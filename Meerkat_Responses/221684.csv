   Assesment: This is a 68 yo F w/ hx of Hep C cirrhosis, ascites and
   upper GIB who was found unresponsive today
   .
   Plan:
   # Respiratory failure: Hypercarbic failure, due to improper
   ventilation. No oxygenation difficulty hence most likely due to MS
   change .
   - Pt currently on CPAP with PS 10 and PEEP 5. Will continue to monitor
   -Change to Propofol for sedation from fentanyl versed [**1-21**] hepatic
   metabolism of the later.
   -Would like to get pm RISB and possible SBT.
   .
   # MS change: In the setting of liver disease and Hx of encephalopathy
   during this admission most likely due to hepatic encephalopathy.
   Meningitis considered unlikely without incr WBC or fever. Also given
   coagulopathy and low platelets, risk of LP would be considerable at
   this time.  Neuro exam non-focal but neuro would like MRI to rule out
   mass lesion today.
   - lactulose 1000 pr
   - LP if pt not improving or for any worsening
   - diagnostic paracentesis to r/o SBP today
   -Appreciate neuro recs
   -MRI, EEG head ordered
   .
   # Acute on chronic blood loss anemia: Hct drop from 30 to 25 overnight.
   OG tube now with blood in it
   -Will d/w liver possible need for rpt EGD prior to extubation
   - Rpt Hct now and transfuse for Hct <25.
   - 2 large bore peripherals in
   - type and screen active
   - Protonix IV 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Cirrhosis with secondary complication: most likely due to Hep C as no
   other causes identified.
   - diagnostic paracentesis to r/o SBP
   - lactulose  and rifaximin as ordered
   -IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] as above
   - hold on diuretics for now
   -Cipro at SBP prophylaxis dose
   .
   # h/o fevers: Pt remains afebrile with WBC trending down. pt vanco and
   flagyl unclear why
   - verify need for vanco and/or flagy
   - Ordered Cipro at SBP prophylaxis dose
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # renal failure: Cr now stable at 1.0  Earlier this admission,
   suspicion for  HRS, albumin was given upon which she improved.
   - f/u renal function
   - if any deterioration: check lytes, conside albumin weight based for 2
   days
   .
   # E coli UTI: urine positive from [**10-22**]. Pt no longer on treatment for
   this. Will f/u abx needs today.
   .
   # elevated INR: 1.9 yesterday.  due to poor liver function. unlikley
   due to GIC, sepsis or other causes.
   - FFP if bleed or inr>2
   .
   # Hep C: followed by liver. this is new diagnosis. unclear how she
   aquired hep C. No acute tratment as inpatient but as outpatient, this
   will be needed.
   .
   # h/o cervical cancer: rectovaginal fistula, has radiation proctitis as
   seen on scope and radiation cystitis on CBI.
   - followed by urology
   - hematouria: per urology most likely due to radiation cystitis in the
   setting of low plt and high INR: to continue bladder irrigation
   .
   # Non gap metabolic acidosis:  hyperchloremic. Possibly [**1-21**] diarrhea.
   Will continue to monitor and consider bicarb if worstens.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She was found unresponsive today and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.1 C (97%)
- Heart rate: 88 bpm
- Blood pressure: 100/59 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (Melena, GI Bleed, GIB): The patient has a history of upper GIB and is currently experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by the presence of blood in her OG tube. This is likely due to her underlying cirrhosis and portal hypertension.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and encephalopathy are likely secondary to her liver disease. Hepatic encephalopathy can cause confusion, disorientation, and changes in behavior.

3. Anemia, Acute, Secondary to Blood Loss (Hemorrhage, Bleeding): The patient's hemoglobin levels have dropped significantly overnight, indicating acute blood loss. She requires immediate blood transfusion to maintain her hemoglobin levels above 25.

4. Respiratory Failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive today. The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, hepatic encephalopathy, anemia secondary to blood loss, and impaired skin integrity.

Plan:
1. Intubation with assist-control ventilation and low tidal volume to treat respiratory failure.
2. ABG analysis to evaluate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Head CT to rule out other causes of respiratory failure.
4. CXR to assess the presence of pneumonia.
5. Infectious workup, including blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum culture.
6. Lactulose administration to manage hepatic encephalopathy.
7. Narcane administration to assess response.
8. Paracentesis to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
9. Repeat labs to rule out electrolyte disturbances.
10. Treatment for acute on chronic blood loss anemia, including transfusion of packed red blood cells as needed.
11. Vitamin K administration for coagulopathy.
12. Protonix IV for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
13. Ceftriaxone administration for suspected SBP.
14. FFP administration for INR correction.
15. Rifaxim administration for hepatic encephalopathy.
16. Lasix and spironolactone for fluid management.

   Oxygenation excellent. Appears comfortable on vent, although RSBI >120
   this AM. Mental status improved. Would continue on lactulose. Would
   switch from versed and fentanyl to propofol because of concern that
   with decreased liver function, there will be build up of these meds
   with impaired mental status and difficulty weaning from ventilator.  I
   do not feel that an LP is indicated now given the high risk of the
   procedure (with coagulopathy) and the fact that the mental status has
   improved in the past 24 hours on lactulose (and that her deterioration
   was associated with discontinuation of lactulose) making meningitis
   less likely.
   Hct has dropped with evidence of ongoing GI bleeding. Would reconsult
   GI service re: repeat endoscopy. Would transfuse.
   Platelet count remains low, but no need for transfusion. INR still
   below 2.
   Calcium down today. Would replete.
   Non-gap acidosis developing, possibly from diarrhea. Consider repleting
   bicarb to reduce ventilatory requirements in anticipation of weaning
   from mechanical ventilation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They are experiencing acute respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, altered mental status, and cirrhosis. The patient has required increased sedation on the ventilator and has been showing signs of increased bleeding per OG tube with a falling hematocrit level.

The patient's alertness has improved in the morning, and they are on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with excellent oxygenation on a fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of 0.4. They have been intubated due to encephalopathy.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 105/53 to 122/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 6 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Their heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,239 mL and 1,322 mL, with a total output of 955 mL and 980 mL, resulting in a balance of 284 mL and 342 mL respectively. They are receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)"

   Plan:
   # Respiratory failure: Hypercarbic failure, due to improper
   ventilation. No oxygenation difficulty hence most likely due to MS
   change .
   - Pt currently on CPAP with PS 10 and PEEP 5. Will continue to monitor
   -Change to Propofol for sedation from fentanyl versed [**1-21**] hepatic
   metabolism of the later.
   -Would like to get pm RISB and possible SBT.
   .
   # MS change: In the setting of liver disease and Hx of encephalopathy
   during this admission most likely due to hepatic encephalopathy.
   Meningitis considered unlikely without incr WBC or fever. Also given
   coagulopathy and low platelets, risk of LP would be considerable at
   this time.  Neuro exam non-focal but neuro would like MRI to rule out
   mass lesion today.
   - lactulose 1000 pr
   - LP if pt not improving or for any worsening
   - diagnostic paracentesis to r/o SBP today
   -Appreciate neuro recs
   -MRI, EEG head ordered

   # Acute on chronic blood loss anemia: Hct drop from 30 to 25 overnight.
   OG tube now with blood in it
   -Will d/w liver possible need for rpt EGD prior to extubation
   - Rpt Hct now and transfuse for Hct <25.
   - 2 large bore peripherals in
   - type and screen active
   - Protonix IV 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Cirrhosis with secondary complication: most likely due to Hep C as no
   other causes identified.
   - diagnostic paracentesis to r/o SBP
   - lactulose  and rifaximin as ordered
   -IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] as above
   - hold on diuretics for now
   -Cipro at SBP prophylaxis dose

   # renal failure: Cr now stable at 1.0  Earlier this admission,
   suspicion for  HRS, albumin was given upon which she improved.
   - f/u renal function
   - if any deterioration: check lytes, conside albumin weight based for 2
   days

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding who was found unresponsive on 10/30. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. Firstly, there is an ongoing respiratory failure due to improper ventilation, most likely caused by a metabolic change (MS change) rather than oxygenation difficulty. The plan is to continue monitoring the patient's respiratory status and consider changing sedation from fentanylversed to propofol for hepatic metabolism.

Secondly, the patient is suspected to have hepatic encephalopathy, which is supported by the history of liver disease and previous episodes of encephalopathy during this admission. Meningitis is considered unlikely without an increased white blood cell count or fever. A neurologic examination is non-focal, and an MRI has been ordered to rule out a mass lesion. Lactulose has been prescribed, and lumbar puncture (LP) may be considered if the patient does not improve or shows any worsening symptoms.

Thirdly, the patient has acute-on-chronic blood loss anemia, with a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 30% to 25% overnight. An orogastric tube is in place with blood in it. The plan is to repeat hemoglobin levels, transfuse for a hemoglobin level below 25%, and perform an"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) who was found unresponsive on October 30th. She has been admitted to the ICU and has had several medical complications. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hepatic encephalopathy, acute anemia due to blood loss, impaired skin integrity, and cirrhosis with secondary complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient had acute respiratory failure but it has now resolved. However, there is a need for ongoing monitoring.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is suspected to have hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver disease. An EEG has been ordered and discussion with neurology is ongoing regarding further treatment options, including the possibility of an MRI.
3. Acute on chronic blood loss anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level is stable at 30 today. The plan includes following up with liver recommendations, monitoring the Hct level, and starting Lasix and spironolactone today while closely watching electrolytes and volume status.
4. Cirrhosis with secondary complications: The patient has cirrhosis most likely due to Hepatitis C as no other causes have been identified. Treatment for hepatic encephalopathy and cirrhosis-related complications, such as lactulose and rifaximin,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with altered mental status, cirrhosis, and acute respiratory failure. They have been extubated and are currently on supplemental oxygen. The patient's EEG from yesterday was reported as abnormal, but no evidence of seizure activity was observed overnight. Telemetry is planned to be started. There are no signs of infection or fever. The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, acute anemia due to blood loss, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), impaired skin integrity, hypernatremia, and pleural effusions. 

Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (melena, GI bleed, GIB): This is indicated by the presence of bloody stools and a history of upper GI bleeding.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition is suggested by the patient's altered mental status and cirrhosis.
3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and the need for respiratory support indicate acute respiratory failure.
4. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient has a low hemoglobin level, which is likely due to blood loss from the gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to their critical condition and possible fluid overload.
6. Hypernatremia: The elevated sodium level indicates hypernatremia, which can occur in dehydration or due to excessive intake of sodium"

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive on 10/30 with acute mental status changes. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including acute respiratory failure, hepatic encephalopathy, impaired skin integrity, acute anemia due to blood loss, and gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The respiratory failure has resolved, but there are still crackles bilaterally present. The patient's mental status changes are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, considering her liver disease and previous episodes of encephalopathy during this admission. An MRI brain with enhancing lesions was performed, and the patient has been started on Keppra. 

The patient's anemia is likely due to ongoing blood loss from the upper gastrointestinal tract or from catheter-associated bleeding. The Hct levels are stable in the range of 25-30. 

The patient's cirrhosis is a result of Hepatitis C infection, as no other causes have been identified. Treatment for hepatic encephalopathy and cirrhosis has been initiated, including lactulose and rifaximin. 

The patient's fevers have resolved, and cultures show only yeast in sputum. Antibiotics have been discontinued as no active infections were found. 

The patient's creatinine levels are stable at 1.0, indicating no renal failure at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, anemia, altered mental status, cirrhosis, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has been doing well post-extubation with excellent oxygen saturation off supplemental oxygen. Mental status has improved, but there is some somnolence. No evidence of seizure activity. The patient's Hct is drifting down slowly, and platelets are between 70-90K. 

24-hour events include an MRI of the brain, which showed an abnormality but with pending interpretation. The patient received various medications including lorazepam, protonix, lactulose, spironolactone, lasix, and keptra. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 112/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight, and no evidence of endotracheal or NG tube. Cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds with no murmurs. Peripheral pulses are present bilaterally. Respiratory examination reveals diffuse rales posteriorly and anteriorly. Abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination shows the patient attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She was found unresponsive on 10/30 with acute mental status changes. The patient has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy, acute on chronic blood loss anemia, cirrhosis with secondary complications, elevated INR, and a history of cervical cancer with rectovaginal fistula and radiation proctitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: This is a condition characterized by neurological symptoms such as confusion and altered mental status due to liver dysfunction. It can be exacerbated by factors like infections, medications, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Acute on Chronic Blood Loss Anemia: The patient has a stable hematocrit level ranging from 25-30%. The blood loss may be from the upper GI tract or the cervix. Close monitoring of vital signs and oxygenation is necessary.
3. Cirrhosis with Secondary Complications: The patient has evidence of portal hypertension (umbilical venous recanalization, paraesophageal varices) and ascites. These complications can lead to further decompensation of liver function.
4. Elevated INR: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated at 2.0. This indicates impaired blood clotting ability due to liver dysfunction. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent bleeding,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive on 10/30 with acute mental status changes. The patient has ongoing leakage from the vagina and catheterization. Imaging reveals nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis, evidence of portal hypertension including umbilical vein recanalization, and paraesophageal varices. The patient also has ascites, floating bowel loops, no bowel obstruction, no free air, and decompressed bladder. There are no signs of liver metastasis or lymphadenopathy. The patient has an elevated alpha-fetoprotein level and negative abdominal/pelvic ultrasound, which suggests that an MRI of the liver is not indicated at this time. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 107/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count of 91 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 137 mg/dL, and an INR of 2.0.

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive on [10-30] with acute mental status changes. The MRI brain showed chronic microvascular ischemic changes and an old infarction. Neurological recommendations were made based on the MRI findings. The patient continues on Keppra and lactulose 60 PO QID.

The patient has acute on chronic blood loss anemia, with a stable hematocrit level ranging from 25-30%. The most likely source of blood loss is upper gastrointestinal bleeding or from the cervical biopsy site. Urology was consulted, and they did not need to see the patient, just continue with the cervical biopsy.

The patient has cirrhosis with secondary complications, most likely due to Hepatitis C as no other causes were identified. Lactulose and rifaximin were ordered for the management of hepatic encephalopathy. IV PPI was also given as ordered.

The patient had fevers in the past, but remains afebrile now with a trending down WBC count. Cultures since [10-22] show only yeast in the sputum. Antibiotics were discontinued at this time as no active infections were detected, but cultures will continue to be monitored.

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding who was found unresponsive on 10/30 with acute mental status changes. The patient has undergone several procedures and treatments, including an MRI of the brain showing chronic microvascular ischemic changes and an old infarction, placement of a nasogastric tube for lactulose administration, placement of a peripheral IV line, and insertion of a PICC line.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 107/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, elevated bilirubin levels, and decreased albumin levels. The patient's blood counts reveal anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL and leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14,100 cells/mm³. The patient's platelet count is within normal range.

The patient has several medical complications, including acute-on-chronic blood loss anemia, hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The bleeding is likely from the upper gastrointestinal tract or from the cervical cancer-related complications, such as rectovaginal fistula"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged individual with acute respiratory failure, cirrhosis, and altered mental status. The patient is well-nourished, overweight, and not in acute distress. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems, but there are diffuse crackles in the lungs. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time, and demonstrates purposeful movement. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profile. Imaging shows minimal increase in interstitial markings on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to melena (black, tarry stools) and anemia due to blood loss.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by liver dysfunction and characterized by confusion, disorientation, and other cognitive impairments.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which could progress to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) if not managed appropriately.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient may be at risk of developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's abnormal coagulation profile suggests an increased risk of bleeding,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive and has acute mental status changes. The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications, including hepatic encephalopathy, acute on chronic blood loss anemia, cirrhosis with secondary complications, elevated INR due to poor liver function, h/o cervical cancer with rectovaginal fistula and radiation proctitis, and resolved non-gap metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and acute mental status changes may be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver disease. Treatment includes lactulose and rifaximin.
2. Acute on Chronic Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's stable hematocrit levels suggest ongoing blood loss from either the upper GI tract or cervical bleeding. Further investigation and management are needed to address this issue.
3. Cirrhosis with Secondary Complications: The patient's history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis has resulted in secondary complications such as ascites and upper GI bleeding. These complications require ongoing management and monitoring.
4. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR of 2.0 today is likely due to poor liver function. This may increase the risk of bleeding, and further evaluation is necessary.
5. History of Cervical"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure due to a severe lung infection. The patient's medical history includes a history of chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. 

Upon admission, the patient was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 94/24 mmHg and tachycardic with a heart rate of 105 bpm. The patient's oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. 

The patient has been receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and supportive care in the ICU. However, the patient's condition has continued to deteriorate. 

The patient's recent lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. The patient's liver enzymes are within normal range, but there are abnormalities in electrolyte levels, including low potassium and magnesium levels. 

The patient's nutritional status is also concerning, as indicated by the alteration in nutrition and impaired skin integrity. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory failure indicates a potential complication related to the severe lung infection. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial to manage this condition effectively.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The presence of melena suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and anemia. Monitoring the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic status, and stool output is essential to detect any further bleeding"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive and experienced acute mental status changes, which resolved likely due to hepatic encephalopathy or post-ictal state. The patient has stable hemoglobin levels in the range of 25-30, indicating anemia possibly caused by upper GI bleeding or central venous catheter insertion. Her Hepatitis C cirrhosis remains stable with an AFP level of 11. The patient is being treated with lactulose, rifaximin, Lasix, and aldactone. Her coagulopathy has an INR of 2.0, indicating poor synthetic liver function. Vitamin K is administered, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is ready if bleeding occurs. The patient also has a history of cervical cancer with a rectovaginal fistula and radiation proctitis, as well as likely radiation cystitis on central venous catheterization. Surgery consultation is considered, and bladder irrigation continues for hematuria. The patient is receiving nutrition through enteral feeding at a rate of 20 mL/hour with a goal of 30 mL/hour. She is on prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and she is being considered for discharge to the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive with acute mental status changes but has since resolved. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 95/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a history of cervical cancer with a rectovaginal fistula and radiation proctitis, as well as potential radiation cystitis seen on the colonoscopy. There are concerns about possible medical complications related to her cirrhosis, including hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, abnormal coagulation profile with an INR of 2.0, low albumin levels, and elevated lactic acid levels. There are also abnormal blood cell counts with an increased neutrophil percentage and decreased lymphocyte percentage.

Plan:

1. Continue Keppra at a higher dose of 750 mg with the goal of 1g, along with rifaximin and lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Investigate the cause of anemia and consider packed red blood cell transfusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute respiratory failure, cirrhosis, and altered mental status. The patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis and experienced a gastrointestinal bleed, resulting in an altered mental state. The patient was treated with rifaximin, lactulose, and pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver cirrhosis. Close monitoring of neurologic status and management of ammonia levels are necessary.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleed, which can lead to anemia and hypotension. Regular monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic status is required.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, possibly due to ARDS or another underlying cause. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory function is necessary.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may increase the risk of infection. Proper wound care and infection prevention measures should be implemented.
5. Hematuria: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive and had acute mental status changes. She underwent an endoscopy which revealed grade 3 esophageal varices without active bleeding and subsequent ligation as well as portal hypertensive gastropathy. The patient was intubated and extubated without complication. She is currently on Octreotide and Pantoprazole. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a low blood pressure. She is receiving respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. She has a fever and dry mouth. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for constitutional symptoms and dry mouth. She is NPO (nothing by mouth) and has a nasogastric tube in place. Flowsheet data shows that she has received a significant amount of fluids and blood products, with a slight fluid balance deficit. She has received medications including antibiotics, antacids, and coagulation factors. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which could potentially recur, leading to further blood loss and anemia.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver cirrhosis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive with acute mental status changes. The patient underwent endoscopy that revealed grade 3 esophageal varices without active bleeding, which were subsequently ligated. She also had portal hypertensive gastropathy.

The patient has been receiving octreotide, pantoprazole (Protonix), and other ICU medications. She has been on invasive ventilation, but extubation was successful without complication. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever and dry mouth.

Flowsheet Data:
The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/48 mmHg to 130/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received a total of 1,325 mL of fluids since 12 AM, including 916 mL of IV fluids, 309 mL of TF (likely total parenteral nutrition), and 100 mL of blood products. The patient's urine output is 650 mL, NG output is 600 mL, and stool output is 850 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes aerosol-cool delivery, endotracheal tube, CP"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive with acute mental status changes. The note indicates several potential medical complications:

1. Alteration in nutrition: The patient may be experiencing malnutrition due to impaired gastrointestinal function or other factors related to her underlying condition.

2. Gastrointestinal bleed, upper (melena, GI bleed, GIB): The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be caused by esophageal varices or other sources. This can lead to anemia and potential shock if significant blood loss occurs.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a neurological condition caused by severe liver dysfunction. The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy.

4. Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient's low hematocrit levels suggest acute anemia, likely due to ongoing or recent blood loss.

5. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[Doctor Last Name 2]): The patient is experiencing respiratory difficulties, which may be caused by factors such as aspiration pneumonia or acute lung injury.

6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has compromised skin integrity, which can be associated with decreased mobility, pressure ulcers, or other skin breakdown conditions.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive with acute mental status changes. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate between 76-103 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 113/55 to 121/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments, including the administration of two units of packed red blood cells due to anemia secondary to acute blood loss from upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She has been given pantoprazole (Protonix) to manage stress ulcers and octreotide to reduce portal hypertension.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit levels, and platelet count. Her blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with the highest reading at 249 mg/dL. Other lab values, including liver function tests, electrolytes, and kidney function, are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse crackles in the lungs, mild abdominal distention, and 3+ edema with symmetric pulses. Neurological examination is non-focal, with no asterixis or other abnormalities.

The patient's medical conditions include alterations in nutrition, gastrointestinal bleed (melena), hepatic encephalopathy, acute respiratory failure (not AR"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). She was found unresponsive with acute mental status changes. The patient has been diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy, anemia secondary to blood loss, acute respiratory failure, and impaired skin integrity. She is currently receiving treatment with Keppra, rifaximin, lactulose, octreotide, sucralfate, Lasix, aldactone, proton pump inhibitors (PPI), and bladder irrigation. The patient's INR is 1.9, indicating a coagulopathy likely due to poor synthetic function. She also has a history of cervical cancer with rectovaginal fistula and radiation proctitis as seen on scope, as well as potential radiation cystitis on CBI. The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications that need to be managed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition is caused by liver dysfunction and can lead to altered mental status and confusion.
2. Anemia secondary to blood loss: The patient's anemia is a result of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require further transfusions or blood products.
3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring and support, as indicated by her elevated respiratory rate and the need for supplemental oxygen.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) who presented unresponsive with acute mental status changes. She has a previous diagnosis of cervical cancer, rectovaginal fistula, and radiation proctitis as seen on scope. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/55 to 121/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of UGIB and was found unresponsive with acute mental status changes, which may be related to the bleeding. The presence of melena and esophageal varices seen on endoscopy supports this diagnosis. The patient has been started on octreotide, sucralfate, and proton pump inhibitors to manage the bleeding.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and ascites, hepatic encephalopathy could be a potential complication. The patient's mental status changes could be attributed to this condition. Treatment includes lactulose and rifaximin.

3. Anemia: Due to acute blood loss from the UGIB"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive with acute mental status changes. The patient has been experiencing vomiting blood, passing melanic stool, and experiencing a significant drop in hematocrit levels, requiring multiple blood transfusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has a low oxygen saturation level of 91%. She has coarse crackles in her lungs, edema, and mild distention in her abdomen. The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and the recent acute mental status changes, hepatic encephalopathy is a potential complication. Treatment with lactulose and rifaximin has been initiated.
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient's vomiting of blood and passing melanic stool indicate ongoing UGIB, likely from esophageal varices. Octreotide has been started and sucralfate has been given to protect the stomach lining.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating poor synthetic function of the liver. This increases the risk of bleeding. FFP may be required if the patient experiences any bleeding or undergoes a procedure.
4. Hepatitis C cirrhosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of acute respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, anemia, coagulopathy, cirrhosis, and altered mental status. The patient has been in the ICU and received multiple interventions including transfusions, octreotide infusion, and medication for encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status may be compromised due to the acute respiratory failure and prolonged ICU stay, making him susceptible to developing pneumonia.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy worsening, especially with the presence of altered mental status.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the bleeding has stopped or slowed, there is still a risk of re-bleeding, especially if the underlying cause is not addressed.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been stable, but there is still a risk of hypotension due to coagulopathy and potential fluid shifts.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT.
6. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutrition needs to be closely monitored, and enteral feeding should be continued to prevent malnutrition.
8. Renal dysfunction: The patient's kidney function needs to be monitored closely, considering the use of medications like lasix and the presence of lactic acidosis.
9. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function needs to be closely monitored due to the history of cirrhosis, which may lead to hepatic failure if not managed properly.
10. Anxiety and depression: The patient may experience anxiety and depression due to the prolonged hospitalization and illness. Psychological support should be considered.

Please note that this is a summary and potential medical complications may vary based on individual patient factors. It is essential to consider the patient's specific medical history, current condition, and response to treatment when assessing potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive with acute mental status changes but is now clear. The patient has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, likely due to the upper GI bleed. Her hemoglobin levels have stabilized after receiving three units of blood transfusion. She is hemodynamically stable and her lactate levels have improved. The patient is currently receiving octreotide, sucralfate, and proton pump inhibitors. She also has a history of cervical cancer with a rectovaginal fistula and radiation proctitis, as seen on scope. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient may be at risk for acute respiratory failure, possibly due to ARDS or another underlying respiratory condition.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient may have impaired skin integrity due to prolonged bed rest or immobility in the ICU.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, she may be at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status.
4. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss from the upper GI bleed. Continuous monitoring of her hemoglobin levels and transfusion as needed will be important.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding needs to be closely monitored and managed to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive with acute mental status changes but is now clear. The patient has received 3 units of blood overnight due to significant blood loss, including 50cc of emesis and nearly 2 liters of maroon stool. She is hemodynamically stable but has an elevated lactate level.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low due to blood loss. She has received 3 units of blood overnight and will continue to be monitored.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Upper (Melena, GI Bleed, GIB): The patient has a history of upper GIB and is currently experiencing bleeding. She will continue to receive octreotide and sucralfate to manage the bleeding.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes may be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy. She will continue rifaximin and lactulose to manage this condition.
4. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is currently stable.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, likely due to ascites.
6. HCV Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is stable, and she will continue to receive lactulose, rifaximin, Lasix"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She was found unresponsive with acute mental status changes but is now clear. She is hemodynamically stable and has a stabilized hematocrit after receiving 3 units of blood on [**2119-11-6**]. The differential diagnosis includes variceal bleed, urinary bleed, or an undiscovered upper GIB. Her lactate level is elevated with a gap.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has stabilized after receiving blood transfusions, but ongoing bleeding or further blood loss could lead to worsening anemia.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of upper GIB, and it is possible that she may experience another episode.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by severe liver disease.
4. Respiratory failure: Acute respiratory failure may occur due to aspiration pneumonia or exacerbation of underlying respiratory conditions.
5. Impaired skin integrity: Prolonged bed rest or immobility can lead to pressure ulcers and impaired skin integrity.
6. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Given the patient's catheterization and immobility, there is a risk of developing a UTI.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive with acute mental status changes, which have since resolved. She is currently experiencing likely upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient's nausea and vomiting have resolved after adjusting her medication regimen.
- Anemia was treated with a blood transfusion due to a drop in hematocrit.
- The patient's HCV cirrhosis is stable, and she is being continued on lactulose, rifaximin, Lasix, and aldactone.
- Coagulopathy is present with an elevated INR, which was corrected with fresh frozen plasma.
- The patient has a history of cervical cancer, with complications including rectovaginal fistula and radiation proctitis. Urology consultation is planned.
- The patient's hepatic encephalopathy has resolved, and she will continue on keppra prophylaxis, rifaximin, and lactulose.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) - The patient has a history of upper GIB and is currently experiencing likely bleeding. Close monitoring and treatment for GIB are essential.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy - The patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis and is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring for changes in mental status and continued treatment with lactul"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive with acute mental status changes but is now clear. She has likely upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has several medical complications including anemia secondary to blood loss, acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and hepatic encephalopathy. She also has a history of cervical cancer with associated rectovaginal fistula and radiation proctitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of upper GI bleeding and is currently experiencing likely upper GI bleeding, as indicated by the presence of melena and the need for transfusion.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver cirrhosis.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has dropped significantly, indicating acute anemia likely secondary to blood loss from the GI bleeding.
4. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is on supplemental oxygen and has decreased oxygen saturation levels, suggesting respiratory failure.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has edema at the ankles, which may indicate impaired skin integrity.
6. Cervical cancer complications: The patient has a history of cervical cancer with associated rectovaginal fistula and radiation proctitis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive and had acute mental status changes, which are now clear. She is currently hemodynamically stable and has stabilized Hct after receiving 3 units of packed red blood cells. The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, likely related to her upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Her anemia is most likely from gastrointestinal bleeding, and her coagulopathy has improved with the administration of fresh frozen plasma. The patient's hepatic encephalopathy has resolved, and she is being continued on lactulose and rifaximin. Her HCV cirrhosis is stable, and she is being managed with lactulose, rifaximin, Lasix, and aldactone. The patient's h/o cervical cancer is causing rectovaginal fistula and radiation proctitis, which will require further evaluation and management. The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding of upper gastrointestinal source: The patient's ongoing nausea and vomiting suggest ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic stability, and laboratory values (particularly platelets and coagulation profile) is crucial to detect any"

","The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive with acute mental status changes, now clear, with likely upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient is still hypernatremic to 149, indicating a high level of sodium in the blood.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) dropped to 22 yesterday, indicating a significant decrease in red blood cell count. This could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding or other causes.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient had a change in mental status (MS) changes, which resolved, but could be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and is currently showing signs of likely UGIB.
5. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, suggesting a possible infection.
6. Impaired liver function: The patient has chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, which can lead to impaired liver function and subsequent complications.
7. Renal dysfunction: The patient's creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are elevated, indicating potential renal dysfunction.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient has impaired ventilation and oxygenation, putting her at risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). She was found unresponsive on the floor with acute mental status changes, which have since resolved. She is currently experiencing another episode of UGIB, for which she has been emergently intubated to protect her airway and allow for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to locate the source of bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) was stable in the morning but dropped significantly after the massive UGIB episode in the afternoon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient's ongoing UGIB is a significant concern. The source of the bleeding could not be located during the EGD, and she is being prepared for an emergent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure to stabilize her. She has received several units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to manage the blood loss.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE): The patient had acute mental status changes that resolved, which were likely due to hepatic encephalopathy (HE). This condition can occur in patients with advanced liver disease like cirrhosis. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of recurrent HE and maintain lactulose"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). She presented unresponsive on the floor with acute mental status changes, likely due to upper GIB. The patient required emergent intubation for airway protection and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to identify the source of bleeding. However, the EGD was unable to locate the source. The patient received octreotide, six units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and two units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). She is currently stable but remains at risk for further bleeding. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and ongoing UGIB puts her at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status and neuromuscular abnormalities.
3. Anemia: The patient has already received multiple units of PRBCs, but she may continue to bleed, leading to worsening anemia and hemodynamic instability.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a high INR of 1.6 and has received FFP, indicating impaired clotting function."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) who was found unresponsive on the floor. She now has clear mental status but is likely suffering from upper GIB. The patient is currently in comfort measures only (CMO) status with a nasogastric tube (Last Name (un) 466) still in place to prevent exsanguination. The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure and heart rate within normal ranges. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions. Lab results indicate abnormalities in hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocyte count, platelet count, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and kidney function. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to esophageal varices, which has already occurred and was temporarily stopped by placing a nasogastric tube.
2. Hypotension and potential shock due to blood loss from UGIB.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy due to worsening liver function and cirrhosis.
4. Infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
6. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or renal failure due to hypotension and decreased renal perfusion.
7. Malnutrition and poor glycemic control due to NPO status and stress from critical illness."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. She was found unresponsive and had acute mental status changes, which have since cleared. The patient likely suffered from massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to esophageal varices, which was stopped by placing a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube (SB tube). The family refused transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. The patient is currently in comfort measures only (CMO) status, receiving morphine sulfate infusion, and remains intubated for airway protection. She is hypotensive and requires mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: Despite the SB tube in place, there is still a risk of re-bleeding due to the patient's underlying liver disease and history of variceal bleeding.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: As the patient has a history of cirrhosis, there is a possibility of hepatic encephalopathy developing or worsening, leading to altered mental status.
5. Infection: Prolonged intubation and imm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). She was found unresponsive on the floor with acute mental status changes. The patient experienced massive UGIB likely from esophageal varices on November 10th. The bleeding was stopped by placing an endoscopic band (Last Name un 466), but the family refused transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). The patient is currently comfort measures only (CMO) with Last Name un 466 removed on November 13th.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of UGIB due to esophageal varices. There is a high risk of recurrent bleeding, which can lead to hypotension, shock, and potential organ failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains extubated and is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to impaired ventilation. This could be exacerbated by her unresponsive state and inability to protect her airway.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: As a result of advanced liver disease, the patient may develop hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by confusion, altered mental status, and potential coma.
4. Anemia: The patient may develop anemia secondary to blood loss from the massive UGIB. Anemia can lead to fatigue"
