   Disposition: [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
","Based on the provided physician progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of new fevers and hypotension after urological manipulation with lithotripsy. The patient is suspected to have urosepsis due to the disintegration of an infected stone. 

The patient's current condition includes difficulty breathing, leukocytosis, and non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. The hypotension has been resolving with fluid boluses, but the patient's blood pressure remains in the high 80s. The patient's oxygen saturation is at 100% on 3 liters of nasal cannula. 

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Urosepsis - hypotension is being managed with fluid boluses to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, antibiotic source control with ampicillin and gentamicin, follow-up urine culture and blood cultures, Tylenol for fevers, and Zofran for nausea.
2. Difficulty breathing - the patient is currently well-oxygenated on 3 liters of nasal cannula and will be monitored. If she continues to be afebrile, consideration will be given to administering a single dose of 10mg IV Lasix.
3. Non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis - this is likely due to the large amount of normal saline (NS) given, with a HCO3 level of 17 today and Cl level of 112. It is expected to resolve as the patient approaches euvolemia.
4. Leukocytosis - daily CBC monitoring is recommended, and no medications that could cause bone marrow suppression are being administered.
5. Atrial fibrillation - Coumadin has been held for the procedure today, and it will be resumed once the patient has recovered and is cleared by urology. Sotalol has also been held due to hypotension.
6. Hypertension - lisinopril and HCTZ have been held due to hypotension.

In summary, the patient is being managed for urosepsis, difficulty breathing, non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and appropriate interventions are being implemented."

","Based on the provided physician progress note, the patient is an elderly Caucasian female who has been admitted to the ICU with new fevers and hypotension following urological manipulation with lithotripsy. The patient's condition suggests urosepsis, likely due to the disintegration of an infected stone. 

The patient's medical history includes a recent procedure involving lithotripsy, which may have caused an infection in the urinary tract leading to sepsis. The patient's symptoms include difficulty breathing, leukocytosis (high white blood cell count), and non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Urosepsis - hypotension has been resolving with fluid boluses, antibiotic source control with ampicillin and gentamicin, follow-up urine and blood cultures, Tylenol for fevers, and Zofran for nausea.
2. Difficulty breathing - the patient is currently stable on 3 liters of nasal cannula oxygen and may require aggressive IVF hydration. Monitoring will continue, and consideration will be given to a single dose of 10mg IV lasix if necessary.
3. Non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis - this is likely due to the large amount of normal saline administered. The plan is to continue monitoring renal function and expect resolution as the patient approaches euvolemia.
4. Leukocytosis - this is likely due to post-operative inflammation"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 11297**] is a 80 year-old with new fevers and hypotension after
   urological manipulation with lithotripsy, likely due to urosepsis from
   disintegration of infected stone, now with some difficulty breathing,
   leukocytosis and non-anion cap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
   .
   1. Urosepsis - hypotension has been resolving with fluid boluses
   -- hold IVF for now as to maintain MAP > 60
   -- antibiotic source control with ampicillin and gentamycin
   -- f/u urology recs re: abx and effect on renal function (trend Cr)
   -- follow-up urine culture and blood cultures
   -- tylenol for fevers
   -- zofran prn nausea
   2. Difficulty breathing- satting well on 3 L NC, could be [**2-18**]
   aggressive IVF hydration. Will monitor pt today, if continues to be
   afebrile, will consider 1x 10mg IV lasix
   3. Non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis- HCO3 is 17 today,
   Cl 112
 likely all from NS, as > 4 L given.
   -- continue to follow renal function
   -- likely will resolve as approaches euvolemia
   4. Leukocytosis - -- monitor daily CBC, likely due to post-operative
   inflammation.
   -- not on any meds that could cause BM suppression
   .
   #. Afib - coumadin has been on hold for procedure today
   -- holding coumadin until recovers and is ok'ed by urology.
   -- hold sotalol given hypotension
   -- restart ASA

   I have seen and examined the patient and concur with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 11211**];s note
   above.
   Mrs [**Known lastname 11297**] developed SIRS after completion of her procedure yesterday
   and now appears to have resolving hypotension. She has received
   ampi./gent per urology staff recs and has clinical features of mild
   CHF. She is in NSR at this time.
   She may benefit from gentle lasix later today if SBP and temp curve are
   stable..
   She still needs ICU level care.

","The patient is an 80-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with new fevers and hypotension following urological manipulation with lithotripsy. The likely cause of these symptoms is urosepsis due to the disintegration of an infected stone. The patient also has difficulty breathing, leukocytosis, and non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.

The plan includes managing urosepsis by holding intravenous fluids (IVF) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, administering antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) for source control, following up with urology recommendations regarding antibiotic use and its effect on renal function, and obtaining urine and blood cultures. Tylenol will be given for fevers, and Zofran will be used as needed for nausea.

For difficulty breathing, the patient is currently on 3 liters of nasal cannula (NC), and aggressive IVF hydration will be considered. If the patient remains afebrile, a single dose of 10mg IV Lasix may be considered.

The non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is likely due to the large amount of normal saline (NS) given. The plan is to continue monitoring renal function and expect resolution as the patient approaches euvolemia.

Leukocytosis is expected due to post-operative inflammation and will be monitored daily. Medications that could cause bone marrow suppression are not being administered"

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a chief complaint of new fevers and hypotension following urological manipulation with lithotripsy. She is likely experiencing urosepsis from the disintegration of an infected stone. The patient has received aggressive intravenous fluids to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg and antibiotic treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin. If persistent hypotension occurs, a central venous line will be placed and pressors will be initiated to maintain MAP above 60 mmHg. Follow-up urine and blood cultures will be obtained. Tylenol will be administered for fevers, and Zofran will be given as needed for nausea.

The patient also has leukopenia, which has resolved on repeat CBC. The differential diagnosis includes lab error versus transient response to bacteremia/sepsis. The patient is no longer neutropenic, and daily CBC monitoring will continue. She is not on any medications that could cause bone marrow suppression.

Additionally, the patient has atrial fibrillation, and Coumadin has been held for the procedure today. Coumadin and ASA will be held until the patient recovers and is cleared by urology. Sotalol has also been held due to hypotension.

The patient's hypertension medications, including lisinopril and HCTZ, have been withheld due to current hypotension.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on regular diet"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female who presented with new fevers and hypotension after urological manipulation, likely due to urosepsis from disintegration of an infected stone. She is now experiencing difficulty breathing, leukocytosis, and non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient has been treated with IV fluids to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60, antibiotic source control with ampicillin and gentamicin, follow-up urine and blood cultures, Tylenol for fevers, and Zofran for nausea.
2. Difficulty breathing: The patient is currently on 2 liters nasal cannula (NC) oxygen and has a saturation level of 99%. Aggressive IV fluid hydration may have contributed to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR). Small IV fluids will be given as needed to keep heart rate under control, and further diuresis is being held.
3. Non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis: This condition has resolved with a bicarbonate level of 25 today. Continuing to follow electrolyte levels is recommended.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has been restarted on Sotalol and continues to be in AFib with RVR. Coumadin is being held until recovery and approval from urology. IV Diltiazem or Lopressor"

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of new fevers and hypotension following urological manipulation with lithotripsy. She likely has urosepsis due to the disintegration of an infected stone. She also has difficulty breathing, leukocytosis, and non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure of 117/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is currently on various medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis - the patient's hypotension has been resolving with fluid boluses, and antibiotics have been started to control the infection. It is important to monitor the patient's response to the treatment and follow up with urine and blood cultures.
2. Difficulty breathing - the patient is currently on 3 L of nasal cannula oxygen and her saturation levels are good. Aggressive IV fluid hydration will be monitored, and if she remains afebrile, a single dose of 10mg IV lasix may be considered.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of new fevers and hypotension after urological manipulation with lithotripsy. The patient is currently being treated for urosepsis, which is likely due to the disintegration of an infected stone. 

The patient's current medical conditions include difficulty breathing, leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Urosepsis: The patient is already being treated for urosepsis with antibiotics and fluid hydration. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs and lab results for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.

2. Difficulty breathing: The patient's oxygen saturation is good on 2 liters of nasal cannula, but they may still require further respiratory support if their symptoms worsen. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is essential.

3. Electrolyte disturbances: The patient has imbalances in potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels. Regular monitoring and correction of these electrolytes are necessary to prevent complications such as cardiac arrhythmias.

4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient is currently in afib with RVR and is being treated with diltiazem and metoprolol"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 11297**] is a 80 year-old with new fevers and hypotension after
   urological manipulation with lithotripsy, likely due to urosepsis from
   disintegration of infected stone, now with some difficulty breathing,
   leukocytosis and non-anion cap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
   .
   1. Urosepsis
 Leukocytosis has been resolving, the patient is afebrile
   -- IVF to maintain MAP > 60
   -- antibiotic source control with ampicillin and gentamycin
   -- f/u urology recs
   -- follow-up urine culture and blood cultures
   -- tylenol for fevers
   -- zofran prn nausea
   2. Difficulty breathing- satting well on 2 L NC, could be [**2-18**]
   aggressive IVF hydration. The patient is s/p diuresis yesterday, may
   have developed afib with RVR secondary to dehydration.  Will give back
   small IVF as needed to keep HR under control and hold further diuresis
   for now.
   3. Non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis- Resolved, HCO3 25
   today.
   -- continue to follow lytes
   .
   4.. Afib
 Re-started Sotalol.  The patient continues to be in afib
   with RVR.
   -- holding coumadin until recovers and is ok'ed by urology.
   -- re-started Sotalol
   --IV Dilt or Lopressor for BP control
   --IVF small boluses as needed for tachycardia or hypotension
   - F/u Troponins, CK, CK-MB given concern for demand ischemia in the
   setting of tachycardia.
   --Continue ASA

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman who presented with fever and hypotension following lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement. She has been diagnosed with sepsis but does not appear toxic. Her vital signs are stable, and she is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. She also has atrial fibrillation, for which she is being monitored in the ICU due to pauses and intermittent ventricular pacing. The patient's electrolyte levels are being monitored, particularly her potassium and magnesium levels. Imaging shows haziness bilaterally and blunting of the left costophrenic angle, unchanged from the previous day.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, which indicates a serious infection in her body. It is important to continue monitoring her vital signs and laboratory results to ensure that the infection is being effectively managed.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and is experiencing pauses with intermittent ventricular pacing. This may require further intervention or medication adjustments to maintain a stable heart rhythm.
3. Kidney issues: The patient underwent lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement for kidney stones. It will be important to monitor her renal function and the position of the stent to prevent any complications related to kidney function.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, need to be closely"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 11297**] is a 80 year-old with new fevers and hypotension after
   urological manipulation with lithotripsy, likely due to urosepsis from
   disintegration of infected stone, here with atrial fibrillation in the
   120s-140s and difficulty breathing.
   1. Atrial fibrillation- could be due to intense diuresis/ dehydration
   stress as pt is 3L negative O/N.
   -- Increased sotalol from 80mg [**Hospital1 7**] to 120mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -- IV lopressor 5mg as needed for rate control
   -- can consider IV diltiazem before dilt gtt
   -- correct w/ small boluses of fluid, 250cc NS over 15min at a time
   -- hold further diuresis for now
   -- consider starting dilt gtt if needed
   -- restarted coumadin as per urology recs
   -- ct ASA
   2. Difficulty breathing- could be [**2-18**] volume status, holding lasix for
   now. Can
t do albuterol nebs b/c pt is on beta blocker. Unlikely flash
   pulmn edema, given stable clinical presentation.
   3. Urosepsis
 WBC somewhat increased today, the patient is afebrile ad
   normotensive.  CXR unremarkable.  Pt complaining of dysuria upon
   voiding and a tingling feeling.
   -- U/A and UCx for possible UTI
   -- added Pyridium for urinary analgesia/ sx relief
   -- antibiotic source control with ampicillin and gentamycin (day 5 of a
   7 day total course)
   -- f/u urology recs
   -- f/u UCx if bug not sensitive to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] add 3^rd [**Doctor Last Name **]
   -- tylenol for fevers
   -- zofran prn nausea
   4. Electrolyte disturbances
   -- check PO lytes and replete K, Mg and Phos as needed
   6. [**Name (NI) 11388**] pt had SBPs in 180s-200s o/n and previously had home
   anti-HTN meds held d/t hypotension on initial arrival
   -- hold lisinopril 40mg daily
   -- continue  HCTZ 12.5mg daily (outpatient meds)

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known Last Name 11297**], an 80-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with new fevers and hypotension following urological manipulation with lithotripsy. She is likely suffering from urosepsis due to the disintegration of an infected stone. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with a rapid heart rate and difficulty breathing. Her vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and increased heart rate. She has a history of hypertension but her anti-HTN medications have been withheld due to hypotension. 

Potential Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's rapid heart rate and irregular rhythm suggest atrial fibrillation. It is important to control the heart rate to prevent complications such as heart failure or thromboembolism. The current treatment plan includes increasing sotalol and using IV lopressor as needed for rate control.

2. Difficulty breathing: The patient's difficulty breathing could be related to volume status, as indicated by the negative fluid balance overnight. Holding lasix may help improve her respiratory symptoms. The use of beta blockers limits the ability to administer albuterol nebs. Flash pulmonary edema is unlikely given the stable clinical presentation.

3. Urosepsis: The patient has signs of urosepsis, including increased WBC count and symptoms of dysuria and a tingling sensation. Further evaluation with U/A and UCx is needed to identify any"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 11297], an 80-year-old female, was admitted with new fevers and hypotension after urological manipulation with lithotripsy. She likely has urosepsis from the disintegration of an infected stone. She presents with atrial fibrillation in the 120s-140s and difficulty breathing. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and a recent urinary tract infection. Her current medications include sotalol, lopressor, lasix, and coumadin. She is also on outpatient medications for hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation could be due to intense diuresis/dehydration stress or other underlying conditions. Management includes increasing sotalol to 120mg, IV lopressor as needed for rate control, correcting fluid status with small boluses of fluid, holding further diuresis, and considering starting diltiazem if needed.

2. Difficulty Breathing: The patient's difficulty breathing could be due to volume status or other factors. Holding lasix for now and closely monitoring the patient's respiratory status is recommended. Nebulized albuterol cannot be administered due to the patient's use of a beta-blocker.

3. Urosepsis: The patient is showing signs of urosepsis, including an increased white blood cell count, dysuria, and a ting"
