   Assessment and Plan
   40yo man with h/o ascending aortic dissection and St. Jude's valve on
   coumadin, with right renal mass, here in ICU for monitoring after R
   radical nephrectomy.
   .
   #. s/p R radical nephrectomy and removal of large renal mass: Patient
   just underwent large surgery with successful removal of R kidney
   including large 13cm mass suspicious for malignancy. Pathology was
   sent, still not back. This mass was likely cause of perinephric bleed
   during last hospital stay requiring IR embolization. Still intubated
   and in ICU overnight.
   - urology following, appreciate comanagement
   - f/u pathology
   - watch dressings, Q8hr Hct overnight after procedure (estimated blood
   loss 1,700cc requiring transfusions and FFP in OR)
   - closely monitor UOP and renal function given removal of one kidney
   - fentanyl boluses prn pain overnight
   - trend lactate until normalized
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.1-1.3
   prior to procedure. Cr up to 1.6 post procedure. Monitor Cr and UOP
   closely as during last hospital stay, patient had acute renal failure
   with Cr up to 6, requiring CVVH and intubation for volume overload.
   Vigileo monitor placed, patient with SVV of 10, CI 5.4, acceptable
   urine output.
   - continue LR @ 75cc/hr for maintenance
   - goal to keep UOP>15cc/hr, continue to monitor hemodynamics
   - given prior history, have low threshold to involve nephrology service
   if patient's UOP falls below 15cc/hr or patient's renal failure worsens
   despite fluid resuscitation
   - hold lisinopril for BP control
   .
   #. HTN: Patient with h/o HTN. Patient with high BPs, given known aortic
   dissection which has been stable, will need to have strict BP control.
   A-line in place. Patient on carvedilol, lisinopril, and amlodipine at
   home.
   - goal to keep systolic <165, MAP btw 80-100
   - restart carvedilol and amlodipine. Hold on restarting lisinopril
   given renal failure
   - IV metoprolol prn SBP>165. Can try IV labetalol, hydral if still
   uncontrolled on IV metoprolol
   .
   #. Continued intubation/respiratory failure: Patient left on vent post
   procedure given concern for fluid overload, or requirement for
   resuscitation. Patient s/p 6L fluids in OR. Patient with good
   oxygenation on PEEP 5, FiO2 50, so goal to move towards liberation from
   ventilator. Currently, patient's SVV 10, CI 5.4.
   - will titrate down on propofol overnight with goal for extubation when
   stable
   - trial patient on pressure support overnight
   - post procedure CXR
   .
   #. Known ascending aortic dissection s/p St Jude's valve: Patient's
   dissection currently stable. Patient bridged with heparin for
   mechanical valve prior to procedure. Good symmetric pulses.
   - restart heparin gtt without bolus 6 hours after procedure. Goal PTT
   50-70
   - strict BP control as above
   - monitor Hct and for bleeding on heparin

","The patient is a 40-year-old man with a history of ascending aortic dissection and a St. Jude's valve on coumadin, who also has a right renal mass. He is currently in the ICU for monitoring after undergoing a radical nephrectomy.

The patient's recent events include saturating the dressing with blood, decreased lung volumes on CXR but doing well when the vent was changed to pressure support, and the administration of metoprolol IV for BP control.

His vital signs show a temperature of 38.0°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/52 mmHg to 186/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

On the flow sheet data, the patient has been receiving fluids and blood products. His blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 131/50 mmHg to 186/65 mmHg. His urine output has been low, with a total output of 108 mL since 12 AM.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and lactate, as well as decreased levels of platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), and potassium (K+). The patient's sodium"

   40yo man with h/o St Jude valve p/w RP bleed s/p radical nephrectomy.
   .
   #. RP bleed: Has remained HD stable other than tachycardia. UOP has
   dropped off, possibly from ATN vs. rhabdo. Hct continues to trend
   downward. Per urology we will hold heparin and follow serial Hcts while
   transfusing.
   - f/u urology recommendations
   - Q4hour Hct
   - closely monitor UOP bolus w/ IVF if <50cc/hr
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: ATN vs. Rhabdo. Cr likely falsely
   elevated from large CK. [**Month (only) 51**] need dialysis in the short term.
   - Renal to spin urine
   - f/u renal recommendations
   - hold lisinopril for BP control given renal toxicity
   .
   #. HTN: holding antihypertensives given large bleed and risk of HD
   instability.
   - hold carvedilol, metoprolol, lisinopril
   .
   .
   #. Known ascending aortic dissection s/p St Jude's valve: Will need to
   allow PTT to drift down given large bleed. As soon as he is deamed
   stable will restart heparin drip to avoid emboli. Good symmetric
   pulses.
   - Hold heparin drip per urology
   - Holding BP meds
   - Cardiology consult

   Assessment and Plan
   40yo man with h/o ascending aortic dissection and St. Jude's valve on
   coumadin, with right renal mass, here in ICU for monitoring after R
   radical nephrectomy.
   .
   #. s/p R radical nephrectomy and removal of large renal mass: Patient
   on [**2-27**] underwent large surgery with successful removal of R kidney
   including large 13cm mass suspicious for malignancy. Pathology was
   sent, still not back. This mass was likely cause of perinephric bleed
   during last hospital stay requiring IR embolization. Still intubated
   and in ICU overnight.
   - urology following, appreciate comanagement
   - f/u pathology
   - watch dressings as they were blood soaked.  HCT stable but continue
   to check  Q8hr Hct
   - closely monitor UOP and renal function given removal of one kidney
   - fentanyl boluses prn pain overnight
   - lactate was elevated but has normalized to 1.3
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.1-1.3
   prior to procedure. Cr up to2.4 on [**2-28**]. Monitor Cr and UOP closely as
   during last hospital stay, patient had acute renal failure with Cr up
   to 6, requiring CVVH and intubation for volume overload. Vigileo
   monitor placed, patient with SVV of 10, CI 5.4.  Pt had acceptable UOP
   overnight.
   - d/c LR as pt volume up
   - goal to keep UOP>15cc/hr, continue to monitor hemodynamics
   - given prior history will consider nephrology c/s today
   -trend creatinine (noon check) will likely trend down given he only has
   one kidney, however may trend up given that will given lasix prior to
   extubation with goal neg 1L
   - hold lisinopril for BP control given renal toxicity
   .
   #. HTN: Patient with h/o HTN. Patient with high BPs, given known aortic
   dissection which has been stable, will need to have strict BP control.
   A-line in place. Patient on carvedilol, lisinopril, and amlodipine at
   home.   He is receiving metoprolol PRN for HTN
   - goal to keep systolic <165, MAP btw 80-100
   - restart carvedilol and
   .
   #. Continued intubation/respiratory failure: Patient was left on vent
   post procedure given concern for fluid overload, or requirement for
   resuscitation. Patient s/p 6L fluids in OR. Pt did well over night with
   good ABG on PS. Sedation low this AM and pt with good cough and
   moderate secretions.  CXR looks better this AM
   -lasix 40 IV x1 with goal neg 1L given volume up per JVD
   -will extubate this AM
   .
   #. Known ascending aortic dissection s/p St Jude's valve: Patient's
   dissection currently stable. Patient bridged with heparin for
   mechanical valve prior to procedure. Good symmetric pulses.
   - On heparin gtt.  Goal PTT 50-70. Was high this AM will adjust per
   scale.
   - strict BP control as above
   - monitor Hct and for bleeding on heparin, however given risk of stroke
   will preferentially give blood over stopping heparin if he drops HCT
   .
   # Decreased bowel sounds: ? pt could be developing ileus.   Resection
   of R kidney proximal  to duodenum although no known damage to GI track
   during procedure.
   -advance NG tube this AM
   -Keep NG tube until flatus
   -Keep PPI on until flatus
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia
   - hold fenofibrate for now (use in caution with mild-moderate renal
   impairment) but restart as renal function improves
   .
   #. Gout
   - hold home colchicine for now (use in caution with mild-moderate renal
   impairment) but restart as renal function improves

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of ascending aortic dissection and St. Jude's valve who underwent right radical nephrectomy and removal of a large renal mass. He is currently in the ICU for monitoring. The patient's recent events include extubation, a decreasing hematocrit trend despite receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells, and a decrease in urine output.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level was elevated prior to the procedure, and it further increased to 2.4 on the following day. This indicates a potential acute kidney injury, which could be due to factors such as hypoperfusion, nephrotoxic drugs, or postoperative complications.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been high, with readings ranging from 163/66 to 175/73 mmHg. Strict blood pressure control is necessary to prevent complications like myocardial ischemia or aortic dissection.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient received a significant amount of fluids intraoperatively (6L), and there are concerns about fluid overload. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload, such as increased central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary edema, or weight gain, is important.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to respiratory failure. Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to the"

","The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal failure, and renal cancer who is currently in the ICU. He underwent nephrectomy for a renal mass and is now experiencing acute blood loss anemia due to a retroperitoneal bleed. The patient is on chronic anticoagulation and has been transfused with blood, with heparin being held but not reversed. Serial hematocrits are planned to monitor the patient's blood count.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 154/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 3 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient has a history of acute pain and is currently on fentanyl and metoprolol infusions. He also received a dose of lasix. His physical examination reveals clear lung sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and warm skin without rash or jaundice. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movement with normal tone.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, leukocyte count of 207 K/uL, platelet count of 198 mg/dL, sodium level of 141 mEq/L, potassium level of 5.0 mEq/L, chloride level of 103 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 26.4%, creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 118 mg/dL, and a PT/PTT/INR of 15.6/81.1/1.4. Other lab results are within normal range.

The patient's imaging shows a CT abdomen, but the images are not provided in the progress note.

Assessment and plan include acute blood loss anemia due to retroperitoneal bleed, for which blood transfusion is being administered while holding heparin. Serial hct is planned to monitor the patient's blood count. The hope is that the bleeding will cease as anticoagulation is stopped, and urology will follow up on this issue.

The patient also has a history of s/p [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 1930**], for which the cardiology team will weigh in on the length of time to safely hold anticoagulation.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with dropping urine output, mild acidosis, and hyperkalemia. The patient is receiving volume resuscitation, and a renal consult is planned.

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and V"

","The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of aortic dissection, chronic anticoagulation, and nephrectomy for renal mass. He has been experiencing acute blood loss anemia due to retroperitoneal bleeding. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, but it has been stopped. He has also had an arterial line placed, which was stopped as well.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), a heart rate of 113 bpm with a normal range of 78-113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/43 mmHg to 175/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute with a normal range of 11-30 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on 3 liters nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,060 mL and a total output of 1,884 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 1,176 mL. His urine output has been decreasing. The patient's respiratory support includes delivery of oxygen through a nasal cannula, and his ABG results are pending.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. His cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds, and his peripheral vascular examination shows present radial pulses but absent dorsalis pedis pulses."

   #. RP bleed: Has remained HD stable.  Patient s/p 6 units of PRBCs
   yesterday and has had relatively stable HCT overnight.  Patient
s CVP
   is 17, is likely volume overloaded.  Per urology we will hold heparin
   and follow serial Hcts while transfusing.
   - f/u urology recommendations
   - Q4hour Hct for now
   - closely monitor UOP post diuresis with lasix
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Improving.  ATN vs. Rhabdo. Patient
   has made urine overnight, approx 20-40cc/hr.  Patient has a history of
   ARF needing dialysis in the past.  Given patient
s hemodynamic
   stability, will favor diuresis with lasix IV and closely follow UOP.
   Patient may need CVVH if UOP does not respond, for short term.
   - Lasix 60mg IV, MR x1.  Follow UOP
   - f/u renal recommendations
   - F/u AM CPK
   .
   #. HTN: holding antihypertensives given large bleed and risk of HD
   instability.
   - hold carvedilol, metoprolol, lisinopril
   .
   #. Known ascending aortic dissection s/p St Jude's valve:  Off
   anticoagulation for 24 hours.  Given that the patient has a high flow
   valve, patient can be off coumadin for three days maximum (per
   cardiology recommendations).  Patient has a known aortic dissection
   that was medically managed, keeping SBP < 160.   As soon as he is
   deemed stable will restart heparin drip to avoid emboli. Good symmetric
   pulses.
   - Hold heparin drip for now
   - Continue Labetalol gtt, titrate to goal SBP < 160

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of St Jude valve and recent radical nephrectomy. He is currently in the ICU for retroperitoneal bleeding. 

Key findings from the note include:
- The patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday, but his hematocrit (HCT) did not respond and continued to trend downward.
- The patient's urine output (UOP) dropped off to 20cc/hr and did not respond to a 500cc bolus.
- Vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and low oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 91%.
- The patient has a large right-sided nephrectomy wound that is clean and dry with scant serosanguinous drainage.
- Labs indicate elevated creatinine levels and potential acute kidney injury (AKI).
- The patient has multiple medical complications such as acute on chronic renal failure, hypertension, known ascending aortic dissection, hyperlipidemia, and gout.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Continued bleeding: Despite receiving PRBCs, the patient's HCT continues to trend downward, indicating ongoing blood loss.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest AKI, which may be due to rhabdomyolysis or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
3. Hypotension and shock: The patient's low blood pressure and inadequate response to fluid resuscitation raise concerns for hypovolemic shock.
4. Infection: The presence of a large wound and potential immunosuppression due to AKI increase the risk of wound infection or systemic infection.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of St Jude valve and known ascending aortic dissection puts him at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid status, renal function, and wound healing while addressing the underlying causes of the complications mentioned above."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of St Jude valve, presenting with a retroperitoneal bleed post radical nephrectomy. He received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday and has been hemodynamically stable overnight. His central venous pressure (CVP) is elevated at 17, indicating potential volume overload. The plan is to hold heparin and follow serial hemoglobin (Hct) levels while transfusing.

The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, previously requiring dialysis. He has started producing urine overnight, approximately 20-40 cc/hr. Given his hemodynamic stability, diuresis with lasix IV will be initiated, and urine output (UOP) will be closely monitored. If there is no response to lasix, continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) may be necessary.

Antihypertensives have been held due to the large bleed and risk of hemodynamic instability. Medications such as carvedilol, metoprolol, and lisinopril will be withheld.

The patient has a known ascending aortic dissection, for which he is off anticoagulation for 24 hours. He has a St Jude's valve and will be off coumadin for a maximum of three days (per cardiology recommendations). As soon as he is deemed stable, the heparin drip will be restarted to prevent emboli.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old man with a history of St Jude valve and recent radical nephrectomy. He presented with a retroperitoneal bleed but is now hemodynamically stable. The patient has shown improvement in his acute on chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 3.5, likely due to post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis. His blood pressure remains elevated, and he is currently on carvedilol 25mg, half of his home dose. The patient's known ascending aortic dissection status post St Jude's valve requires the restart of heparin drip, with the goal of keeping the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) between 60-70. 

The patient has several other medical conditions, including hyperlipidemia and gout, but these are being held at the moment. The patient's diet has been advanced to clear liquids, and he is currently on full code status with ICU consent signed by his wife. The patient will continue to be monitored overnight in the ICU as his heparin drip has just started."

","The patient is a 40-year-old man with a history of a St Jude valve, presenting with retroperitoneal bleed after undergoing radical nephrectomy. His hematocrit (Hct) is now stable. The patient has made significant progress over the past 24 hours, including stopping Lasix and autodiuresing a large volume, transitioning from IV Dilaudid to oral pain management, remaining stable in terms of Hct, and experiencing a decrease in creatinine levels.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 66-83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/64-154/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is hemodynamically stable, with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 5 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,030 mL, output of 6,400 mL, and a negative balance of -5,370 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula and has an ABG result of /26.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be alert and oriented, with a regular rhythm, II/VI systolic murmur, loud mechanical S2, clear to auscultation anteriorly in the lungs, moderately firm and mildly tender abdomen, and 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (W"

   #. RP bleed, s/p R radical nephrectomy: Continues HD stable. Hct stable
   stable x2 days.
   - Urology to determine frequency of Hct checks, going up on heparin
   drip.

   #. HTN:  Goal SBP < 160.  Currently on Carvedilol 25mg [**Hospital1 7**], half home
   dose.  SBPs have been up to 170s, so will uptitrate carvedilol
   - uptitrate carvedilol to 37.5mg [**Hospital1 7**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of a St Jude valve, who presented with a renal pelvis bleed post radical nephrectomy. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels are currently stable.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic renal failure, with creatinine levels improving to 2.5. He is experiencing a large autodiuresis and requires further management for hyperkalemia and potential discontinuation of a foley catheter.

The patient also has a history of hypertension, with blood pressures reaching up to 170s despite being on carvedilol 25mg (half the home dose). Therefore, the plan is to uptitrate carvedilol to 37.5mg.

The patient previously had an ascending aortic dissection, for which he was taken off anticoagulation for 3 days. Now, it is planned to restart heparin drip, aiming for a target partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60-70 seconds.

The patient has been diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, but it is decided to hold fenofibrate for now. He also has a history of gout, and colchicine administration is being withheld due to the fluctuating renal status.

The patient's nutritional status is being addressed, with plans to advance his diet to clear liquids. His access includes one peripheral intravenous line (PIV) and a right internal jugular"
