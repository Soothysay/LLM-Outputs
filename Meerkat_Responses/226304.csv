   1. L sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria: Patient currently does
   not have these symptoms and has a normal neuro exam.  Concerning for
   TIA, especially given multiple TIAs, most recently 1 month ago. Patient
   is already on aggrenox for this. On last hospitalization, Carotid US on

   stroke, which is less likely given no residual deficits, meningitis,
   hypothyroidism, and seizures.

   14.4.  No focal signs of infection. However given reported hypoxia in
   ED, concerning for community acquired pneumonia. Currently 96% on RA.
   Patient reportedly had altered mental status. With leukocytosis, it is
   possible that the patient has meningitis or encephalitis. Though
   clinically patient has no meningeal signs. This is likely a chronic
   elevation. Would consider hematologic work up if culture data negative.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and on aggrenox presents with weakness, left-sided numbness, and dysarthria. These symptoms have since resolved. The patient also has hypoxia and leukocytosis. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and they are receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula. The physical examination reveals no focal neurologic deficits, and the patient's skin and peripheral vascular examination are not assessed. The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin T levels. The patient has been diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, cerebrovascular accident (stroke), and community-acquired pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Recurring TIA: The patient's history of multiple TIAs and the current symptoms of weakness, left-sided numbness, and dysarthria suggest a potential risk for recurring TIA. Further evaluation and management are recommended, including follow-up with neurology recommendations, considering MRI/MRA, Echo to rule out patent foramen ovale (PFO), and EEG.
2. Stroke: Although the patient does not have residual deficits, there is still a concern for stroke due to the initial symptoms. Monitoring and appropriate interventions should be continued to prevent further complications.
3. Meningitis or encephalitis: The patient's leukocytosis and altered mental status raise concern for possible central nervous system infections like meningitis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) presenting with weakness, left-sided numbness, and dysarthria. The symptoms have since resolved, but there is concern for a TIA or stroke. The patient is already on Aggrenox for this condition. She also has leukocytosis, hypoxia, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Left-sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria: The patient's initial symptoms suggest a possible TIA or stroke. Given her history of multiple TIAs and ongoing treatment with Aggrenox, it is important to monitor for any recurrent symptoms and follow up with neurology recommendations. Consideration should be given to an MRI/MRA to rule out other causes and determine the appropriate management plan.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has resolved from 17.1 to 11.2, but remains elevated. This could be due to a chronic elevation or an acute infection. Since the patient has no focal signs of infection, chronic leukocytosis may be the cause. However, given the reported hypoxia in the emergency department, community-acquired pneumonia should also be considered. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, and blood cultures, urinalysis, and urine culture should be performed.

3. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation has improved from"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who presents with weakness and dysarthria. The patient has a history of pneumonia and cerebrovascular accident (stroke). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various medications and treatments. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are some concerning findings such as elevated blood pressure and abnormal laboratory results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores. This is a common complication in patients who are immobile or bedridden.

2. CVA (Stroke): The patient has a history of stroke, which increases the risk of further neurological complications. These can include recurrent strokes, worsening neurological deficits, or secondary complications such as seizures.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's history of pneumonia indicates a possible respiratory infection. In the ICU setting, this could lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

4. DVT/PE: The patient's immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and potentially pulmonary embolism (PE). These conditions can be life-threatening if not promptly identified and treated.

5. Infection: The patient's impaired immune system due to the underlying conditions and treatments may increase the risk of acquiring additional infections. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical symptoms is necessary to"

   [**Age over 90 **] yo F with a history of multiple TIAs on aggrenox presents from
   weakness with L sided numbness, weakness, dysarthria that has since
   resolved, also with hypoxia and leukocytosis.
   .
   .
   1. L sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria: Patient currently does
   not have these symptoms and has a normal neuro exam.  Concerning for
   TIA, especially given multiple TIAs, most recently 1 month ago. Patient
   is already on aggrenox for this. On last hospitalization, Carotid US on
   [**2160-9-18**] showed <40% stenosis bilaterally. Differential also includes
   stroke, which is less likely given no residual deficits, meningitis,
   hypothyroidism, and seizures.
   -follow up with neurology in AM regarding recurring TIA while on
   aggrenox
   -consider MRI/MRA in AM
   -Patient has no Echo in our system. Consider Echo in the AM to rule out
   PFO.
   -continue aggrenox per outpatient regimen
   -obtain fasting lipid panel and HgbA1C
   -allow autoregulation of BP with goal SBP < 185
   -labetalol PRN SBP>185
   -hold lisinopril. Consider restarting in the AM.
   -Continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone tonight
   -consider EEG in AM
   -continue Simvastatin per outpatient regimen
   -obtain TSH, Vit B12
   2. Leukocytosis: WBC 17.1. Afebrile currently. WBC on discharge from
   last hospitalization was 14.4.  No focal signs of infection. However
   given new hypoxia, concerning for community acquired pneumonia. Patient
   reportedly had altered mental status. With leukocytosis, it is possible
   that the patient has meningitis or encephalitis. Though clinically
   patient has no meningeal signs. This is likely a chronic elevation.
   Would consider hematologic work up if culture data negative. From
   looking at rehab records, patient has had chronic leukocytosis and was
   going to be set up with heme at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**].
   -blood cultures
   -UA, urine culture
   -d/c foley catheter
   -repeat CXR in AM
   -continue Vanc, Ceftriaxone for community acquired pneumonia.
   .
   3. Hypoxia: CTA negative for PE. CT chest does not show infiltrates,
   however given leukocytosis and hypoxia, would strongly consider
   community acquired pneumonia. Influenza swab performed in ED is
   negative. Lactate of 2.3 likely from increased work of breathing. EKG
   unchanged from baseline.
   -Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone for CA pneumonia
   -supplemental oxygen as needed
   -repeat CXR in AM
   -repeat lactate in AM
   -rule out MI -1st set negative
   4. Gait disorder: Patient recently slipped from her bed at rehab.  She
   has a known pubic rami fracture, seen on CT today.  She has seen
   orthopedics as an outpatient.
   -weight bearing as tolerated.
   -fall precautions

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) who presented with weakness, left-sided numbness, and dysarthria that have since resolved. The patient also experienced hypoxia and leukocytosis. 

The assessment and plan section of the note mentions four potential medical complications:

1. Left-sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria: This is concerning for a TIA, especially given the patient's history of multiple TIAs. The patient is already on Aggrenox for this condition. An MRI/MRA is recommended in the morning to further evaluate the possibility of a TIA or stroke. An echocardiogram should also be considered to rule out a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Aggrenox should be continued per outpatient regimen, and blood pressure should be allowed to autoregulate with a goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) below 185. Labetalol can be used as needed if the SBP exceeds 185. Lisinopril should be held for now, but may be restarted in the morning. Fasting lipid panel and HgbA1C should be obtained.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has a high white blood cell (WBC) count of 17.1. This is slightly higher than the WBC count on discharge from the last hospitalization, which was 14.4. There are no"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) on Aggrenox. She was admitted with likely recurrent TIA and experienced transient hypoxemia, which has since resolved.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 176/68 to 137/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's neurological examination shows that she is alert and attentive but not oriented to time.

The laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 11.2 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL, platelet count of 283 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 100 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.10 ng/mL. The EKG shows normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and left axis deviation, and there are Q waves in the aVL lead. The chest X-ray is severely rotated and suggests a possible right lower lobe infiltrate, although it is a poor quality study.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and currently admitted with likely recurrent TIA. She was triaged to the MICU overnight for transient hypoxemia, which has since resolved.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 176/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. Her physical examination reveals crackles in the bibasilar region of the chest, no peripheral edema, and normal neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and glucose levels. However, her creatinine level is elevated at 0.9 mg/dL. Imaging studies, including a CT torso, CT head, and RUQ US, did not reveal any significant abnormalities except for cholelithiasis and a pubic ramus fracture. An EKG shows left ventricular hypertrophy with strain pattern and possible coronary artery disease.

The assessment and plan include probable TIA, with differential diagnoses including infection (systemic or CNS) and seizure. The patient will continue on Aggrenox and statin therapy. Empiric antibiotic treatment may be considered for 48-72 hours if there is continued supporting evidence, but it will be"

   1. L sided numbness, weakness, and dysarthria: Patient currently does
   not have these symptoms and has a normal neuro exam.  Concerning for
   TIA, especially given multiple TIAs, most recently 1 month ago. Patient
   is already on aggrenox for this. On last hospitalization, Carotid US on
   [**2160-9-18**] showed <40% stenosis bilaterally. Differential also includes
   stroke, which is less likely given no residual deficits, meningitis,
   hypothyroidism, and seizures.

   Afebrile currently. WBC on discharge from last hospitalization was
   14.4.  No focal signs of infection. However given reported hypoxia in
   ED, concerning for community acquired pneumonia. Currently 96% on RA.
   Patient reportedly had altered mental status. With leukocytosis, it is
   possible that the patient has meningitis or encephalitis. Though
   clinically patient has no meningeal signs. This is likely a chronic
   elevation. Would consider hematologic work up if culture data negative.
   From looking at rehab records, patient has had chronic leukocytosis and
   was going to be set up with heme at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**].

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), on aggrenox, presenting with weakness and left-sided numbness. The symptoms have since resolved, and a CT scan of the head showed no evidence of stroke. The patient was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone for suspected pneumonia and meningitis, but the CT chest showed no signs of pneumonia. Instead, atelectasis in the left lower lobe may be the cause of her fever and transient hypoxia. The patient has been alert and confused, most consistent with delirium due to the suspected TIA. 

Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can be caused by prolonged bed rest, immobility, or pressure ulcers.
2. CVA (stroke, cerebral infarction), other: The patient had symptoms consistent with a TIA, which has since resolved. However, there is a possibility of a stroke due to her history of TIAs and risk factors.
3. H/O pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient was treated for suspected pneumonia, but the CT chest showed no signs of pneumonia. However, atelectasis in the left lower lobe may still be present, leading to her fever and transient hypoxia.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is an increase in white blood cell count"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease who presented to the emergency department with acute onset of left-sided chest pain radiating to the left arm. The patient was found to have an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was promptly taken to the catheterization lab for an emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Following the procedure, the patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of post-PCI complications. The patient's blood pressure remained elevated despite initial medication adjustments, and he was eventually placed on hydralazine for better control. The patient also experienced episodes of sundowning, for which he received haloperidol.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelets (Plt), with slightly decreased levels of creatinine (Cr) and glucose. His cardiac markers, including troponin-T, remain within normal limits. Other lab values such as calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), phosphorus (PO4), and electrolytes are within normal range.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate (HR) within normal range and respiratory rate (RR) slightly below normal. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) is maintained at 96% without the need for supplemental oxygen. Blood pressure (BP) fluctuated throughout the day,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) who was admitted with likely recurrent TIA. The patient was triaged to the MICU overnight for transient hypoxemia. The evaluation so far has been unremarkable.

The patient's hospitalization has been marked by delirium, which is a new symptom. There are no clear signs of infection at this time, although there is leukocytosis that is chronic. No electrolyte imbalances were observed. It is planned to discontinue antibiotics today and closely monitor the patient if okay with the neurologist. Low-dose haloperidol will be used as needed for delirium management.

The patient also has possible TIA, and it is appreciated to have neurology follow-up. The patient will continue taking Aggrenox and a statin.

Additionally, the patient experienced transient hypoxemia, which has now resolved and is stable on room air.

The patient has hypertension, which needs cautious control in the setting of TIAs. Lisinopril was resumed, and low-dose amlodipine was added yesterday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) on Aggrenox. She was admitted for a likely recurrent TIA and experienced transient hypoxemia, which has since resolved. The patient also has delirium, which is new and not related to infection. Other medical conditions include hypertension, a possible TIA, a fractured left pubic ramus, and chronic leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which may lead to confusion, disorientation, and difficulty in following commands. Frequent re-orientation and low-dose haloperidol (Haldol) will be used as needed to manage the delirium.
2. Possible TIA: The patient's recurrent TIA symptoms indicate a potential risk of stroke. Continued monitoring and management with Aggrenox and statin therapy are recommended.
3. Transient Hypoxemia: Although the patient's transient hypoxemia has resolved, it is important to closely monitor her oxygen levels to prevent any further episodes.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs cautious control, especially in the setting of TIAs. Lisinopril has been resumed, and low-dose amlodipine has been added.
5. Left Pubic Ramus Fracture: The patient has a fractured left pubic ramus, which requires fall precautions, physical therapy (PT"
