   Assessment and Plan: This is a 26 year old female with recent spinal
   surgery who presents with fevers, cough and hypotension.
   Hypotension/Sepsis:  Initially concern was for sepsis with source being
   recent surgical implants.  Now the most likely source is her lungs, and
   a possible bacterial superinfection of her influenza infection.
   Currently making good urine, mentating well and with normal lactate
   which argues against end-organ malperfusion.  She has complained of
   diarrhea so clostridium difficle should also be considered, though she
   is currently constipated.  She received vancomycin and zosyn in the
   emergency room for empiric coverage of sepsis of unclear etiology. Her
   pressures are improved this morning with SBPs in the 90s, though she
   had lower pressures just 8-10 hours ago.  Per clinic notes, her
   baseline would appear to be high 90s to 110s.  She has not responded
   well to fluid boluses.
   - will need to consider central IV access if persistent hypotension
   - f/u blood and sputum, c. diff and influenza swab
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for empiric coverage of sepsis
   - continue tamiflu pending influenza swab
   - f/u ESR and CRP which were sent from floor
   - monitor fever curve and WBC count
   - will need to consider additional imaging to assess for evidence of
   surgical infectious complications
   Influenza story: had a convincing story and a sick contact.
   - continue tamiflu for 5 day course.
   - consult ID.
   Spinal fusion:  Per orthopedics her wound is healing well and is at low
   risk for hardware infection.
   - f/u ortho recs
   Pain:  Pain has been difficult to control during recent
   hospitalization.  Per patient she takes morphine
   - increase to home regimen of 60mg TID MS contin.
   - Consult pain service as this worked well for her on her prior
   admission.
   - PO dilaudid for breakthrough
   - bowel regimen
 dulcolax seems to work for her.
   FEN: replete electrolytes, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 26-year-old female with recent spinal surgery presenting with fevers, cough, and hypotension. She has been diagnosed with influenza A and is currently being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin for possible bacterial superinfection of her influenza infection. Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), blood pressure ranging from 100/67 mmHg to 75/44 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She has received fluids but has not responded well to them. The patient's pain has been difficult to control, and her pain medication has been increased. Imaging shows gallbladder sludge with no definite wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. The patient's WBC count is 3.0 K/uL, Hct is 30.1%, and Plt is 263 K/uL. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fever could indicate sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Influenza A Infection: The patient tested positive for influenza A, which can cause respiratory symptoms and weaken the immune system, making her more susceptible to other infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who recently underwent spinal surgery and presents with fevers, cough, and hypotension. She has been diagnosed with influenza A and received treatment for possible sepsis, including vancomycin and zosyn. Her blood pressure has improved but she remains hypotensive, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. Additional tests and consultations have been ordered, including checking TSH and cortisol levels, monitoring fever curve and WBC count, and considering additional imaging. The patient's pain management has been inadequate, and a pain service consultation has been requested. Her electrolytes are replete, and she is on a regular diet. She is currently on prophylactic heparin and bowel regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with hypotension and fevers, which raised concerns for sepsis. Although her blood pressure has improved, the possibility of sepsis should still be considered, especially if there is a bacterial superinfection of her influenza infection or another source of infection.
2. Hypotension: Despite receiving treatment, the patient remains hypotensive. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.
3. Influenza A: The patient tested positive for influenza A. It is important to monitor her symptoms and ensure that she completes the prescribed course of antiviral medication (Tamiflu).
4. Surgical complications: As the patient recently"

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 26 year old female with recent spinal
   surgery who presents with fevers, cough and hypotension.
   Hypotension/Sepsis:  Concern given the constellation of fevers,
   tachycardia and hypotension that this represents sepsis.  Currently
   making good urine, mentating well and with normal lactate which argues
   against end-organ malperfusion.  Souce is unclear.  Highest on the
   differential would be blood stream versus hardware infection of the
   back.  She also has a left sided infiltrate on chest CT which is being
   treated with levofloxacin but has persistent cough and pleuritic chest
   pain.  Given myalgias and high fevers, influenza is on the
   differential.  Urinalysis is negative.  She has complained of diarrhea
   so clostridium difficle should also be considered.  She received
   vancomycin and zosyn in the emergency room for empiric coverage of
   sepsis of unclear etiology. Heart rate now in the 90s with blood
   pressures in the high 90s systolic after 5 liters of IVF.  Unclear
   baseline blood pressures, per nursing staff during her previous
   hospitalization her baseline blood pressures were in the 90s but in
   clinic it appears to be in the high 90s to 110s.
   - normal saline boluses for UOP < 30 cc/hr, SBP < 90
   - will need to consider central IV access if persistent hypotension
   - close monitoring of urine output
   - will follow blood cultures
   - will send sputum, c. diff and influenza swab
   - vancomycin and zosyn for empiric coverage of sepsis
   - continue tamiflu pending influenza swab
   - f/u ESR and CRP which were sent from floor
   - monitor fever curve and WBC count
   - will need to consider additional imaging to assess for evidence of
   surgical infectious complications
   Spinal fusion:  Per orthopedics her wound is healing well and is at low
   risk for hardware infection.
   - will follow orthopedics recommendations for consideration of
   additional imaging
   Pain:  Pain has been difficult to control during recent
   hospitalization.  Per patient she takes morphine
   - continue home regimen with MS contin 30 mg Q8H
   - dilaudid for breakthrough
   - bowel regimen
   FEN: IV fluid boluses as above, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen
   Access: Peripherals, may need to consider central access if persistent

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old female with recent spinal surgery who presents with fevers, cough, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with influenza A and is experiencing hypotension, which could potentially be related to sepsis. The source of infection is unclear, with possible causes including a blood stream infection or hardware infection from the spinal surgery. The patient also has a left-sided infiltrate on chest CT, treated with levofloxacin, along with persistent cough and pleuritic chest pain.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 84 bpm (with a range of 70-97 bpm), blood pressure in the high 90s systolic, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (with a range of 12-21 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient has received vancomycin and zosyn for empiric coverage of sepsis. 

The plan of care includes normal saline boluses for urine output less than 30 cc/hr and systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg, considering central IV access if persistent hypotension occurs, close monitoring of urine output, following blood cultures, sending sputum, C. diff, and influenza swab, continuing tamiflu pending influenza swab, monitoring fever curve and WBC count, and considering additional imaging to assess for"

The patient is a 26-year-old female with recent spinal surgery who is currently in the ICU. She presents with fevers, cough, and hypotension. The initial concern was for sepsis with potential sources being surgical implants, but now it is believed that her lungs are the likely source, possibly due to a bacterial superinfection of her influenza infection. A left-sided pleural effusion and left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms were seen on yesterday's CXR, consistent with pneumonia. The patient is currently mentating well, making good urine, and has normal lactate levels, indicating no end-organ malperfusion. She received vancomycin and zosyn in the emergency room for empiric coverage of sepsis. Follow-up blood and sputum cultures, as well as tests for Clostridium difficile and influenza, are planned. The patient will continue on vancomycin and zosyn for pneumonia coverage, along with a 5-day course of tamiflu. An endocrine consult is needed to evaluate the equivocal cortisol stim test result. Orthostatic blood pressures should be monitored, and a PT consult is required for out-of-bed activity. The patient's spinal fusion wound is healing well, and there is no need for imaging.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 26-year-old female with recent spinal surgery who presents with fevers, cough, and hypotension. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) and is currently being treated for sepsis with vancomycin and zosyn. The patient's blood pressure is still low, despite improvements in the morning, and she has not responded well to fluid boluses. Central IV access may be necessary if persistent hypotension occurs.

The patient's pain management has been difficult during her hospitalization, and she is currently on morphine. It has been decided to increase her home regimen of MS Contin to 60mg TID and consult the pain service. Breakthrough pain will be managed with PO dilaudid, and a bowel regimen including dulcolax will be continued.

The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is on a regular diet. Prophylaxis measures include subcutaneous heparin for DVT prevention and a bowel regimen to prevent stress ulcers. If the patient's clinical condition improves and her blood pressures remain stable, she may be transferred to the floor later today or tomorrow.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, and there is a concern for bacterial superinfection of her influenza infection. Clostridium difficile should also be considered due to her recent diarrhea.

2. Hypotension: Despite receiving fluids,"

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 26 year old female with recent spinal
   surgery who presents with fevers, cough and hypotension.
   Hypotension/Sepsis:  Initially concern was for sepsis with source being
   recent surgical implants.  Now the most likely source is her lungs, and
   a possible bacterial superinfection of her influenza infection.
   Yesterday
s CXR showed left-sided pleural effusion combined to left
   lower lobe area of consolidation with air bronchograms (new), which is
   consistent with PNA.  Currently making good urine, mentating well and
   with normal lactate which argues against end-organ malperfusion.  She
   has complained of diarrhea so clostridium difficle should also be
   considered, though she is currently constipated.  She received
   vancomycin and zosyn in the emergency room for empiric coverage of
   sepsis of unclear etiology.
   - f/u blood and sputum, c. diff and influenza swab
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for empiric coverage of pneumonia
   - continue tamiflu x5 day course
   - ID
   - f/u TSH and check cortisol stim test for other possible source of
   hypotension.
   - monitor fever curve and WBC count
   Hypotension: [**Last Name (un) **] stim test result equivocal. Also patient had episode
   of greater hypotension which responded to fluid bolus. Patient reports
   that she will attempt to take greater POs today as she is net negative
   for hospital stay significantly. Patient continues to mentate fully,
   making good urine. Would like orthostatic blood pressures, needs PT
   consult as to whether she needs brace to sit up in bed
   - Endocrine consult
   -PT consult for out of bed
   Spinal fusion:  Per orthopedics her wound is healing well and is at low
   risk for hardware infection; did not feel imaging was necassary
   Vaginal Itching: Patient appears to have yeast infection. Will send
   sample of discharge.
   Pain:  Pain has been difficult to control during recent
   hospitalization.  Per patient she takes morphine. Patient reports that
   pain regimen yesterday worked well for her
   - Consult pain service as this worked well for her on her prior
   admission.
   - PO dilaudid for breakthrough

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who underwent spinal surgery and is currently in the ICU. She presents with fevers, cough, and hypotension. The initial concern was sepsis, possibly from surgical implants, but now the most likely source seems to be her lungs, with a possible bacterial superinfection of her influenza infection. The patient's recent chest X-ray showed a left-sided pleural effusion combined with left lower lobe area consolidation, indicating pneumonia. She has received vancomycin and zosyn for empiric coverage of sepsis and pneumonia. Other potential causes of hypotension, such as endocrine issues, should also be investigated. The patient's fever and white blood cell count should be monitored. She is currently constipated but has had episodes of diarrhea, which raises concerns about Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's pain has been difficult to control, and a pain consult has been requested. The patient's vaginal itching may be due to a yeast infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, but her blood pressure is low. She is expected to be moved to the floor later today or tomorrow pending clinical improvement."

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 26 year old female with recent spinal
   surgery who presents with fevers, cough and hypotension; influenza A+.
   Influenza:  Initially concern was for sepsis with source being recent
   surgical implants.  Now the most likely source is her lungs, and a
   possible bacterial superinfection of her influenza infection.
   Yesterday
s CXR showed left-sided pleural effusion combined to left
   lower lobe area of consolidation with air bronchograms (new), which is
   consistent with PNA.  She received vancomycin and zosyn in the
   emergency room for empiric coverage of sepsis of unclear etiology.
   Blood cultures are negative to date. ID was consulted and felt that CXR
   improved from prior hospitalization when patient was aggressively
   treated for PNA, so we do not need to treat that at this point.
   Recommended oseltamavir (H1N1), ramantadine (for coverage of possible
   seasonal flu in addition to H1N1).  Currently fever curve is trending
   downward.
   - f/u blood and sputum (has not yet produced enough sputum for sputum
   culture)
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn until 48 hours negative blood culture
   - continue tamiflu x5 day course
   - Rimantadine 100mg PO BID x5 day course
   - monitor fever curve and WBC count
   Hypotension: Baseline from last hospitalization 90s-100s/60s. [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   test result equivocal. Also patient had episode of greater hypotension
   which responded to fluid bolus. Patient reports that she will attempt
   to take greater POs today as she is net negative for hospital stay
   significantly. Patient continues to mentate fully, making good urine;
   sepsis as a cause seems very unlikely. Per ID recommendations, patient
   may have heart failure secondary to influenza, which may be eitiology
   for hypotension; will get ECHO to assess function.
   - Endocrine consult
   - ECHO
   Leukopenia: Patient WBC count on arrival 4.3, trending down. Will ask
   ID for further recommendations as to if this may be related to viral
   causes or antibiotics.
   -F/u with ID
   Spinal fusion:  Per orthopedics her wound is healing well and is at low
   risk for hardware infection; did not feel imaging was necassary
   Vaginal Itching: Patient appears to have yeast infection. Will send
   sample of discharge and give 150mg of fluconazole x1.
   Pain:  Pain has been difficult to control during recent
   hospitalization.  Per patient she takes morphine. Patient reports that
   pain regimen yesterday worked well for her

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old female with recent spinal surgery who presents with fevers, cough, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with influenza A and is suspected to have a bacterial superinfection in her lungs. She received vancomycin and zosyn in the emergency room for empiric coverage of sepsis. Blood cultures are negative to date, and the patient is currently being treated with oseltamavir and ramantadine for her flu infection.

The patient's hypotension is being evaluated as potentially due to heart failure secondary to influenza. An echo is recommended to assess cardiac function. The patient's leukopenia is also being monitored, and further recommendations from the ID team are pending. The patient's wound from spinal fusion is healing well, and imaging is not necessary according to orthopedics. The patient has vaginal itching, which is suspected to be a yeast infection. A sample of discharge will be sent, and fluconazole will be given.

The patient's pain has been difficult to control during her hospitalization, and a pain service consultation is recommended. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is on a regular diet. Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers is being provided.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 26 year old female with recent spinal
   surgery who presents with fevers, cough and hypotension; influenza A+.
   Influenza:  Initially concern was for sepsis with source being recent
   surgical implants.  Now the most likely source is her lungs, and a
   possible bacterial superinfection of her influenza infection.
   Yesterday
s CXR showed left-sided pleural effusion combined to left
   lower lobe area of consolidation with air bronchograms (new), which is
   consistent with PNA.  She received vancomycin and zosyn in the
   emergency room for empiric coverage of sepsis of unclear etiology.
   Blood cultures are negative to date. ID was consulted and felt that CXR
   improved from prior hospitalization when patient was aggressively
   treated for PNA, so we do not need to treat that at this point.
   Recommended oseltamavir (H1N1), ramantadine (for coverage of possible
   seasonal flu in addition to H1N1).  Currently fever curve is trending
   downward.
   - f/u blood and sputum (has not yet produced enough sputum for sputum
   culture)
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn until 48 hours negative blood culture
   - continue tamiflu x5 day course
   - Rimantadine 100mg PO BID x5 day course
   - monitor fever curve and WBC count
   Hypotension: Baseline from last hospitalization 90s-100s/60s. [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   test result equivocal. Also patient had episode of greater hypotension
   which responded to fluid bolus. Patient reports that she will attempt
   to take greater POs today as she is net negative for hospital stay
   significantly. Patient continues to mentate fully, making good urine;
   sepsis as a cause seems very unlikely. Per ID recommendations, patient
   may have heart failure secondary to influenza, which may be eitiology
   for hypotension; will get ECHO to assess function.
   - Endocrine consult
   - ECHO
   Leukopenia: Patient WBC count on arrival 4.3, trending down. Will ask
   ID for further recommendations as to if this may be related to viral
   causes or antibiotics.
   -F/u with ID
   Spinal fusion:  Per orthopedics her wound is healing well and is at low
   risk for hardware infection; did not feel imaging was necassary
   Vaginal Itching: Patient appears to have yeast infection. Will send
   sample of discharge.
   Pain:  Pain has been difficult to control during recent
   hospitalization.  Per patient she takes morphine. Patient reports that
   pain regimen yesterday worked well for her
   - Consult pain service as this worked well for her on her prior
   admission.
   - PO dilaudid for breakthrough
   - bowel regimen

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 26-year-old female who recently underwent spinal surgery.
- She presented with fevers, cough, and hypotension.
- She tested positive for influenza A.
- Her initial concern was sepsis due to surgical implants, but now it is believed that her lungs are the source of infection, possibly a bacterial superinfection on top of her influenza infection.
- A chest X-ray showed a left-sided pleural effusion combined with left lower lobe consolidation, indicating pneumonia (PNA).
- She received vancomycin and zosyn for empiric coverage of sepsis.
- Blood cultures are negative to date.
- The ID consultant recommended oseltamavir (H1N1) and ramantadine for coverage of possible seasonal flu in addition to H1N1.
- Her fever curve is trending downward.
- Follow-up blood and sputum cultures are needed.
- She will continue vancomycin and zosyn until 48 hours negative blood culture.
- She will receive a five-day course of tamiflu and a five-day course of rimantadine.
- Monitor fever curve and WBC count.
- The patient's baseline blood pressure is in the 90s/60s, which is consistent with her previous hospitalization.
- Her hypotension may be due to heart failure secondary to influenza, as"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 26-year-old female with recent spinal surgery who is experiencing fevers, cough, and hypotension.
- She has been diagnosed with influenza A and her blood cultures are negative.
- She has a left-sided pleural effusion and consolidation in the left lower lobe area, which is consistent with pneumonia.
- She was treated with vancomycin and zosyn for suspected sepsis, and oseltamavir and ramantadine were recommended by the ID consult.
- The patient's hypotension is being monitored, and an endocrine consult has been requested due to equivocal stim test results.
- The patient also has vaginal itching, which is likely due to a yeast infection.
- Pain control has been difficult, and a pain consult has been requested.
- The patient's wound from spinal fusion is healing well.
- Fluid balance and vital signs are being closely monitored.
- Blood cultures are still pending, and further tests and consultations are planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacterial superinfection of the influenza infection: Given the patient's compromised immune system and the presence of pneumonia, there is a risk of developing a bacterial superinfection.
2. Heart failure secondary to flu: The patient's hypotension may be indicative of heart failure, possibly caused by the influenza infection.
3. Worsening of pneumonia: The patient's left-sided pleural effusion and consolidation indicate pneumonia. If left untreated"

   Assessment and Plan: This is a 26 year old female with recent spinal
   surgery who presents with fevers, cough and hypotension; influenza A+.
   Influenza:  Initially concern was for sepsis with source being recent
   surgical implants.  Now the most likely source is her lungs, and a
   possible bacterial superinfection of her influenza infection.
   Yesterday
s CXR showed left-sided pleural effusion combined to left
   lower lobe area of consolidation with air bronchograms (new), which is
   consistent with PNA.  She received vancomycin and zosyn in the
   emergency room for empiric coverage of sepsis of unclear etiology.
   Blood cultures are negative to date. ID was consulted and felt that CXR
   improved from prior hospitalization when patient was aggressively
   treated for PNA, so we do not need to treat that at this point.
   Recommended oseltamavir (H1N1), ramantadine (for coverage of possible
   seasonal flu in addition to H1N1).  Currently fever curve is trending
   downward.
   - f/u blood and sputum (has not yet produced enough sputum for sputum
   culture)
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn until 48 hours negative blood culture
   - continue tamiflu x5 day course
   - Rimantadine 100mg PO BID x5 day course
   - monitor fever curve and WBC count
   Hypotension: [**Last Name (un) **] stim test result equivocal. Also patient had episode
   of greater hypotension which responded to fluid bolus. Patient reports
   that she will attempt to take greater POs today as she is net negative
   for hospital stay significantly. Patient continues to mentate fully,
   making good urine. Would like orthostatic blood pressures, needs PT
   consult as to whether she needs brace to sit up in bed
   - Endocrine consult
   -PT consult for out of bed
   Spinal fusion:  Per orthopedics her wound is healing well and is at low
   risk for hardware infection; did not feel imaging was necassary
   Vaginal Itching: Patient appears to have yeast infection. Will send
   sample of discharge.
   Pain:  Pain has been difficult to control during recent
   hospitalization.  Per patient she takes morphine. Patient reports that
   pain regimen yesterday worked well for her
   - Consult pain service as this worked well for her on her prior
   admission.
   - PO dilaudid for breakthrough
   - bowel regimen
 dulcolax seems to work for her.
   FEN: replete electrolytes, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, bowel regimen
   Access: Peripherals, may need to consider central access if persistent
   hypotension

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 26-year-old female who recently underwent spinal surgery. She presents with fevers, cough, and hypotension. The influenza test came back positive for influenza A. The patient has been receiving vancomycin and zosyn for suspected sepsis, but blood cultures are negative. The ID consult recommends continuing oseltamavir and ramantadine for five days. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F) and a heart rate of 67 bpm. Her blood pressure is 91/53 mmHg, respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95%. The patient is in sinus rhythm, with a total fluid intake of 1,260 mL and output of 3,320 mL. 

The physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the right base, no edema in the extremities, and a small amount of greenish discharge from the vagina with no odor. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 3.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, platelet count of 267 K/uL, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, and glucose of 100 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ineffective coping, fever, hypotension, pain control, and influenza infection."
