   Assessment and Plan:  The patient is a 52 yo man with h/o TB who
   presents with a 5-day history of worsening hemoptysis.
   # Hemoptysis:  Pt went to IR yesterday and had bronchial artery
   emoblized.  Continues to have hemoptysis (10-15 cc/ suction).  He
   remains intubated with dual lumen tube.  DDx includes TB v.
   bronchiectasis v. malignancy v. bronchovascular fistula v. PE v. AVM v.
   vasculitis.
    - Attempt extubation this morning if tolerated.
    - F/U bronchoscopy labs (gram stain, AFB, legionella)
    - Send sputum for fungi and cytology
    - Consider ANCA and GMB Ab to assess to vasculities
    - F/U CT in 3 months to observe lung lesion
    - ID reccs
    - IR reccs
   # TB:  The patient has a history of TB, for which he was reportedly
   treated in [**Country 3153**] in [**2190**].  ID has been following and recommends holding
   ABX until certain of infection.
    - F/U Bronchial AFB smear
    - F/U ID recs
much appreciated.
   # Leukocytosis:  Patient
s WBC today increased from 9.2 to 14.4.  Most
   likely [**1-14**] infection, as patient was rigoring during IR procedure and
   has a low grade temperature.
    - Continue Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin empirically for CAP
    - F/U cultures

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of tuberculosis who presents with worsening hemoptysis. He underwent an interventional radiology procedure yesterday where his bronchial artery was embolized. Despite this, he continues to have significant hemoptysis. The patient remains intubated with a dual lumen tube and has not been able to tolerate extubation. Differential diagnoses include tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, malignancy, bronchovascular fistula, pulmonary embolism, arteriovenous malformation, and vasculitis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hemoptysis: The patient continues to have hemoptysis despite the embolization procedure. The attending physician plans to attempt extubation if tolerated, perform follow-up bronchoscopy labs, send sputum for fungi and cytology, consider ANCA and GMB Ab to assess for vasculitis, follow-up CT in three months, and consult infectious disease and interventional radiology.
2. Tuberculosis: The patient has a history of tuberculosis, for which he was reportedly treated in [Country] in [Year]. The infectious disease specialist recommends holding antibiotics until certain of infection. Follow-up bronchial AFB smear and infectious disease recommendations are planned.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased from 9.2 to 14.4. This is likely due to infection, considering the patient was rigor"

","Summary:
The patient presented with hemoptysis and underwent an IR procedure yesterday, where a bronchial artery was embolized. The patient remained intubated overnight with a double-lumen tube and was initially sedated with Propofol. However, the sedation was weaned, and the patient became agitated and unable to understand the current situation. Propofol was then increased. The patient continues to have significant hemoptysis, with 10-15 cc of blood suctioned with each suctioning. 

Medical history is limited due to the patient's sedation and language barrier. No known drug allergies exist. The patient received Ceftriaxone at 09:00 PM last night. Propofol infusion is ongoing at a rate of 50 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include Vecuronium, administered at 03:30 AM. Additionally, the patient is taking Azithromycin 250 mg PO Q24H, Acetaminophen 325-650 mg PO prn, Ceftriaxone 1 gm IV Q24H, Aluminum-Magnesium Hydrox.-Simethicone 15-30 mL PO QID:PRN, and Zolpidem Tartrate 5 mg PO HS:PRN for insomnia.

Flowsheet data shows vital signs within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/51 to 93/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 410 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and peak inspiratory pressure of 18 cmH2O. The patient's blood gases indicate a pH of 7.23.

Physical examination findings are incomplete due to the patient's agitation and inability to assess certain parameters. Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab values, including PT/PTT/INR, are elevated. 

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of hemoptysis and tuberculosis, as well as ICU care. The patient requires close monitoring, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of tuberculosis (TB) who presents with worsening hemoptysis. The patient underwent an interventional radiology (IR) procedure yesterday, where the bronchial artery was embolized. Despite this intervention, the patient continues to have significant hemoptysis.

The patient remains intubated with a double-lumen tube and is currently sedated. The plan for today includes attempting extubation if tolerated, performing follow-up bronchoscopy with lab analysis, sending sputum for fungi and cytology, considering ANCA and GMB Ab to assess for vasculitis, and scheduling a follow-up CT scan in three months to observe the lung lesion.

The patient also has a history of TB, for which he was reportedly treated in [Country 3153] in [Year 2190]. The infectious disease (ID) team recommends holding antibiotics until certain of infection and plans to follow up on bronchial AFB smear and ID recommendations.

Additionally, the patient's white blood cell count has increased from 9.2 to 14.4, suggesting a possible infection. The patient was also rigoring during the IR procedure and has a low-grade temperature. Empirical coverage for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with ceftriaxone and azithromycin is being continued, and cultures will be followed.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's ongoing hemopt"

 TUBERCULOSIS
   52M with history of TB, treated with RIPE for 9 months, presents with
   hemoptysis. Pt presented to hospital with intermittent hemoptysis.
   Bronch yesterday revealed severe hemoptysis, followed by recurrent
   massive hemoptysis, admitted to MICU, intubated with double lumen tube,
   s/p IR-guided embolization of arteries that were extravasating blood,
   now without evidence of active bleeding.
   Will plan to extubate this morning since patient appears comfortable
   and has excellent mental status with interpreter. If bleeding recurs
   will discuss with IR, IP, and surgery.
   Etiology remains unclear, including PNA, CAP, granulomatous process
   (histo?), old TB. Will follow-up micro from BAL and will stop
   respiratory isolation. Will continue discussion with ID. Holding off on
   vasculitis serologies. Cont abx for CAP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of tuberculosis (TB) who presented to the hospital with hemoptysis. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and was found to have severe hemoptysis, leading to intubation and admission to the MICU. The patient then underwent an interventional radiology (IR)-guided embolization of bleeding arteries. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/58 mmHg to 137/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, the blood glucose level is elevated at 111 mg/dL. Other lab values, including electrolytes and kidney function, are within normal range.

The patient's imaging shows stable right upper lobe airspace opacity on chest X-ray. Microbiology results for bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of hemoptysis, tuberculosis, and possible pneumonia or CAP. The etiology of the hemoptysis remains unclear, and further investigation is planned, including follow-up micro from BAL and discussion with infectious disease specialists. The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of tuberculosis (TB) who presented to the hospital with hemoptysis (coughing up blood). He has been treated for TB for 9 months. The patient experienced severe hemoptysis, followed by recurrent massive hemoptysis, and was admitted to the MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit). He was intubated with a double lumen tube and underwent interventional radiology (IR)-guided embolization of bleeding arteries. The patient is currently stable without evidence of active bleeding.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of TB, which can weaken the lung tissue and increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient's history of TB and recurrent massive hemoptysis may contribute to the development or worsening of COPD.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The repeated episodes of hemoptysis and the underlying lung disease can lead to increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries, causing pulmonary hypertension.
4. Respiratory failure: Given the severity of hemoptysis and the patient's critical condition, there is a risk of respiratory failure due to impaired gas exchange.
5. Infection: The patient is on respiratory isolation, indicating a possible risk of infection from hospital-acquired organisms.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of tuberculosis who presented with a 5-day history of worsening hemoptysis. He underwent embolization of bronchial and intercostal arteries, was intubated with a dual lumen ETT, and had resolution of hemoptysis. He was extubated on [**2193-8-2**]. Differential diagnoses for hemoptysis include bronchiectasis, malignancy, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), vasculitis, and tuberculosis. The patient's AFBs have been negative three times, making tuberculosis less likely. The patient's respiratory status will continue to be monitored, and he will return to interventional radiology (IR) if hemoptysis recurs. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has been sent for gram-negative (GNR) culture on ceftriaxone and azithromycin. ANCA and GMB antibodies will be followed up to assess for vasculitis, and a follow-up CT scan in three months will observe the lung lesion. The patient completed tuberculosis treatment in [**Country 3153**] in [**2190**], and infectious disease (ID) has been following up. The patient has had three negative AFBs, and respiratory precautions have been discontinued. Elevated white blood cell count and infiltrates on chest CT suggest either hemorrhage or purulent material consistent with pneumonia. Empirical coverage for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) will continue with ceftriaxone and azithromycin, and cultures will be followed up. Mild creatinine elevation and hematuria on urine analysis suggest acute kidney injury (AKI), which could be due to pre-renal causes, antibiotic-associated nephrotoxicity, or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Intravenous fluid challenge will be given, and laboratory tests including urine analysis, electrolytes, osmolality, and eosinophils will be repeated. Trends in creatinine will be monitored, and a repeat urine analysis will be performed. A renal ultrasound may be considered if the urine sediment remains active. The patient's nutrition will be managed regularly, and glycemic control will be maintained. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) boots and stress ulcer prophylaxis. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis will also be implemented. The patient's code status remains as full code, and his current disposition is unknown."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 52 yo man with h/o TB who presents with a 5-day
   history of worsening hemoptysis.
   # Hemoptysis:  Pt went to IR and had bronchial and intercostal artery
   emoblized.  Was intubated with dual lumen ETT and had resolution of
   hemoptysis, extubated on [**2193-8-2**].  DDx includes bronchiectasis v.
   malignancy v. AVM v. vasculitis.  TB much less likely given negative
   AFBs.
   - continue to monitor respiratory status
   - would return to IR if hemoptysis recurs
   - f/u BAL studies
   - f/u ANCA and GMB Ab to assess to vasculities
   - F/U CT in 3 months to observe lung lesion
   - ID reccs
   - IR reccs
   # TB:  The patient has a history of TB, for which he completed
   treatment in [**Country 3153**] in [**2190**].  ID has been following.  Has three negative
   AFBs.
   - have d/c
d respiratory precautions
   - ID reccs
   # Leukocytosis/?pneumonia:  Elevated WBC count and infiltrates on chest
   CT suggest either hemorrhage or purulent material consistent with
   pneumonia.  Most likely [**1-14**] infection, as patient was rigoring during
   IR procedure and has a low grade temperature.
    - Continue Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin empirically for CAP (today is day
   [**3-20**])
    - F/U cultures
   # Acute kidney injury:  Mild creatinine elevation and hematuria on UA.
   [**Month (only) 8**] have some pre-renal component but would also consider AIN in
   setting of antibiotics and nephrolithiasis.
   - IVF challenge
   - check UA, lytes, osmoles, and eosinophils
   - continue to trend creatinine
   - repeat UA
   - consider renal ultrasound if UA sediment still active

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of tuberculosis who presented with a 5-day history of worsening hemoptysis. He underwent embolization of the bronchial and intercostal arteries, was intubated with a dual lumen endotracheal tube, and subsequently experienced resolution of hemoptysis. The patient was extubated on [**2193-8-2**]. Differential diagnoses include bronchiectasis, malignancy, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), vasculitis, and tuberculosis. The patient has completed tuberculosis treatment in [**Country 3153**] in [**2190**] and has had three negative acid-fast bacilli (AFBs) cultures. 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 49 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 108/53 to 129/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a slight imbalance in fluid intake and output. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 9.2 to 15.7 thousand cells per microliter, elevated creatinine levels, and slight abnormalities in other blood parameters. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range.

 HEMOPTYSIS
   52M with h/o TB, presented with a 5-day history of worsening
   hemoptysis, transferred to MICU with massive hemoptysis from RUL,
   intubated with dual-lumen tube 2 days ago, s/p successful IR
   embolization. If rebleeds may need thoracics ([**Last Name (un) 8416**]), since IP
   visualized the airways without any endobronchial lesions.
   Now extubated and doing well except for vague abdominal discomfort.
   Increased creatinine - likely volume depleted + dye load from
   angiograhy. Will hydrate and continue full diet. Repeat the u/a.
   Upon discharge, please set him up for pulmonary follow up with CXR and
   spirometry for within 4-6 weeks. He should f/u with his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 8417**] 2
   weeks of discharge.

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of tuberculosis, who presented with worsening hemoptysis over five days. He was intubated with a dual-lumen tube and underwent successful interventional radiology (IR) embolization for massive hemoptysis from the right upper lobe. The patient is now extubated and doing well, except for vague abdominal discomfort. The patient's increased creatinine levels are likely due to volume depletion and dye load from the angiography. The plan is to hydrate the patient and continue with a full diet. A repeat urinalysis will be done upon discharge. The patient should follow up with pulmonary care within four to six weeks, including a chest X-ray and spirometry. He should also follow up with his primary care physician (PCP) two weeks after discharge."
