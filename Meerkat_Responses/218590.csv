","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female admitted to the ICU for persistent postoperative hypotension following an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. She refused blood transfusion despite being at risk of death, which led to exploration for a bleed in the operating room. The patient has a history of morphine allergy and papilloma. On review of systems, she reports fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, and no chest pain, shortness of breath, emesis, or other symptoms. Vital signs show a heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/63 to 118/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving intravenous fluids and has received 19 mL of blood products. Fluid balance shows an intake of 250 mL and output of 610 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 360 mL. Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula, and arterial blood gases are pending. Physical examination reveals stable vital signs but with bibasilar lung opacities, possibly due to aspiration, atelectasis, or infection. Imaging shows a small amount of free fluid in the perihepatic, perisplenic, and supraumbilical regions, which appears to be simple fluid attenuation. There is also trace perihepatic fluid and a small amount of complex fluid just superior to the bladder, with layering debris versus blood products. Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hematocrit of 20.2% and elevated lactate levels. Microbiology cultures are pending. The patient underwent surgical intervention in the operating room, where a perihepatic bleeding site was identified and cauterization performed. She received 1 unit of packed red blood cells intraoperatively and her blood pressure has improved. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but requires close monitoring of urine output, heart rate, blood pressure, and lactates. Surgical follow-up is planned, and consideration may be given to returning to the operating room. The patient's depression medication will be continued."

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for persisting postoperative hypotension following an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. She has a history of depression and biliary colic. The patient refused a blood transfusion despite being at risk of death, which led to urgent exploration for bleeding in the operating room. She received two units of packed red blood cells intraoperatively and her blood pressure has improved. However, her hematocrit levels are still low, indicating acute blood loss anemia. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable after surgical intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent postoperative hypotension is a significant concern. This could be due to ongoing bleeding or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
2. Intraabdominal Hematoma: The presence of a small amount of free fluid in the perihepatic, perisplenic, and supraumbilical regions suggests the possibility of an intraabdominal hematoma. Further imaging may be necessary to confirm this.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The bibasilar lung opacities seen on imaging may represent aspiration, atelectasis, or infection. Close monitoring for respiratory symptoms and potential infection is required.
4. Infection: The patient has pending cultures for MRSA screen, urine culture, and blood culture. If any of these tests come back positive, it may indicate an infection that needs"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female who underwent an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole) for symptomatic cholelithiasis. She was admitted to the MICU due to persisting post-operative hypotension. The patient refused blood transfusion despite being at risk of death, citing the risk of infection. She required exploration for bleed in the operating room and approximately 1.5 liters of blood were removed, with an identified oozing site in the gallbladder fossa that was cauterized. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) intraoperatively.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 109 bpm (with a range of 97-115 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 111/63 mmHg to 118/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (with a range of 19-31 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 250 mL and 750 mL, with a total output of 610 mL and 290 mL. The patient's urine output is 160 mL and 290 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device, nasal cannula, and has an ABG result of ///"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with hypotension and postoperative blood loss following a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been dropping, necessitating transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and surgical evacuation of a clot. The patient is currently receiving increased FiO2 due to hypoxia and has received approximately 1700 cc of crystalloid fluids. The patient is unable to stand and is somnolent since returning from the operating room, displaying signs of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates a risk for inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Anemia: The ongoing blood loss and low Hct levels suggest a significant risk of anemia, which can compromise oxygen delivery to tissues.
3. Hypoxia: The increased FiO2 requirements and decreased oxygen saturation indicate impaired oxygenation, potentially due to lung complications or blood volume shifts.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to prolonged immobility, invasive lines, and a compromised immune system.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs.
6. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: Critical illness and the use of corticosteroids"

   Coexisting air bronchograms suggest an increase in the extent of the
   pre-existing areas of atelectasis. However, coexisting pneumonia,
   potentially after aspiration, is also possible. In addition, there is
   moderate blunting of the left
   costophrenic sinus, so that the presence of a small pleural effusion
   cannot be excluded.
   Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette. No overt pulmonary

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a chief complaint of symptomatic cholelithiasis. She underwent an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy but experienced persisting postoperative hypotension, leading to her admission to the MICU. The patient had blood in the peritoneum, which was cauterized, and received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) intraoperatively. Her hematocrit (HCT) initially improved but has now trended down to 24. She continues to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 90s. Her heart rate remains unchanged. There are concerns about acute blood loss anemia, potential aspiration pneumonia, hypoxia, and ongoing monitoring for postoperative complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persisting postoperative hypotension indicates inadequate tissue perfusion and may be due to ongoing blood loss or sepsis.
2. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient's HCT has dropped from the 150s to 24, indicating significant blood loss. This can lead to inadequate oxygen-carrying capacity and further hypotension.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and opacities on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of aspiration pneumonia, especially considering her recent intubation and surgical intervention.
4. Hypox"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU for persisting post-operative hypotension following an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patient underwent a re-exploration in the operating room due to blood in the peritoneum, which was not actively bleeding and was cauterized. The patient has been experiencing low-grade fevers and is on multiple infusions and medications. Vital signs show a fever, low blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient's heart rhythm is normal, but peripheral pulses are not assessed. There is a marked increase in lung density in both lung bases on chest X-ray, indicating possible atelectasis or pneumonia. Blood lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a nasogastric tube in place. The patient has a history of allergies to morphine and heart papillae.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of increased lung density and air bronchograms on the chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia. This is further supported by the patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count.
2. Atelectasis: The increased lung density in both lung bases on the chest X-ray may also indicate atelectasis, which is a common post-operative complication.
3. Pleural effusion: The moderate blunting of the left costophrenic sinus on the chest X-ray"

   Assessment and Plan
 HEMORRHAGE/HEMATOMA, PROCEDURE-RELATED (E.G., CATH, PACEMAKER, ICD
   BLEED):  Hct has been stable.  Last transfusion yesterday afternoon.
   Repeat hct at 2 pm, if stable will be called out to the surgical
   service.  Also in positive fluid balance so some of equilibration of
   hct likely dilutional.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK):  Has been hemodynamically stable since going
   back to OR for clot evacuation.
 HYPOXIA:  Now 93% on room air sitting up in chair.  Still with
   crackles at bases, atelectasis vs. mild congestion/fluid overload.
   Autodiuresing this morning, negative 1 L since midnight.
