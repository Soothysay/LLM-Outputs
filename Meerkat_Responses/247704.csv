   Labs / Radiology:
   [**2185-2-17**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
   moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
   left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
   left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-30 %). There is no ventricular
   septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed
   free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
   ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality,
   with elevated left atrial pressure. The estimated pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2184-7-5**], the left ventricle is more dilated. The mitral
   regurgitation is reduced.
   CXR [**2185-2-17**]:
   Comparison is made to 7 hours earlier.  On
   this study, the upper stomach is visualized.  The nasogastric tube ente
   rs the
   stomach. Its sidehole is present within the stomach.  The more inferior
    course
   of the tube is not visualized, lying below the inferior edge of this vi
   ew.
   Otherwise, there has been no significant change, again noting large bil
   ateral
   pleural effusions with associated atelectasis. No pneumothorax.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. The patient was admitted following a recent hospitalization with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and hypotension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 98/45 mmHg to 133/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated for airway protection and is currently on mechanical ventilation in CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 550-596 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.1-7.8 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, platelet count of 242-331 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 26 mEq/L, creatinine level of 9.4-9.8 mg/dL, glucose level of 158 mg/dL, and serum electrolytes within normal ranges. The troponin T level is 0.53-0.52 ng/mL, and the lactic acid level is 1.2 mmol/L.

The patient's imaging studies reveal bilateral effusions on chest X-ray but decreased from previous admissions. An echocardiogram shows global left ventricular hypertrophy (LVHK), an ejection fraction of 20-30%, and slightly improved mitral regurgitation (MR).

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing evaluation for potential medical complications such as infection, medications' effects, and hyperviscosity syndrome related to Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. The patient has been weaned off pressors and is currently hemodynamically stable. Blood cultures have been obtained, and an infection workup is underway. The plan also includes continuing current medications, reassessing the degree of Waldenstrom's for possible hyperviscosity contributing to altered mental status, and considering a lumbar puncture if there is no improvement in mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Infection: The patient has signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and possible sepsis, as indicated by positive blood cultures and elevated white blood cell count. The infection workup includes obtaining blood, urine, and sputum cultures.

2. Hyperviscosity syndrome: The patient has Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with diabetes, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. He was admitted following a recent hospitalization with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/45 mmHg to 133/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 550 mL and peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine level, and elevated troponin-T level. Imaging studies reveal global left ventricular hypokinesis, an ejection fraction of 20-30%, and bilateral pleural effusions that appear decreased. The patient's blood culture is positive for Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of atelectasis on chest X-ray. Extubation may be considered once the patient's respiratory function improves, but there is a risk of post-extubation ventilation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of uncontrolled diabetes type II, end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. The patient presented with altered mental status for one day after recent discharge. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Altered mental status: The etiology is unclear, but it could be due to sepsis or polypharmacy. The blood culture is positive for GPCs, and there is a history of prior use of ativan and morphine. Renal dysfunction may also be a contributing factor. Hyperviscosity syndrome is unlikely given the serum viscosity level. Serial MS/neuro exams will be performed after extubation. An MRI may be recommended to evaluate for vascular dementia.

2) Hypotension: The patient met one of the SIRS criteria at presentation but required levophed for BP support following intubation. Given positive blood cultures and an essentially unchanged ECHO, septic shock is the most likely etiology. Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage with Vanc/Zosyn for GPCs in blood cultures should be continued. Peritoneal fluid cell count is negative for SBP, and blood culture sensitivities are pending.

3) ESRD: The patient was last dialyzed on [**2-15**]. Peritoneal dialysis should be continued as per renal recommendations. Nephrocaps should also be continued.

4) Cardiac: The patient has mild troponin leak, likely due to demand ischemia and renal disease. Troponins have been stable over the past three days, and CK levels are normal. An ECHO showed no regional wall motion abnormalities. ASA 325 mg daily should be continued. An ACEI and beta-blocker can be resumed once hypotension resolves.

5) Anemia: The patient likely has anemia due to ESRD. Weekly Procrit should be continued.

6) DM2: The patient's diabetes type II is poorly controlled with an HbA1c>13%. RISS and diabetic diet should be implemented.

7) OSA: The patient has a history of OSA but has not been using CPAP recently. Overnight monitoring and supplemental oxygen should be provided as needed.

8) Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia: Serum viscosity is essentially stable with no acute issues.

ICU Care:
Nutrition, glycemic control, lines, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer should be managed accordingly. The patient's code status is full, and disposition is ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II, end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. He presented with altered mental status for one day after recent discharge. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. Blood cultures were drawn, and an EKG was performed.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/63 to 148/119 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is a first-degree AV block. Fluid balance shows an input of 306 mL and output of 2064 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1758 mL. The patient is receiving O2 delivery device, spontaneous ventilation of 596 mL, and has an ABG of /27 with a ventilation rate of 8.2 L/min.

The patient's labs show white blood cell count of 304 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dL, platelet count of 135 K/uL, creatinine of 9.8 mg/dL, blood glucose of 158 mg/dL, and sodium of 135 mEq/L. The patient has positive Gram-positive cocci in bottles from blood cultures, as well as Gram-negative rods in the urine.

The patient's assessment and plan include altered mental status with an unclear etiology, likely sepsis versus polypharmacy given the blood culture positive for GPCs and history of previous use of Ativan and morphine. The patient also has hypotension on admission, requiring levophed for blood pressure support following intubation. Septic shock was the most likely etiology of hypotension on admission, with the source of infection still unclear. The patient has a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II, end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, congestive heart failure exacerbation, and complications related to end-stage renal disease. The patient's altered mental status requires close monitoring and further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. The patient's hypotension needs to be managed with appropriate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. The source of infection needs to be identified and treated accordingly. The patient's end-stage renal disease requires continued peritoneal dialysis, and his cardiac condition needs to be monitored and managed appropriately."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo M with a h/o uncontrolled DMII, ESRD on PD, CAD, CHF w/ an EF of
   20-30% and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia who presents after recent
   discharge with altered mental status x 1 day.
   1) Altered mental status: etiology unclear, but likely [**1-22**] sepsis vs.
   polypharm, given blood culture + GPCs and history of ativan+morphine
   prior to presentation.  MS still not quite at basline, d/w
   renal/primary. There may be an underlying component of dementia.
   Hyperviscosity unlikely given serum viscosity of 1.3 (normal 1.4-1.8).
   - will perform serial MS/neuro exams s/p extubation
   - possibility of vascular dementia, would recommend MRI to better
   evaluate
   - continue with pertioneal dialysis
   - continue empiric Vanc, Ceftriaxone
   - f/u cultures- speciation of GPCs in blood
   2) Hypotension: on adm, pt met 1 of SIRS criteria (afebrile, HR 74, WBC
   7.9, RR 21) but required levophed for BP support following intubation.
   Only definitive culture data is
 bottles + for GPCs.  Essentially
   unchanged ECHO and CE flat.  Septic shock was still most likely
   etiology pt hypotension on admission.   Source of infection still
   unclear, but need to consider foot ulcers, peritoneum, SBE as possible
   sources.  BPs stable >48hrs
   - peritoneal fluid cell ct does not meet criteria for SBP, unclear how
   to interpret in setting of PD, will d/w renal
   - given mildly thickened AV & MV valves, will d/w cardiology re
   possibility of SBE
   - for now will cover empirically for SBP with Ceftriaxone
   - blood culture + GPCs, covering with Vanc, waiting on sensitivities
   (may be contaminant)
   - urine NGTD, sputum + GNRs, GPCs & yeast.  Cx resp flora?
   - normal [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim test
   3) ESRD: Continue PD, per renal recs. Goal to run net negative.
   - Continue Nephrocaps
   4) Cardiac:
   (a) Vessels: Pt p/w mild troponin leak, likely due to demand ischemia
   in setting of sepsis and renal disease
   - troponins mildly elevated but stable x 3 & CKs normal, ECHO showed no
   RWMA.
   - continue ASA 325 mg daily
   (b) Pump: Severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with relative
   preservation of apical systolic function suggestive of non-ischemic
   etiology; ECHO [**2-17**] essentially unchanged with LVEF 20-30%.
   - resume AceI and beta-blocker once hypotension resolved
   5) Anemia: likely [**1-22**] ESRD.
   - continue Procrit
   6) DM2: Poorly controlled, HbA1c>13%.
   - RISS, diabetic diet
   7) OSA: pt with h/o OSA on CPAP, but has not been using for months now
   - will monitor overnight & apply supplemental oxygen prn
   - encourage family to bring in home machine
   .

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type II, end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. The patient presented with altered mental status for one day after recent discharge and was found to have blood culture positive for gram-positive cocci in bottles.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Altered mental status: The etiology is unclear, but it is likely due to sepsis or polypharmacy given the blood culture positive for gram-positive cocci and previous use of ativan and morphine. The patient's mental status is still not quite at baseline, and there may be an underlying component of dementia. Hyperviscosity is unlikely given a serum viscosity of 1.3 (normal 1.4-1.8). Serial mental status/neuro exams will be performed after extubation. Possibility of vascular dementia would require an MRI to better evaluate. Continue peritoneal dialysis, continue empiric Vanc, Ceftriaxone, follow-up cultures for speciation of GPCs in blood.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (dm), coronary artery disease (cad), congestive heart failure (chf) with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. He was admitted following a recent hospitalization with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and hypotension due to presumed septic shock.

The patient has shown improvements in his condition. He was extubated yesterday and is now stable on room air with an improved mental status. However, he experienced a new onset atrial fibrillation (AF) with stable rates and blood pressure. Blood cultures were obtained from the right internal jugular (RIJ) and left radial (LRAD) lines.

The patient has no known drug allergies and is currently on various medications, including piperacillin, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. His allergies, review of systems, and past medical, social, and family history remain unchanged from admission except for the noted improvements.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 98 bpm (94-152 bpm), blood pressure of 103/55 mmHg (64/41-148/119 mmHg), respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (15-24 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96%. His central venous pressure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (dm), coronary artery disease (cad), congestive heart failure (chf) with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. The patient was admitted with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and hypotension from presumed septic shock.

The patient's current issues include:

1. SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) remains unclear, and the exact cause of infection is still unknown. The patient is being treated for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) but has a history of more impressive cell counts in previous admissions. Foot wounds appear unimpressive, and it is difficult to fully rule out spontaneous bacterial empyema (SBE). A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be considered to definitively rule out SBE, and the possibility of a peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter contributing to the infection is also being considered.

2. Altered mental status (not delirium) appears improved but not quite at the prior baseline. This may be due to infection and medications, and it is possible that this is a more chronic problem, warranting a work-up for dementia.

3. Hypotension is currently stable without the need for pressors, and the patient will resume home medications. 

4. End-stage renal disease (ESRD"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic anemia, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic heart failure, altered mental status, end-stage renal disease, type II diabetes mellitus, hypotension, peripheral vascular disease, and lymphoma (Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia). The patient was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, hypotension, and respiratory failure.

24-hour events include extubation yesterday and being stable on room air. Blood cultures were drawn from the right internal jugular (RIJ) at 02:30 PM and 05:00 PM. An EKG was performed after the patient climbed out of bed and showed ST elevations in leads I, aVL, and V1-V6.

The patient has a history of allergies to no known medications. The last dose of antibiotics was given on 02/19/2018 at 08:00 AM. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis and other ICU medications. The patient's medical, social, and family history remains unchanged except as noted above.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 98 bpm (94-152 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 103/55 mmHg to 96/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (15-24 breaths"
