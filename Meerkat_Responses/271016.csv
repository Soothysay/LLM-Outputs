   24 Hour Events:
   * Anion gap closed yesterday AM and insulin pump was restarted. Patient
   was noted to have difficulty using pump given her blindness, which was
   confirmed by patient's outpatient endocrinologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 354**] and this
   is felt to be the likely
    contributor to recurrent DKA.
   * Despite restarting Insulin pump, FS increased to > 300, suggesting
   malfunctioning pump and patient was restarted on Insulin gtt.
   Discussion with outpatient endocrinologist resulted in plan to give 14
   [**Location 355**] with a sliding scale and
    discontinuing Insulin pump until it is replaced on Monday by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 354**]
   * Once weaned off of Insulin gtt, patient was persistently hypoglycemic
   with 14 units of Lantus and was thus continued on D5 1/2 NS while
   essentially NPO overnight.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 1 who was admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's insulin pump malfunctioned, leading to a recurrence of DKA. Despite restarting the insulin pump, her fingerstick blood glucose (FS) levels remained elevated, indicating ongoing hyperglycemia. The patient was then switched to insulin gtt and later transitioned to Lantus with a sliding scale insulin regimen until a new insulin pump can be obtained. The patient experienced some episodes of hypoglycemia while on Lantus and was given D5 1/2 NS overnight. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent DKA due to insulin pump malfunction and difficulty using the pump due to blindness.
2. Hypoglycemia while on Lantus and sliding scale insulin.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF) secondary to dehydration from DKA, which has resolved.
4. Leukocytosis likely due to stress, which has also resolved.
5. Potential risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to prolonged immobility in the ICU.
6. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given the duration of mechanical ventilation.

Please note that the patient's current condition is stable, and appropriate measures are being taken to manage her diabetes and prevent further complications."

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 1 who was admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's chief complaint is anion gap closed yesterday morning, and she had difficulty using her insulin pump due to her blindness. This difficulty is likely the cause of recurrent DKA. The patient was restarted on insulin gtt and then continued on a sliding scale with Lantus 14 units until a new insulin pump can be obtained. The patient experienced persistent hypoglycemia while on insulin gtt and was continued on D5 1/2 NS while essentially NPO overnight.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [date]. The patient is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and dextrose 50% infusion since 12:35 AM.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 73 bpm (range 71-92 bpm), blood pressure of 101/39 mmHg (67-110/70-115 mmHg), respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute (range 16-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's weight remains at 47 kg.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 5,901 mL with 297 mL output by mouth, 3,371 mL output through intravenous fluids, and 500 mL output by urine. The patient has not had any blood products or stool output. The respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivery with an oxygen saturation of 98%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are pending.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed due to the patient's blindness, normal skin examination, and neurologic examination also not assessed. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 16.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 32.6%, platelet (Plt) count of 303 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.0 mg/dL, troponin-T levels less than 0.01 ng/mL, and glucose levels ranging from 82-322 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with the patient currently on Lantus 14 units with a sliding scale while awaiting a new insulin pump. The patient experienced some hypoglycemia since starting Lantus and was on D5 NS overnight. The plan is to wean off D5 NS as the patient continues with oral intake.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 1 admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's insulin pump malfunctioned, leading to recurrent DKA. She was restarted on insulin drip and then transitioned to long-acting insulin (Lantus) with a sliding scale due to the malfunctioning pump. The patient experienced persistent hypoglycemia while on Lantus and is currently being monitored closely. Her leukocytosis has resolved, and acute renal failure (ARF) is suspected to be pre-renal in nature. The patient is expected to continue with a diabetic diet and have her electrolytes corrected as needed. She will require teaching and home nursing assistance upon discharge.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced persistent hypoglycemia while on Lantus, indicating the need for close monitoring of blood glucose levels.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient initially presented with DKA, which recurred due to the malfunctioning insulin pump. Continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels and prompt intervention are necessary to prevent further episodes of DKA.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is suspected to have pre-renal ARF secondary to dehydration from DKA. Close monitoring of renal function and adequate hydration are essential to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 1 admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has difficulty using her insulin pump due to blindness and was restarted on insulin gtt. Despite restarting the insulin pump, her fingerstick blood glucose (FS) increased to over 300 mg/dL, suggesting a malfunctioning pump. The patient was placed back on insulin gtt and will continue with a sliding scale while awaiting a new insulin pump. She has experienced episodes of hypoglycemia since starting Lantus and was kept on D5 1/2 NS while NPO overnight. Her allergies are unknown, and her last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2184-9-4**] at 12:02 PM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent DKA: The patient's difficulty using the insulin pump due to blindness may contribute to recurrent episodes of DKA.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced persistent hypoglycemia while on Lantus and sliding scale insulin. Monitoring of fingerstick blood glucose levels is crucial to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia.
3. Dehydration: The patient's history of DKA suggests significant dehydration, which needs to be closely monitored and managed with appropriate fluid resuscitation.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: DKA can cause electrolyte disturbances such as hyperkalemia, hyponatrem"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, managed with an insulin pump, and macular degeneration resulting in legal blindness. She was admitted with her second episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in the past four months. The possible precipitating event for this episode is dysfunction of the insulin pump.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia requiring a D5 infusion after starting Lantus. This highlights the risk of low blood sugar levels when adjusting insulin doses.

2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's second episode of DKA indicates a potential complication related to uncontrolled diabetes. DKA is a serious condition that can occur when there is a lack of insulin in the body, leading to high blood sugar levels, ketone production, and metabolic acidosis.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient had low urine output (UOP) initially, which could suggest an acute kidney injury. However, it has since resolved with the administration of intravenous fluids (IVF).

4. Cardiovascular disease: The patient has a systolic murmur heard on cardiovascular examination, which may indicate an underlying heart condition. Further evaluation is needed to determine the significance of this finding.

5. Infection: Although not explicitly stated in the progress note, the patient is at increased risk of infections"

The patient is an 80-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus and macular degeneration resulting in legal blindness. She was admitted to the ICU for her second episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) within the past four months. The precipitating event is suspected to be dysfunction of her insulin pump. The patient's vital signs are stable, and her blood glucose levels are now controlled. However, she experienced hypoglycemia requiring a D5 infusion after the first dose of lantus.

Potential medical complications:
1. Dysfunction of the insulin pump: The patient's recent episode of DKA may have been triggered by the dysfunction of her insulin pump. It is crucial to ensure that the new pump provided for her is functioning properly and that she is able to manage it effectively at home.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia requiring a D5 infusion. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels will be necessary to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia once the patient is transferred to the floor.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient initially presented with signs of ARF, but it has since resolved with the administration of IV fluids.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 F PMH type 1 DM managed with an insulin pump, macular degeneration
   resulting in legal blindness who is admitted with DKA.  Suspect this
   may have been triggered by pump dysfunction.  Her sugars are now
   controlled, but she has had some hypoglycemia requiring D5 after her
   first dose of lantus.
   1)       DM
 Decrease lantus to 10 units.  Continue humalog SS.  DC D5
   and encourage po intake.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 354**] will bring in a new pump for her
   tomorrow and we will have to review her ability to manage this at home
   and whether additional home services would be helpful.  We will also
   ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 354**] about ASA, ACEI and statin use.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) who was admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has a history of macular degeneration resulting in legal blindness. The patient's DKA was suspected to be triggered by dysfunction of her insulin pump. She received insulin, lantus, and had episodes of hypoglycemia requiring a D5 infusion. Her urine output was low, but improved after IV fluids. Her metabolic disarray has resolved. The patient's current vital signs are stable, and she is expected to be transferred to the floor if her sugar levels remain stable. The plan includes decreasing lantus to 10 units, continuing humalog SS, discontinuing D5 infusion, encouraging oral intake, and bringing in a new insulin pump for her to manage at home.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient had episodes of hypoglycemia while receiving treatment for DKA. This highlights the importance of close monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjusting insulin doses accordingly.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient was admitted with DKA, which is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketone production, and metabolic acidosis. It requires prompt medical attention and management.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient had low urine output initially, indicating possible ARF. However, it"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) who presented to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's blood sugars have been difficult to control, with two episodes of hypoglycemia. She also complains of a sore throat, but without fever or exudate. The patient has no known drug allergies. She was started on Lantus insulin, but the insulin pump is not working properly, leading to the need for alternative management. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/54 to 155/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is alert and oriented, with intact cranial nerves and normal strength and sensation. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient has experienced two episodes of hypoglycemia since starting Lantus insulin. This can be managed by adjusting the dosage of insulin and closely monitoring blood glucose levels.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient presented to the ICU with DKA,"

   DM/DKA: Resolved s/p Insulin gtt x 2. Currently, patient remains off
   insulin pump, has demonstrated difficulty using it due to her
   blindness. Per discussion with primary endocrinologist, patient
   remained on Lantus with a sliding scale while she awaited a new Insulin
   pump.  Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 354**] decided to hold off on new pump and continue lantus +
   SS.  FS cont. to be widely variable going from 94->400s after eating
   breakfast.
   - Cont. Lantus to 10 u QHS and use SS
   -Continue to monitor FS while on Lantus/SS
   - Patient will need teaching and VNA on discharge as  her blindness was
   likely the reason she went into
     DKA.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 354**] requests VNA to prefill her syringes at home to
   assist with more accurate delivery.
   Leukocytosis: Resolved. Likely in the setting of stress. Still
   afebrile, hemodynamically stable and cultures are negative.
   -f/u throat culture

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 80-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) managed by an insulin pump, and macular degeneration resulting in legal blindness. She was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and it is suspected that pump dysfunction may have triggered this episode. Her blood sugars are now controlled, but she experienced some hypoglycemia requiring D5 after the first dose of Lantus.

Medical Complications:
1. DM: The patient's DM is being managed by adjusting Lantus dosing and Humalog sliding scale. She will no longer use her insulin pump, but will convert to long-acting insulin. Close monitoring is required due to widely ranging finger stick blood sugar levels.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF has resolved, as indicated by improved urine output after intravenous fluids.

ICU Care:
- Nutrition: The patient is on a [**Doctor First Name **] diet.
- Glycemic Control: The patient's blood sugar levels need to be closely monitored.
- Lines: The patient has had a 20-gauge line placed on [**2184-9-4**] at 12:04 AM.
- Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- Communication: The patient's status is full code, indicating that she should receive"

 Decrease lantus to 10 units.  Continue humalog SS.  DC D5
   and encourage po intake.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 354**] will bring in a new pump for her
   tomorrow and we will have to review her ability to manage this at home
   and whether additional home services would be helpful.  We will also
   ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 354**] about ASA, ACEI and statin use.
