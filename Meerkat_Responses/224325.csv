   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64 yo man with dilated cardiomyopathy and severe aortic
   stenosis, OSA & pulmonary hypertension who was admitted to the hospital
   for worsening dyspnea and is transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for further care.
   .
   # Fever/hyperthermia: differential dx is broad and includes infection,
   drug reaction, or malignant hyperthermia.  His fever predates receipt
   of neuroleptics and he is not rigid to suggest NMS.  He did not receive
   atropine in the cath lab and does not have dilated pupils, making
   anticholinergic syndrome unlikely.  octreotide causes fever in 16-20%
   of patients, which is possible.  Hyperthyroidism could also be
   possible.  Infectious causes are possible, but less commonly cause such
   high fever.  C diff can cause very high fever, toxin-mediate disease
   (like TSS) could also cause such fever (although no skin flushing,
   etc), viral infection (given lymphopenia), etc.  No rash or
   eosinophilia to suggest allergic reaction
   - hold octreotide
   - f/u culture data
   - check TSH
   - consider viral serologies & ID consult in AM.
   - send hemolysis labs
   - consider TTE/TEE to r/o endocarditis
   - treat with vancomycin, cipro, flagyl
   - standing tylenol & cooling blanket
   - hydrate cautiously to replace insensible losses
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive overnight with MAP
s in 40
   Minimally responsive to small IVF boluses therefore was started on
   dopamine however did not tolerate [**1-22**] tachycardia. Changed to levophed
   and tolerating well
   - continue levophed to maintain MAP>55-60
   .
   # Dyspnea: acute on chronic dyspnea is likely multifactorial.  He has
   COPD, severe pulmonary hypertension possibly [**1-22**] COPD, OSA, or other
   causes.  Known chronic systolic heart failure .  His cath lab numbers
   show that he is not in significant pulmonary edema.  Respiratory status
   improved with decreased work of breathing and stable oxygenation
   - continue supplumental oxygen
   - place swan tomorrow and diurese as needed
   - repeat CXR today
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   .
   # Transaminitis: unclear etiology.  Could represent viral infection,
   versus congestive hepatopathy. US negative for cholangitis or
   cholecystitis.
   - f/u hepatitis B panel, CMV, EBV
   - trend LFT
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Improved both symptomatically and by exam.  KUB
   without evidence of perforation
   - check C diff when able
   - consider CT abdomen today
   - trend LFT
   -f/u final read abdominal U/S
   .
   # UTI: unlikely to be source of such a high fever
   - cont ciprofloxacin
   - f/u urine cx
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: severe based on gradient and valve area.  Patient
   has had symptoms of refractory heart failure, but no angina or
   syncope.  Depressed EF alone is indication for valve repair.
   - consider referral for valve repair/replacement when stabilizes
   - resume BB when BP's stable
   - consider dobutamine echo to r/o pseudo aortic stenosis
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: atrial fibrillation with wide complex QRS
   - restart BB when able
   - show EKGs to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in AM
   .
   # Diabetes: blood sugars well controlled
   - continue lantus 30U
   - HISS
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: continue statin
   .
   # Access: placed cordis with RIJ CVC [**2114-4-23**].  Will place swan today for
   better assessment of volume status
   .
   # FEN/GI: restart diet today
   .
   # Code: full
","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted for worsening dyspnea and is currently in the ICU. The patient has experienced several medical complications, including fever, hypotension, dyspnea, transaminitis, abdominal pain, urinary tract infection (UTI), and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has a high fever of 105Â°F, which could be due to various causes such as infection, drug reaction, or malignant hyperthermia. Differential diagnoses include infectious causes, drug-induced fever, hyperthyroidism, or allergic reaction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

2. Hypotension: The patient became hypotensive overnight with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 40s. Despite receiving intravenous fluids, the patient's blood pressure remains low. The patient was started on dopamine but did not tolerate it due to tachycardia. Levophed was then initiated and the patient is tolerating it well. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of the vasopressor dose will be necessary to maintain a MAP above 55-60 mmHg.

3. Dyspnea: The patient's acute-on-chronic dyspnea is likely multifactorial. Factors contributing to the dyspnea include chronic systolic heart failure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy and severe aortic stenosis who was admitted to the hospital for worsening dyspnea. He is currently in the ICU and experiencing multiple medical complications.

1. Fever/hyperthermia: The patient has had a high fever (105 F) last night, which was treated with Tylenol and cooling blankets. The differential diagnosis for the fever includes infection, drug reaction, or malignant hyperthermia. The patient did not receive atropine in the cath lab and does not have dilated pupils, making anticholinergic syndrome unlikely. Other potential causes such as octreotide-induced fever, hyperthyroidism, and infectious causes should be considered.

2. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea is likely multifactorial. It could be due to fever-induced tachypnea, severe pulmonary hypertension, or other underlying conditions. The patient has been anticoagulated for most of his hospital stay, making pulmonary embolism unlikely.

3. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which could be due to viral infection or congestive hepatopathy. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.

4. Abdominal pain: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain, which may be related to hepatitis or other gastrointestinal issues. Additional tests are required to identify the underlying cause.

5. UTI: The patient's urinary tract infection is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, OSA, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital for worsening dyspnea and is now in the ICU. He has had a fever of 105Â°F, which was treated with Tylenol and cooling blankets. The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring IV fluids and the use of dopamine and norepinephrine. He has also received midazolam and haloperidol for sedation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient's high fever could be due to an infection, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
2. Drug reaction: The fever may also be a reaction to one of the medications the patient is receiving.
3. Malignant hyperthermia: This is a rare reaction to certain anesthetic drugs, which can cause a rapid increase in body temperature.
4. Anticholinergic syndrome: The patient did not receive atropine in the cath lab, making this less likely.
5. Hyperthyroidism: This could be a possible cause of the fever, especially considering the patient's lymphopenia.
6. Septic shock: The patient's unstable blood pressure and the need for aggressive resuscitation suggest the possibility of septic shock.
7. Endocarditis: A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea on exertion and transferred for further evaluation of aortic stenosis. Currently, the patient is diagnosed with septicemia caused by Group B Streptococcus/Enterococcal bacteremia, possibly due to translocation in the setting of recent cardiac catheterization; cannot exclude endocarditis and is at risk given rheumatic heart disease.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Sepsis and septic shock due to the ongoing infection.
2. Endocarditis, which is a risk given the patient's history of rheumatic heart disease and recent cardiac catheterization.
3. Acute kidney injury (ATN) in the setting of contrast nephropathy.
4. Respiratory failure due to COPD and pulmonary hypertension.
5. Congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to severe aortic stenosis.
6. Hepatic dysfunction with transaminitis of unclear etiology.
7. Anemia, possibly due to gastrointestinal bleeding or chronic kidney disease.

   I have reviewed the progress note above by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 164**] and agree with the
   documentation of the clinical course over the past 24 hours.  The
   physical examination documented is consistent with my examination
   today.  We are treating the patient for presumed sepsis that is
   worsened by acute on chronic left ventricular dysfunction.  He also has
   atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  Although we are
   holding anticoagulation due to his recent GI bleed, we will evaluate
   this again in the setting of his possible endocarditis.  This afternoon
   he feels improved and is less dysnpeic, consistent with a therapeutic
   response to his diuretics.   I agree with the above progress note
   including plans for continued antibiotic therapy and need for a TEE to
   exclude endocarditis.  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3139**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5279**], MD  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5760**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea on exertion and transferred for further evaluation of aortic stenosis. Currently, the patient is being treated for septicemia caused by gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia, possibly streptococcal or enterococcal translocation in the setting of recent cardiac catheterization. There is a concern for endocarditis given his rheumatic heart disease. The patient's fever has subsided, but his white blood cell count is increasing. He requires substantial pressor support to maintain perfusion, and his hemoglobin concentration is at the target level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already being treated for sepsis secondary to GPC bacteremia. Continued monitoring and management of his condition are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Endocarditis: Given the patient's history of rheumatic heart disease and recent cardiac catheterization, there is a concern for endocarditis. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be performed to evaluate for this condition.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring due"

   # Fever: Fever defervesced overnight. Differential dx is broad and
   includes infectious and non-infectious causes including drug reaction.
   Thyroid studies normal
   - continue vancomycin, cipro, flagyl
   - tylenol prn
   - hydrate cautiously to replace insensible losses
   - consider TTE/TEE to r/o endocarditis
   - f/u viral hepatitis serologies
   - f/u culture data
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  30
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient became hypotensive overnight with MAP
s in 40
   Minimally responsive to small IVF boluses therefore was started on
   dopamine however did not tolerate [**1-22**] tachycardia. Changed to levophed
   and tolerating well. Likely septic physiology
   - continue levophed to maintain MAP>55-60
   - place Swan today for better hemodynamic monitoring
   - trend SvO2
   .
   # Dyspnea: acute on chronic dyspnea is likely multifactorial.  He has
   COPD, severe pulmonary hypertension possibly [**1-22**] COPD, OSA, or other
   causes.  Known chronic systolic heart failure .  His cath lab numbers
   show that he is not in significant pulmonary edema.  Respiratory status
   improved with decreased work of breathing and stable oxygenation
   - continue supplumental oxygen
   - place swan tomorrow and diurese as needed
   - repeat CXR today
   - wean oxygen as tolerated
   .
   # Transaminitis: unclear etiology.  Could represent viral infection,
   versus congestive hepatopathy. US negative for cholangitis or
   cholecystitis.
   - f/u hepatitis B panel, CMV, EBV
   - trend LFT
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Improved both symptomatically and by exam.  KUB
   without evidence of perforation
   - check C diff when able
   - consider CT abdomen today
   - trend LFT
   -f/u final read abdominal U/S
   .
   # UTI: unlikely to be source of such a high fever
   - cont ciprofloxacin
   - f/u urine cx
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis: severe based on gradient and valve area.  Patient
   has had symptoms of refractory heart failure, but no angina or
   syncope.  Depressed EF alone is indication for valve repair.
   - consider referral for valve repair/replacement when stabilizes
   - resume BB when BP's stable
   - consider dobutamine echo to r/o pseudo aortic stenosis
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: atrial fibrillation with wide complex QRS
   - restart BB when able

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted for worsening dyspnea and transferred to the ICU for further care. The patient experienced a fever overnight, which has since defervesced. He also presented with hypotension that was initially unresponsive to IV fluids but responded to dopamine and then levophed. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, and he has acute on chronic dyspnea with multiple potential contributing factors including COPD, severe pulmonary hypertension, and chronic systolic heart failure. The patient's transaminase levels are elevated, but the etiology is unclear. He also has abdominal pain, but an abdominal ultrasound did not reveal any evidence of perforation. Additionally, the patient has a urinary tract infection, severe aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation with wide complex QRS, well-controlled diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and a new central venous catheter placement. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever and elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a possible infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.
2. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and requirement for vasopressors (dopamine and levophed)"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital due to dyspnea on exertion and was transferred for further evaluation of his severe aortic stenosis. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for septic shock caused by bacteremia with coagulase-positive Staphylococcus. He has multiple comorbidities including dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 25%, severe aortic stenosis, and rheumatic mitral stenosis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.0Â°F, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 107/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. His physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, a harsh systolic murmur at the base, and trace edema in the lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.6 thousand/mm3, elevated creatinine levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), low albumin level, elevated lactate level, and elevated troponin-T level. Blood cultures are positive for coagulase-positive Staphylococcus.

The patient's imaging studies reveal severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, severe aortic stenosis, mild mitral stenosis, moderate mitral regurgitation, and severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) does not show any valvular vegetations, but imaging of the aortic valve is limited by severe valvular sclerosis.

The patient has several medical complications, including septic shock, acute kidney injury (likely due to contrast nephropathy from a recent cardiac catheterization), acute respiratory failure, liver failure (with unclear etiology), anemia (possibly due to gastrointestinal bleeding from a colonic arteriovenous malformation), and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient's current plan includes titrating levophed to maintain ScvO2>70%, placing a Swan-Ganz catheter for better hemodynamic monitoring, maintaining CVP>7-10 mmHg, maintaining hematocrit >30%, trending lactate levels, continuing vancomycin, discontinuing ciprofloxacin and flagyl, obtaining additional information regarding prior history, and consulting with a cardiothoracic surgeon for possible aortic valve repair."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital for dyspnea on exertion and transferred for further evaluation of aortic stenosis. He now presents with gram-positive cocci bacteremia, septic shock, and possible enterococcal translocation.

The patient's condition is unstable with high fever that has defervesced, increasing white blood cell count, improving perfusion but still requiring substantial vasopressor support, and a hematocrit level at goal. He has severe aortic stenosis with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and minimal mitral stenosis. There is also evidence of global left ventricular hypokinesis, right ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction, and severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's recent medical history includes a colonoscopy with cauterization of colonic arteriovenous malformation, which could potentially be related to anemia of unclear etiology. There is also evidence of transaminitis, possibly due to congestive hepatopathy or viral hepatitis. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, norepinephrine,"

   I have reviewed the progress note above by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5621**] and agree with
   the documentation of the clinical course over the past 24 hours.  The
   physical examination documented is consistent with my examination today
   and I was present for the pertinent aspects of the examination by Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5621**].  He has [**3-24**] positive blood cultures for Gm positive cocci in
   clusters and is on appropriate antibiotic therapy.  He still requires
   low doses of Levophed and we will proceed with a Swan Ganz catheter
   placement for assessment of his LV filling pressures.   We have asked
   cardiac surgery to evaluate him for the appropriateness and timing of
   his aortic valve replacement.  There is no current evidence of
   endocarditis.   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3139**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5279**], MD  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5760**]

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to difficulty breathing on exertion (DOE) and is currently being evaluated for severe AS. The patient has also been diagnosed with bacteremia caused by coag-positive staphylococci and is suspected to have sepsis.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Septic condition: The patient is experiencing sepsis likely caused by coag-positive staphylococci bacteremia. He is on appropriate antibiotic therapy, but his condition requires close monitoring. Pressor requirements are still substantial, and a Swan-Ganz catheter has been placed for better hemodynamic monitoring.

2. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient had an acute episode of dyspnea overnight, which may be related to increased fluids. However, he improved without diuresis. The low suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE) is due to the absence of hypoxia, and the negative lower extremity Doppler ultrasound (LENI) further reduces the likelihood of PE.

3. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are trending"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a medical history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of aortic stenosis and is now presenting with gram-positive cocci bacteremia, which may be related to streptococcal or enterococcal translocation. There is a concern for possible endocarditis, especially given her history of rheumatic heart disease.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Fever with a maximum temperature of 102.0Â°F (38.9Â°C)
- Tachycardia with a heart rate of 93 beats per minute
- Hypotension with blood pressure ranging from 107/65 mmHg to 71/37 mmHg
- Tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula
- Atrial fibrillation with an irregular heart rhythm
- Limited physical examination due to the patient's condition
- Elevated white blood cell count
- Elevated blood glucose levels
- Abnormal liver function tests
- Abnormal kidney function with acute kidney injury

   The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
   cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic
   root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
   are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis.
   Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is a
   minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
   Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
   the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No definite vegetations seen;
   severe aortic stenosis with severely reduced left ventricular ejection

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea on exertion and was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation of severe aortic stenosis. On admission, the patient had a high fever and was found to have bacteremia caused by Group B Streptococcus (GPC). The patient's condition has been complicated by sepsis, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hepatic dysfunction, and anemia.

The patient underwent several diagnostic tests, including a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), and an ultrasound of the legs. The TTE showed severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, severe aortic stenosis, mild mitral stenosis, and moderate mitral regurgitation. The TEE did not show any valvular vegetations but was limited by severe valvular sclerosis. A CT scan of the abdomen was also performed, which showed a colonic arteriovenous malformation (AVM) that was cauterized.

   root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
   are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis.
   Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is a
   minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis.
   Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
   the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No definite vegetations seen;
   severe aortic stenosis with severely reduced left ventricular ejection
   fraction; minimal mitral stenosis
   TEE: IMPRESSION: No apparent valvular vegetations. However, imaging of
   the aortic valve is limited by severe valvular sclerosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension.
- The patient was admitted to the hospital due to difficulty breathing on exertion and was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation of aortic stenosis.
- The patient developed fever and was found to have bacteremia caused by coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, which may be related to a recent C-scope procedure.
- The patient's condition is complicated by severe left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, severe aortic stenosis, minimal mitral stenosis, and pulmonary hypertension.
- Other medical complications include possible urinary tract infection (negative urine culture), liver failure with unclear etiology, acute kidney injury likely due to contrast nephropathy or acute tubular necrosis, anemia of unclear cause, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and back pain with possible infection.
- The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient requires vasopressors to maintain blood pressure and oxygen saturation.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, lactate, and troponin levels.
- Imaging studies reveal severe aortic st"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to dyspnea on exertion (DOE), which has been ongoing for several months. The patient presented with fevers, septic bacteremia caused by Coag positive staph, and septic shock.

Key findings from the progress note include:
1. The patient has severe aortic stenosis with severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF = 20-30%).
2. There is evidence of significant intraventricular mechanical dyssynchrony.
3. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
4. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is present.
5. No apparent valvular vegetations are observed in the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).
6. The patient has worsening liver function tests (LFTs) with an unclear etiology, likely superimposed element of congestive hepatopathy.

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He presented to the hospital with dyspnea on exertion and was transferred for further evaluation of aortic stenosis. On admission, he was found to have GPC bacteremia and septicemia, possibly related to a recent colonoscopy. He also has an increasing white blood cell count, indicating ongoing infection. The patient's hemodynamics are being supported with norepinephrine and dobutamine infusions. His ejection fraction is severely reduced at 20-30%. 

The patient has undergone a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), which revealed severe aortic stenosis with severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. There is also evidence of moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No vegetations were seen on the TEE, ruling out endocarditis. 

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, showing a hepatitis pattern of unclear etiology. This could be due to congestive hepatopathy or viral hepatitis.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the information:

- The patient has been diagnosed with chronic diastolic heart failure (CHF) and knowledge deficit.
- They are also experiencing acute respiratory failure, not ARDS.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation (AFIB), hypotension that is not in shock, and aortic stenosis.
- The patient has a fever, which is not of unknown origin.

The patient's vital signs show an elevated heart rate (85 bpm), low blood pressure (100/59 mmHg), and a slightly elevated body temperature (37.8 C). The patient is receiving dobutamine, lasix, norepinephrine, heparin sodium, and other medications.

The lab results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and troponin T. There are also elevated levels of liver enzymes (ALT/AST), amylase, lipase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening heart failure, exacerbation of respiratory failure, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer bleeding, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, administer appropriate medications, and provide adequate supportive care to manage these"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8Â°C (100.7Â°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 100/59 mmHg to 81/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and atrial fibrillation with a regularized rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals findings consistent with severe AS and MS, including a harsh systolic murmur at the base, fine crackles at the bases, and no wheezes or rhonchi. Neurological examination is normal, and the patient is awake, alert, and oriented to time, place, and person.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, increased lactate levels, elevated liver enzymes"

   I have reviewed the progress note above by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5621**] on [**2114-4-26**]
   and agree with the documentation of the clinical course over the past
   24 hours.  The physical examination documented is consistent with my
   examination today and I was present for the pertinent aspects of the
   examination by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5621**].  His staph sepsis is responding to
   antibiotic therapy and his hemodynamics are improving substantially.
   His INR is improving consistent with improvement of his [**Last Name (STitle) 1613**] liver.
   The plan today is continued hemodynamic support with dobutamine and
   weaning of the levophed in order to support further continued diuresis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with dyspnea on exertion, transferred for further evaluation of aortic stenosis, and now presents with gram-positive cocci bacteremia and septic shock.

The patient remains afebrile with decreasing white blood cell count. His perfusion is improving, but he still requires substantial pressor support. A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed to monitor his hemodynamics, revealing volume overload based on the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 36 mmHg. The central venous pressure (CVP) improved with diuresis overnight. The plan includes weaning levophed as able to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 mmHg, uptitration of dobutamine as tolerated by heart rate to maintain superior vena oxygen saturation (ScvO2) >70%, maintaining CVP between 7-30 mmHg, maintaining hematocrit (Hct) >30%, rewedge today, and continue vancomycin.

Additional medical complications include liver failure with elevated liver enzymes, acute on chronic systolic heart failure with ongoing volume overload, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of aortic stenosis and is now presenting with infective endocarditis caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a low blood pressure, low cardiac output, and is dependent on vasopressors and inotropic support.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has an irregularly irregular rhythm with a rapid ventricular response.
3. Severe aortic stenosis: The patient has a significant narrowing of the aortic valve, which is causing symptoms of heart failure.
4. Rheumatic mitral stenosis: The patient has a narrowing of the mitral valve due to previous rheumatic fever.
5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has well-controlled diabetes and is on basal and short-acting insulin.
6. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient has chronic airflow limitation and is on albuterol nebs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted for further evaluation of aortic stenosis but developed septic shock due to MSSA bacteremia. The patient remains afebrile with decreasing white count and improving perfusion. He is volume overloaded based on his PCWP of 36 and CVP improved with diuresis overnight. The patient is currently on dobutamine and lasix infusions and is being weaned off levophed. Swan-Ganz catheter was placed yesterday to better monitor hemodynamics. The patient's liver function tests are still trending up with a pattern suggestive of hepatitis, possibly related to congestive hepatopathy. Surgical repair of aortic stenosis may be considered after clearing the infection. The patient also has acute on chronic systolic heart failure with symptoms of dyspnea overnight that improved without diuresis. He has acute episodes of COPD, pulmonary hypertension, and anxiety, as well as anxiety-related dyspnea. The patient's abdominal pain has improved, and there is no evidence of perforation or source of pain on RUQ ultrasound. He has acute renal failure possibly due to ATN or contrast nephropathy.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral regurgitation, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of AS and is now presenting with gram-positive cocci bacteremia, likely caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The patient has septic shock and is requiring vasopressors for hemodynamic support.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI) with an elevated creatinine level, liver dysfunction with elevated liver enzymes, anemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and hyperlipidemia. He also has back pain, which is suspicious for possible infection given his bacteremia and fever.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's condition requires close monitoring of hemodynamics, including CVP, PCWP, and ScvO2. Pressors should be titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg and ScvO2 above 70%. A Swan-Ganz catheter should be placed for better hemodynamic monitoring. The goal is to maintain CVP between 7-30 mmHg, H"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old woman with a medical history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of AS and now presents with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and septic shock.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8Â°C (100.7Â°F), heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 100/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. She is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) of 28/78 mmHg, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 36 mmHg. Her cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI) are 5.4 L/min and 2.3 L/min/m2, respectively. The mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of aortic stenosis and is now presenting with gastrointestinal perforation complicated by bacteremia and septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient remains dependent on significant pressor support, indicating ongoing cardiogenic shock. There is evidence of volume overload based on clinical examination and rising pulmonary pressures.
2. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which is being treated with nafcillin. Serial blood cultures are pending, and the patient's white blood cell count is decreasing.
3. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are stable, with decreasing ALT levels. He has shock liver and no evidence of cholangitis or cholecystitis on abdominal ultrasound.
4. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient appears to be volume overloaded and is experiencing symptoms of congestive heart failure.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 5621**] from [**2114-4-28**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Comfortable, talking on cellphone.  Still on low dose levophed and
   dobutamine.  On antibiotics for MSSA.
   Medical Decision Making
   Continue antibiotics, wean off pressors.
   Discussed briefly long term mgmt with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5447**] of CT surgery:   High
   risk for AVR with severe pulm HTN.
   [**Month (only) 11**] need to bring him back after acute illness to cath lab and if PA
   pressures still high, consider aortic valvuloplasty.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to dyspnea on exertion, transferred for further evaluation of aortic stenosis, and now presents with gram-positive cocci bacteremia and septic shock.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is still requiring significant pressor support, indicating ongoing cardiogenic shock. His pulmonary artery pressures are rising, suggesting volume overload.
2. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which is being treated with nafcillin. His white blood cell count is decreasing, suggesting improvement.
3. Liver Failure: The patient has evidence of liver failure, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. A liver ultrasound did not reveal any cholangitis or cholecystitis.
4. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient appears to be volume overloaded, and diuresis has been initiated.
5. ARF: The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) likely due to shock and contrast nephropathy. His urine output is improving, and diuretics have been started.
6. Anemia: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea on exertion and was transferred for further evaluation of AS. The patient is now presenting with MSSA bacteremia and septicemia. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Septicemia caused by MSSA bacteremia: The patient remains afebrile with decreasing white count. His perfusion is improving as indicated by ScvO2. However, he still requires substantial pressor support. A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed yesterday, revealing volume overload based on the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 36. The central venous pressure (CVP) has improved with diuresis overnight. The plan includes weaning off levophed as able to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65, uptitrating dobutamine as tolerated to maintain ScvO2 >70%, maintaining CVP >7-30 mmHg, maintaining hematocrit (Hct) >30%, rewedge today, continuing vancomycin, obtaining additional information regarding prior history of MRSA infection, and serial blood cultures.

","The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's blood cultures have identified MSSA, and he has been started on vancomycin and nafcillin. The patient has diuresed over 3.5L at 1500 with MAP's in the high 50-60's and was unable to wean off levophed. Lasix was held, and the patient received 250cc IVF at 2104, with another 250cc IVF at 2300. The patient's liver enzyme levels are likely indicative of shock liver, and an abdominal ultrasound with doppler is recommended along with supportive care. The patient also has trouble weaning levophed, likely due to intravascular volume depletion from overdiuresis.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic diastolic heart failure, knowledge deficit, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), aortic stenosis, hypotension (not in shock), fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin), and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.4Â°F), blood pressure of 97/56mmHg, heart rate of 86 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on norepineph"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral valve disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea on exertion and transferred for further evaluation of aortic stenosis. Currently, he is in the ICU with MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and signs of volume overload. The patient's blood cultures showed MSSA, and he was started on vancomycin and nafcillin. He received diuresis of >3.5L and was unable to wean off levophed. The patient's liver function tests are trending up, suggesting possible liver failure, likely due to congestive hepatopathy. He also has acute on chronic systolic heart failure, chronic dyspnea with multifactorial causes, resolved abdominal pain, acute renal failure likely secondary to ATN with contrast nephropathy, anemia, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation with a decreased INR, and back pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has MSSA bacteremia and septic shock, indicating a serious infection that requires immediate attention and management.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's acute on chronic systolic heart failure and severe aortic stenosis increase the risk of cardiac complications, including"

   white count. Perfusion slightly worse by ScvO2 (58
49 today) and still
   w/ pressor requirement; Hct @ goal (30). Swan in place for hemodynamic
   monitoring; PAP are still high but MAPs are stable
   - wean levophed as able to maintain MAP >65
   - uptitrate Dobutamine as tolerated by heart rate (yesterday in 80s) to
   maintain ScvO2>70% (down today)
   - maintain CVP>[**7-30**], improved since yesterday with nearly 3L of IVF
   - maintain Hct>30%

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral valve disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of AS and now presents with MSSA bacteremia and septic shock. The patient's current condition includes atrial fibrillation, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, acute renal failure (ATN), anemia, thrombocytopenia, and back pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient remains afebrile with decreasing white blood cell count, indicating improvement. However, perfusion is slightly worse, as indicated by ScvO2 (58% today) and the patient still requires pressor support. The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) is stable, but pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) are still high. The plan is to wean levophed as able to maintain MAP >65, uptitrate dobutamine as tolerated by heart rate to maintain ScvO2 >70%, maintain central venous pressure (CVP) >7-30, maintain hematocrit (Hct) >30%, and reassess volume status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted for evaluation of aortic stenosis and now presents with gram-positive cocci bacteremia and septic shock. The patient has been on multiple medications, including nafcillin, dobutamine, levophed, lasix, and heparin. He is currently in cardiogenic shock and appears to be volume overloaded based on clinical examination and rising pulmonary pressures. The patient also has liver failure, acute kidney injury, anemia, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, back pain, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and is receiving prophylactic treatments for DVT and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is still requiring significant pressor support, indicating ongoing cardiogenic shock. Weaning off levophed may be challenging due to the patient's volume overload and high pulmonary artery pressures.
2. MSSA bacteremia: Although the patient's white blood cell count is decreasing, MSSA bacteremia needs to be monitored closely, and serial blood cultures should be obtained.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to dyspnea on exertion, transferred for further evaluation of aortic stenosis, and now presents with gastrointestinal perforation (GPC) bacteremia and septic shock.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25%, severe aortic stenosis, and rheumatic mitral stenosis. These conditions contribute to the development of cardiogenic shock. The levophed infusion has been discontinued, and the patient will be weaned off it as tolerated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. Lasix will be started to promote urine output of 100-150 cc/hr, and dobutamine will be continued at the current rate to support cardiac output.

2. MSSA bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which requires ongoing treatment with nafcillin. The white blood cell count is stable, and the patient remains afebrile.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to dyspnea on exertion and was transferred for further evaluation of aortic stenosis. Currently, the patient is being treated for MSSA bacteremia and septic shock, as well as cardiogenic shock.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and dilated cardiomyopathy, which increases the risk of cardiogenic shock. The dobutamine infusion is being continued to maintain cardiac index (CI) > 2.5, and lasix gtt is being titrated to maintain urine output (UOP) > 100-150cc/hr.

2. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient has MSSA bacteremia of unclear source, and there is a concern for ongoing infection as indicated by the surveillance cultures being negative. The nafcillin antibiotic is being continued for a 2-week course, and levophed is being weaned to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65.

3. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests ("

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 25%), severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of aortic stenosis and is now presenting with bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and septic shock.

The patient continues to require pressor support to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg. Dobutamine is being used to support cardiac output, and Lasix is being given to achieve a urine output of 100-150 cc/hr. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with a stable heart rate of 90-100 beats per minute.

Regarding potential medical complications, the patient has a history of liver failure, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes. The patient's INR is stable, suggesting that synthetic function is currently intact. However, the patient should be monitored closely for any signs of hepatic dysfunction.

The patient also has acute kidney injury (AKI), likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of septic shock and contrast nephropathy. The patient is producing a significant amount"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of aortic stenosis and now presents with gram-positive cocci bacteremia and septic shock. The patient has a history of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to atrial fibrillation (AF), liver failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and anemia. He is currently receiving dobutamine and lasix for cardiogenic shock, nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia, and other medications for his various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. The use of dobutamine and lasix may help support cardiac output, but careful monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is essential to prevent further complications.

2. MSSA bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which is a serious infection caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Continuing nafcillin therapy and monitoring blood cultures are important to prevent the spread of infection and identify any antibiotic resistance.

3. Liver failure:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of septic/cardiogenic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including sepsis without organ dysfunction, heart failure (diastolic), chronic CHF, respiratory failure (acute), atrial fibrillation, hypotension, aortic stenosis, fever, and knowledge deficit.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 89/68 mmHg to 73/47 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 96%.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), decreased platelet count (Plt), increased creatinine (Cr), elevated glucose levels, prolonged prothrombin time (PT)/activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT)/international normalized ratio (INR), elevated cardiac enzymes (CK/CKMB/Troponin-T), and abnormal liver function tests (ALT/AST/Alk Phos/T Bili).

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to dyspnea on exertion, transferred for further evaluation of aortic stenosis, and now presents with gram-positive cocci bacteremia and septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient appears to be volume overloaded based on the clinical exam and rising pulmonary pressures with a pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (PAD) of 34 this morning. Levophed was discontinued this AM, and it will be monitored whether the patient still requires significant pressure support. The plan is to wean levophed as tolerated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 after diuresis.
2. MSSA bacteremia: The patient remains afebrile with a stable white blood cell count. It is important to maintain hematocrit (Hct) >30%, continue nafcillin to complete a 2-week course, and follow up with serial blood cultures (pending).
3. Liver failure: Liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, and the patient has been diagnosed with shock liver by the liver team. An ultrasound was negative for cholangitis or cholec"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of septic/cardiogenic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including sepsis without organ dysfunction, heart failure (diastolic), chronic, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), atrial fibrillation, hypotension (not shock), aortic stenosis, fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin), and knowledge deficit.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 89/68 mmHg, heart rate of 91 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight is 121.1 kg, and height is 69 inches.

The patient has been receiving various medications and infusions, including furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium, and dobutamine. The patient also has multiple lines, including a PA catheter inserted on 04/25/2114 at 03:00 PM.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 14.4 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 125 mg/dL, increased creatinine level of 2.0, elevated lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L, and elevated D-dimer level of [**Numeric Identifier 5835**] ng/mL.

The patient's blood cultures were positive on 04/26/2114 at 04:30 AM, 04:55 AM, 01:54 PM, and 10:16 PM. The patient's platelet count has been falling over time, and there is a suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) based on the 4Ts score of [**3-25**].

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening septic/cardiogenic shock, progression of heart failure, development of organ dysfunction, further decrease in platelet count leading to bleeding complications, and potential adverse effects from medications and interventions.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of their vital signs, fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and ongoing evaluation of their respiratory status. Prompt intervention may be necessary to address any complications that may arise."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted for dyspnea on exertion and transferred for further evaluation of aortic stenosis. The patient is now diagnosed with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is currently experiencing cardiogenic shock, which is being managed by titrating dobutamine to maintain cardiac index (CI) >2.5, adjusting lasix infusion to achieve urine output (UOP) of 100-150 cc/hr, and monitoring PCWP, ScvO2, CI, and SVR every 8 hours. Levophed should be weaned as tolerated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 after diuresis, and Hct should be maintained >30%.

2. Acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's acute on chronic CHF is related to fluid resuscitation for sepsis. Management includes lasix infusion with lasix bolus to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters within 24 hours and consideration of a wedge pressure if able"

   I have reviewed the daily progress note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5621**] on [**4-29**]. [**2113**]
   and I agree with the documentation of the events over the past 24
   hours.  I also concur with the noted physical examination and was
   present during the assessment of its components.  The assessment and
   treatment plan as outlined above accurately reflect our plans for
   therapy over the next 24 hours.   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is symptomatically improved
   over the past 24 hours.  He still complains of back pain but his
   dyspnea is better.  His physical examination shows better rate control
   of his atrial fibrillation on amiodarone and improved lung fields.  His
   pulmonary artery pressures remain elevated and we will continue
   diuresis with dobutamine ionotropic support.  His LFTs are also
   improving.  We have consulted our cardiac surgery colleagues and will
   review the options of balloon valvuloplasty if this is needed to assess
   the response to his pulmonary hypertension to aortic valve dilation
   after completion of his treatment for staph sepsis.  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3139**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5279**], MD

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension.
- The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of aortic stenosis and is currently experiencing multi-system organ dysfunction.
- The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, MSSA bacteremia of unclear source, cardiogenic shock, septic shock, liver failure, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, anemia, and rate-related aberrancy.
- The patient's medical history includes a recent gastrointestinal bleed caused by colonic arteriovenous malformation, which was cauterized.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 94/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's heart function is compromised due to severe aortic stenosis and rheumatic mitral stenosis. There is a risk of further deterioration in cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.
2. Septic Shock: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which can lead to septic shock."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, and knowledge deficit. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.6Â°C (96.1Â°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 94/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and a heart rhythm of atrial fibrillation. The patient is receiving various medications and infusions, including heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and dobutamine.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction. This condition can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock if not properly managed.

2. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure. Fluid overload or inadequate cardiac output can lead to worsening heart failure symptoms and potentially life-threatening complications such as pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of platelet levels and cautious use of anticoagulant medications are necessary to prevent bleeding events.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure. If not treated promptly and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral valve disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of aortic stenosis and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is already experiencing cardiogenic shock, which requires close monitoring and management with dobutamine to maintain cardiac index (CI) >2.5, titration of lasix to achieve urine output (UOP) of 100-150 cc/hr, and weaning of levophed as tolerated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 mmHg after diuresis.
2. Acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's acute CHF is related to fluid resuscitation for sepsis and requires diuresis with lasix to achieve negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters within 24 hours.
3. MSSA bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, likely acquired during hospitalization, and requires completion of a 2-week course of nafcillin.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, suggesting possible liver failure. A liver consult"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension (pHTN).
- The patient was admitted for dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and evaluation of AS. He is now being treated for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.
- The patient's current medical conditions include cardiogenic shock, acute on chronic heart failure (CHF) due to fluid resuscitation for sepsis, MSSA bacteremia, liver failure, hyperbilirubinemia, nausea, thrombocytopenia, aortic stenosis, acute renal failure (ARF), anemia, atrial fibrillation (AFib), low back pain, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity.
- The patient has had multiple interventions including cardiac catheterization, administration of nafcillin, dobutamine, lasix, and heparin.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (T) 36.6Â°C, heart rate (HR) 103 bpm, blood pressure (BP) 82/51 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) 96%, and atrial fibrillation.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated blood glucose levels, elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests.
- The patient has been placed on various medications including nafcillin, dobutamine, lasix, ranitidine, furosemide, and morphine sulfate.
- The patient's current disposition is critical care unit (CCU) with full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is already experiencing cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires close monitoring and management.
2. Acute on chronic CHF: The patient has acute on chronic CHF due to fluid resuscitation for sepsis. This condition needs to be closely monitored to prevent further deterioration.
3. MSSA bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which needs to be treated appropriately to prevent complications such as septic shock and endocarditis.
4. Liver failure: The patient is showing signs of liver failure, which may be multifactorial in origin. Close monitoring of liver function tests and appropriate management are necessary.
5. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has hyperbilirubinemia with direct bilirubin elevation."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral valve stenosis (MS), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted for evaluation of AS and now presents with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is stable but requires continuous dobutamine infusion to maintain cardiac index (CI) above 2.5. Lasix should be titrated to achieve urine output (UOP) of 100-150 cc/hr and a negative fluid balance of 1 L within 24 hours. Repeat measurements of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), mixed venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), CI, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) should be done every 8 hours. Levophed should be discontinued, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be maintained above 60 mmHg.

2. Acute on Chronic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's CHF is related to fluid resuscitation for sepsis. Lasix should be continued to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1-2 L"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C (97.1 F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 82/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and an irregular heart rhythm of atrial fibrillation. The patient's weight is 121.1 kg, and their height is 69 inches. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, some potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema, renal dysfunction, and cardiogenic shock.

2. Infection: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, indicating an ongoing infection in the body. This can progress to septic shock if not appropriately managed.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute thrombocytopenia, which means their platelet count is low. This can increase the risk of bleeding and bruising.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of aortic stenosis and is now being treated for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is currently stable, but close monitoring of cardiac output and diuresis is necessary. Dobutamine will be continued at 7.5mg/hour to maintain cardiac index (CI) >2.5.
2. Acute on Chronic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): Due to fluid resuscitation for sepsis, the patient may develop acute on chronic CHF. Lasix will be given through a continuous infusion with a goal of negative 1 liter urine output per hour.
3. MSSA Bacteremia: The source of MSSA bacteremia is unclear, so surveillance cultures will be negative. Nafcillin will be continued for a total of 2 weeks.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, and a liver consult has been requested"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral valve disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea on exertion and transferred for further evaluation of aortic stenosis. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has severe aortic stenosis and dilated cardiomyopathy, which may lead to cardiogenic shock. He is being supported with dobutamine to maintain cardiac output and diuresis.
2. Acute on Chronic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's fluid resuscitation for sepsis has worsened his CHF. Lasix is being titrated to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1 liter within 24 hours.
3. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which could be the source of his septic shock. He is being treated with nafcillin.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating possible liver failure. A liver consult has been requested, and hepatotoxic medications are being avoided.
5. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has elevated bilirubin levels, but the source is unclear. An ultrasound did not show evidence of"

He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a nasogastric tube in place. His vital signs are stable, but he has been experiencing some complications, such as ileus and dark brown stool. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of cardiac enzymes, liver enzymes, and lactate. His platelet count is low, and he has a prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. The patient's blood cultures grew nafcillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's rising serum creatinine levels indicate a decline in renal function, which could progress to AKI if not managed appropriately.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of respiratory infection is necessary.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea on exertion and was transferred for further evaluation of aortic stenosis. The patient is now presenting with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 95/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with an irregularly irregular rhythm. Physical examination reveals fine crackles at the lung bases, no wheezes or rhonchi, and warm dry extremities with 1+ lower extremity edema to midcalves bilaterally.

Laboratory findings include a white blood cell count of 13.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, platelet count of 92 K/uL, creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, blood glucose of 125 mg/dL, and liver function tests showing elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (633 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (131 U/L). Other lab results include elevated D-dimer levels and lactate dehydrogenase (730 IU/L).

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient is stable off of Levophed for over 24 hours. Dobutamine should be decreased to maintain cardiac index (CI) > 2.5, and closely monitor cardiac output and diuresis. Recheck mean arterial pressure (MAP) and CI in one hour, and continue to hold Levophed.

2. Acute on chronic heart failure (CHF): This is related to fluid resuscitation for sepsis. Goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance of 400-500 mL over the next 24 hours. Watch output closely to avoid exacerbating cardiogenic shock, and repeat pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), mixed venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), CI, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) every 8 hours.

3. Atrial fibrillation (A-fib): The patient is not symptomatic, and the heart rate is well-controlled. Started on digoxin yesterday with a loading dose, and will switch to maintenance dose afterward. Consider cardioversion when other issues improve, likely requiring three weeks of therapeutic INR before proceeding. Consider biventricular pacing.

4. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSS"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, and aortic stenosis. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has been on dobutamine, furosemide, and heparin sodium infusions. His vital signs are relatively stable with a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/51 mmHg to 99/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals fine crackles at the lung bases, no wheezes or rhonchi, and 1+ lower extremity edema. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, liver enzymes, lactate, and D-dimer levels. The patient has also shown signs of constipation and ileus, for which senna, colace, and lactulose have been started. The patient's pain is being managed with tramadol, and he is passing flatus. He has refused the NG tube. The plan is to hold narcotics and treat conservatively for now. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction. It is crucial to monitor his vital signs and lab results closely for any signs of deterioration or progression of sepsis.
2. Respiratory"

   over the past 24 hours.  The physical findings are consistent with my
   examination today.   His staph sepsis is responding to treatment but he
   remains on pressure support for his aortic stenosis and pulmonary
   hypertension.    Balloon valvuloplasty will be considered to improve
   his forward cardiac output and assess the reduction in his PA
   pressures.  The assessment and plan accurately describe our course for

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M w/ nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS,
   rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH with DOE,
   transferred for further evaluation of AS, now with MSSA bacteremia,
   septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: Yesterday we were able to wean the patient
   completely off dobutamine; he maintained MAPs in 70s and his calculated
   CI was 1.9, which is evidence that he is getting over the
   septic/cardiogenic shock. Therefore, from a hemodynamic standpoint
   there is no longer need for his swan-ganz and cordis. However, we will
   keep the swan-ganz and cordis in place at this time for two reasons:
   first, pulmonary will be coming by to evaluate his pulmonary
   hypertension and they may need the swan-ganz catheter to do their NO
   trial; second, the cordis is being currently used for venous access
   because he has very difficult-to-access peripheral veins. Therefore, we
   will need to get a PICC placed before the cordis can be removed.
   - Goal MAPs >65
   - switch lasix gtt to lasix bolus 90mg Q6H, goal neg -1L to -2L x 24
   hrs; be careful not to overdiurese him,
   - maintain Hct>30%
   - PICC line placement
   - Pulmonary consult to evaluate pulmonary hypertension and possible use
   of sildenafil
   .
   # Acute on chronic CHF
 Related to fluid resuscitation for sepsis.
   -Switch to lasix bolus, goal neg 1-2L for 24hours.
   -Watch output closely, ensuring that he is not much more than 2 L
   negative in 24 hours, because getting too much fluid off of him would
   result in decreased preload leading to decreased cardiac output, and
   given his aortic stenosis he might not be able to maintain his MAPs.
   -f/u PM lytes (2pm)
   .
   # A fib: Not symptomatic. Rate well controlled in the 80s on digoxin.
   Will potentially need cardioversion in the future, and it might even
   improve his cardiac output. If we decide to do cardioversion sooner
   than 3 weeks, we may need an echo to check for clot to prevent stroke.
   - con

   - switch to PO digoxin
   - f/u digoxin level tomorrow in AM

   -cont nafcillin to complete a 2 week course (day #1=[**2114-4-24**], day
   #14=[**2114-5-8**])
   .
   #Liver failure. The transaminitis from before is now resolving, was
   likely due to shock liver given all findings. However, his INR is still
   high at 2.1, so we will recheck LFTs tomorrow in the morning.
   - recheck LFTs.
   -avoid hepatotoxic medications
   -tylenol 2gm max/24 hrs

   #Hyperbilirubinemia
 Direct. Source unclear. Alkaline phosphatase not
   elevated. RUQ ultrasound on admission without evidence of
   cholecystitis. Could this be [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - Monitor daily
   #Nausea/Vomiting/Conspitation/Diarrhea. The patient is no longer
   experiencing n/v and his constipation is resolved with stopping opioid
   analgesic and starting aggressive bowel regimen. In fact, now he has
   diarrhea. He has a negative c. diff.
   - Decrease bowel regimen to reduce diarrhea.
   - do a rectal to check for impaction
   #AS
 His acute issues have now resolved and he will be a candidate for
   treatment of AS.
   - Valvuloplasty with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5279**] on Friday PM. This may help decrease the
   pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   #ARF
 Although his Cr is 1.7, it is stable. Most likely his ARF is
   related not only to lasix, but also due to renal vein congestion
   preventing full and proper blood flow out of the kidney. As his volume
   status improves and he becomes less volume overloaded and as we wean
   the lasix, we can expect to see his Cr trend down.
   - Back-off on Lasix if Cr returns >2.0, otherwise continue lasix now in
   boluses.
   - Cont trend UOP, Cr
   - Urine lytes showed he was pre-renal with FE BUN 28.4 (less than the
   cut off of 30-35).

   - On tramadol for this, helping a little bit but not completely.
   - limit tylenol
   - consider imaging of back if pain worsens or neuro status changes
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia. His thrombocytopenia was likely a component of
   shock, liver failure, and bone marrow suppression from his bacteremia.
   It is now resolving and platelets are actually increasing today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension admitted to the ICU for further evaluation of AS. The patient presented with dobutamine-responsive cardiogenic shock and MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

The patient's hemodynamic parameters have improved, and he has been weaned off dobutamine. His mean arterial pressure (MAP) is in the 70s, and his cardiac index (CI) is 1.9, indicating that he is recovering from septic/cardiogenic shock. However, the patient still requires hemodynamic monitoring, and the swan-ganz and cordis catheters will be kept in place for further evaluation and access.

The patient's pulmonary edema has significantly improved, and his bowel function has normalized. He no longer experiences nausea, vomiting, or constipation but now has diarrhea. The patient's atrial fibrillation (A-fib) is well-controlled on digoxin, but he may require cardioversion in the future to potentially improve his cardiac output. The source of MSSA bacteremia is unclear, and the patient will continue receiving nafcillin for a two-week course.

   64 M w/ nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS,
   rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH with DOE,
   transferred for further evaluation of AS, now with MSSA bacteremia,
   septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: Yesterday we were able to wean the patient
   completely off dobutamine; he maintained MAPs in 70s and his calculated
   CI was 1.9, which is evidence that he is getting over the
   septic/cardiogenic shock. Therefore, from a hemodynamic standpoint
   there is no longer need for his swan-ganz and cordis. However, we will
   keep the swan-ganz and cordis in place at this time for two reasons:
   first, pulmonary will be coming by to evaluate his pulmonary
   hypertension and they may need the swan-ganz catheter to do their NO
   trial; second, the cordis is being currently used for venous access
   because he has very difficult-to-access peripheral veins. Therefore, we
   will need to get a PICC placed before the cordis can be removed.
   - Goal MAPs >65
   - switch lasix gtt to lasix bolus 90mg Q6H, goal neg -1L to -2L x 24
   hrs; be careful not to overdiurese him,
   - maintain Hct>30%
   - PICC line placement
   - Pulmonary consult to evaluate pulmonary hypertension and possible use
   of sildenafil
   .
   # Acute on chronic CHF
 Related to fluid resuscitation for sepsis.
   -Switch to lasix bolus, goal neg 1-2L for 24hours.
   -Watch output closely, ensuring that he is not much more than 2 L
   negative in 24 hours, because getting too much fluid off of him would
   result in decreased preload leading to decreased cardiac output, and
   given his aortic stenosis he might not be able to maintain his MAPs.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of aortic stenosis and is now being treated for MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/60 mmHg to 116/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on room air, and atrial fibrillation as the heart rhythm. The patient's weight is 121.1 kg, and height is 69 inches.

The patient's physical examination reveals a crescendo/decrescendo murmur, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, crackles at the lower lung fields bilaterally, and trace pitting edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels. The patient's platelet count is stable, and he has mild hyperkalemia. Renal function tests indicate acute kidney injury (AKI), possibly due to septic shock and contrast nephropathy.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), famotidine (Pepcid), and nafcillin for MSSA bacteremia. He is also on maintenance doses of digoxin for atrial fibrillation and basal subcutaneous insulin for diabetes mellitus. Other medications include statins for hyperlipidemia and low-sodium diet for nutrition.

The patient's care plan includes weaning off dobutamine, maintaining mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 65, switching Lasix from a continuous infusion to bolus dosing, ensuring negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters within 24 hours, and monitoring for signs of overdiuresis. A pulmonary consult has been requested to evaluate pulmonary hypertension and potential use of sildenafil. The patient's aortic stenosis requires surgical repair, but he needs to clear the infection before consideration for surgery. A computed tomography (CT) consult has been requested.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac function may deteriorate, leading to decreased cardiac output and hypotension.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is already impaired, and further deterioration may occur due to ongoing sepsis, use of nephrotoxic drugs, or inadequate fluid management.
3. Infection: The patient has MSSA bacteremia and may develop further infections, especially if immunosuppressive medications are used.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating potential liver dysfunction. Continued monitoring and supportive care are necessary.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable, but there is a low-intermediate probability of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Monitoring platelet counts and considering alternative anticoagulation may be needed.
6. Anemia: The patient has a stable hemoglobin level, but ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and chronic lumbar back disease may contribute to anemia. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels is recommended.
7. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has elevated bilirubin levels, and the source needs to be identified. Monitoring liver function tests and considering additional investigations, such as imaging, may be necessary.
8. Pulmonary complications: The patient's COPD and OSA put him at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or exacerbations of his pre-existing lung diseases.
9. Contrast-induced nephropathy: The patient received contrast during imaging, which may have contributed to AKI. Further evaluation"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M w/ nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS,
   rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH with DOE,
   transferred for further evaluation of AS, now with MSSA bacteremia,
   septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: Yesterday we were able to wean the patient
   completely off dobutamine; he maintained MAPs in 70s and his calculated
   CI was 1.9, which is evidence that he is getting over the
   septic/cardiogenic shock. Therefore, from a hemodynamic standpoint
   there is no longer need for his swan-ganz and cordis. However, we will
   keep the swan-ganz and cordis in place at this time for two reasons:
   first, pulmonary will be coming by to evaluate his pulmonary
   hypertension and they may need the swan-ganz catheter to do their NO
   trial; second, the cordis is being currently used for venous access
   because he has very difficult-to-access peripheral veins. Therefore, we
   will need to get a PICC placed before the cordis can be removed.
   - Goal MAPs >65
   - switch lasix gtt to lasix bolus 90mg Q6H, goal neg -1L to -2L x 24
   hrs; be careful not to overdiurese him,
   - maintain Hct>30%
   - PICC line placement
   - Pulmonary consult to evaluate pulmonary hypertension and possible use
   of sildenafil
   .
   # Acute on chronic CHF
 Related to fluid resuscitation for sepsis.
   -Switch to lasix bolus, goal neg 1-2L for 24hours.
   -Watch output closely, ensuring that he is not much more than 2 L
   negative in 24 hours, because getting too much fluid off of him would
   result in decreased preload leading to decreased cardiac output, and
   given his aortic stenosis he might not be able to maintain his MAPs.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of aortic stenosis and is currently being treated for MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

The patient has shown improvement in hemodynamics, as he was able to wean off dobutamine and maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) in the 70s and a calculated cardiac index (CI) of 1.9, indicating better cardiac output. However, the patient still requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: Although the patient has shown improvement, there is still a need for close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters, and the patient may require continued support with medications like digoxin and careful fluid management.

2. Acute on Chronic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure, and recent fluid resuscitation for sepsis has resulted in acute exacerbation. It is important to balance fluid administration to prevent both under-resuscitation and over-resuscitation, which could lead to decreased preload and cardiac output.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M w/ nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS,
   rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH with DOE,
   transferred for further evaluation of AS, now with MSSA bacteremia,
   septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: Yesterday we were able to wean the patient
   completely off dobutamine; he maintained MAPs in 70s and his calculated
   CI was 1.9, which is evidence that he is getting over the
   septic/cardiogenic shock. Therefore, from a hemodynamic standpoint
   there is no longer need for his swan-ganz and cordis. However, we will
   keep the swan-ganz and cordis in place at this time for two reasons:
   first, pulmonary will be coming by to evaluate his pulmonary
   hypertension and they may need the swan-ganz catheter to do their NO
   trial; second, the cordis is being currently used for venous access
   because he has very difficult-to-access peripheral veins. Therefore, we
   will need to get a PICC placed before the cordis can be removed.
   - Goal MAPs >65
   - switch lasix gtt to lasix bolus 90mg Q6H, goal neg -1L to -2L x 24
   hrs; be careful not to overdiurese him,
   - maintain Hct>30%
   - PICC line placement
   - Pulmonary consult to evaluate pulmonary hypertension and possible use
   of sildenafil
   .
   # Acute on chronic CHF
 Related to fluid resuscitation for sepsis.
   -Switch to lasix bolus, goal neg 1-2L for 24hours.
   -Watch output closely, ensuring that he is not much more than 2 L
   negative in 24 hours, because getting too much fluid off of him would
   result in decreased preload leading to decreased cardiac output, and
   given his aortic stenosis he might not be able to maintain his MAPs.

   # A fib: Not symptomatic. Rate well controlled in the 80s on digoxin.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted with dyspnea on exertion and evaluated for severe AS. He now presents with MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient had cardiogenic shock, but he is improving as evidenced by being able to wean off dobutamine and maintaining mean arterial pressures (MAPs) in the 70s and a calculated cardiac index (CI) of 1.9.

2. Acute on Chronic Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has acute exacerbation of chronic CHF related to fluid resuscitation for sepsis. The goal is to achieve negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters in 24 hours without overdiuresis.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has AF with a well-controlled heart rate in the 80s on digoxin. There is a potential need for cardioversion in the future, which may improve cardiac output. An echocardiogram will be necessary to check for clot before cardioversion to prevent stroke.

   rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH with DOE,
   transferred for further evaluation of AS, now with MSSA bacteremia,
   septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: Yesterday we were able to wean the patient
   completely off dobutamine; he maintained MAPs in 70s and his calculated
   CI was 1.9, which is evidence that he is getting over the
   septic/cardiogenic shock. Therefore, from a hemodynamic standpoint
   there is no longer need for his swan-ganz and cordis. However, we will
   keep the swan-ganz and cordis in place at this time for two reasons:
   first, pulmonary will be coming by to evaluate his pulmonary
   hypertension and they may need the swan-ganz catheter to do their NO
   trial; second, the cordis is being currently used for venous access
   because he has very difficult-to-access peripheral veins. Therefore, we
   will need to get a PICC placed before the cordis can be removed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral valve disease (MS), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension admitted to the ICU for further evaluation of AS. He presented with dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and was transferred from another hospital due to MSSA bacteremia and cardiogenic shock.

The patient has shown improvement over the past 24 hours, with successful weaning off dobutamine and maintaining mean arterial pressures (MAPs) in the 70s and a calculated cardiac index (CI) of 1.9. This suggests that he is recovering from septic and cardiogenic shock. However, the patient still requires hemodynamic monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter (swan-ganz) and cordis for venous access due to difficult-to-access peripheral veins. A PICC line placement is planned.

The patient's current medical issues include acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) related to fluid resuscitation for sepsis, atrial fibrillation (AF) well-controlled with digoxin, MSSA bacteremia treated with nafcillin, liver failure multifactorial in origin, hyperbilirubinemia with unclear source, nausea possibly due to medication side effects or ileus, thromb"

   64 M w/ nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS,
   rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH with DOE,
   transferred for further evaluation of AS, now with MSSA bacteremia,
   septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: Yesterday we were able to wean the patient
   completely off dobutamine; he maintained MAPs in 70s and his calculated
   CI was 1.9, which is evidence that he is getting over the
   septic/cardiogenic shock. Therefore, from a hemodynamic standpoint
   there is no longer need for his swan-ganz and cordis. However, we will
   keep the swan-ganz and cordis in place at this time for two reasons:
   first, pulmonary will be coming by to evaluate his pulmonary
   hypertension and they may need the swan-ganz catheter to do their NO
   trial; second, the cordis is being currently used for venous access
   because he has very difficult-to-access peripheral veins. Therefore, we
   will need to get a PICC placed before the cordis can be removed.
   - Goal MAPs >65
   - switch lasix gtt to lasix bolus 90mg Q6H, goal neg -1L to -2L x 24
   hrs; be careful not to overdiurese him,
   - maintain Hct>30%
   - PICC line placement
   - Pulmonary consult to evaluate pulmonary hypertension and possible use
   of sildenafil
   .
   # Acute on chronic CHF
 Related to fluid resuscitation for sepsis.
   -Switch to lasix bolus, goal neg 1-2L for 24hours.
   -Watch output closely, ensuring that he is not much more than 2 L
   negative in 24 hours, because getting too much fluid off of him would
   result in decreased preload leading to decreased cardiac output, and
   given his aortic stenosis he might not be able to maintain his MAPs.

   than 3 weeks, we may need an echo to check for clot to prevent stroke.

   #Liver failure. The transaminitis from before is now resolving, was
   likely due to shock liver given all findings. However, his INR is still
   high at 2.1, so we will recheck LFTs tomorrow in the morning.
   - recheck LFTs.

   #Nausea/Vomiting/Conspitation/Diarrhea. The patient is no longer
   experiencing n/v and his constipation is resolved with stopping opioid
   analgesic and starting aggressive bowel regimen. In fact, now he has
   diarrhea. He has a negative c. diff.
   - Decrease bowel regimen to reduce diarrhea.
   - do a rectal to check for impaction
   #AS
 His acute issues have now resolved and he will be a candidate for
   treatment of AS.
   - Valvuloplasty with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5279**] on Friday PM. This may help decrease the
   pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   #ARF
 Although his Cr is 1.7, it is stable. Most likely his ARF is
   related not only to lasix, but also due to renal vein congestion
   preventing full and proper blood flow out of the kidney. As his volume
   status improves and he becomes less volume overloaded and as we wean
   the lasix, we can expect to see his Cr trend down.
   - Back-off on Lasix if Cr returns >2.0, otherwise continue lasix now in
   boluses.
   - Cont trend UOP, Cr
   - Urine lytes showed he was pre-renal with FE BUN 28.4 (less than the

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension admitted to the ICU for further evaluation of AS. The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is at risk for recurrent cardiogenic shock due to severe AS and ongoing hemodynamic instability.
2. Acute on Chronic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's acute exacerbation of CHF is related to fluid resuscitation for sepsis. Close monitoring of fluid status and careful diuresis management are necessary to prevent overdiuresis and hypotension.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has well-controlled AF with a controlled ventricular rate. Potential cardioversion may be considered in the future, but precautions should be taken to prevent stroke.
4. MSSA Bacteremia: The source of MSSA bacteremia is unclear, and surveillance cultures are negative. Continuous nafcillin therapy is planned for a 2-week course.
5. Liver Failure: The patient has evidence of liver failure, as indicated by elevated transaminases and prolonged INR. Rechecking LFT"

   # Cardiogenic shock: Yesterday we were able to wean the patient
   completely off dobutamine; he maintained MAPs in 70s and his calculated
   CI was 1.9, which is evidence that he is getting over the
   septic/cardiogenic shock. Therefore, from a hemodynamic standpoint
   there is no longer need for his swan-ganz and cordis. However, we will
   keep the swan-ganz and cordis in place at this time for two reasons:
   first, pulmonary will be coming by to evaluate his pulmonary
   hypertension and they may need the swan-ganz catheter to do their NO
   trial; second, the cordis is being currently used for venous access
   because he has very difficult-to-access peripheral veins. Therefore, we

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. The patient was admitted with dyspnea on exertion, transferred for further evaluation of AS, and now presents with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

The patient's recent events include valvuloplasty scheduled for Friday, vitamin K administered to prepare for the procedure, contact precautions due to a history of MRSA cellulitis, unsuccessful attempts to place a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, a central venous line (CVL) kept in place, and a need for a PICC placement in radiology.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 98.4Â°C, heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 66/39 to 98/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation.

The patient's physical examination reveals an echocardiogram showing a crescendo/decrescendo murmur, normal S1 and S2, crackles at the lower lung fields bilaterally, soft abdomen, trace pitting edema, and decreased breath sounds.

Laboratory results show leukocyte count of 13.1 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level of 28.4 mg/dL, sodium level of 134 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride level of 98 mEq/L, magnesium level of 2.0 mEq/L, glucose level of 110 mg/dL, and albumin level of 3.0 g/dL. Coagulation profile indicates a prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) of 20.6/1.9, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 114.6 seconds, fibrinogen level of 392 mg/dL, and D-dimer level of 5835 ng/mL. Cardiac markers show elevated troponin-T and creatine kinase-MB levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's hemodynamic instability and decreased cardiac output may lead to cardiogenic shock. Close monitoring of blood pressure and cardiac index is necessary.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine level and history of fluid resuscitation indicate the possibility of AKI. Adjusting diuretic therapy and closely monitoring renal function parameters is important.
3. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Bacteremia: The patient's MSSA bacteremia needs to be treated with appropriate antibiotics. Close surveillance for signs of infection or sepsis is necessary.

   rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH with DOE,
   transferred for further evaluation of AS, now with MSSA bacteremia,
   septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: Yesterday we were able to wean the patient
   completely off dobutamine; he maintained MAPs in 70s and his calculated
   CI was 1.9, which is evidence that he is getting over the
   septic/cardiogenic shock. Therefore, from a hemodynamic standpoint
   there is no longer need for his swan-ganz and cordis. However, we will
   keep the swan-ganz and cordis in place at this time for two reasons:
   first, pulmonary will be coming by to evaluate his pulmonary
   hypertension and they may need the swan-ganz catheter to do their NO
   trial; second, the cordis is being currently used for venous access
   because he has very difficult-to-access peripheral veins. Therefore, we
   will need to get a PICC placed before the cordis can be removed.
   - Goal MAPs >65
   - switch lasix gtt to lasix bolus 90mg Q6H, goal neg -1L to -2L x 24
   hrs; be careful not to overdiurese him,

   SUB-INTERN ADDENDUM:
   Assessment/Plan: 64y/o M with dilated cardiomyopathy and severe AS who

   valvuloplasty.
   # Cardiogenic/septic shock. MAPs have been maintained well in 60-70s.
   Off pressors, and BCx have been NGTD and his WBC is trending down. Will
   pull cordis today as it is no longer needed, and will have IR place
   PICC since he is a hard stick.
   - IR PICC
   - Pull cordis, d/c heparin before doing this
   - On nafcillin, day 1= [**2114-4-24**]
   - I/O goal even to net positive 500cc
   #CHF. Yesterday he was net negative only 100 cc (goal was about 1L) and
   his clinical exam still suggests that he is volume overloaded (pitting
   edema, crackles on lung exam, elevated JVP). His CXR is about the same
   as in the past (pulmonary edema is present and it is unchanged from
   prior CXR). Even though we are diuresing him, his clinical exam
   suggests that he we cannot get the fluid off. Furthermore, his
   creatining has been rising and is at 2.0 today. This raises the
   possibility that he is paradoxically volume depleted, and that as a
   result his kidneys are not perfusing well enough to clear the
   creatinine. Therefore, in order to measure his volume status a little
   more accurately, we will really have to go by the urine output and
   creatinine, not his other exam findings.
   - Lasix bolus 120 this AM, then hold all lasix today and bolus as
   necessary to maintain goal I/O 0 to 500 positive
   - f/u 2PM lytes
   #Afib. His digoxin has been helping him control his heart rate and keep
   it mostly in the 60-100 range, but he is still in atrial fibrillation
   (expected). His level today came back at 0.8 (slightly
   sub-therapeutic). At this time, however, we will keep his digoxin at
   0.125 because the drug is renally dosed and he is in ARF (rising
   creatinine). We will keep an eye on his Afib and heart rate.
   - Continue dig
   - continue heparin for ppx, hold heparin right before his valvuloplasty
   tomorrow
   #Shock liver. His INR is at 1.9 and is stable in this range (1.8 to 2.0
   the last few days). His LFTs (as well as LDH and T bili) are trending
   down which suggests that his shock liver is getting better.
   Furthermore, he received Vitamin K yesterday which should help improve
   his INR. His PTT just [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] today, from 79 to 114.

   #AS. He will have valvuloplasty tomorrow. Most likely this is

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for evaluation of AS and is currently recovering from septic shock and cardiogenic shock. The patient has several medical complications, including atrial fibrillation (AF), acute kidney injury (ARF), anemia, thrombocytopenia, liver failure, hyperlipidemia, and low back pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has recovered from cardiogenic shock but may experience complications related to his underlying heart conditions.
2. Aortic stenosis: The patient has severe AS and will undergo valvuloplasty tomorrow. This procedure aims to improve his symptoms and decrease pulmonary hypertension.
3. Septic shock: The patient recovered from septic shock but may still be at risk for complications related to MSSA bacteremia.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating possible ARF. Close monitoring of renal function and urine output is necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient has a stable hemoglobin level but requires ongoing monitoring. Further evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding is needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M w/ nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS,
   rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH with DOE,
   transferred for further evaluation of AS, now with MSSA bacteremia,
   septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: Yesterday we were able to wean the patient
   completely off dobutamine; he maintained MAPs in 70s and his calculated
   CI was 1.9, which is evidence that he is getting over the
   septic/cardiogenic shock. Therefore, from a hemodynamic standpoint
   there is no longer need for his swan-ganz and cordis. However, we will
   keep the swan-ganz and cordis in place at this time for two reasons:
   first, pulmonary will be coming by to evaluate his pulmonary
   hypertension and they may need the swan-ganz catheter to do their NO
   trial; second, the cordis is being currently used for venous access
   because he has very difficult-to-access peripheral veins. Therefore, we
   will need to get a PICC placed before the cordis can be removed.
   - Goal MAPs >65
   - switch lasix gtt to lasix bolus 90mg Q6H, goal neg -1L to -2L x 24
   hrs; be careful not to overdiurese him,
   - maintain Hct>30%
   - PICC line placement
   - Pulmonary consult to evaluate pulmonary hypertension and possible use
   of sildenafil
   .
   # Acute on chronic CHF
 Related to fluid resuscitation for sepsis.
   -Switch to lasix bolus, goal neg 1-2L for 24hours.
   -Watch output closely, ensuring that he is not much more than 2 L
   negative in 24 hours, because getting too much fluid off of him would
   result in decreased preload leading to decreased cardiac output, and
   given his aortic stenosis he might not be able to maintain his MAPs.
   -f/u PM lytes (2pm)
   .
   # A fib: Not symptomatic. Rate well controlled in the 80s on digoxin.
   Will potentially need cardioversion in the future, and it might even
   improve his cardiac output. If we decide to do cardioversion sooner
   than 3 weeks, we may need an echo to check for clot to prevent stroke.
   - con

   - switch to PO digoxin
   - f/u digoxin level tomorrow in AM

   #  MSSA bacteremia - unclear source; WBC# and fever curve trending
   down, surveillance Cx neg to date.
   -cont nafcillin to complete a 2 week course (day #1=[**2114-4-24**], day
   #14=[**2114-5-8**])
   .
   #Liver failure. The transaminitis from before is now resolving, was
   likely due to shock liver given all findings. However, his INR is still
   high at 2.1, so we will recheck LFTs tomorrow in the morning.
   - recheck LFTs.
   -avoid hepatotoxic medications
   -tylenol 2gm max/24 hrs

   elevated. RUQ ultrasound on admission without evidence of

   - Monitor daily
   #Nausea/Vomiting/Conspitation/Diarrhea. The patient is no longer
   experiencing n/v and his constipation is resolved with stopping opioid
   analgesic and starting aggressive bowel regimen. In fact, now he has
   diarrhea. He has a negative c. diff.
   - Decrease bowel regimen to reduce diarrhea.
   - do a rectal to check for impaction
   #AS
 His acute issues have now resolved and he will be a candidate for
   treatment of AS.
   - Valvuloplasty with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5279**] on Friday PM. This may help decrease the
   pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   #ARF
 Although his Cr is 1.7, it is stable. Most likely his ARF is
   related not only to lasix, but also due to renal vein congestion
   preventing full and proper blood flow out of the kidney. As his volume
   status improves and he becomes less volume overloaded and as we wean
   the lasix, we can expect to see his Cr trend down.
   - Back-off on Lasix if Cr returns >2.0, otherwise continue lasix now in
   boluses.
   - Cont trend UOP, Cr
   - Urine lytes showed he was pre-renal with FE BUN 28.4 (less than the
   cut off of 30-35).

   monitor for evidence of complication of bacteremia (epidural abscess)
   - On tramadol for this, helping a little bit but not completely.
   - limit tylenol
   - consider imaging of back if pain worsens or neuro status changes
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia. His thrombocytopenia was likely a component of
   shock, liver failure, and bone marrow suppression from his bacteremia.
   It is now resolving and platelets are actually increasing today.

   SUB-INTERN ADDENDUM:
   Assessment/Plan: 64y/o M with dilated cardiomyopathy and severe AS who
   recovered from a recent cardiogenic/septic shock, now awaiting
   valvuloplasty.
   # Cardiogenic/septic shock. MAPs have been maintained well in 60-70s.
   Off pressors, and BCx have been NGTD and his WBC is trending down. Will
   pull cordis today as it is no longer needed, and will have IR place
   PICC since he is a hard stick.
   - IR PICC
   - Pull cordis, d/c heparin before doing this
   - On nafcillin, day 1= [**2114-4-24**]
   - I/O goal even to net positive 500cc
   #CHF. Yesterday he was net negative only 100 cc (goal was about 1L) and
   his clinical exam still suggests that he is volume overloaded (pitting
   edema, crackles on lung exam, elevated JVP). His CXR is about the same
   as in the past (pulmonary edema is present and it is unchanged from
   prior CXR). Even though we are diuresing him, his clinical exam
   suggests that he we cannot get the fluid off. Furthermore, his
   creatining has been rising and is at 2.0 today. This raises the
   possibility that he is paradoxically volume depleted, and that as a
   result his kidneys are not perfusing well enough to clear the
   creatinine. Therefore, in order to measure his volume status a little
   more accurately, we will really have to go by the urine output and
   creatinine, not his other exam findings.
   - Lasix bolus 120 this AM, then hold all lasix today and bolus as
   necessary to maintain goal I/O 0 to 500 positive
   - f/u 2PM lytes
   #Afib. His digoxin has been helping him control his heart rate and keep
   it mostly in the 60-100 range, but he is still in atrial fibrillation
   (expected). His level today came back at 0.8 (slightly
   sub-therapeutic). At this time, however, we will keep his digoxin at
   0.125 because the drug is renally dosed and he is in ARF (rising
   creatinine). We will keep an eye on his Afib and heart rate.
   - Continue dig
   - continue heparin for ppx, hold heparin right before his valvuloplasty
   tomorrow
   #Shock liver. His INR is at 1.9 and is stable in this range (1.8 to 2.0
   the last few days). His LFTs (as well as LDH and T bili) are trending
   down which suggests that his shock liver is getting better.
   Furthermore, he received Vitamin K yesterday which should help improve
   his INR. His PTT just [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] today, from 79 to 114.
   - Continue trending LFTs
   #AS. He will have valvuloplasty tomorrow. Most likely this is
   contributing to his pulmonary hypertension (combined with his OSA,
   COPD, etc.).
   - Valvuloplasty
   #Otherwise, plan as above.

   agree with the documentation of the progress over the past 24 hours.
   He feels better today and his CXR is stable although his creatinine has
   inched up to 2.0 today, consistent with a pre renal azotemia.   As
   noted yesterday, his pulmonary artery hypertension makes him at
   extremely high risk for AVR.   As a result, we will proceed with aortic
   valvuloplasty tomorrow  to assess its effect on the PA pressures.
   Because of the etiology of the AS primarily relating to rheumatic
   disease, I am hopeful that we will be able to obtained a good anatomic
   result.  I agree with the assessment and plan as outlined in the

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital due to dyspnea on exertion and was found to have MSSA bacteremia and septic shock. He is currently in cardiogenic shock as well.

The patient's medical history includes a recent gastrointestinal bleed with colonic arteriovenous malformation (AVM) that was cauterized, chronic lumbar back disease, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. He also has hyperlipidemia.

His current medications include nafcillin, dobutamine, lasix, famotidine, and insulin for diabetes control.

The patient's physical examination findings include a crescendo/decrescendo murmur, normal S1 and S2, crackles at the lower lung fields bilaterally, trace pitting edema, and soft stool. His vital signs include a heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 98/57 mmHg to 98/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature of 98.4Â°C.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M w/ nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS,
   rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH with DOE,
   transferred for further evaluation of AS, now with MSSA bacteremia,
   septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: Yesterday we were able to wean the patient
   completely off dobutamine; he maintained MAPs in 70s and his calculated
   CI was 1.9, which is evidence that he is getting over the
   septic/cardiogenic shock. Therefore, from a hemodynamic standpoint
   there is no longer need for his swan-ganz and cordis. However, we will
   keep the swan-ganz and cordis in place at this time for two reasons:
   first, pulmonary will be coming by to evaluate his pulmonary
   hypertension and they may need the swan-ganz catheter to do their NO
   trial; second, the cordis is being currently used for venous access
   because he has very difficult-to-access peripheral veins. Therefore, we
   will need to get a PICC placed before the cordis can be removed.
   - Goal MAPs >65
   - switch lasix gtt to lasix bolus 90mg Q6H, goal neg -1L to -2L x 24
   hrs; be careful not to overdiurese him,
   - maintain Hct>30%
   - PICC line placement
   - Pulmonary consult to evaluate pulmonary hypertension and possible use
   of sildenafil
   .
   # Acute on chronic CHF
 Related to fluid resuscitation for sepsis.
   -Switch to lasix bolus, goal neg 1-2L for 24hours.
   -Watch output closely, ensuring that he is not much more than 2 L
   negative in 24 hours, because getting too much fluid off of him would
   result in decreased preload leading to decreased cardiac output, and
   given his aortic stenosis he might not be able to maintain his MAPs.
   -f/u PM lytes (2pm)
   .
   # A fib: Not symptomatic. Rate well controlled in the 80s on digoxin.
   Will potentially need cardioversion in the future, and it might even
   improve his cardiac output. If we decide to do cardioversion sooner
   than 3 weeks, we may need an echo to check for clot to prevent stroke.

   #Liver failure. The transaminitis from before is now resolving, was
   likely due to shock liver given all findings. However, his INR is still
   high at 2.1, so we will recheck LFTs tomorrow in the morning.
   - recheck LFTs.

   #Nausea/Vomiting/Conspitation/Diarrhea. The patient is no longer
   experiencing n/v and his constipation is resolved with stopping opioid
   analgesic and starting aggressive bowel regimen. In fact, now he has
   diarrhea. He has a negative c. diff.
   - Decrease bowel regimen to reduce diarrhea.
   - do a rectal to check for impaction
   #AS
 His acute issues have now resolved and he will be a candidate for
   treatment of AS.
   - Valvuloplasty with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5279**] on Friday PM. This may help decrease the
   pulmonary hypertension.
   .
   #ARF
 Although his Cr is 1.7, it is stable. Most likely his ARF is
   related not only to lasix, but also due to renal vein congestion
   preventing full and proper blood flow out of the kidney. As his volume
   status improves and he becomes less volume overloaded and as we wean
   the lasix, we can expect to see his Cr trend down.
   - Back-off on Lasix if Cr returns >2.0, otherwise continue lasix now in
   boluses.
   - Cont trend UOP, Cr
   - Urine lytes showed he was pre-renal with FE BUN 28.4 (less than the
   cut off of 30-35).

   - On tramadol for this, helping a little bit but not completely.
   - limit tylenol
   - consider imaging of back if pain worsens or neuro status changes

   SUB-INTERN ADDENDUM:
   Assessment/Plan: 64y/o M with dilated cardiomyopathy and severe AS who
   recovered from a recent cardiogenic/septic shock, now awaiting
   valvuloplasty.
   # Cardiogenic/septic shock. MAPs have been maintained well in 60-70s.
   Off pressors, and BCx have been NGTD and his WBC is trending down. Will
   pull cordis today as it is no longer needed, and will have IR place
   PICC since he is a hard stick.
   - IR PICC
   - Pull cordis, d/c heparin before doing this
   - On nafcillin, day 1= [**2114-4-24**]
   - I/O goal even to net positive 500cc
   #CHF. Yesterday he was net negative only 100 cc (goal was about 1L) and
   his clinical exam still suggests that he is volume overloaded (pitting
   edema, crackles on lung exam, elevated JVP). His CXR is about the same
   as in the past (pulmonary edema is present and it is unchanged from
   prior CXR). Even though we are diuresing him, his clinical exam
   suggests that he we cannot get the fluid off. Furthermore, his
   creatining has been rising and is at 2.0 today. This raises the
   possibility that he is paradoxically volume depleted, and that as a
   result his kidneys are not perfusing well enough to clear the
   creatinine. Therefore, in order to measure his volume status a little
   more accurately, we will really have to go by the urine output and
   creatinine, not his other exam findings.
   - Lasix bolus 120 this AM, then hold all lasix today and bolus as
   necessary to maintain goal I/O 0 to 500 positive
   - f/u 2PM lytes
   #Afib. His digoxin has been helping him control his heart rate and keep
   it mostly in the 60-100 range, but he is still in atrial fibrillation
   (expected). His level today came back at 0.8 (slightly
   sub-therapeutic). At this time, however, we will keep his digoxin at
   0.125 because the drug is renally dosed and he is in ARF (rising
   creatinine). We will keep an eye on his Afib and heart rate.
   - Continue dig
   - continue heparin for ppx, hold heparin right before his valvuloplasty
   tomorrow
   #Shock liver. His INR is at 1.9 and is stable in this range (1.8 to 2.0
   the last few days). His LFTs (as well as LDH and T bili) are trending
   down which suggests that his shock liver is getting better.
   Furthermore, he received Vitamin K yesterday which should help improve
   his INR. His PTT just [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] today, from 79 to 114.
   - Continue trending LFTs
   #AS. He will have valvuloplasty tomorrow. Most likely this is
   contributing to his pulmonary hypertension (combined with his OSA,
   COPD, etc.).
   - Valvuloplasty
   #Otherwise, plan as above.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted for dyspnea on exertion and was found to have MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

The patient underwent fluid resuscitation for sepsis and was able to wean off dobutamine. He maintained mean arterial pressures (MAPs) in the 70s and had a calculated cardiac index of 1.9, indicating improvement from septic/cardiogenic shock. However, the patient still requires monitoring and treatment for several conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has recovered from cardiogenic/septic shock, but ongoing monitoring is necessary to ensure that his hemodynamic parameters remain stable.

2. Acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's volume status is a concern, as he is still experiencing signs of fluid overload (pitting edema, crackles on lung exam, elevated jugular venous pressure). Diuretics may be required to manage this condition.

3. Atrial fibrillation (Afib): The patient is well-controlled on digox"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS s/p
   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # Chronic systolic heart failure:  Patient still with signs of fluid
   overload (crackles, lower extremity edema). Given aortic stenosis and
   poor EF, having difficulty mobilizing fluid forward. On [**2114-5-4**],
   patient was started on Dobutamine once again in hopes of mobilizing
   fluid forward. This was based on an elevated PCWP noted by RHC at time
   of aortoplasty. He was negative 500cc for the day, suggesting that
   increasing flow to kidney rather than using diuretics alone may be the
   best way to achieve a favorable fluid balance. On further assessment
   this morning, milrinone may be a useful medication in this patient. We
   would expect milrinone to help with ionotropy as well; associated
   tachycardia would make the beta-blocker useful.
   -          Stop Dobutamine
   -          Start milrinone
   -          Start Lasix gtt with goal UOP 40-60cc per hour
   -          Goal fluid status -1L today
   -          Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID
   -          Restart digoxin, recheck level in the morning
   -          Continue to monitor hemodynamics
   -          Goal MAP>60, PCWP 18 (patient is preload dependent given
   aortic stenosis)
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.
   -          Pulmonary recs
   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more
   medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for AVR.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Rate well controlled in the 80s on digoxin.
   Will potentially need cardioversion in the future, and it might even
   improve his cardiac output. If we decide to do cardioversion sooner
   than 3 weeks, we may need an echo to check for clot to prevent stroke.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Digoxin restarted, as above; check AM digoxin level
   - Beta-blocker for rate control, as above
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Continue coumadin, goal INR [**1-23**]
   # MSSA bacteremia:  Unclear source; surveillance culture remain
   negative
    - Continue Nafcillin for 2 week course (day #1=[**2114-4-24**], day
   #14=[**2114-5-8**])
   .
   # Liver failure:  Transaminitis resolving, synthetic function
   improving. Likely [**1-22**] shock liver
   - Avoid hepatotoxic medications
   - Tylenol 2gm max/24 hrs
   .
   # ARF:  Creatinine now stable at 2.2. Suspect prerenal and renal vein
   congestion secondary to poor forward flow.
   - Expect improvement as milrinone helps forward flow
   - Closely monitor creatinine as we restart Lasix gtt
   # Anemia
 Hct stable; unclear baseline; recent GIB w/ C-scope showing
   colonic AVM that was cauterized
   -          Trend hematocrit
   -          Guaiac stools

   # Low back pain:  Presumed [**1-22**] chronic lumbar back disease, but will
   monitor for evidence of complication of bacteremia (epidural abscess)
   - Tramadol

   I have reviewed the progress note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1225**] for [**2114-5-5**].   I
   agree with the 24 hours events documented with the note.  I was present
   during the physical examination and agree with the documented
   findings.   The assessment and plan outline our strategy over the next
   24 hours.   Mr. [**Known lastname **] has done well symptomatically over the past 24
   hours but has had little response to diuretic therapy.    We will
   change to milrinone in an attempt to improve his ionotropic support and
   diuresis.  We would like to obtain a net 1000-[**2104**] cc fluid reduction
   over the next 24 hours.  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3139**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5279**], MD  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5760**]

","Summary:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension.
- He was admitted for evaluation of aortic stenosis and found to have MSSA bacteremia and cardiogenic shock.
- The patient still shows signs of fluid overload, such as crackles and lower extremity edema.
- Due to the patient's poor ejection fraction and aortic stenosis, he has difficulty mobilizing fluid forward.
- The plan is to start milrinone to help with ionotropy and diuresis, aiming for a net fluid reduction of 1000-500cc over the next 24 hours.
- Other ongoing plans include continuing metoprolol, restarting digoxin, and monitoring hemodynamics with goals of maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) 18.
- Pulmonary hypertension is still present despite aortic valveoplasty, and the patient may be a candidate for aortic valve replacement (AVR) in the future.
- Atrial fibrillation is well-controlled on digoxin, and cardioversion may be considered in the future.
- MSSA bacteremia is being treated with nafcillin for a two-week course.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization procedure on [**2114-5-4**] at 10:47 AM and had sheath insertion at 04:00 PM on the same day. The patient's Foley catheter was discontinued, and Coumadin was restarted. The patient is also receiving morphine for pain management.

The patient's goal output is set at 500cc positive with a current value of -375 at 1900. Dobutamine and beta-blockers have been initiated. The patient has lost transmission in one of the lines, prompting the decision to get a chest X-ray.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99.0 F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/43 mmHg to 113/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and atrial fibrillation as the heart rhythm.

The patient's weight is currently 122.7 kg, with a height of 69 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg, pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) is 95/38 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) is 4.3 L/min, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is 1,453 dynes*sec/cm"

   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # Chronic systolic heart failure:  Patient still with signs of fluid
   overload (crackles, lower extremity edema). Given aortic stenosis and
   poor EF, having difficulty mobilizing fluid forward. On [**2114-5-4**],
   patient was started on Dobutamine once again in hopes of mobilizing
   fluid forward. He was negative 500cc for the day, suggesting that
   increasing flow to kidney rather than using diuretics alone may be the
   best way to achieve a favorable fluid balance. On further assessment
   this morning, milrinone may be a useful medication in this patient. We
   would expect milrinone to help with ionotropy as well; associated
   tachycardia would make the beta-blocker useful.
   -          Stop Dobutamine
   -          Start milrinone
   -          Start Lasix gtt with goal UOP 40-60cc per hour
   -          Goal fluid status -1L today
   -          Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID

   # Cardiogenic shock:
   Yesterday we were able to wean the patient completely off dobutamine;
   he maintained MAPs in 70s and his calculated CI was 1.9, which is
   evidence that he is getting over the septic/cardiogenic shock.
   Therefore, from a hemodynamic standpoint there is no longer need for
   his swan-ganz and cordis. However, we will keep the swan-ganz and
   cordis in place at this time for two reasons: first, pulmonary will be
   coming by to evaluate his pulmonary hypertension and they may need the
   swan-ganz catheter to do their NO trial; second, the cordis is being
   currently used for venous access because he has very
   difficult-to-access peripheral veins. Therefore, we will need to get a
   PICC placed before the cordis can be removed.
   - Goal MAPs >65
   - switch lasix gtt to lasix bolus 90mg Q6H, goal neg -1L to -2L x 24
   hrs; be careful not to overdiurese him,
   - maintain Hct>30%
   - PICC line placement
   - Pulmonary consult to evaluate pulmonary hypertension and possible use
   of sildenafil
   .
   # Acute on chronic CHF
 Related to fluid resuscitation for sepsis.
   -Switch to lasix bolus, goal neg 1-2L for 24hours.
   -Watch output closely, ensuring that he is not much more than 2 L
   negative in 24 hours, because getting too much fluid off of him would
   result in decreased preload leading to decreased cardiac output, and
   given his aortic stenosis he might not be able to maintain his MAPs.

   #ARF
 Although his Cr is 1.7, it is stable. Most likely his ARF is
   related not only to lasix, but also due to renal vein congestion
   preventing full and proper blood flow out of the kidney. As his volume
   status improves and he becomes less volume overloaded and as we wean
   the lasix, we can expect to see his Cr trend down.
   - Back-off on Lasix if Cr returns >2.0, otherwise continue lasix now in

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral valve disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted with dyspnea on exertion and transferred for further evaluation of aortic stenosis. The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock. He is currently experiencing chronic systolic heart failure, fluid overload, pulmonary hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's poor left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and severe aortic stenosis contribute to ongoing fluid overload, evidenced by crackles in the lungs and lower extremity edema. It is crucial to manage his fluid balance carefully to prevent worsening heart failure.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's elevated pulmonary pressures suggest significant pulmonary hypertension, which may be secondary to his COPD and body habitus. This condition increases the risk of right heart strain and failure.
3. Aortic stenosis: Despite undergoing aortoplasty, the patient's aortic valve area did not improve significantly. He may be a candidate for aortic valve replacement (AVR) in the future, once medically stabilized.
4. MSSA bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing infection with"

   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # Chronic systolic heart failure:  Patient still with signs of fluid
   overload (crackles, lower extremity edema). Given aortic stenosis and
   poor EF, having difficulty mobilizing fluid forward. On [**2114-5-4**],
   patient was started on Dobutamine once again in hopes of mobilizing
   fluid forward. This was based on an elevated PCWP noted by RHC at time
   of aortoplasty. He was negative 500cc for the day, suggesting that
   increasing flow to kidney rather than using diuretics alone may be the
   best way to achieve a favorable fluid balance. On further assessment
   this morning, milrinone may be a useful medication in this patient. We
   would expect milrinone to help with ionotropy as well; associated
   tachycardia would make the beta-blocker useful.
   -          Stop Dobutamine
   -          Start milrinone
   -          Start Lasix gtt with goal UOP 40-60cc per hour

   aortic stenosis)
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.
   -          Pulmonary recs
   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more
   medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for AVR.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Rate well controlled in the 80s on digoxin.
   Will potentially need cardioversion in the future, and it might even
   improve his cardiac output. If we decide to do cardioversion sooner
   than 3 weeks, we may need an echo to check for clot to prevent stroke.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Digoxin restarted, as above; check AM digoxin level

   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Continue coumadin, goal INR [**1-23**]

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted for further evaluation of AS and found to have methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and septic shock, as well as cardiogenic shock.

The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with signs of fluid overload, such as crackles and lower extremity edema. Due to aortic stenosis and poor ejection fraction, it is difficult to mobilize fluid forward. The patient was started on dobutamine to help mobilize fluid forward, but this was stopped and replaced with milrinone, which will also help with inotropy and is expected to improve kidney perfusion.

The patient also has pulmonary hypertension with elevated pulmonary pressures out of proportion to the expected values for aortic stenosis alone. He has known severe COPD and a body habitus concerning for OSA. Pulmonary consult service is following up on this issue once the patient becomes more euvolemic.

After undergoing aortoplasty, there was minimal improvement in valve area, but the transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHg. Once the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS s/p
   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # Chronic systolic heart failure:  The patient
s signs of fluid
   overload (lower extremity and dependent back edema, crackles) are
   mildly better today than previously, and his urine output picked up to
   60-100cc/hr after starting milrinone and lasix. This suggests that
   milrinone, which enhances contractility and vasodilates peripherally,
   is helping the patient mobilize fluid forward in the context of his
   aortic stenosis and poor EF. Contractility is further enhanced by the
   digoxin he is taking for atrial fibrillation. Indeed, we know that
   milrinone and digoxin are working because his cardiac index (by Fick
   equation) is better today at 2.7 as compared to 1.8 yesterday morning.
   Furthermore, his creatinine is trending down today (1.1 today from
   2.2-ish over the past 3 days), and his UOP has picked up after starting
   the lasix (now 200cc+/hr over the past 7 hours). This further supports
   that increasing forward flow with milrinone is increasing blood flow
   through the kidney (increasing glomerular filtration rate as evidenced
   by decreasing creatinine) and that adding lasix is helping with the
   diuresis. We expect that he will continue to diurese significantly over
   the next 24 hours. The patient is otherwise on lopressor to decrease
   milrinone-associated tachycardia.
   -          Cont milrinone at 0.5 mcg/kg/min
   -          Cont digoxin, this AM level at 0.8 (subtherapeutic), may
   consider increasing to 0.250 mg
   -          Cont lasix at 15 mg/hour
   -          Goal fluid status -1L today (currently at -800 cc)
   -          Continue Metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid
   -          Continue to monitor hemodynamics
   -          Goal MAP>60
   -          Consider wedging him today to assess for some changes in
   fluid status (keeping in mind limitation of this measurement in the
   context of his aortic stenosis)
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Rate well controlled in the 80-90s on digoxin
   but his rhythm is still in atrial fibrillation. Will potentially need
   cardioversion in the future, which might even improve his cardiac
   output (thus decreasing the need for milrinone). If we decide to do
   cardioversion sooner than 3 weeks, we may need an echo to check for
   clot to prevent stroke.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Digoxin, consider increasing down
   - Beta-blocker for rate control, as above
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Continue coumadin, goal INR [**1-23**], today at 1.6 (subtherapeutic)
   # Hemoptysis.  The patient has had nausea since yesterday and this AM
   he had hemoptysis. He most likely has an upper GI bleed secondary to
   his heparin.  We will need to discontinue the heparin and trend his
   hematocrit every 6 hours given the possible GI bleed. We will also
   place an NG tube to decompress and a PPI IV to decrease the bleeding,
   which we hope will relieve his nausea. Just in case his hematocrit
   drops too drastically, he has a type-and-cross active. Although he has
   not had a BM in 2 days, he has robust bowel sounds this morning and got
   a dulcolax, so we expect he should move his bowels soon. Given that he
   is on morphine (and we cannot discontinue because his back pain gets
   too severe), he will need to continue with a very robust bowel regimen.
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.
   -          Pulmonary recs
   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more
   medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for AVR.
   # MSSA bacteremia:  Unclear source; surveillance culture remain
   negative
    - Continue Nafcillin for 2 week course (day #1=[**2114-4-24**], day
   #14=[**2114-5-8**])
   .
   # Liver failure:  Transaminitis resolving, synthetic function
   improving. Likely [**1-22**] shock liver
   - Avoid hepatotoxic medications
   - Tylenol 2gm max/24 hrs
   .
   # ARF:  Creatinine trending down to 1.1, which suggests that the
   decrease in his GFR previously was due to poor forward flow and renal
   vein congestion (i.e. pre-renal ARF).
   -          Expect improvement as milrinone helps forward flow
   -          Closely monitor creatinine as we have increased Lasix gtt
   # Anemia
 Hct stable; unclear baseline; recent GIB w/ C-scope showing
   colonic AVM that was cauterized
   -          Trend hematocrit
   -          Guaiac stools
   .
   # Low back pain:  Presumed [**1-22**] chronic lumbar back disease, but will

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the intensive care unit with symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and was found to have MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock. The patient has been receiving treatment with milrinone, lasix, dobutamine, heparin, warfarin, metoprolol, digoxin, and nafcillin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac output is compromised due to severe aortic stenosis and dilated cardiomyopathy. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Septic shock: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which can progress to septic shock if not effectively treated. Septic shock is characterized by hypotension, altered mental status, and organ dysfunction.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has developed hemoptysis, which is likely secondary to heparin-induced bleeding. This needs to be managed promptly to prevent further blood loss and potential complications.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, indicating possible acute kidney injury. This may be due to pre-renal azotemia secondary"

   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # Chronic systolic heart failure:  Patient still with signs of fluid
   overload (crackles, lower extremity edema). Given aortic stenosis and
   poor EF, having difficulty mobilizing fluid forward. On [**2114-5-4**],
   patient was started on Dobutamine once again in hopes of mobilizing
   fluid forward. This was based on an elevated PCWP noted by RHC at time
   of aortoplasty. He was negative 500cc for the day, suggesting that
   increasing flow to kidney rather than using diuretics alone may be the
   best way to achieve a favorable fluid balance. On further assessment
   this morning, milrinone may be a useful medication in this patient. We
   would expect milrinone to help with ionotropy as well; associated
   tachycardia would make the beta-blocker useful.
   -          Stop Dobutamine
   -          Start milrinone
   -          Start Lasix gtt with goal UOP 40-60cc per hour
   -          Goal fluid status -1L today
   -          Continue Metoprolol Tartrate 12.5 mg PO BID
   -          Restart digoxin, recheck level in the morning
   -          Continue to monitor hemodynamics
   -          Goal MAP>60, PCWP 18 (patient is preload dependent given
   aortic stenosis)
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.
   -          Pulmonary recs
   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more
   medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for AVR.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Rate well controlled in the 80s on digoxin.
   Will potentially need cardioversion in the future, and it might even
   improve his cardiac output. If we decide to do cardioversion sooner
   than 3 weeks, we may need an echo to check for clot to prevent stroke.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Digoxin restarted, as above; check AM digoxin level
   - Beta-blocker for rate control, as above
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Continue coumadin, goal INR [**1-23**]
   # MSSA bacteremia:  Unclear source; surveillance culture remain
   negative
    - Continue Nafcillin for 2 week course (day #1=[**2114-4-24**], day

   improving. Likely [**1-22**] shock liver
   - Avoid hepatotoxic medications
   - Tylenol 2gm max/24 hrs

   # ARF:  Creatinine now stable at 2.2. Suspect prerenal and renal vein
   congestion secondary to poor forward flow.
   - Expect improvement as milrinone helps forward flow

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient was admitted with dyspnea on exertion and was found to have MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock. The patient has been receiving various treatments including dobutamine, milrinone, Lasix, metoprolol, digoxin, heparin, and nafcillin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has signs of fluid overload such as crackles and lower extremity edema. The patient's poor ejection fraction and severe aortic stenosis make it difficult to mobilize fluid forward. The use of dobutamine, milrinone, and Lasix will be important in managing this condition.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has elevated pulmonary pressures that are out of proportion to his aortic stenosis alone. The patient's known severe COPD and body habitus may contribute to this condition. A pulmonary consult service is following the patient.
3. Aortic stenosis: The patient underwent aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve area. The transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once the patient is medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for aortic valve replacement (AVR).
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is well-controlled on digoxin. Cardioversion may be considered in the future to improve cardiac output. An echo may be needed to check for clot before cardioversion to prevent stroke.
5. MSSA bacteremia: The source of the MSSA bacteremia is unclear, but surveillance cultures remain negative. Nafcillin will be continued for a 2-week course.
6. Liver failure: The patient has resolving transaminitis and improving synthetic function, likely due to [**1-22**] shock liver. Hepatotoxic medications should be avoided, and Tylenol usage should be limited.
7. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine is stable at 2.2, suggesting prerenal and renal vein congestion secondary to poor forward flow. Improvement is expected with milrinone therapy, and close monitoring of creatinine is necessary, especially when restarting Lasix gtt.
8. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, and the baseline is unclear. A recent gastrointestinal bleed with colonic arteriovenous malformation (AVM) was cauterized. Trending hematocrit and monitoring for evidence of complications of bacteremia (epidural abscess) are important.
9. Low back pain: The patient has presumed [**1-22**] chronic lumbar back disease, but monitoring for evidence of complications of bacter"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a medical history of chronic diastolic heart failure, aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and sepsis. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure due to pulmonary embolism and subsequent cardiac arrest. The patient required resuscitation with advanced cardiac life support measures.

Since admission, the patient has been on dobutamine and milrinone for cardiac support, along with Lasix and diuretics for fluid management. Heparin was temporarily held due to aortoplasty but has been restarted. Coumadin was increased to 4 mg PO daily. Lopressor was changed from IV to PO.

The patient's potassium level was low at 3.1, so potassium repletion was administered. There are no pulmonary recurrences, but the patient is constipated and nauseous. Bowel sounds are present, and Dulcolax was started as needed.

The patient's last dose of antibiotics was nafcillin at 06:00 AM. Current infusions include heparin sodium at 1,000 units/hour, milrinone at 0.5 mcg/kg/min, and furosemide (Lasix) at 15 mg/hour. Other medications include metoprolol, coumadin, and heparin.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs remain"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS s/p
   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # Chronic systolic heart failure:  The patient
s signs of fluid
   overload (lower extremity and dependent back edema, crackles) are
   mildly better today than previously, and his urine output picked up to
   60-100cc/hr after starting milrinone and lasix. This suggests that
   milrinone, which enhances contractility and vasodilates peripherally,
   is helping the patient mobilize fluid forward in the context of his
   aortic stenosis and poor EF. Contractility is further enhanced by the
   digoxin he is taking for atrial fibrillation. Indeed, we know that
   milrinone and digoxin are working because his cardiac index (by Fick
   equation) is better today at 2.7 as compared to 1.8 yesterday morning.
   Furthermore, his creatinine is trending down today (1.1 today from
   2.2-ish over the past 3 days), and his UOP has picked up after starting
   the lasix (now 200cc+/hr over the past 7 hours). This further supports
   that increasing forward flow with milrinone is increasing blood flow
   through the kidney (increasing glomerular filtration rate as evidenced
   by decreasing creatinine) and that adding lasix is helping with the
   diuresis. We expect that he will continue to diurese significantly over
   the next 24 hours. The patient is otherwise on lopressor to decrease
   milrinone-associated tachycardia.
   -          Cont milrinone at 0.5 mcg/kg/min
   -          Cont digoxin, this AM level at 0.8 (subtherapeutic), may
   consider increasing to 0.250 mg
   -          Cont lasix at 15 mg/hour
   -          Goal fluid status -1L today (currently at -800 cc)
   -          Continue Metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid
   -          Continue to monitor hemodynamics
   -          Goal MAP>60
   -          Consider wedging him today to assess for some changes in
   fluid status (keeping in mind limitation of this measurement in the
   context of his aortic stenosis)
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Rate well controlled in the 80-90s on digoxin
   but his rhythm is still in atrial fibrillation. Will potentially need
   cardioversion in the future, which might even improve his cardiac
   output (thus decreasing the need for milrinone). If we decide to do
   cardioversion sooner than 3 weeks, we may need an echo to check for
   clot to prevent stroke.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Digoxin, consider increasing down
   - Beta-blocker for rate control, as above
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Continue coumadin, goal INR [**1-23**], today at 1.6 (subtherapeutic)
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.
   -          Pulmonary recs
   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more
   medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for AVR.
   # MSSA bacteremia:  Unclear source; surveillance culture remain
   negative
    - Continue Nafcillin for 2 week course (day #1=[**2114-4-24**], day
   #14=[**2114-5-8**])
   .
   # Liver failure:  Transaminitis resolving, synthetic function
   improving. Likely [**1-22**] shock liver
   - Avoid hepatotoxic medications
   - Tylenol 2gm max/24 hrs
   .
   # ARF:  Creatinine trending down to 1.1, which suggests that the
   decrease in his GFR previously was due to poor forward flow and renal
   vein congestion (i.e. pre-renal ARF).
   -          Expect improvement as milrinone helps forward flow
   -          Closely monitor creatinine as we have increased Lasix gtt
   # Anemia
 Hct stable; unclear baseline; recent GIB w/ C-scope showing

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and was found to have MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

The patient's signs of fluid overload have improved, with better urine output after starting milrinone and lasix. His cardiac index by Fick equation has improved to 2.7 from 1.8 yesterday morning, indicating better forward flow. His creatinine level is trending down, suggesting improved renal function.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including dobutamine, milrinone, lasix, heparin, digoxin, metoprolol, nafcillin, and coumadin. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 104/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's signs of fluid overload suggest ongoing challenges with managing his heart failure. Continued optimization of"

   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # Chronic systolic heart failure:  The patient
s signs of fluid
   overload (lower extremity and dependent back edema, crackles) are
   mildly better today than previously, and his urine output picked up to
   60-100cc/hr after starting milrinone and lasix. This suggests that
   milrinone, which enhances contractility and vasodilates peripherally,
   is helping the patient mobilize fluid forward in the context of his
   aortic stenosis and poor EF. Contractility is further enhanced by the
   digoxin he is taking for atrial fibrillation. Indeed, we know that
   milrinone and digoxin are working because his cardiac index (by Fick
   equation) is better today at 2.7 as compared to 1.8 yesterday morning.
   Furthermore, his creatinine is trending down today (1.1 today from
   2.2-ish over the past 3 days), and his UOP has picked up after starting
   the lasix (now 200cc+/hr over the past 7 hours). This further supports
   that increasing forward flow with milrinone is increasing blood flow
   through the kidney (increasing glomerular filtration rate as evidenced
   by decreasing creatinine) and that adding lasix is helping with the
   diuresis. We expect that he will continue to diurese significantly over
   the next 24 hours. The patient is otherwise on lopressor to decrease
   milrinone-associated tachycardia.
   -          Cont milrinone at 0.5 mcg/kg/min
   -          Cont digoxin, this AM level at 0.8 (subtherapeutic), may
   consider increasing to 0.250 mg
   -          Cont lasix at 15 mg/hour
   -          Goal fluid status -1L today (currently at -800 cc)

   context of his aortic stenosis)
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.
   -          Pulmonary recs
   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more
   medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for AVR.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Rate well controlled in the 80s on digoxin.
   Will potentially need cardioversion in the future, and it might even
   improve his cardiac output. If we decide to do cardioversion sooner
   than 3 weeks, we may need an echo to check for clot to prevent stroke.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. These include:

1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has severe aortic stenosis (AS) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with an ejection fraction of 25%. This combination puts him at high risk for cardiogenic shock, which is already present as indicated by his hypotension and elevated cardiac enzymes.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is impaired, as evidenced by a rising creatinine level from 2.2 to 2.3. This could be due to prerenal azotemia secondary to poor forward flow, renal vein congestion, or possibly sepsis-induced kidney injury.

3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has elevated pulmonary pressures out of proportion to his aortic stenosis alone. This may be related to his known severe COPD and body habitus, as well as potential right heart strain from his cardiogenic shock.

4. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia with an unknown source. It is crucial to identify and treat the source of infection to prevent further complications.

5. Liver Failure: The patient has evidence of liver dysfunction, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes and a low albumin level. This could be due to septic shock, medication-induced hepatotoxicity, or preexisting liver disease.

   hematocrit every 6 hours given the possible GI bleed. We will also
   place an NG tube to decompress and a PPI IV to decrease the bleeding,
   which we hope will relieve his nausea. Just in case his hematocrit
   drops too drastically, he has a type-and-cross active. Although he has
   not had a BM in 2 days, he has robust bowel sounds this morning and got
   a dulcolax, so we expect he should move his bowels soon. Given that he
   is on morphine (and we cannot discontinue because his back pain gets

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted with dyspnea on exertion and was found to have MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock. The patient's current medications include milrinone, lasix, dobutamine, heparin, digoxin, and lopressor. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's signs of fluid overload are improving with the use of milrinone and lasix. His cardiac index is also improving, indicating better contractility and increased forward flow.
   - Continue milrinone at 0.5 mcg/kg/min.
   - Continue digoxin and consider increasing the dose.
   - Continue lasix at 15 mg/hour.
   - Goal fluid status -1L today.
   - Continue monitoring hemodynamics and aim for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60.
   - Consider wedging the patient today to assess fluid status.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's rate is well-controlled on digoxin, but he remains in atrial fibrillation. Cardioversion may be considered in the future, potentially improving cardiac output.

   Assessment and Plan
   64M with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS s/p
   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # Chronic systolic heart failure:  The patient
s signs of fluid
   overload (lower extremity and dependent back edema, crackles) are
   mildly better today than previously, and his urine output picked up to
   60-100cc/hr after starting milrinone and lasix. This suggests that
   milrinone, which enhances contractility and vasodilates peripherally,
   is helping the patient mobilize fluid forward in the context of his
   aortic stenosis and poor EF. Contractility is further enhanced by the
   digoxin he is taking for atrial fibrillation. Indeed, we know that
   milrinone and digoxin are working because his cardiac index (by Fick
   equation) is better today at 2.7 as compared to 1.8 yesterday morning.
   Furthermore, his creatinine is trending down today (1.1 today from
   2.2-ish over the past 3 days), and his UOP has picked up after starting
   the lasix (now 200cc+/hr over the past 7 hours). This further supports
   that increasing forward flow with milrinone is increasing blood flow
   through the kidney (increasing glomerular filtration rate as evidenced
   by decreasing creatinine) and that adding lasix is helping with the
   diuresis. We expect that he will continue to diurese significantly over
   the next 24 hours. The patient is otherwise on lopressor to decrease
   milrinone-associated tachycardia.
   -          Cont milrinone at 0.5 mcg/kg/min
   -          Cont digoxin, this AM level at 0.8 (subtherapeutic), may
   consider increasing to 0.250 mg
   -          Cont lasix at 15 mg/hour
   -          Goal fluid status -1L today (currently at -800 cc)
   -          Continue Metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid
   -          Continue to monitor hemodynamics
   -          Goal MAP>60
   -          Consider wedging him today to assess for some changes in
   fluid status (keeping in mind limitation of this measurement in the
   context of his aortic stenosis)
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Rate well controlled in the 80-90s on digoxin
   but his rhythm is still in atrial fibrillation. Will potentially need
   cardioversion in the future, which might even improve his cardiac
   output (thus decreasing the need for milrinone). If we decide to do
   cardioversion sooner than 3 weeks, we may need an echo to check for
   clot to prevent stroke.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Digoxin, consider increasing down
   - Beta-blocker for rate control, as above
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Continue coumadin, goal INR [**1-23**], today at 1.6 (subtherapeutic)
   # Hemoptysis.  The patient has had nausea since yesterday and this AM
   he had hemoptysis. He most likely has an upper GI bleed secondary to
   his heparin.  We will need to discontinue the heparin and trend his
   hematocrit every 6 hours given the possible GI bleed. and place an NG
   tube to decompress. Although he has not had a BM in 2 days, he has
   robust bowel sounds this morning and got a dulcolax PRN, so we expect
   he should move his bowels soon. Given that he is on morphine (and we
   cannot discontinue because his back pain gets too severe), he will need
   a very robust bowel regimen.
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.
   -          Pulmonary recs
   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more
   medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for AVR.
   # MSSA bacteremia:  Unclear source; surveillance culture remain
   negative
    - Continue Nafcillin for 2 week course (day #1=[**2114-4-24**], day
   #14=[**2114-5-8**])
   .
   # Liver failure:  Transaminitis resolving, synthetic function
   improving. Likely [**1-22**] shock liver
   - Avoid hepatotoxic medications
   - Tylenol 2gm max/24 hrs
   .
   # ARF:  Creatinine trending down to 1.1, which suggests that the
   decrease in his GFR previously was due to poor forward flow and renal
   vein congestion (i.e. pre-renal ARF).
   -          Expect improvement as milrinone helps forward flow
   -          Closely monitor creatinine as we have increased Lasix gtt
   # Anemia
 Hct stable; unclear baseline; recent GIB w/ C-scope showing
   colonic AVM that was cauterized
   -          Trend hematocrit
   -          Guaiac stools
   .
   # Low back pain:  Presumed [**1-22**] chronic lumbar back disease, but will
   monitor for evidence of complication of bacteremia (epidural abscess)
   - Tramadol

   failure, and bone marrow suppression from his bacteremia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted with dyspnea on exertion and was found to have MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock. The patient's current condition is stable, with signs of fluid overload and poor urine output, which have improved since starting milrinone and lasix. His cardiac index has improved, and his creatinine levels are decreasing, indicating improved kidney function. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, for which he is taking digoxin, and he may require cardioversion in the future. He has experienced hemoptysis, likely due to heparin-induced bleeding, so the heparin will be discontinued. The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and is awaiting further evaluation from the pulmonary consult service. He underwent an aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve area and may be a candidate for aortic valve replacement (AVR) in the future. The patient has a history of liver failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), anemia, low back pain, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and chronic lumbar back disease. He is currently receiving multiple medications"

s signs of fluid
   overload (lower extremity and dependent back edema, crackles) are
   better today than previously and his net fluid status yesterday was
   -2L.  However, his BP has been falling somewhat (MAPs in 50s now) and
   HR is increasing (up to 110-120s). This suggests that he is either
   over-diuresed, this is a reaction to his medications, or worse he is
   septic (WBC was 24 this AM). We will need to be cautious with him
   throughout the day and monitor his hemodynamic status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of aortic stenosis and found to have methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's signs of fluid overload are improving, but his blood pressure is falling, and heart rate is increasing. This suggests that he may be over-diuresed, reacting to medications, or septic. Monitoring hemodynamic status is crucial.
- Continue milrinone at 0.5 mcg/kg/min.
- Discontinue digoxin due to renal failure.
- Continue lasix at 5 mg/hour, increase today if necessary to maintain fluid goals.
- Goal fluid status -500cc.
- Continue metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid to decrease high heart rate.
- Monitor hemodynamics.
- Goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60.
- Wedge today was 24.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rate is getting high, and he remains in atrial fibrillation"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS s/p
   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # Chronic systolic heart failure:  The patient
s signs of fluid
   overload (lower extremity and dependent back edema, crackles) are
   mildly better today than previously, and his urine output picked up to
   60-100cc/hr after starting milrinone and lasix. This suggests that
   milrinone, which enhances contractility and vasodilates peripherally,
   is helping the patient mobilize fluid forward in the context of his
   aortic stenosis and poor EF. Contractility is further enhanced by the
   digoxin he is taking for atrial fibrillation. Indeed, we know that
   milrinone and digoxin are working because his cardiac index (by Fick
   equation) is better today at 2.7 as compared to 1.8 yesterday morning.
   Furthermore, his creatinine is trending down today (1.1 today from
   2.2-ish over the past 3 days), and his UOP has picked up after starting
   the lasix (now 200cc+/hr over the past 7 hours). This further supports
   that increasing forward flow with milrinone is increasing blood flow
   through the kidney (increasing glomerular filtration rate as evidenced
   by decreasing creatinine) and that adding lasix is helping with the
   diuresis. We expect that he will continue to diurese significantly over
   the next 24 hours. The patient is otherwise on lopressor to decrease
   milrinone-associated tachycardia.
   -          Cont milrinone at 0.5 mcg/kg/min
   -          Cont digoxin, this AM level at 0.8 (subtherapeutic), may
   consider increasing to 0.250 mg
   -          Cont lasix at 15 mg/hour
   -          Goal fluid status -1L today (currently at -800 cc)
   -          Continue Metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid
   -          Continue to monitor hemodynamics
   -          Goal MAP>60
   -          Consider wedging him today to assess for some changes in
   fluid status (keeping in mind limitation of this measurement in the
   context of his aortic stenosis)
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Rate well controlled in the 80-90s on digoxin
   but his rhythm is still in atrial fibrillation. Will potentially need
   cardioversion in the future, which might even improve his cardiac
   output (thus decreasing the need for milrinone). If we decide to do
   cardioversion sooner than 3 weeks, we may need an echo to check for
   clot to prevent stroke.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Digoxin, consider increasing down
   - Beta-blocker for rate control, as above
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Continue coumadin, goal INR [**1-23**], today at 1.6 (subtherapeutic)
   # Hemoptysis.  The patient has had nausea since yesterday and this AM
   he had hemoptysis. He most likely has an upper GI bleed secondary to
   his heparin.  We will need to discontinue the heparin and trend his
   hematocrit every 6 hours given the possible GI bleed. We will also
   place an NG tube to decompress and a PPI IV to decrease the bleeding,
   which we hope will relieve his nausea. Just in case his hematocrit
   drops too drastically, he has a type-and-cross active. Although he has
   not had a BM in 2 days, he has robust bowel sounds this morning and got
   a dulcolax, so we expect he should move his bowels soon. Given that he
   is on morphine (and we cannot discontinue because his back pain gets
   too severe), he will need to continue with a very robust bowel regimen.
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.

   Assessment and Plan
   64M with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS s/p
   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # Chronic systolic heart failure:  The patient
s signs of fluid
   overload (lower extremity and dependent back edema, crackles) are
   mildly better today than previously, and his urine output picked up to
   60-100cc/hr after starting milrinone and lasix. This suggests that
   milrinone, which enhances contractility and vasodilates peripherally,
   is helping the patient mobilize fluid forward in the context of his
   aortic stenosis and poor EF. Contractility is further enhanced by the
   digoxin he is taking for atrial fibrillation. Indeed, we know that
   milrinone and digoxin are working because his cardiac index (by Fick
   equation) is better today at 2.7 as compared to 1.8 yesterday morning.
   Furthermore, his creatinine is trending down today (1.1 today from
   2.2-ish over the past 3 days), and his UOP has picked up after starting
   the lasix (now 200cc+/hr over the past 7 hours). This further supports
   that increasing forward flow with milrinone is increasing blood flow
   through the kidney (increasing glomerular filtration rate as evidenced
   by decreasing creatinine) and that adding lasix is helping with the
   diuresis. We expect that he will continue to diurese significantly over
   the next 24 hours. The patient is otherwise on lopressor to decrease
   milrinone-associated tachycardia.
   -          Cont milrinone at 0.5 mcg/kg/min
   -          Cont digoxin, this AM level at 0.8 (subtherapeutic), may
   consider increasing to 0.250 mg
   -          Cont lasix at 15 mg/hour
   -          Goal fluid status -1L today (currently at -800 cc)
   -          Continue Metoprolol 12.5 mg po bid
   -          Continue to monitor hemodynamics
   -          Goal MAP>60
   -          Consider wedging him today to assess for some changes in
   fluid status (keeping in mind limitation of this measurement in the
   context of his aortic stenosis)
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Rate well controlled in the 80-90s on digoxin
   but his rhythm is still in atrial fibrillation. Will potentially need
   cardioversion in the future, which might even improve his cardiac
   output (thus decreasing the need for milrinone). If we decide to do
   cardioversion sooner than 3 weeks, we may need an echo to check for
   clot to prevent stroke.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Continue Digoxin, consider increasing down
   - Beta-blocker for rate control, as above
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Continue coumadin, goal INR [**1-23**], today at 1.6 (subtherapeutic)
   # Hemoptysis.  The patient has had nausea since yesterday and this AM
   he had hemoptysis. He most likely has an upper GI bleed secondary to
   his heparin.  We will need to discontinue the heparin and trend his
   hematocrit every 6 hours given the possible GI bleed. We will also
   place an NG tube to decompress and a PPI IV to decrease the bleeding,
   which we hope will relieve his nausea. Just in case his hematocrit
   drops too drastically, he has a type-and-cross active. Although he has
   not had a BM in 2 days, he has robust bowel sounds this morning and got
   a dulcolax, so we expect he should move his bowels soon. Given that he
   is on morphine (and we cannot discontinue because his back pain gets
   too severe), he will need to continue with a very robust bowel regimen.
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.
   -          Pulmonary recs
   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more
   medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for AVR.
   # MSSA bacteremia:  Unclear source; surveillance culture remain
   negative
    - Continue Nafcillin for 2 week course (day #1=[**2114-4-24**], day
   #14=[**2114-5-8**])
   .
   # Liver failure:  Transaminitis resolving, synthetic function
   improving. Likely [**1-22**] shock liver
   - Avoid hepatotoxic medications
   - Tylenol 2gm max/24 hrs
   .
   # ARF:  Creatinine trending down to 1.1, which suggests that the
   decrease in his GFR previously was due to poor forward flow and renal
   vein congestion (i.e. pre-renal ARF).
   -          Expect improvement as milrinone helps forward flow
   -          Closely monitor creatinine as we have increased Lasix gtt
   # Anemia
 Hct stable; unclear baseline; recent GIB w/ C-scope showing
   colonic AVM that was cauterized
   -          Trend hematocrit
   -          Guaiac stools

   # Low back pain:  Presumed [**1-22**] chronic lumbar back disease, but will

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral valve stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted for evaluation of aortic stenosis and found to have MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock. The patient's signs of fluid overload are mildly better today, suggesting that the treatment with milrinone and lasix is helping to mobilize fluid forward in the context of his aortic stenosis and poor ejection fraction. His cardiac index has improved from 1.8 to 2.7, indicating better cardiac function. The patient's creatinine level is trending down, and his urine output has increased after starting lasix, suggesting improved kidney function. The patient's atrial fibrillation is well-controlled on digoxin, but he may need cardioversion in the future. Hemoptysis occurred due to heparin therapy, so heparin was discontinued. An NG tube was placed to decompress and a PPI IV was given to decrease bleeding. The patient's nausea was likely caused by morphine, and he will continue with a robust bowel regimen. Pulmonary pressures are elevated, and the patient has severe COPD. A pulmonary consult service is following the case. The patient underwent aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve area."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of CHF, aortic stenosis, and sepsis. He presented with symptoms of heart failure, including shortness of breath, edema, and fatigue. The patient has been experiencing persistent nausea, coffee ground emesis, and is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been receiving treatment for sepsis with nafcillin and is on multiple medications for heart failure management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coffee ground emesis and ongoing nausea indicate a potential risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. This could be due to stress ulcers caused by severe illness or medication use.

2. Sepsis: Despite being on appropriate antibiotics, the patient's leukocytosis and elevated D-dimer levels suggest ongoing infection and potential sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary.

3. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's history of CHF and current symptoms of edema, fatigue, and tachycardia indicate an exacerbation of heart failure. It is crucial to monitor fluid balance and adjust medications accordingly.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, which can contribute to hemodynamic instability and increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Rate control and anticoagulation should be considered.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's plate"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS s/p
   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # SHOCK.  The patient
s biggest problem right now is shock in multiple
   forms: septic (as evidenced by increasing white count) and cardiogenic
   (poor EF, ventricular dyssynchrony, and myocardial stunning from
   sepsis).
   ***SEPTIC SHOCK***
   -          Elevated white count. The etiology of his septic shock is
   unclear. Although his UA was suspicious, his UCx is negative. His Foley
   was pulled and a new one was placed. He has negative CXR from
   yesterday. He still has diarrhea today but his stool c. diff is
   negative.  Blood cultures from yesterday are still NGTD, and we will
   send surveillance cultures today. Other potential sources include his
   cordis/swan and PICC lines.  We will consider pulling these lines
   today, possibly cordis/swan will be removed during this afternoon
   procedure. At this time we are treating his sepsis empirically.
   -          Pressors
    He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin,
   zosyn, and flagyl, to cover most bugs that might be causing his shock.
   His c. diff came back negative yesterday.  Anion-gap metabolic acidosis
   suggests potential infectious etiology.
   ***Plan for treating septic shock:
   -          RUQ US to look for potential infectious source in biliary
   tree, check LFTs
   -          Will consider pulling cordis, swan, PICC line during the day
   as these might be possible source of infection. Note that the swan is
   coiled in the RA.
   -          goal MAPs >55, treated with phenylephrine and vasopressin
   ***Plan for treating cardiogenic shock:
   - He has been aneuric so he will be increasingly fluid overloaded as
   IVs are continued.
   - continue milrinone to increase contractility
   - cont metoprolol to decrease HR, thereby increasing SV
   - We may consider restarting digoxin, but because he has ARF he might
   not need it. ?check dig level
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need ablation or cardiac resync therapy to make his enhance his
   cardiac output
   # ARF. Cr. 3.2 from 2.2 yesterday in AM. BUN also rising (49 from low
   40s). Aneuric and he is getting more volume overloaded (especially
   arms), and he is becoming less oriented. Likely etiology is ATN,
   possibly from aggressive vasoconstriction with pressors as well as
   decreased perfusion pressure from sepsis.
   - Renal reccs are in
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need CVVH, not candidate for HD because his BP would drop too
   much. This should help his hyponatremia as well.
   # Afib. Rate is now better controlled on lopressor 100mg TID (BP
   controlled with pressors). Goals 60-70, now in the 80s. Also written
   for PRN lopressor in case it
s needed.
   # CHF. Cannot get volume off because aneuria, would need CVVH for this.
   # Leukocytosis. On Vanc, zosyn, flagyl. UA suspicious, UCx, BCx,
   pending. CXR (negative for PNA), and C.diff negative.
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.
   -          Pulmonary recs
   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more
   medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for AVR.
   # MSSA bacteremia:  Unclear source; surveillance culture remain
   negative.
    - No longer on nafcillin, but is otherwise covered by broad spectrum
   antibiotics.
   .
   # Liver failure:  Transaminitis resolving, synthetic function
   improving. Likely [**1-22**] shock liver
   - Avoid hepatotoxic medications
   - Tylenol 2gm max/24 hrs
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable; unclear baseline; recent GIB w/ C-scope showing
   colonic AVM that was cauterized
   -          Trend hematocrit

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral valve stenosis, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and found to have MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock. The patient's current condition is unstable, and he is experiencing multiple complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a potential ongoing infection. Blood cultures are pending, and he is being treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Possible sources of infection include the Foley catheter, PICC line, and cordis/swan lines. These lines may need to be removed or replaced if they are identified as potential sources of infection.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has poor left ventricular ejection fraction (EF 25%) and ventricular dyssynchrony. He is currently receiving inotropic support with milrinone to increase contractility and vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. Metoprolol is being used to control heart rate and improve stroke volume.

   Assessment and Plan
   64M with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS s/p
   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # SHOCK.  The patient
s biggest problem right now is shock, both
   cardiogenic and septic, as evidenced by hypotension, anuria, change in
   mental status, and metabolic acidosis.
   ***SEPTIC SHOCK***
   -          The patient has a leukocytosis of 28, tachycardia,
   tachypnea, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, increasing need for pressors,
   all of which point towards a diagnosis of septic shock, but the
   etiology is unclear at this time. Although his UA was suspicious, his
   UCx is negative. His Foley was pulled and a new one was placed. He has
   negative CXR from yesterday. He still has diarrhea today but his stool
   c. diff is negative x1.  Blood cultures from yesterday are still NGTD,
   and we will send surveillance cultures today. Other potential sources
   include his cordis/swan and PICC lines.  Swan will be pulled this AM,
   other lines potentially pulled later today.
   -          At this time we are treating his sepsis empirically with
   vancomycin ([**2114-5-7**]=day 1), zosyn ([**2114-5-7**]=day 1), and flagyl
   ([**2114-5-7**]=day 1), awaiting blood cultures and sensitivities.
   -          We ordered ultrasound of abdomen to look for infectious
   source in biliary tree. Check LFTs as well.
   -          His profound hypotension is primarily due to sepsis. Because
   milrinone is contributing partially to his hypotension, we will try to
   wean it today. He is getting maximal doses of phenylephrine and
   vasopressin with a goal of MAP >55.
   ***CARDIOGENIC SHOCK***
   -          The patient has cardiogenic shock (i.e. cardiac pump failure
   as evidenced by poor EF), which is due to a combination of dilated
   cardiomyopathy, ventricular dyssynchrony, atrial fibrillation,
   tachycardia, and probable myocardial stunning from sepsis. Primary
   therapy to this point has been to treat him with inotropy (i.e.
   milrinone). He was also treated with amiodarone for a-fib and
   metoprolol for tachycardia, which we believe will increase his cardiac
   output by allowing for more time for better diastolic filling. Despite
   these efforts to increase his cardiac output, his SVR is dropping
   further (from sepsis) and his heart cannot increase the CO to
   sufficiently compensate. He will thus need to be taken to the cath lab
   this PM to undergo cardioversion (to reverse a-fib and thus decrease
   tachycardia), and [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacing to reverse his ventricular
   dyssynchrony.
   -          He is getting maximal doses of phenylephrine and vasopressin
   with a goal of MAP >55.
   # ARF. Cr. 3.2 from 2.2 yesterday in AM. BUN also rising (49 from low
   40s). Aneuric and he is getting more volume overloaded (especially
   arms), and he is becoming less oriented. Likely etiology is ATN,
   possibly from aggressive vasoconstriction with pressors as well as
   decreased perfusion pressure from sepsis.
   - Will call renal consult
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need CVVH (not candidate for HD because his BP would drop too
   much). Indications would include severe volume overload (i.e.
   increasing O2 requirement, which he does not need right now), uremia
   (including metabolic acidosis), or severe electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Afib. Rate is now better controlled on lopressor 100mg TID (BP
   controlled with pressors). Goals 60-70, now in the 80s. Also written
   for PRN lopressor in case it
s needed.
   # CHF. More fluid overloaded today than previously. Cannot get volume
   off because anuria, would need CVVH for this, renal was consulted will
   leave a note today.
   # Leukocytosis. Trending up, most likely due to an infection.
   Empirically treated on Vanc, zosyn, flagyl (all day 2). UA suspicious,
   UCx, BCx, pending. CXR (negative for PNA), and C.diff negative x1.
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.
   -          Pulmonary recs
   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more
   medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for AVR.
   # MSSA bacteremia:  Unclear source; surveillance culture remain
   negative.
    - No longer on nafcillin (14 day course), but is otherwise covered by
   broad spectrum antibiotics.

   # Coagulopathy. The patient
s INR is up today again, at 2.8. Etiology
   includes shock liver from sepsis, as well as sepsis itself.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension.
- The patient was admitted for evaluation of aortic stenosis and was found to have MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.
- The patient's biggest problem right now is shock, both cardiogenic and septic, as evidenced by hypotension, anuria, change in mental status, and metabolic acidosis.
- The patient has leukocytosis, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, tachycardia, and tachypnea, all of which point towards a diagnosis of septic shock, but the etiology is unclear at this time.
- The patient is being treated empirically with vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl for presumed evolving septic physiology.
- The patient has cardiogenic shock due to a combination of dilated cardiomyopathy, ventricular dyssynchrony, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, and probable myocardial stunning from sepsis.
- The patient will undergo cardioversion and [Hospital1]-ventricular pacing to reverse his ventricular dyssynchrony.
- The patient's renal function is deteriorating, with an increase in creatinine from 2.2 to 3.2 and rising BUN.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation is now better controlled on metoprolol.
- The patient has fluid overload and is becoming less oriented.
- The patient has pulmonary hypertension, with elevated pulmonary pressures.
- The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia, with unclear source.
- The patient has coagulopathy, likely due to shock liver from sepsis.
- The patient has anemia, likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding caused by a colonic arteriovenous malformation.
- The patient has low back pain, presumed to be chronic lumbar back disease, but will monitor for evidence of complications of bacteremia.
- The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely due to bone marrow suppression from bacteremia.
- The patient's diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia are well-controlled.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and hepatic dysfunction.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock can progress to severe heart failure and potentially lead to ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's deteriorating renal function, indicated by the rise in creatinine and BUN, may progress to acute kidney injury, requiring renal replacement therapy.
4. Coagulopathy:"

   milrinone). He was also treated with amiodarone for a-fib and
   metoprolol for tachycardia, which we believe will increase his cardiac
   output by allowing for more time for better diastolic filling. Despite
   these efforts to increase his cardiac output, his SVR is dropping
   further (from sepsis) and his heart cannot increase the CO to
   sufficiently compensate. He will thus need to be taken to the cath lab
   this PM to undergo cardioversion (to reverse a-fib and resultingly
   decrease tachycardia), and [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacing to reverse his
   ventricular dyssynchrony.

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. He presented with dyspnea on exertion and was transferred to the hospital for further evaluation of aortic stenosis. Upon admission, he was found to have MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

The patient's biggest problem right now is shock, both cardiogenic and septic, as evidenced by hypotension, anuria, change in mental status, and metabolic acidosis. He has a leukocytosis of 28, tachycardia, tachypnea, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, increasing need for pressors, all of which point towards a diagnosis of septic shock, but the etiology is unclear at this time. Although his urine culture was suspicious, his blood culture is negative. His Foley catheter was removed and a new one was placed. He has a negative chest X-ray from yesterday, but still has diarrhea today, and his stool Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test is negative. Blood cultures from yesterday are still pending, and surveillance cultures will be sent today. Other potential sources of infection include his cordis/swan and peripherally inserted central catheter"

   Assessment and Plan

   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # SHOCK.  The patient
s biggest problem right now is shock in multiple
   forms: septic (as evidenced by increasing white count) and cardiogenic
   (poor EF, ventricular dyssynchrony, and myocardial stunning from
   sepsis). The etiology of his septic shock currently seems to be urinary
   given his UA, but we will need to f/u on urince cultures. He was
   started on broad spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, zosyn, and
   flagyl, to cover most bugs that might be causing his shock. His c. diff
   came back negative yesterday.  Anion-gap metabolic acidosis suggests
   potential infectious etiology.
   ***Plan for treating septic shock:
   - Consider pulling cordis as could be source of infection, replace it
   as well
   - Swan is coiled in the RA, we will need to pull this and re-float a
   new one
   - To be safe, we may consider pulling PICC line as it also may be
   source of infection
   - goal MAPs >55, treated with phenylephrine and vasopressin

   - He has been aneuric so lasix was discontinued

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral valve disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital for dyspnea on exertion and found to have MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock. The patient's current condition is complicated by multiple organ dysfunction including respiratory, renal, hepatic, hematological, and cardiovascular systems. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, and other supportive measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock due to MSSA bacteremia. It is crucial to continue aggressive management with antibiotics and hemodynamic support to prevent further deterioration.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has cardiogenic shock secondary to his severe aortic stenosis and ventricular dyssynchrony. Continued management with inotropic support, afterload reduction, and rate control is necessary.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury, possibly due to sepsis-induced renal dysfunction or acute tubular necrosis. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) may be required for fluid overload and electrolyte management.
4. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient has evidence of liver dysfunction with"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of aortic stenosis and was found to have methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

The patient's current medications include vasopressin, phenylephrine, milrinone, pantoprazole, metoprolol, heparin sodium, and various antibiotics. He is also receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation and hemodynamic support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis and septic shock. It is important to monitor his vital signs closely and administer appropriate antibiotics to treat the infection.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, likely due to his severe aortic stenosis and underlying cardiomyopathy. Close monitoring of his hemodynamic status and continued support with vasopressors and inotropes are necessary.

3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has elevated pulmonary pressures, which may be"

   Assessment and Plan
   64M with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS s/p
   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # SHOCK.  The patient
s biggest problem right now is shock in multiple
   forms: septic and cardiogenic
   ***SEPTIC SHOCK***
   -          The patient has a leukocytosis of 28, tachycardia,
   tachypnea, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, increasing need for pressors,
   all of which point towards a diagnosis of sepsis and shock, but the
   etiology is unclear at this time. Although his UA was suspicious, his
   UCx is negative. His Foley was pulled and a new one was placed. He has
   negative CXR from yesterday. He still has diarrhea today but his stool
   c. diff is negative.  Blood cultures from yesterday are still NGTD, and
   we will send surveillance cultures today. Other potential sources
   include his cordis/swan and PICC lines.  Swan will be pulled this AM,
   other lines potentially pulled later today.
   -          At this time we are treating his sepsis empirically with
   vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl, awaiting blood cultures and
   sensitivities.
   -          We ordered ultrasound of abdomen to look for infectious
   source in biliary tree. Check LFTs as well.
   -          We are treating his hypotension with maximal doses of
   phenylephrine and vasopressin with a goal of MAP >55.
   -          goal MAPs >55, treated with phenylephrine and vasopressin
   ***CARDIOGENIC SHOCK***
   -          The patient has cardiogenic shock (poor EF, ventricular
   dyssynchrony, and myocardial stunning from sepsis).
   ***Plan for treating cardiogenic shock:
   - He has been aneuric so he will be increasingly fluid overloaded as
   IVs are continued.
   - continue milrinone to increase contractility
   - cont metoprolol to decrease HR, thereby increasing SV
   - We may consider restarting digoxin, but because he has ARF he might
   not need it. ?check dig level
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need ablation or cardiac resync therapy to make his enhance his
   cardiac output
   # ARF. Cr. 3.2 from 2.2 yesterday in AM. BUN also rising (49 from low
   40s). Aneuric and he is getting more volume overloaded (especially
   arms), and he is becoming less oriented. Likely etiology is ATN,
   possibly from aggressive vasoconstriction with pressors as well as
   decreased perfusion pressure from sepsis.
   - Renal reccs are in
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need CVVH, not candidate for HD because his BP would drop too
   much. This should help his hyponatremia as well.
   # Afib. Rate is now better controlled on lopressor 100mg TID (BP
   controlled with pressors). Goals 60-70, now in the 80s. Also written
   for PRN lopressor in case it
s needed.
   # CHF. Cannot get volume off because aneuria, would need CVVH for this.
   # Leukocytosis. On Vanc, zosyn, flagyl. UA suspicious, UCx, BCx,
   pending. CXR (negative for PNA), and C.diff negative.
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient presented with dyspnea on exertion and was admitted to the intensive care unit for further evaluation of aortic stenosis. 

During his hospital stay, the patient developed multiple complications, including MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic liver failure. He also has leukocytosis, anemia, low back pain, thrombocytopenia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia. The patient requires ongoing medical support with vasopressors, inotropes, and renal replacement therapy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of cardiogenic shock, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and further deterioration of renal function. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent these complications and improve his chances of recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   64M with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS s/p
   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # SHOCK.  The patient
s biggest problem right now is shock, both
   cardiogenic and septic, as evidenced by hypotension, anuria, change in
   mental status, and metabolic acidosis.
   - currently on milrinone, neosynephrine, and vasopressin
   ***SEPTIC SHOCK***
   -          The patient has a leukocytosis of 28, tachycardia,
   tachypnea, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, increasing need for pressors,
   all of which point towards a diagnosis of septic shock, but the
   etiology is unclear at this time. Although his UA was suspicious, his
   UCx is negative. His Foley was pulled and a new one was placed. He has
   negative CXR from yesterday. He still has diarrhea today but his stool
   c. diff is negative x1.  Blood cultures from yesterday are still NGTD,
   and we will send surveillance cultures today. Other potential sources
   include his cordis/swan and PICC lines.  Swan will be pulled this AM,
   other lines potentially pulled later today.
   -          At this time we are treating his sepsis empirically with
   vancomycin ([**2114-5-7**]=day 1), zosyn ([**2114-5-7**]=day 1), and flagyl
   ([**2114-5-7**]=day 1), awaiting blood cultures and sensitivities.
   -          We ordered ultrasound of abdomen to look for infectious
   source in biliary tree. Check LFTs as well.
   -          His profound hypotension is primarily due to sepsis. Because
   milrinone is contributing partially to his hypotension, we will try to
   wean it today. He is getting maximal doses of phenylephrine and
   vasopressin with a goal of MAP >55.
   ***CARDIOGENIC SHOCK***
   -          The patient has cardiogenic shock (i.e. cardiac pump failure
   as evidenced by poor EF), which is due to a combination of dilated
   cardiomyopathy, ventricular dyssynchrony, atrial fibrillation,
   tachycardia, and probable myocardial stunning from sepsis. Primary
   therapy to this point has been to treat him with inotropy (i.e.
   milrinone). He was also treated with amiodarone for a-fib and
   metoprolol for tachycardia, which we believe will increase his cardiac
   output by allowing for more time for better diastolic filling. Despite
   these efforts to increase his cardiac output, his SVR is dropping
   further (from sepsis) and his heart cannot increase the CO to
   sufficiently compensate. He will thus need to be taken to the cath lab
   this PM to undergo cardioversion (to reverse a-fib and thus decrease
   tachycardia), and [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacing to reverse his ventricular
   dyssynchrony.
   -          He is getting maximal doses of phenylephrine and vasopressin
   with a goal of MAP >55.
   # ARF. Cr. 3.2 from 2.2 yesterday in AM. BUN also rising (49 from low
   40s). Aneuric and he is getting more volume overloaded (especially
   arms), and he is becoming less oriented. Likely etiology is ATN,
   possibly from aggressive vasoconstriction with pressors as well as
   decreased perfusion pressure from sepsis.
   - Renal following, appreciate recommendations
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need CVVH (not candidate for HD because his BP would drop too
   much). Indications would include severe volume overload (i.e.
   increasing O2 requirement, which he does not need right now), uremia
   (including metabolic acidosis), or severe electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Afib. Rate is now better controlled on lopressor 100mg TID (BP
   controlled with pressors). Goals 60-70, now in the 80s. Also written
   for PRN lopressor in case it
s needed.
   # CHF. More fluid overloaded today than previously. Cannot get volume
   off because anuria, would need CVVH for this, renal was consulted will
   leave a note today.
   # Leukocytosis. Trending up, most likely due to an infection.
   Empirically treated on Vanc, zosyn, flagyl (all day 2). UA suspicious,
   UCx, BCx, pending. CXR (negative for PNA), and C.diff negative x1.
   - continue Vanc/zosyn/flagyl (IV changed to PO)
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.
   -          Pulmonary recs
   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more
   medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for AVR.

   negative.
    - No longer on nafcillin (14 day course), but is otherwise covered by
   broad spectrum antibiotics.

   Assessment and Plan
   64M with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS s/p
   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # SHOCK.  The patient
s biggest problem right now is shock in multiple
   forms: septic (as evidenced by increasing white count) and cardiogenic
   (poor EF, ventricular dyssynchrony, and myocardial stunning from
   sepsis). The etiology of his septic shock currently seems to be urinary
   given his UA but his UCx is negative. He was started on broad spectrum
   antibiotics, including vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl, to cover most
   bugs that might be causing his shock. His c. diff came back negative
   yesterday.  Anion-gap metabolic acidosis suggests potential infectious
   etiology.
   ***Plan for treating septic shock:
   -          RUQ US to look for potential infectious source in biliary
   tree, check LFTs
   -          Will consider pulling cordis, swan, PICC line during the day
   as these might be possible source of infection. Note that the swan is
   coiled in the RA.
   -          goal MAPs >55, treated with phenylephrine and vasopressin
   ***Plan for treating cardiogenic shock:
   - He has been aneuric so he will be increasingly fluid overloaded as
   IVs are continued.
   - continue milrinone to increase contractility
   - cont metoprolol to decrease HR, thereby increasing SV
   - We may consider restarting digoxin, but because he has ARF he might
   not need it. ?check dig level
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need ablation or cardiac resync therapy to make his enhance his
   cardiac output
   # ARF. Cr. 3.2 from 2.2 yesterday in AM. BUN also rising (49 from low
   40s). Aneuric and he is getting more volume overloaded (especially
   arms), and he is becoming less oriented. Likely etiology is ATN,
   possibly from aggressive vasoconstriction with pressors as well as
   decreased perfusion pressure from sepsis.
   - Renal reccs are in
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need CVVH, not candidate for HD because his BP would drop too
   much. This should help his hyponatremia as well.
   # Afib. Rate is now better controlled on lopressor 100mg TID (BP
   controlled with pressors). Goals 60-70, now in the 80s. Also written
   for PRN lopressor in case it
s needed.
   # CHF. Cannot get volume off because aneuria, would need CVVH for this.
   # Leukocytosis. On Vanc, zosyn, flagyl. UA suspicious, UCx, BCx,
   pending. CXR (negative for PNA), and C.diff negative.
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.

   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral valve disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. He was admitted with dyspnea on exertion and found to have MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock. The patient has multiple complications including acute kidney injury, anemia, atrial fibrillation, liver failure, thrombocytopenia, low back pain, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by a severe immune response to an infection. It can lead to organ failure and death if not promptly treated.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient also has cardiogenic shock, which occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This can further worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of complications.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function has deteriorated, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels and oliguria. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. Anemia can contribute to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm that can lead to poor blood flow, increased risk of stroke, and other cardiovascular complications.
6. Liver failure: The patient has evidence of liver dysfunction, including elevated liver enzymes and decreased albumin levels. Liver failure can result in jaundice, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, putting him at risk for bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
8. Low back pain: The patient's low back pain may be related to chronic lumbar back disease, but it is important to monitor for evidence of complications like epidural abscess.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has elevated lipid levels, which are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Management of hyperlipidemia is crucial in reducing this risk.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional are necessary to determine the exact nature and severity of the patient's conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   64M with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS s/p
   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # SHOCK.  The patient
s biggest problem right now is shock, both
   cardiogenic and septic, as evidenced by hypotension, anuria, change in
   mental status, and metabolic acidosis.
   ***SEPTIC SHOCK***
   -          The patient has a leukocytosis of 28, tachycardia,
   tachypnea, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, increasing need for pressors,
   all of which point towards a diagnosis of septic shock, but the
   etiology is unclear at this time. Although his UA was suspicious, his
   UCx is negative. His Foley was pulled and a new one was placed. He has
   negative CXR from yesterday. He still has diarrhea today but his stool
   c. diff is negative x1.  Blood cultures from yesterday are still NGTD,
   and we will send surveillance cultures today. Other potential sources
   include his cordis/swan and PICC lines.  Swan will be pulled this AM,
   other lines potentially pulled later today.
   -          At this time we are treating his sepsis empirically with
   vancomycin ([**2114-5-7**]=day 1), zosyn ([**2114-5-7**]=day 1), and flagyl
   ([**2114-5-7**]=day 1), awaiting blood cultures and sensitivities.
   -          We ordered ultrasound of abdomen to look for infectious
   source in biliary tree. Check LFTs as well.
   -          His profound hypotension is primarily due to sepsis. Because
   milrinone is contributing partially to his hypotension, we will try to
   wean it today. He is getting maximal doses of phenylephrine and
   vasopressin with a goal of MAP >55.
   ***CARDIOGENIC SHOCK***
   -          The patient has cardiogenic shock (i.e. cardiac pump failure
   as evidenced by poor EF), which is due to a combination of dilated
   cardiomyopathy, ventricular dyssynchrony, atrial fibrillation,
   tachycardia, and probable myocardial stunning from sepsis. Primary
   therapy to this point has been to treat him with inotropy (i.e.
   milrinone). He was also treated with amiodarone for a-fib and
   metoprolol for tachycardia, which we believe will increase his cardiac
   output by allowing for more time for better diastolic filling. Despite
   these efforts to increase his cardiac output, his SVR is dropping
   further (from sepsis) and his heart cannot increase the CO to
   sufficiently compensate. He will thus need to be taken to the cath lab
   this PM to undergo cardioversion (to reverse a-fib and thus decrease
   tachycardia), and [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacing to reverse his ventricular
   dyssynchrony.
   -          He is getting maximal doses of phenylephrine and vasopressin
   with a goal of MAP >55.
   # ARF. Cr. 3.2 from 2.2 yesterday in AM. BUN also rising (49 from low
   40s). Aneuric and he is getting more volume overloaded (especially
   arms), and he is becoming less oriented. Likely etiology is ATN,
   possibly from aggressive vasoconstriction with pressors as well as
   decreased perfusion pressure from sepsis.
   - Will call renal consult
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need CVVH (not candidate for HD because his BP would drop too
   much). Indications would include severe volume overload (i.e.
   increasing O2 requirement, which he does not need right now), uremia
   (including metabolic acidosis), or severe electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Afib. Rate is now better controlled on lopressor 100mg TID (BP
   controlled with pressors). Goals 60-70, now in the 80s. Also written
   for PRN lopressor in case it
s needed.
   # CHF. More fluid overloaded today than previously. Cannot get volume
   off because anuria, would need CVVH for this, renal was consulted will
   leave a note today.
   # Leukocytosis. Trending up, most likely due to an infection.
   Empirically treated on Vanc, zosyn, flagyl (all day 2). UA suspicious,
   UCx, BCx, pending. CXR (negative for PNA), and C.diff negative x1.
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.
   -          Pulmonary recs
   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more
   medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for AVR.
   # MSSA bacteremia:  Unclear source; surveillance culture remain
   negative.
    - No longer on nafcillin (14 day course), but is otherwise covered by
   broad spectrum antibiotics.
   .
   # Coagulopathy. The patient
s INR is up today again, at 2.8. Etiology
   includes shock liver from sepsis, as well as sepsis itself.
   - f/u DIC labs

   # Liver failure:  Transaminitis resolving, synthetic function
   improving. Likely [**1-22**] shock liver

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 25%), severe aortic stenosis post aortoplasty, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea on exertion and transferred for further evaluation of aortic stenosis. Upon admission, he was found to have MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

The patient's biggest problem at the moment is shock, both cardiogenic and septic. The cardiogenic shock is due to a combination of dilated cardiomyopathy, ventricular dyssynchrony, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, and probable myocardial stunning from sepsis. The septic shock is evidenced by hypotension, anuria, change in mental status, and metabolic acidosis.

The patient is being treated with vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl for the MSSA bacteremia. The source of the bacteremia is unclear at this time. Other potential sources include his cordis/swan and PICC lines. The swan will be pulled this morning, and other lines may be pulled later today.

   Assessment and Plan
   64M with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS s/p
   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # SHOCK.  The patient
s biggest problem right now is shock, both
   cardiogenic and septic, as evidenced by hypotension, anuria, change in
   mental status, and metabolic acidosis.
   ***SEPTIC SHOCK***
   -          The patient has a leukocytosis of 28, tachycardia,
   tachypnea, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, increasing need for pressors,
   all of which point towards a diagnosis of septic shock, but the
   etiology is unclear at this time. Although his UA was suspicious, his
   UCx is negative. His Foley was pulled and a new one was placed. He has
   negative CXR from yesterday. He still has diarrhea today but his stool
   c. diff is negative.  Blood cultures from yesterday are still NGTD, and
   we will send surveillance cultures today. Other potential sources
   include his cordis/swan and PICC lines.  Swan will be pulled this AM,
   other lines potentially pulled later today.
   -          At this time we are treating his sepsis empirically with
   vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl, awaiting blood cultures and
   sensitivities.
   -          We ordered ultrasound of abdomen to look for infectious
   source in biliary tree. Check LFTs as well.
   -          We are treating his hypotension with maximal doses of
   phenylephrine and vasopressin with a goal of MAP >55.
   ***CARDIOGENIC SHOCK***
   -          The patient has cardiogenic shock (i.e. cardiac pump failure
   as evidenced by poor EF), which is due to a combination of dilated
   cardiomyopathy, ventricular dyssynchrony, atrial fibrillation,
   tachycardia, and probable myocardial stunning from sepsis. Primary
   therapy to this point has been to treat him with inotropy (i.e.
   milrinone). He was also treated with amiodarone for a-fib and
   metoprolol for tachycardia, which we believe will increase his cardiac
   output by allowing for more time for better diastolic filling. Despite
   these efforts to increase his cardiac output, his SVR is dropping
   further (from sepsis) and his heart cannot increase the CO to
   sufficiently compensate. He will thus need to be taken to the cath lab
   this PM to undergo cardioversion (to reverse a-fib and resultingly
   decrease tachycardia), and [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacing to reverse his
   ventricular dyssynchrony.
   -          Of note, we must remember that because milrinone causes
   vasodilatation, owever, because the medication also causes peripheral
   vasodilatation, he has needed additional pressors to compensate for the
   combined effects from milrinone and septic shock.
   -          We must also keep in mind that his volume overload is going
   to be only getting worse now that he is aneuric.
   # ARF. Cr. 3.2 from 2.2 yesterday in AM. BUN also rising (49 from low
   40s). Aneuric and he is getting more volume overloaded (especially
   arms), and he is becoming less oriented. Likely etiology is ATN,
   possibly from aggressive vasoconstriction with pressors as well as
   decreased perfusion pressure from sepsis.
   - Renal reccs are in
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need CVVH, not candidate for HD because his BP would drop too
   much. This should help his hyponatremia as well.
   # Afib. Rate is now better controlled on lopressor 100mg TID (BP
   controlled with pressors). Goals 60-70, now in the 80s. Also written
   for PRN lopressor in case it
s needed.
   # CHF. Cannot get volume off because aneuria, would need CVVH for this.
   # Leukocytosis. On Vanc, zosyn, flagyl. UA suspicious, UCx, BCx,
   pending. CXR (negative for PNA), and C.diff negative.
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.
   -          Pulmonary recs
   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more
   medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for AVR.
   # MSSA bacteremia:  Unclear source; surveillance culture remain
   negative.
    - No longer on nafcillin, but is otherwise covered by broad spectrum
   antibiotics.
   .
   # Liver failure:  Transaminitis resolving, synthetic function
   improving. Likely [**1-22**] shock liver
   - Avoid hepatotoxic medications
   - Tylenol 2gm max/24 hrs
   .

   # Low back pain:  Presumed [**1-22**] chronic lumbar back disease, but will
   monitor for evidence of complication of bacteremia (epidural abscess)
   - Tramadol

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis (AS), rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and pulmonary hypertension (PH). He was admitted to the hospital for dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and evaluation of AS. However, he was found to have methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock.

The patient's current condition is critical, and he is experiencing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is already diagnosed with septic shock, which is characterized by hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, increasing need for pressors, and a high white blood cell count (leukocytosis). The source of infection is unclear, but possible sources include his central lines, Foley catheter, or gastrointestinal tract.

2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient also has cardiogenic shock due to poor left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), ventricular dyssynchrony, atrial fibrillation (AF), tachycardia, and myocardial"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and a recent gastrointestinal bleed. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute renal failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and hypotension. The patient underwent various interventions in the cath lab, including placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter, but no cardiac intervention was performed. He is currently on multiple vasopressors and has elevated levels of D-dimer and fibrinogen. His condition remains unstable with persistent hypotension, acute respiratory failure, and ongoing pain management needs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and acute renal failure diagnosis. This can lead to further fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and accumulation of waste products.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which may result in ongoing blood loss, anemia, and potential rebleeding events.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's chronic heart failure may worsen due to the underlying conditions and the stress on the cardiovascular system from the vasopressors and other treatments.
4. Sepsis: With elevated D-dimer levels and the presence of infection indicators, there is a risk of progressing to septic shock, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

   Assessment and Plan
   64M with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS s/p
   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # SHOCK.  The patient
s biggest problem right now is shock, both
   cardiogenic and septic, as evidenced by hypotension, anuria, change in
   mental status, and metabolic acidosis.
   - currently on milrinone, neosynephrine, and vasopressin
   ***SEPTIC SHOCK***
   -          The patient has a leukocytosis of 28, tachycardia,
   tachypnea, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, increasing need for pressors,
   all of which point towards a diagnosis of septic shock, but the
   etiology is unclear at this time. Although his UA was suspicious, his
   UCx is negative. His Foley was pulled and a new one was placed. He has
   negative CXR from yesterday. He still has diarrhea today but his stool
   c. diff is negative x1.  Blood cultures from yesterday are still NGTD,
   and we will send surveillance cultures today. Other potential sources
   include his cordis/swan and PICC lines.  Swan will be pulled this AM,
   other lines potentially pulled later today.
   -          At this time we are treating his sepsis empirically with
   vancomycin ([**2114-5-7**]=day 1), zosyn ([**2114-5-7**]=day 1), and flagyl
   ([**2114-5-7**]=day 1), awaiting blood cultures and sensitivities.
   -          We ordered ultrasound of abdomen to look for infectious
   source in biliary tree. Check LFTs as well.
   -          His profound hypotension is primarily due to sepsis. Because
   milrinone is contributing partially to his hypotension, we will try to
   wean it today. He is getting maximal doses of phenylephrine and
   vasopressin with a goal of MAP >55.
   ***CARDIOGENIC SHOCK***
   -          The patient has cardiogenic shock (i.e. cardiac pump failure
   as evidenced by poor EF), which is due to a combination of dilated
   cardiomyopathy, ventricular dyssynchrony, atrial fibrillation,
   tachycardia, and probable myocardial stunning from sepsis. Primary
   therapy to this point has been to treat him with inotropy (i.e.
   milrinone). He was also treated with amiodarone for a-fib and
   metoprolol for tachycardia, which we believe will increase his cardiac
   output by allowing for more time for better diastolic filling. Despite
   these efforts to increase his cardiac output, his SVR is dropping
   further (from sepsis) and his heart cannot increase the CO to
   sufficiently compensate. He will thus need to be taken to the cath lab
   this PM to undergo cardioversion (to reverse a-fib and thus decrease
   tachycardia), and [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacing to reverse his ventricular
   dyssynchrony.
   -          He is getting maximal doses of phenylephrine and vasopressin
   with a goal of MAP >55.
   # ARF. Cr. 3.2 from 2.2 yesterday in AM. BUN also rising (49 from low
   40s). Aneuric and he is getting more volume overloaded (especially
   arms), and he is becoming less oriented. Likely etiology is ATN,
   possibly from aggressive vasoconstriction with pressors as well as
   decreased perfusion pressure from sepsis.
   - Renal following, appreciate recommendations
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need CVVH (not candidate for HD because his BP would drop too
   much). Indications would include severe volume overload (i.e.
   increasing O2 requirement, which he does not need right now), uremia
   (including metabolic acidosis), or severe electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Afib. Rate is now better controlled on lopressor 100mg TID (BP
   controlled with pressors). Goals 60-70, now in the 80s. Also written
   for PRN lopressor in case it
s needed.
   # CHF. More fluid overloaded today than previously. Cannot get volume
   off because anuria, would need CVVH for this, renal was consulted will
   leave a note today.
   # Leukocytosis. Trending up, most likely due to an infection.
   Empirically treated on Vanc, zosyn, flagyl (all day 2). UA suspicious,
   UCx, BCx, pending. CXR (negative for PNA), and C.diff negative x1.
   - continue Vanc/zosyn/flagyl (IV changed to PO)
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.
   -          Pulmonary recs
   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more
   medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for AVR.
   # MSSA bacteremia:  Unclear source; surveillance culture remain
   negative.
    - No longer on nafcillin (14 day course), but is otherwise covered by
   broad spectrum antibiotics.
   .
   # Coagulopathy. The patient
s INR is up today again, at 2.8. Etiology
   includes shock liver from sepsis, as well as sepsis itself.
   - f/u DIC labs

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and pulmonary hypertension. He was admitted to the hospital for shortness of breath on exertion and found to have MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock. He is currently in the ICU receiving multiple vasopressors and inotropic support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which is characterized by hypotension, tachycardia, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, and leukocytosis. The etiology of sepsis is unclear at this time. The patient is being treated empirically with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole while awaiting blood culture results.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has cardiogenic shock due to poor left ventricular function caused by dilated cardiomyopathy, ventricular dyssynchrony, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, and myocardial stunning from sepsis. He is receiving inotropic support with milrinone.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's serum creatinine has risen from 2.2 to 3.2 mg/dL, indicating acute kidney injury. The likely etiology is acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to aggressive vasoconstriction with pressors and decreased perfusion pressure from sepsis.
4. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's pulmonary pressures are elevated out of proportion to his aortic stenosis alone. He has a known history of severe COPD and obesity, which may contribute to pulmonary hypertension.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of 2.8, indicating coagulopathy. This could be due to shock liver from sepsis and the sepsis itself.
6. Liver Failure: The patient has resolving transaminitis and improving synthetic function, suggesting liver failure due to septic shock.
7. Anemia: The patient has stable hematocrit levels, but his recent gastrointestinal bleeding with a colonic arteriovenous malformation that was cauterized may contribute to anemia.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable platelet counts, which are likely affected by sepsis, liver failure, and bone marrow suppression.

   64M with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 25%), severe AS s/p
   aortoplasty, rheumatic MS, DM, COPD, OSA & pulm HTN admitted to OSH
   with DOE, transferred for further evaluation of AS and found to have
   MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock
   # SHOCK.  The patient
s biggest problem right now is shock, both
   cardiogenic and septic, as evidenced by hypotension, anuria, change in
   mental status, and metabolic acidosis.
   - currently on milrinone, neosynephrine, and vasopressin
   ***SEPTIC SHOCK***
   -          The patient has a leukocytosis of 28, tachycardia,
   tachypnea, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, increasing need for pressors,
   all of which point towards a diagnosis of septic shock, but the
   etiology is unclear at this time. Although his UA was suspicious, his
   UCx is negative. His Foley was pulled and a new one was placed. He has
   negative CXR from yesterday. He still has diarrhea today but his stool
   c. diff is negative x1.  Blood cultures from yesterday are still NGTD,
   and we will send surveillance cultures today. Other potential sources
   include his cordis/swan and PICC lines.  Swan will be pulled this AM,
   other lines potentially pulled later today.
   -          At this time we are treating his sepsis empirically with
   vancomycin ([**2114-5-7**]=day 1), zosyn ([**2114-5-7**]=day 1), and flagyl
   ([**2114-5-7**]=day 1), awaiting blood cultures and sensitivities.
   -          We ordered ultrasound of abdomen to look for infectious
   source in biliary tree. Check LFTs as well.
   -          His profound hypotension is primarily due to sepsis. Because
   milrinone is contributing partially to his hypotension, we will try to
   wean it today. He is getting maximal doses of phenylephrine and
   vasopressin with a goal of MAP >55.
   ***CARDIOGENIC SHOCK***
   -          The patient has cardiogenic shock (i.e. cardiac pump failure
   as evidenced by poor EF), which is due to a combination of dilated
   cardiomyopathy, ventricular dyssynchrony, atrial fibrillation,
   tachycardia, and probable myocardial stunning from sepsis. Primary
   therapy to this point has been to treat him with inotropy (i.e.
   milrinone). He was also treated with amiodarone for a-fib and
   metoprolol for tachycardia, which we believe will increase his cardiac
   output by allowing for more time for better diastolic filling. Despite
   these efforts to increase his cardiac output, his SVR is dropping
   further (from sepsis) and his heart cannot increase the CO to
   sufficiently compensate. He will thus need to be taken to the cath lab
   this PM to undergo cardioversion (to reverse a-fib and thus decrease
   tachycardia), and [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular pacing to reverse his ventricular
   dyssynchrony.
   -          He is getting maximal doses of phenylephrine and vasopressin
   with a goal of MAP >55.
   # ARF. Cr. 3.2 from 2.2 yesterday in AM. BUN also rising (49 from low
   40s). Aneuric and he is getting more volume overloaded (especially
   arms), and he is becoming less oriented. Likely etiology is ATN,
   possibly from aggressive vasoconstriction with pressors as well as
   decreased perfusion pressure from sepsis.
   - Renal following, appreciate recommendations
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need CVVH (not candidate for HD because his BP would drop too
   much). Indications would include severe volume overload (i.e.
   increasing O2 requirement, which he does not need right now), uremia
   (including metabolic acidosis), or severe electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Afib. Rate is now better controlled on lopressor 100mg TID (BP
   controlled with pressors). Goals 60-70, now in the 80s. Also written
   for PRN lopressor in case it
s needed.
   # CHF. More fluid overloaded today than previously. Cannot get volume
   off because anuria, would need CVVH for this, renal was consulted will
   leave a note today.
   # Leukocytosis. Trending up, most likely due to an infection.
   Empirically treated on Vanc, zosyn, flagyl (all day 2). UA suspicious,
   UCx, BCx, pending. CXR (negative for PNA), and C.diff negative x1.
   - continue Vanc/zosyn/flagyl (IV changed to PO)
   # Pulmonary hypertension:  Pulmonary pressures elevated out of
   proportion to what would be expected with aortic stenosis alone.
   Patient with known severe COPD. Has body habitus concerning for OSA as
   well, although has not be desaturating at night. Pulmonary consult
   service following; will weigh in again once patient is more euvolemic
   given that PCWP is still elevated.
   -          Pulmonary recs
   # Aortic stenosis:  s/p aortoplasty with minimal improvement in valve
   area. Transaortic pressure gradient did improve by 30mmHG. Once more
   medically stabilized, he may be a candidate for AVR.
   # MSSA bacteremia:  Unclear source; surveillance culture remain
   negative.
    - No longer on nafcillin (14 day course), but is otherwise covered by
   broad spectrum antibiotics.
   .
   # Coagulopathy. The patient
s INR is up today again, at 2.8. Etiology
   includes shock liver from sepsis, as well as sepsis itself.
   - f/u DIC labs

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, rheumatic mitral stenosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. He was admitted with dyspnea on exertion and found to have MSSA bacteremia, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock. The patient's biggest problem is shock, both cardiogenic and septic. He is currently on multiple vasopressors and inotropic support. Other medical complications include acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, leukocytosis, pulmonary hypertension, liver failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, low back pain, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has poor left ventricular function due to dilated cardiomyopathy, which can lead to cardiogenic shock.
2. Septic shock: The patient has MSSA bacteremia and is showing signs of sepsis, which can progress to septic shock.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has anuria and rising creatinine levels, indicating potential acute kidney injury.
4. Liver failure: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and coagulopathy, suggesting possible liver dysfunction.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to sepsis, liver"
