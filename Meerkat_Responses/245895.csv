   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 83 yo fm with hx of AS, CAD s/p 1V [**Hospital 8408**] transfered from
   OSH with 98% left main disease.
   .
   #. CAD: Stable on medical managment.  OSH Cath shows showed 98%
   discrete distal left main disease, 90% proximal/mid/distal RCA, patent
   RIMA-distal RCA, 85% mid right external iliac stenosis.  Patient is at
   very high risk for PCI with 98% distal left main disease. The patient
   is a poor substrate for IABP given her peripheral vascular disease.
   Has patent RIMA-RCA that is likely providing collateral flow to her
   LAD.  Patient's unstable angina has been medically managed on Nitro
   gtt, Heparin, Clopidogrel, ASA.  Given patient
s active GIB, heparin
   was discontinued last night.  Patient received 2u pRBC overnight with
   hct improvement from 22.7 to 27.1
   - continue nitro gtt
   - continue ASA 325mg daily, atorvastatin 80mg daily, Metoprolol
   Tartrate 37.5 mg Q6H
   - f/u TTE today
   - f/u Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recs on high risk PCI to distal LMCA with TandemHeart
   assistance, either today or on Monday
   .
   #.  Possible Lower GI bleed:  HCT at OSH 34 on admission, dropped to 28
   on transfer and 22.7 last night at [**Hospital1 19**].  Patient with BRBPR on Rectal
   Examination, no bloody bowel movement.  Heparin was discontinued last
   night in the setting of GIB.  This is less likely UGIB given no bump in
   BUN.  Patient reported having colonoscopy 5 years ago with no
   significant abnormalities except for some polyps, was told that she did
   not have to come back for 10 years.  Patient received 2u pRBC
   overnight, with hct bump from 22.7 to 27.1.  CT abd/pelvis ruled out RP
   bleed.
   - transfusion goal hct 30

   #. Pump: Patient appears euvolemic on exam.  Minimal basilar crackles,
   no evidence of R sided failure.  Patient was diursed at OSH.  Echo at
   OSH shows EF 60-65%, mod LVH, mod LAE, mild [**Last Name (un) **], nl functioning
   prosthetic aortic valve, mod/sev MR, mild/mod TR, mild PR.  Patient
   with III/VI SEM at RUSB, with Carotid upstroke delay.

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of atherosclerotic disease and coronary artery disease. She was transferred from OSH with 98% left main coronary artery disease and is currently being managed medically for unstable angina. The patient has undergone a cardiac catheterization that showed 98% distal left main disease, 90% proximal/mid/distal right coronary artery (RCA) stenosis, patent radial artery graft to distal RCA, and 85% mid right external iliac stenosis. Due to her high risk for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and peripheral vascular disease, she is a poor candidate for intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. 

The patient has a gastrointestinal bleed (GIB), which was initially suspected to be an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) due to her low hemoglobin (Hct) levels. However, it is now believed to be a lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB) given the absence of blood in the stool and no evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage on CT abdomen/pelvis. The patient received a blood transfusion overnight, resulting in an increase in her Hct from 22.7 to 27.1. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/44 to 153/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of Aortic Stenosis (AS) and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), who was admitted to the ICU for unstable angina. The patient has undergone several medical interventions and is currently on multiple medications for her conditions.

From the note, it is evident that the patient's cardiac status is stable, with an ejection fraction of 60-65% and no evidence of right-sided heart failure. However, there is a concern for peripheral vascular disease (PVD) due to the presence of femoral bruits and the need to avoid renal toxins. The patient also has chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III-IV and multiple well-circumscribed bilateral renal lesions, which require further evaluation through imaging or a renal ultrasound.

The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and adjustments to the antihypertensive medication have been made. Additionally, the patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) for which she is prescribed famotidine.

There are several potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions. These include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of AS and CAD, there is a risk of worsening heart failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial ischemia.
2. Renal complications: The presence of CKD and bilateral renal lesions increases the risk of further deterioration in renal function, potentially leading to acute"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of atherosclerotic disease (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD). She was transferred from OSH with 98% left main disease. The patient has been stable on medical management for CAD, with medications including nitroglycerin, heparin, clopidogrel, and aspirin. Due to her unstable angina and active gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), heparin was discontinued last night. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) overnight, resulting in an improvement in hematocrit (Hct) from 22.7 to 27.1.

The patient has multiple medical conditions, including possible lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The patient's blood pressure has been in the 160s range in the morning on 1/15. Her creatinine levels have been increasing over time, indicating worsening renal function.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 153/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The vital signs show a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate of 73 bpm with normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 153/64 mmHg to 111/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient has received multiple units of packed red blood cells overnight, which improved her hematocrit from 22.7% to 27.1%. 

Physical examination reveals a non-displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), regular heart sounds with normal S1 and S2, 3/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating to the carotids, bibasilar crackles in the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.9-7.3 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, creatinine of 1.5-1.6 mg/dL, blood glucose of 104 mg/dL, potassium of 4.1-4.2 mEq/L, and sodium of 140 mEq/L. Other lab values such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range.

The patient's CT abdomen/pelvis shows no evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage but reveals multiple well-circumscribed bilateral renal lesions, some of which may represent simple cysts. There is also extensive atherosclerotic calcification and disease with associated luminal narrowing.

The patient's plan includes continuing nitroglycerin, aspirin, atorvastatin, and metoprolol. Further evaluation of the renal lesions through ultrasound is recommended. The patient is at high risk for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to 98% disease in the distal left main coronary artery (LAD), and alternative options such as TandemHeart support during high-risk PCI are being considered.

Possible lower gastrointestinal bleed is suspected due to a drop in hemoglobin from 34 on admission to 22.7 last night, along with rectal bleeding on examination. However, CT abdomen/pelvis ruled out retroperitoneal bleed. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight, which improved her hematocrit from 22.7% to 27.1%. The goal hematocrit is 30%, and she will be started on oral famotidine.

The patient appears euvolemic on examination, with"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD), who was transferred from another hospital with 98% left main coronary artery disease. The patient is currently being managed medically for unstable angina. The patient has received blood transfusions overnight and has shown improvement in hematocrit levels. The patient's blood pressure remains high despite medication adjustments. The patient also has chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III-IV and multiple bilateral renal lesions seen on CT abdomen/pelvis. The patient has peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unstable Angina: The patient's symptoms of chest pain or discomfort could progress to a more severe heart attack if not properly managed.
2. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure readings indicate a risk of complications such as stroke or heart failure if not controlled.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The presence of multiple renal lesions and elevated creatinine levels suggest worsening kidney function, which may lead to further complications like fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.
4. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient's history of PVD increases the risk of complications related to circulation, such as claudication or even limb ischemia.
5. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The patient's symptoms of heartburn or acid reflux"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease who was transferred from another hospital with 98% left main coronary artery disease. She has been managed medically for unstable angina and has undergone a cardiac catheterization showing significant coronary artery disease. The patient has received blood transfusions and has shown stable hematocrit levels. She is currently on multiple medications including aspirin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, hydralazine, and famotidine.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with blood pressure in the 140s, heart rate in the 50s, respiratory rate in the 17s, and oxygen saturation at 95%. Her physical examination reveals a non-displaced point of maximal impulse, clear lung sounds, trace lower extremity edema, and warm and well-perfused extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels. Her electrolytes and other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:

1. CAD: The patient has significant coronary artery disease, which is being managed medically. Due to her high risk for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and peripheral vascular disease, she is not a suitable candidate for intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP).

She has been managed medically with nitroglycerin, heparin, clopidogrel, and aspirin. Her peripheral vascular disease makes her a poor candidate for intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) therapy. She has patent radial artery to distal circumflex artery (RIMA-RCA) collateral flow to her left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) on admission with stable hematocrit (Hct). 

The patient's echocardiogram (TTE) shows ejection fraction (EF) greater than 55%, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), normal global and regional systolic function. She has aortic valve bioprosthesis with thickened leaflets and abnormally-elevated gradients, mild calcific mitral stenosis, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

The patient is currently on aspirin (ASA) 325 mg daily, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, and clopidogrel 75 mg daily. She is also on metoprolol tartrate from 50 mg every 6 hours (Q6H), with plans to increase the dose. Her antih"

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD), who was transferred from another hospital with significant left main coronary artery disease. She has been managed medically with nitroglycerin, heparin, clopidogrel, and aspirin. However, due to her active gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), heparin was discontinued. The patient's unstable angina has been medically managed, but she is at high risk for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to her 98% distal left main disease. She also has patent saphenous vein graft-to-renal artery (RIMA-RCA) that may provide collateral flow to her left anterior descending artery (LAD). 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/45-185/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. She is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Her physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no peripheral edema. Her neurological assessment is not documented. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated creatinine level, and mildly abnormal liver function tests. Cardiac enzymes are within normal range"

   #. CAD: Stable on medical managment.  OSH Cath shows showed 98%
   discrete distal left main disease, 90% proximal/mid/distal RCA, patent
   RIMA-distal RCA, 85% mid right external iliac stenosis.  Patient is at
   very high risk for PCI with 98% distal left main disease. The patient
   is a poor substrate for IABP given her peripheral vascular disease.
   Has patent RIMA-RCA that is likely providing collateral flow to her
   LAD.  Patient's unstable angina has been medically managed on Nitro
   gtt, Heparin, Clopidogrel, ASA.  Given patient
s active GIB, heparin
   was discontinued on [**1-14**]. Nitro gtt weaned on [**1-16**]. Patient received 2u
   pRBC on admission, with stable Hct. TTE showed EF>55% with LVH with
   normal global and regional systolic function. Aortic valve
   bioprosthesis with thickened leaflets and abnormally-elevated
   gradients. Mild calcific mitral stenosis. Moderate to severe mitral
   regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
   hypertension. We are observing the ICU prior to her high risk procedure

   Examination, no bloody bowel movement.  Heparin was discontinued last
   night in the setting of GIB.  This is less likely UGIB given no bump in
   BUN.  Patient reported having colonoscopy 5 years ago with no
   significant abnormalities except for some polyps, was told that she did
   not have to come back for 10 years.  Patient received 2u pRBC
   yesterday, with hct bump from 22.7 to 27.1.  CT abd/pelvis ruled out RP
   bleed. Hct stable this AM. Will continue to follow.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who was transferred from another hospital with 98% left main coronary artery disease. The patient has undergone previous hospitalization for a cardiovascular event. She has been managed medically for unstable angina and has been on nitroglycerin, heparin, clopidogrel, and aspirin. Due to her active gastrointestinal bleeding, heparin was discontinued. The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and has stable hemoglobin (Hct) levels. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction (EF) >55% with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and normal global and regional systolic function. The patient also has a bioprosthetic aortic valve with thickened leaflets and abnormally-elevated gradients, mild calcific mitral stenosis, moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. The patient is currently being observed in the ICU prior to a high-risk procedure, high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with tandem heart - cardiac and vascular surgery aware.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery disease with 98% left main disease, which increases the risk of myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
2. Active gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with a drop in Hct from 34 to 22.7, possibly related to the use of heparin.
3. History of aortic stenosis (AS) with a bioprosthetic aortic valve, which may lead to symptoms such as syncope, chest pain, or heart failure.
4. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery with potential complications like bleeding, infection, or myocardial infarction.
5. Renal impairment with stage III-IV chronic kidney disease (CKD) and multiple well-circumscribed bilateral renal lesions, requiring careful monitoring and avoidance of renal toxins.
6. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with absent right and left distal pulses, indicating poor peripheral circulation.
7. GERD with potential complications like aspiration pneumonia or esophagitis."
