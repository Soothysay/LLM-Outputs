","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possible COPD, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease with a recent transmetatarsal amputation, and a history of TMA ulcer. The patient presents with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/Hypotension: The patient shows signs of sepsis, including fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and fluid resuscitation is being done cautiously due to ESRD. Pressors are being used to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and central venous pressure (CVP) between 10-12. Lactate levels are being trended, and blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures have been obtained. Serial chest X-rays and follow-up CT scans will be performed.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has obesity hypoventilation syndrome with possible underlying COPD. Increased CO2 levels are causing altered mental status, and BiPAP has been initiated to improve ventilation.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved with BiPAP, suggesting hypercarbia as a contributing factor. Other potential causes include infection, uremia, acidosis, and possible CNS infection. Invasive"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 66 yo M with obesity hypoventilation, ? COPD, afib, ESRD on HD,
   PVD with recent TMA ulcer, who presents with confusion, shortness of
   breath, fever and hypotension.
   .
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:
   Decreased pressor requirement this AM, clinically improved
   Presentation with fever and leukocytosis c/w sepsis
 source remains
   broad including line infection, wound infection. No radiographic
   evidence for pna. Adrenal insufficiency possible given chronic
   steroids, though less likely.
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn empirically
   - Follow up blood and urine cultures, check culture off HD line
   - Sputum culture if making sputum, legionella antigen
   - Flu swab
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   .
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:
   ABG on presentation consistent with acute on chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Improved on BiPAP, now off.
   - Reattempt ABG this AM, correlate with VBG
   - Resume BiPAP if increasing somnolence
   - Outpatient sleep study
   - Limit sedating meds
   .
   Altered Mental Status:
    Improved on BiPAP.  Picture consistent with delirium from hypercarbia
   vs. for sepsis.  No obvious focal symptoms currently to suggest
   stroke.  Must consider all infectious sources currently, though no
   meningismus.  Uremia may also be contributing, as well as hypercarbia
   and acidosis.  Lower suspicion for seizure, head CT neg for bleed.
   Wife also adamantly against invasive procedures
   - Treat possible infection as per above
   - Cont BiPAP with hopes of correcting hypercarbia
   - Correct acidosis by correcting hypercarbia, uremia with dialysis
   - Monitor lytes, ABGs
   - Haldol prn for agitation, hold benzos
   - Defer LP for now
   .
   Afib: Stable currently.  Not anticoagulated.  Hold metoprolol given
   hypotension.  Dig level 2
   - hold metoprolol
   - resume digoxin today
   .
   ESRD on HD: Failed graft.  Received HD TThSat.  Underwent uncomplicated
   dialysis on saturday.  K currently stable correct for hemolysis.
   - Renal consulted
   - Cont renal medications including prednisone for failed graft
   - Dose medications appropriately
   - Monitor electrolytes closely
   .
   PVD s/p TMA debridement: s/p surgery on [**5-11**].  Has known peripheral
   vascular disease.  Tissue culture without growth on culture.  Was seen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possibly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (afib), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The patient presents with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include:
1. Septic Shock/Hypotension: The patient has signs of sepsis such as fever and leukocytosis. Broad sources of infection, including line infection and wound infection, should be considered. The patient is already on vancomycin and zosyn empirically, and further follow-up with blood and urine cultures is recommended.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute on chronic respiratory acidosis, which improved with BiPAP. Continuous monitoring of ABG and VBG, and resuming BiPAP if necessary, are advised. An outpatient sleep study and limiting sedating medications should also be considered.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved with BiPAP, suggesting hypercarbia as a contributing factor. Other potential causes like sepsis, uremia, and acidosis should also be considered. Invasive procedures should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is stable"

","The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status. They have undergone several procedures and treatments, including the insertion of a multi-lumen catheter and a dialysis catheter. 

The patient has allergies to Neupogen (violent reaction), Neurontin (unknown reaction), and Dilaudid (hives). They received their last dose of antibiotics, Piperacillin, on 06/01/2116 at 08:34 PM.

They are currently receiving infusions of norepinephrine and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other ICU medications include BiPAP, Gabapentin, and Hydromorphone Hcl/Pf.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for impaired skin integrity. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), a current temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 80 bpm (with a range of 72-100 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 122/61 mmHg to 127/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (with a range of 13-32 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,279 mL (with 157 mL since 12 AM) and output of 1,219 mL (with 157 mL since 12 AM), resulting in a balance of 1,269 mL (with 142 mL since 12 AM). 

Respiratory support includes the use of BiPAP, and the patient's ABG results are not provided.

Physical examination findings include unassessed peripheral vascular status, not assessed skin condition, and not assessed neurologic status.

Lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, platelet count of 173 K/uL, creatinine level of 5.6 mg/dL, troponin T level of 0.92 mg/dL, and glucose level of 228 mg/dL. Other lab values, including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, are also provided.

Assessment and plan include altered mental status (not delirium), impaired skin integrity, renal failure (end stage), respiratory alkalosis, hypotension (not in shock), and other conditions.

ICU care involves nutrition support, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and comments regarding communication, code status, and disposition."

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with an altered mental status, who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of impaired skin integrity, renal failure (ESRD), respiratory alkalosis, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/61 to 85/26 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on BiPAP for respiratory support. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (12.0 K/uL), hemoglobin (9.7 g/dL), and platelet count (173 K/uL). Renal function tests reveal elevated creatinine (5.6 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Electrolyte imbalances are present, including low potassium (3.6 mEq/L), low chloride (96 mEq/L), and normal sodium (139 mEq/L) levels. The patient's glucose level is elevated at 228 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to Neupogen, Neurontin, and Dilaudid, as well as a recent course of antibiotics (Piperacillin). The patient is receiving multiple medications, including Norepinephrine, Heparin Sodium, and other ICU medications.

The patient's physical examination reveals atrial fibrillation and absent peripheral pulses. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's altered mental status. 

The patient's current assessment includes altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, renal failure, respiratory alkalosis, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has been started on dialysis and is being closely monitored in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possibly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease with a toe amputation and vascular access in place, presenting with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension. The patient has multiple medical complications and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient presented with fever, leukocytosis, and hypotension requiring pressors, which are consistent with septic shock. Possible sources of infection include pneumonia, wound infection/bacteremia, line infection, flu, or CNS source. Broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has obesity hypoventilation syndrome with possible underlying COPD. This could be worsened by fluid overload, infection, and atelectasis. BiPAP has improved the patient's mental status.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status improved on BiPAP, suggesting hypercarbia as a contributing factor. Other potential causes include sepsis, uremia, acidosis, and possible CNS infection. Invasive procedures should be avoided, and the patient's wife is adamant against them.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo with  with fevers, hypotensive, dyspnea and altered mental status
   with acute on chronic resp failure (OHV).  Concern for sepsis/septic
   shock with potential infection sources including HD line, R foot wound,
   lungHis MS is most likely explained by combination of infection,
   hypotension and more likely significant  hypercarbia --this seems to be
   improving with BiPAP. Unclear if he was getting frequent narcotics as
   sedating med effects likely further contributing
   >Sepsis: multiple sources for infection: HD line, recent TMA
   debridement, aspiration.  No obvious source of non infectious fevers
   (PE etc).  HD line seems most reasonable source but hesitant to remove
   in the absence of positive clx.
   - Vanco by level, Pip-Tazo for broad spectrum coverage for empiric 14
   day course
   - Obtain a clx
   - Cont NE requirement wean as tolerated
   - Judicious use of fluids.
   >Altered MS: multifactorial including infection (with increased
   metabolic production CO2) and OHV now much improved. Can - -
   -obtain VBG to follow his CO2. Would empirically use BiPAP for altered
   MS a
   >OHV: no documented sleep study but is hypercarbic
   - out pt sleep study
   - avoid narcotics
   >Renal failure: s/p failed cadaveric transplant.  HD T, Th, Sat
   (interrupted run on sat)
   - HD today (tolerating well on low dose NE)
   - cont 5 mg prednisone for chronic ejection
   >Afib:  Currently  in Afib s/p failed cardioversion (not on anti
   coagulation due to fall risk)
   - restart digoxin  (hold metop for now) on M, W, F dosing given high
   level on admit

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, hypotension, altered mental status, and recent transplant surgery. He is currently in the ICU with sepsis, suspected to be due to multiple sources including an indwelling catheter, recent tissue debridement, and aspiration. The patient has a history of failed cardioversion, renal failure post-transplant, and an atrial fibrillation rhythm. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/61 mmHg to 127/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and potassium levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin and platelet count. His CXR indicates a right-sided pleural effusion. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, renal replacement therapy, and other supportive measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's sepsis could progress to severe sepsis or septic shock if not properly managed.
2. Renal failure: The patient's pre-existing renal failure may worsen due to the ongoing infection and inadequate kidney function.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute on chronic respiratory failure could deteriorate further, leading to respiratory distress or respiratory arrest.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including acute renal failure post failed cadaveric transplant, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and obesity. The patient presented to the ICU with fevers, hypotension, dyspnea, and altered mental status, suggesting possible sepsis and septic shock. Initial assessment revealed several potential sources of infection, including a hemodialysis line, recent total mesorectal excision (TMA) debridement, and aspiration. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to hypercarbia, which has improved with the use of non-invasive positive airway pressure (BiPAP). 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to multiple sources of infection, including the hemodialysis line and recent TMA debridement. A blood culture is needed, and broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco and Pip-Tazo) should be administered for a 14-day course.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is multifactorial, including infection-related hypercarbia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OHV). BiPAP should be continued, and a arterial blood gas (VBG) should be obtained to monitor carbon dioxide levels.
3. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OHV): The patient's OHV has improved with BiPAP,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old overweight/obese individual with a medical history of renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and chronic respiratory failure. The patient presents with altered mental status, fever, hypotension, and difficulty breathing. There are concerns about sepsis/septic shock, with potential sources of infection including the hemodialysis line, right foot wound, and lungs. The patient is also taking prednisone for chronic conditions and has a possibility of adrenal insufficiency. The patient's mitral regurgitation is likely due to a combination of infection, hypotension, and hypercarbia, which seems to be improving with the use of BiPAP. The patient is not currently receiving oral intake (NPO) and is being managed with regular insulin for glycemic control. The patient has multiple lines inserted, including a multi-lumen line, 20-gauge line, and dialysis catheter. Prophylactic measures such as anticoagulation and stress ulcer medication are being administered. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status and is currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/septic shock: Given the patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, altered mental status, and acute respiratory failure, there is a high concern for sepsis or septic shock. Potential sources of infection include the hemodialysis line, right foot"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo with  with fevers, hypotensive, dyspnea and altered mental status
   with acute on chronic resp failure (OHV).  Concern for sepsis/septic
   shock with potential infection sources including HD line, R foot wound,
   lungHis MS is most likely explained by combination of infection,
   hypotension and more likely significant  hypercarbia --this seems to be
   improving with BiPAP. Unclear if he was getting frequent narcotics as
   sedating med effects likely further contributing
   >Sepsis: multiple sources for infection: HD line, recent TMA
   debridement, aspiration.  No obvious source of non infectious fevers
   (PE etc).  HD line seems most reasonable source but hesitant to remove
   in the absence of positive clx.
   - Vanco by level, Pip-Tazo for broad spectrum coverage for empiric 14
   day course
   - Obtain a clx
   - Cont NE requirement wean as tolerated
   - Judicious use of fluids.
   >Altered MS: multifactorial including infection (with increased
   metabolic production CO2) and OHV now much improved. Can - -
   -obtain VBG to follow his CO2. Would empirically use BiPAP for altered
   MS a
   >OHV: no documented sleep study but is hypercarbic
   - out pt sleep study
   - avoid narcotics
   >Renal failure: s/p failed cadaveric transplant.  HD T, Th, Sat
   (interrupted run on sat)
   - HD today (tolerating well on low dose NE)
   - cont 5 mg prednisone for chronic ejection
   >Afib:  Currently  in Afib s/p failed cardioversion (not on anti
   coagulation due to fall risk)
   - restart digoxin  (hold metop for now) on M, W, F dosing given high
   level on admit
   - check dig level
   >Wound care: s/p TMA

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with multiple medical complications, including sepsis, acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and a wound infection. The patient is currently receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, dialysis, and cardiac support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple sources of infection, including a dialysis line and a recent tissue and mucosal aeration debridement. The healthcare team is cautious about removing the dialysis line without further evidence.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing and requires respiratory support with BiPAP. There may be an underlying issue with his lungs, possibly due to chronic respiratory failure or a lung infection.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to a combination of factors such as infection, hypotension, and hypercarbia. Improvement has been seen with the use of BiPAP.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of failed kidney transplant and is currently undergoing hemodialysis. Close monitoring of renal function is essential.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation and was unsuccessful in cardioversion. It is important to restart digoxin and monitor digoxin levels.
6. Wound Infection: The patient has a wound infection from a recent tissue and mucosal aeration debridement"

   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
   size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve
   stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space
   which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal technical quality. Global left ventricular
   function is probably normal, but a focal wall motion abnormality cannot
   be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well seen. No pathologic
   valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure is mildly
   elevated.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a complex medical history including obesity hypoventilation syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (afib), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer, and a history of chronic steroid use.

The patient presents with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension. The initial assessment suggests septic shock/hypotension with increased pressor requirements and presentation consistent with sepsis. The source of infection remains broad, including line infection and wound infection. There are no radiographic signs of pneumonia.

The patient also has hypercarbic respiratory failure, as evidenced by the ABG results showing acute on chronic respiratory acidosis. This has improved with the use of BiPAP, but the patient may require reattempting of ABG and resuming BiPAP if increasing somnolence is observed.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to delirium, possibly from hypercarbia or sepsis. There are no obvious focal symptoms to suggest a stroke, and the lower suspicion for seizure is supported by a negative head CT without bleed. The patient's wife is adamant against invasive procedures, so a lumbar puncture (LP) is deferred for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possible COPD, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD on HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent total lower extremity amputation (TMA) ulcer. He presents with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/32 mmHg to 142/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient is alert but responding to questions repeatedly and asking about his hospitalization. Physical examination findings include an irregularly irregular heartbeat, coarse bilateral crackles in the lungs, and diffuse ecchymosis on the upper extremities with a hemodialysis line showing slight erythema but no drainage or tenderness. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, leukocytosis, increased creatinine, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal no pulmonary embolism, cardiomegaly with trace pericardial effusion, small right pleural effusion, and moderate dependent bibasilar atelectasis. The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities and is currently experiencing septic shock/hypot"

   66 yo M with obesity hypoventilation, ? COPD, afib, ESRD on HD, PVD
   with recent TMA ulcer, who presents with confusion, shortness of
   breath, fever and hypotension.
   .
   Septic Shock/Hypotension:
   Decreased pressor requirement this AM, clinically improved
   Presentation with fever and leukocytosis c/w sepsis
 source remains
   broad including line infection, wound infection. No radiographic
   evidence for pna. Adrenal insufficiency possible given chronic
   steroids, though less likely.
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn empirically
   - Follow up blood and urine cultures, check culture off HD line
   - Sputum culture if making sputum, legionella antigen
   - Flu swab
   - Wean levophed as tolerated
   .
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:
   ABG on presentation consistent with acute on chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Improved on BiPAP, now off.
   - Reattempt ABG this AM, correlate with VBG
   - Resume BiPAP if increasing somnolence
   - Outpatient sleep study
   - Limit sedating meds
   .
   Altered Mental Status:
    Improved on BiPAP.  Picture consistent with delirium from hypercarbia
   vs. for sepsis.  No obvious focal symptoms currently to suggest
   stroke.  Must consider all infectious sources currently, though no
   meningismus.  Uremia may also be contributing, as well as hypercarbia
   and acidosis.  Lower suspicion for seizure, head CT neg for bleed.
   Wife also adamantly against invasive procedures
   - Treat possible infection as per above
   - Cont BiPAP with hopes of correcting hypercarbia
   - Correct acidosis by correcting hypercarbia, uremia with dialysis
   - Monitor lytes, ABGs
   - Haldol prn for agitation, hold benzos
   - Defer LP for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possibly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer. He presents with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension. The patient has a history of confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension. He is currently in the ICU and is being treated for septic shock/hypotension, hypercarbic respiratory failure, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, ESRD on hemodialysis, and PVD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/Hypotension: The patient's presentation with fever and leukocytosis suggests sepsis. The source of infection is broad, including line infection, wound infection, and possibly pneumonia. Close monitoring of blood cultures and follow-up is necessary. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be continued, and the patient's pressor requirement should be closely monitored.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's ABG on presentation showed acute on chronic respiratory acidosis. The improvement seen with BiPAP suggests the need for continued respiratory support. Reattempting ABG this morning and correlating it with VBG is important. If increasing somnolence occurs, resume"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo with  with fevers, hypotensive, dyspnea and altered mental status
   with acute on chronic resp failure (OHV).  Concern for sepsis/septic
   shock with potential infection sources including HD line, R foot wound,
   lungHis MS is most likely explained by combination of infection,
   hypotension and more likely significant  hypercarbia --this seems to be
   improving with BiPAP. Unclear if he was getting frequent narcotics as
   sedating med effects likely further contributing
   >Sepsis: multiple sources for infection: HD line, recent TMA
   debridement, aspiration.  No obvious source of non infectious fevers
   (PE etc).  HD line seems most reasonable source but hesitant to remove
   in the absence of positive clx.
   - Vanco by level, Pip-Tazo for broad spectrum coverage for empiric 14
   day course
   - Obtain a clx
   - Cont NE requirement wean as tolerated
   - Judicious use of fluids.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a complex medical history, including sepsis, acute respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, and a previous failed kidney transplant. The patient presents with fevers, hypotension, dyspnea, and altered mental status. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines and catheters in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation suggests sepsis, possibly due to a central line infection or other sources such as a foot wound or lung infection. Immediate management includes broad-spectrum antibiotics and removal of the central line if appropriate.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, which may be exacerbated by hypercarbia. BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) seems to be improving his condition, but further evaluation and management are required.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be multifactorial, including infection, hypercarbia, and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OHV). Further investigations and interventions, such as obtaining a ventilation blood gas (VBG), are needed.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of failed kidney transplantation and is currently on hemodialysis. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting the treatment plan accordingly are essential.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with fevers, hypotension, dyspnea, and altered mental status. He has a history of acute on chronic respiratory failure (OHV), sepsis with multiple sources of infection, and renal failure following a failed cadaveric transplant. The patient is currently on dialysis, and his vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 93/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci in clusters, indicating a possible bloodstream infection. This raises concerns about the source of infection, with the central venous catheter being a potential culprit. There is also a possibility of aspiration pneumonia and infections at the surgical site.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite receiving fluids. This could be due to septic shock or other factors affecting cardiac function.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and his oxygen saturation is below the normal range. He may be experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or worsening of his underlying chronic respiratory condition.
4. Renal failure: The patient has a history of failed renal transplant and is currently on hemodialysis. There is a risk of further deterioration"

   66 yo with  with fevers, hypotensive, dyspnea and altered mental status
   with acute on chronic resp failure (OHV).  Now with pos blood clx which
   raises question of whether HD line is the source.
   >Sepsis: multiple sources for infection: HD line, recent TMA
   debridement, aspiration.  Now with pos clx  (GPC in clusters) from
   blood. Will need to dialogue with renal re: change of HD line.  Would
   remove femoral CVC today.  Hypotension yesterday complicated by HD
   run.
   - Vanco by level for empiric 14 day course  for GPC. Would stop
   Pip-tazo today.
   - f/u clx
   - Cont NE requirement wean as tolerated
   - Judicious use of fluids.
   >Altered MS: multifactorial including infection (with increased
   metabolic production CO2) and OHV now much improved.
   -if altered MS would check ABG and  Would empirically use BiPAP
   - obtain ABG with VBG is altered MS  to correlate CO2
   >OHV: no documented sleep study but is hypercarbic
   - out pt sleep study
   - avoid narcotics
   >Renal failure: s/p failed cadaveric transplant.  HD T, Th, Sat
   - HD today (tolerating well on low dose NE)
   - cont 5 mg prednisone for chronic ejection
   >Afib:  Currently  in Afib s/p failed cardioversion (not on anti
   coagulation due to fall risk)
   - restart digoxin  (hold metop for now) on M, W, F dosing given high
   level on admit
   - check dig level
   >Wound care: s/p TMA
   - cont ASA and plavix

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old individual with multiple medical issues including sepsis, altered mental status, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and a history of a failed kidney transplant. The patient's condition is summarized as follows:

1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple sources of infection, including a possible source from the hemodialysis (HD) line. Blood cultures have shown gram-positive cocci in clusters, indicating a potential bloodstream infection.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure and is on maintenance hemodialysis. There is also a mention of a failed cadaveric transplant.

3. Altered Mental Status (MS): The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to a combination of infection and underlying obstructive sleep apnea (OHV). It is recommended to obtain an ABG and consider using BiPAP if necessary.

4. Obstructive Hypoventilation (OHV): The patient has evidence of hypercarbic respiratory failure. A sleep study is advised to confirm the diagnosis, and measures should be taken to avoid narcotics.

5. Atrial Fibrillation (Afib): The patient is in atrial fibrillation post a failed cardioversion. Digoxin therapy is recommended, along with monitoring digoxin levels.

6. Wound Care: The patient has wounds from a recent transmyocardial ablation (TMA) procedure. Wound care should be continued, and"

   Septic Shock/Hypotension:
   Increased pressor requirement overnight and this AM after HD yesterday
   Presentation with fever and leukocytosis c/w sepsis
 source remains
   broad including line infection, wound infection. No radiographic
   evidence for pna. Adrenal insufficiency possible given chronic
   steroids, though less likely.  Has coag neg. staph in admission blood
   cx, 1 of 2 sets, surveillance blood cx. negative thus far.
   - Concern for infected HD line, renal feels likely contaminant, no

   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure:
   ABG on presentation consistent with acute on chronic respiratory
   acidosis. Improved on BiPAP.
   - If MS declines will check ABG and correlate with VBG
   - Resume BiPAP if increasing somnolence
   - Outpatient sleep study
   - Limit sedating meds
   .
   Altered Mental Status:
    Improved on BiPAP.  Picture consistent with delirium from hypercarbia
   vs. for sepsis.  No obvious focal symptoms currently to suggest
   stroke.  Must consider all infectious sources currently, though no
   meningismus.  Uremia may also be contributing, as well as hypercarbia
   and acidosis.  Lower suspicion for seizure, head CT neg for bleed.
   Wife also adamantly against invasive procedures
   - Treat possible infection as per above
   - Cont BiPAP prn
   - Correct acidosis by correcting hypercarbia, uremia with dialysis

   .
   Afib: Stable currently.  Not anticoagulated.  Hold metoprolol given
   hypotension.  Dig level 2
   - hold metoprolol
   - resumed digoxin 3 times a week
   .
   ESRD on HD: Failed graft.  Received HD TThSat.  Became hypotensive
   after HD yesterday.
   - Renal consulted
   - Cont renal medications including prednisone for failed graft
   - Dose medications appropriately
   - Monitor electrolytes closely

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer, and confusion. He presents with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to increased pressor requirement, fever, and leukocytosis. The source of infection remains broad, including line infection and wound infection. However, no radiographic evidence for pneumonia has been found.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has acute on chronic respiratory acidosis, as indicated by ABG results. His condition improved on BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure). If the patient's mental status declines, an ABG should be checked, and BiPAP may need to be resumed. An outpatient sleep study, limiting sedating medications, and monitoring for increasing somnolence are recommended.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved on BiPAP, suggesting hypercarbia as a possible cause for delirium. Other contributing factors include sepsis, uremia, acidosis, and potential seizure. A lower suspicion"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, possibly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer. He presents with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension. The patient has an altered mental status, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and possible septic shock/hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, leukocytosis, and increased pressor requirements suggest the possibility of sepsis. Broad sources of infection need to be considered, including line infections and wound infections.

2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute on chronic respiratory acidosis as indicated by his ABG results. Improving his ventilation with BiPAP may help improve his mental status and respiratory function.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and is on HD. He experienced hypotension after his recent HD session. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte balance is necessary.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's confusion may be due to hypercarbia, uremia, infection, or acidosis. Treatment of possible infection, correction of hypercarbia and acidosis, and dialysis to manage uremia"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of obesity hypoventilation syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (afib), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA). He presents with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 93/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on bipap. The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and month but asks repetitive questions.

Physical examination findings include an irregularly irregular heart rhythm, coarse bilateral crackles in the lungs, obesity with a soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm extremities without pitting edema. Neurological examination reveals oriented thoughts and no focal deficits.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12600 cells/mm3, elevated creatinine level of 5.6 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 125 mEq/L. Blood cultures are positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which may indicate a line infection or wound infection. Urine culture is negative"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (afib), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer, and confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension.

The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock/hypotension, hypercarbic respiratory failure, altered mental status, afib, ESRD on HD, PVD with recent TMA ulcer, and other comorbidities. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock/hypotension: The patient's increased pressor requirement and presentation with fever and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection. Broad sources of infection, including line infection and wound infection, should be considered. Adrenal insufficiency may also be a concern due to chronic steroid use.

2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's ABG results indicate acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis. Improvement on BiPAP suggests that non-invasive ventilation support is beneficial. Further management should involve monitoring ABG and VBG, resuming BiPAP if increasing somnolence occurs, limiting sedating medications, and considering an outpatient sleep study.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's improved"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo with  with fevers, hypotensive, dyspnea and altered mental status
   with acute on chronic resp failure (OHV).  Now with pos blood clx which
   raises question of whether HD line is the source although coag neg
   staph would seem to argue for contaminant
    >Sepsis/Hypotension: multiple sources for infection: HD line, recent
   TMA debridement, aspiration.  Now with pos clx  (coag neg staph) from
   blood. Will need to dialogue with renal re: change of HD line.  Would
   remove femoral CVC today.  Hypotension yesterday complicated by HD
   run.
   - Vanco by level for empiric 14 day course  for GPC. Would stop
   Pip-tazo today [**6-4**]
   - f/u clx
   - check random cortisol
   - Cont NE requirement wean as tolerated, will try to turn off post HD
   run.
    >Altered MS: multifactorial including infection (with increased
   metabolic production CO2) and OHV improves with BiPAP, seems to
   correspond to him having increased CO2.
   - Would empirically use BiPAP
   - avoid sedating meds
   >OHV: no documented sleep study but is hypercarbic
   - out pt sleep study
   - avoid narcotics
   - BiPAP at night
   >Renal failure: s/p failed cadaveric transplant.  HD T, Th, Sat
   - HD today (tolerating well on low dose NE)
   - cont 5 mg prednisone for chronic ejection

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with fevers, hypotension, dyspnea, and altered mental status. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure and recently underwent a total mesorectal excision (TMA) for cancer. The patient also has a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, raising concerns about the source of infection, potentially the hemodialysis line.

The patient is being treated for sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is also receiving hemodynamic support with norepinephrine. The plan is to change the hemodialysis line and remove the femoral central venous catheter. The patient's altered mental status is multifactorial, including infection and obstructive sleep apnea (OHV). The patient is currently on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (BiPAP) and will undergo a sleep study to confirm the diagnosis of OHV. Narcotics will be avoided due to their sedative effects.

The patient has a history of renal failure and previously underwent a cadaveric transplant, which failed. The patient is now on maintenance hemodialysis. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, which was not on anticoagulation due to fall risk. Digoxin therapy will be restarted, and the level will be monitored post hemodialysis.

The patient has an open wound from the TMA surgery and will continue with wound care management."

2. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of renal failure and is currently on hemodialysis. There is a need to monitor kidney function and adjust treatment accordingly.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory distress may indicate ongoing respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is necessary.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation therapy may be required to prevent clot formation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old individual with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to fevers, hypotension, dyspnea, and altered mental status. The patient also has acute-on-chronic respiratory failure (OHV), positive blood cultures indicating potential blood clot infection, and a history of sepsis with multiple sources of infection including a possible contaminated hemodialysis line.

The patient's current medications include Vancomycin for a suspected Gram-positive bacterial infection, Piperacillin-Tazobactam (Zosyn) which will be stopped today, and Norepinephrine to manage hypotension. The patient is also on prophylactic Heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prevention with a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI), and elevation of the head of bed (HOB) to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient has several ongoing assessments and plans:
1. Sepsis: The source of infection is being investigated, with a focus on the hemodialysis line and recent transmural amputation debridement. Positive blood cultures indicate a possible blood clot infection, specifically Gram-positive cocci in clusters.
2. Altered mental status: This may be multifactorial, including infection and OHV. If altered mental status persists, an arterial blood gas (ABG) and consideration for BiPAP should"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. He has a history of allergies to Neurontin, Dilaudid, and hives from Piperacillin/Tazobactam. The patient has been receiving multiple medications including stress-dose steroids, Haldol, and Zyprexa for severe agitation. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 122/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. 

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 12.0 K/uL and decreased hemoglobin (Hct) at 32.6%. Blood cultures from the HD line grew Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) indicating a line infection, which was promptly treated by changing the line over wire. The patient has also shown improvement in renal function with decreasing creatinine levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Line infection: The presence of GPCs in the blood culture from the HD line suggests a line infection, which is a potential complication in critically ill patients with multiple lines and tubes.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The note mentions impaired skin integrity, indicating a risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores in a bedridden patient.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possible COPD, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease, and a recent transmetatarsal amputation. He presents with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension. The patient is diagnosed with septic shock due to a line infection, as evidenced by two positive blood cultures including one from the hemodialysis line. He has been started on vancomycin for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus infection. The patient's urine culture is negative, and chest X-ray does not show any clear infiltrate. He has been weaned off pressors and his blood pressure remains stable. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 122/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock/Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent diagnosis of sepsis indicate a high risk for septic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt treatment of infection are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's ABG results on presentation showed acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis, indicating respiratory failure. Continued use of BiPAP and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possibly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer, and confusion. The patient presents with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Septic shock/hypotension: The patient has signs of sepsis due to a line infection, as indicated by positive blood cultures (Gram-positive cocci and coag-negative Staphylococcus). This could lead to septic shock if not promptly treated.

2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis, which may be due to hypoventilation or an underlying lung disease such as COPD. This can worsen the patient's mental status and increase the risk of further complications.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's confusion may be attributed to several factors, including hypercarbia, uremia, infection, and acidosis. Delirium is a common complication in critically ill patients and should be considered.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has diffuse ecchymosis in the upper extremities and a history of TMA ulcer. Poor skin integrity increases the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (afib), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer. The patient presents with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient shows signs of infection with elevated white blood cell count and positive coagulasenegative Staphylococcus in admission blood culture. There is a concern for an infected hemodialysis line, but no current plans to change the line. Surveillance blood cultures are pending.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's ABG results on presentation indicate acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis, which improved with the use of BiPAP. This suggests a potential issue with the patient's ability to ventilate effectively.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's confusion may be attributed to various factors such as hypercarbia, sepsis, uremia, or acidosis. It is important to consider all infectious sources, including the possibility of a urinary tract infection since the urine culture is negative. Other potential causes should also be evaluated, such as a stroke, given the absence of focal symptoms."

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of obesity hypoventilation, suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (afib), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent total mesenteric artery (TMA) ulcer. The patient presents with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension. He has been diagnosed with septic shock due to a line infection, as evidenced by two sets of positive blood cultures including one from the HD line. He is currently stable and off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's ABG on presentation is consistent with acute on chronic respiratory acidosis. His condition improved with the use of BiPAP, indicating the need for ongoing respiratory support.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing agitation and confusion, which could be attributed to various factors such as sepsis, hypercarbia, chronic illness, uremia, or steroid use. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause.
3. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: Although the patient's condition has stabilized, there is still a risk of sepsis progressing to organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and prompt treatment are crucial.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has diffuse ecchymosis in the upper extremities and eryth"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a complex medical history, including sepsis, hypotension, altered mental status, acute on chronic respiratory failure (OHV), renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and wound care post-transmyocardial artery (TMA) debridement. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including Neupogen, Neurontin, Dilaudid, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, Heparin, Haloperidol, and others.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 98 bpm (86-121 bpm), blood pressure of 96/75 mmHg (78-122/91 mmHg), respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute (15-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 91% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolytes. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, anxious mood, crackles in both lung bases, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm extremities. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old individual with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient has fevers, positive blood cultures, and coag-neg staph infection from the hemodialysis (HD) line. There is also a concern about infection sources including the HD line, recent TMA debridement, and aspiration.

2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which could be due to sepsis or other factors such as medication effects.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic respiratory failure (OHV) with crackles on both lung bases. The patient's altered mental status improves with BiPAP. A sleep study is recommended for further evaluation.

4. Thrombocytopenia and Neutropenia: The patient has progressive thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, possibly due to medication effects (rantidine, pip-tazo, and Vanco). A switch to a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and checking the peripheral smear are suggested.

5. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has an altered mental status that corresponds with increased CO2 production, possibly indicating metabolic alkalosis.

6. Chronic kidney disease: The patient had a failed cadaveric transplant and is currently on hemodialysis. The patient tolerates HD well on low-dose norepinephrine"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of fevers, hypotension, dyspnea, and altered mental status. The patient has acute-on-chronic respiratory failure and is experiencing sepsis/hypotension with multiple sources of infection including the hemodialysis (HD) line, recent total mesorectal excision (TMA) debridement, and aspiration. The patient's blood cultures are positive for coagulase-negative staphylococcus, which raises the question of whether the HD line is the source of infection. The patient's HD line was changed over a wire, and vancomycin is being given by level for an empiric 14-day course for gram-positive cocci with HD. Piperacillin-tazobactam is being stopped today.

The patient has progressive neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, with an unclear etiology. Medications such as ranitidine, piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin are suspected to be causing these effects. A switch to a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is planned, and the patient's peripheral smear will be checked.

The patient also has altered mental status, which is multifactorial including infection and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). BiPAP is being used empirically, and sedating medications will be avoided. A sleep study is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of OSA.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possibly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent transmural amputation (TMA) ulcer. The patient presents with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension. 

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient is experiencing septic shock/hypotension due to a line infection with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. He has positive blood cultures, including one from the HD line. The patient's urine culture is negative, and his chest X-ray does not show clear infiltrates. He is currently receiving vancomycin for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and his HD line has been changed over a wire by an interventional radiologist.

The patient also has hypercarbic respiratory failure, as evidenced by an ABG consistent with acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis that has improved with BiPAP. He should resume BiPAP if there is increasing somnolence and check gas exchange.

The patient's altered mental status is attributed to several factors, including possible steroid-induced confusion, delirium in the setting of bacteremia and chronic illness, hypercarbia, uremia, and acidosis. There is no suspicion of seizure, and the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possibly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (afib), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer, presenting with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension. He is bacteremic with both coag-negative staphylococcus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), isolated from blood cultures. The patient's old hemodialysis line is suspected as the source of VRE infection, which has been removed. He is currently receiving daptomycin therapy and will complete a 14-day course. The patient also has hypercarbic respiratory failure, altered mental status, pancytopenia, atrial fibrillation, ESRD on HD, and PVD with recent TMA debridement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already bacteremic with coag-negative staph and VRE. These infections can lead to sepsis, which may worsen his current condition and potentially lead to septic shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, which could progress to hypoxemic respiratory failure if not properly managed.
3. Renal Failure: As the patient's ESRD is"

The patient presents with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient has septic shock/hypotension due to a line infection with positive blood cultures. The patient is being treated with vancomycin for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus on admission blood cultures. Additionally, the patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, altered mental status, pancytopenia, atrial fibrillation, ESRD on HD, and PVD.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on BiPAP, there is a risk of developing VAP if proper infection control measures are not followed.

2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be due to delirium caused by hypercarbia, uremia, sepsis, or a combination of these factors. Close monitoring and addressing underlying causes are necessary.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possibly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer, and septic shock due to a central line infection. 

The patient presented with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension. He has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely caused by a line infection, as indicated by two sets of positive blood cultures including one from the HD line. The patient's urine culture was negative, and a chest X-ray did not show any clear infiltrate. 

The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus infection identified on admission blood culture. Additionally, he is receiving stress dose steroids due to inappropriately low cortisol levels. The HD line has been changed over a wire by an interventional radiologist (IR).

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of obesity hypoventilation and acute on chronic respiratory acidosis. This condition may worsen if the patient does not maintain adequate ventilation.

2. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing confusion and agitation, which could be attributed to delirium caused by hypercar"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent transfusion-associated myocardial infarction (TMA) ulcer. The patient presents with confusion, shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension. 

The patient has bacteremia with coag-negative Staphylococcus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), both isolated from blood cultures. The old hemodialysis (HD) line is suspected as the source of VRE infection, which has been pulled. The patient is now on daptomycin for septic shock. 

The patient also has hypercarbic respiratory failure, as indicated by an ABG showing acute on chronic respiratory acidosis. The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to steroids and infection. 

Other issues include pancytopenia, atrial fibrillation, ESRD on HD, and PVD with recent TMA debridement. 

Plan:
1. Complete 14-day course of daptomycin.
2. Monitor CK levels weekly while on daptomycin.
3. Follow up pending blood cultures and cis.
4. Wean steroids as blood pressure tolerates.
5. Resume BiPAP if increasing somnolence, check gas.
6. Limit sedating medications.
7. Correct acidosis by correcting hypercarbia, uremia with dialysis.
8. Monitor electrolytes, ABGs.
9. Hold metoprolol.
10. Resume digoxin three times a week and check dig level.
11. New HD line on Monday.
12. Consult renal team.
13. Continue VAC dressing and vascular follow-up.
14. Continue communication with interdisciplinary team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has bacteremia with coag-negative Staphylococcus and VRE. There is a risk of further infection due to the compromised immune system.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can lead to worsening respiratory function and potential respiratory arrest.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's confusion and altered mental status can increase the risk of falls, aspiration, and difficulty in communication and decision-making.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's low blood cell counts increase the risk of bleeding and infection.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's irregular heart rhythm can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
6. ESRD on HD: The patient's failed graft and ongoing ESRD management require careful monitoring of electrolyte levels and fluid balance.
7. PVD: The patient's peripheral vascular disease increases the risk of poor wound healing and potential amputation.
8. TMA ulcer: The patient's recent TMA ulcer needs close monitoring for signs of infection or worsening.

The Answer is: The potential medical complications that can arise include infection, respiratory failure, altered mental status, pancytopenia, atrial fibrillation, ESRD on HD, PVD, and TMA ulcer."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with obesity hypoventilation, possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (afib), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a recent transmetatarsal amputation (TMA) ulcer, and confusion. He presented with shortness of breath, fever, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock due to bacteremia with coag-negative staphylococcus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). He has also been diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure, altered mental status, pancytopenia, atrial fibrillation, ESRD on HD, and PVD.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which indicates a severe infection. It is crucial to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or development of new infections.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, which means his carbon dioxide levels are elevated. This condition can lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and confusion may worsen due to factors such as hypercarbia, uremia, steroids, or infection. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to"

   Assessment and Plan
   66yo with COPD and ESRD on HD  admit with dyspnea, hypotension and
   altered mental status in setting of coag neg staph and VRE bacteremia.
   1. Sepsis
       - Thought secondary to infected HD- catheter; catheter removed
   [**6-5**].
       - Continue antibiotics (dose on HD days). Will re-set days to when
   HD catheter removed, for total 14 days ([**6-5**]- [**6-19**])
       - Currently hemodynamically stable with baseline BPs
       - On stress-dose steroids; will wean quickly.
   2. Hypercapnea
       - Likely increased CO2 production in setting of infection
       - Currently on room air
       - continue baseline COPD regimen
   2. OHS
        - Will montior for nocturnal desaturation; BiPap at night.
   3. ESRD
        - HD catheter to be replaced [**6-8**]
        - No acute indications for RRT
        - Hypophosphatemia- will decrease phosphate binders
   4. Altered mental status
        - Initially thought to be toxic-metabolic in setting of
   bacteremia/sepsis and hypercapnia.
        - Now likely additional component of steroid-induced delirium
        - Has returned to baseline
   5. Adrenal insufficiency
        - Secondary to chronic steroid use. Will taper quickly to
   physiologic dose
   6. Anemia, thrombcytopenia
        - Thought multifactorial to sepsis and medications
        - Improving
   7. Afib
        - Rate controlled with metoprolol and Digoxin
        - not anticoagulated due to fall risk
   8. ICU
        - Code status= DNR/DNI
        - Access- will need replacement HD catheter on [**6-8**].  Currently

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, OHS, PVD, and ESRD on HD (s/p failed renal transplant). He presented with symptoms of dyspnea, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient was found to be hypercapneic and hypotensive, requiring vasopressors. He also had a coag-neg staphylococcus aureus and VRE bacteremia, likely from the HD catheter. The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, and stress-dose steroids; the HD catheter was changed over wire.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 110 bpm (78-124 bpm), blood pressure of 106/61 mmHg (71-192/33-169 mmHg), respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute (16-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), creatinine (Cr), and lactate levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. The assessment and plan include sepsis secondary to infected HD-catheter, hypercapnea, obstructive sleep apnea (OHS),"

   Assessment and Plan
   66yo with COPD and ESRD on HD  admit with dyspnea, hypotension and
   altered mental status in setting of coag neg staph and VRE bacteremia.
   1. Sepsis
       - Thought secondary to infected HD- catheter; catheter removed
   [**6-5**].
       - Continue Daptomycin (Linezolid avoided b/c of patient
   pre-existing thrombocytopenia.   Will re-set days to when HD
         catheter removed, for total 14 days ([**6-5**]- [**6-19**])
       - Currently hemodynamically stable with baseline BPs
       - On stress-dose steroids; will wean quickly.
   2. Hypercapnea
       - Likely increased CO2 production in setting of infection
       - Currently on room air
       - continue baseline COPD regimen
   2. OHS
        - Will montior for nocturnal desaturation; BiPap at night.
   3. ESRD
        - HD catheter to be replaced [**6-8**]
        - No acute indications for RRT
        - Hypophosphatemia- will decrease phosphate binders
   4. Altered mental status
        - Initially thought to be toxic-metabolic in setting of
   bacteremia/sepsis and hypercapnia.
        - Now likely additional component of steroid-induced delirium
        - Has returned to baseline
   5. Adrenal insufficiency
        - Secondary to chronic steroid use. Will taper quickly to
   physiologic dose
   6. Anemia, thrombcytopenia
        - Thought multifactorial to sepsis and medications
        - Improving
   7. Afib
        - Rate controlled with metoprolol and Digoxin
        - not anticoagulated due to fall risk
   8. L. knee pain
         - Exam unremarkable
         - Will check LENI to r/o VTE
         - pain control with tylenol
   8. ICU
        - Code status= DNR/DNI
        - Access- will need replacement HD catheter on [**6-8**].  Currently
   with peripherals

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of COPD, OHS, PVD, and ESRD on HD (s/p failed renal transplant). He was admitted with dyspnea, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient has coag-negative Staphylococcus aureus and VRE bacteremia, likely due to an infected HD catheter. 

The patient's current assessment includes:
1. Sepsis secondary to infected HD catheter. The catheter has been removed, and Daptomycin has been initiated for a total of 14 days. The patient is hemodynamically stable.
2. Hypercapnea due to increased CO2 production in the setting of infection. The patient is currently on room air, and his baseline COPD regimen will continue.
3. OHS, which will be monitored for nocturnal desaturation. BiPap at night is recommended.
4. ESRD, with plans to replace the HD catheter on [**6-8**]. There are no acute indications for RRT, and hypophosphatemia will be addressed by decreasing phosphate binders.
5. Altered mental status initially thought to be toxic-metabolic in the setting of bacteremia/sepsis and hypercapnia. It is now believed to be an additional component of steroid-induced delirium, which has since returned to baseline.
6. Adrenal insufficiency"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of COPD, OHS, PVD, and ESRD on HD (s/p failed renal transplant). He presented with dyspnea, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient was found to be hypercapneic and hypotensive, requiring vasopressors. He has a coag-negative Staphylococcus aureus and VRE bacteremia, likely due to his HD catheter. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, stress-dose steroids, and his dialysis catheter was changed over a wire. Despite receiving appropriate treatment, the patient's blood cultures on [**6-5**] still grew VRE.

24-hour events include being placed on 3L NC, experiencing left knee pain, and showing no improvement in blood cultures. The patient has allergies to Neupogen, Neurontin, and Dilaudid. He is currently receiving various medications including ranitidine, heparin sodium, haloperidol, and morphine sulfate.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, and an oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on aerosol-cool, face tent, and receiving supplemental oxygen. His ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. Physical examination reveals audible expiratory wheeze, lungs with bilateral expiratory wheez"

   Assessment and Plan
   66yo with COPD and ESRD on HD  admit with dyspnea, hypotension and
   altered mental status in setting of coag neg staph and VRE bacteremia.
   1. Sepsis
       - Thought secondary to infected HD- catheter; catheter removed
   [**6-5**].
       - Continue antibiotics (dose on HD days). Will re-set days to when
   HD catheter removed, for total 14 days ([**6-5**]- [**6-19**])
       - Currently hemodynamically stable
       - On stress-dose steroids; will wean quickly.
   2. Hypercapnea
       - Likely increased CO2 production in setting of infection
       - Currently breathing at baseline
       - continue baseline COPD regimen
   3. ESRD
        - HD catheter to be replaced [**6-8**]
        - No acute indications for RRT
        - Hypophosphatemia- will decrease phosphate binders
   4. Altered mental status
        - Initially thought to be toxic-metabolic in setting of
   bacteremia/sepsis and hypercapnia.
        - Now likely additional component of steroid-induced delirium
   5. Adrenal insufficiency
        - Secondary to chronic steroid use. Will taper quickly to
   physiologic dose
   6. ICU

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of COPD, OHS, and ESRD on HD admission. He presented with dyspnea, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient has been found to be hypercapneic and hypotensive, requiring vasopressors. He also has a coag-negative Staphylococcus aureus and VRE bacteremia, with the portal of entry likely being the HD catheter. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, and stress-dose steroids. The dialysis catheter was changed over a wire.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently stable hemodynamically, but there is a risk of further deterioration due to ongoing infection.
2. Hypercapnea: The patient's increased CO2 production in the setting of infection may lead to worsening respiratory status.
3. ESRD: The patient's HD catheter needs to be replaced on [**6-8**]. There are no acute indications for RRT.
4. Altered mental status: The patient initially presented with toxic-metabolic altered mental status in the setting of bacteremia/sepsis and hypercapnia. Now, additional components of steroid-induced delirium should be considered.
5. Adrenal insufficiency: Chronic steroid use may lead to secondary adrenal insufficiency. The patient will need to be tapered quickly to a"
