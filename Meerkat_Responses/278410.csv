","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, acute coronary syndrome, history of falls, cervical fracture without spinal cord injury, and recent admission for chest pain and coronary ischemia. The patient received a blood transfusion and experienced mild delirium overnight. Pain was present but responded well to IV morphine with only a mild drop in systolic blood pressure. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/52 to 93/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring shows stable vital signs with some fluctuations in blood pressure. Fluid balance indicates a total intake of 500 mL and output of 300 mL, with urine output of 230 mL. 

Physical examination findings are limited due to non-assessment of peripheral pulses, skin, neurologic responses, movement, tone, and other systems. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count within normal range, elevated creatinine, normal glucose levels, and slightly abnormal coagulation profile. Electrolyte levels are within normal range except for slightly low potassium. 

The patient's medical history includes aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation"

   87 year old woman with mild systolic heart failure, severe aortic
   stenosis and mitral regurgitation, osteoporosis, admitted to the
   hospital after a fall, without evidence of acute fracture, now
   developing ECG changes and cardiac enzyme elevation in setting of
   hypotension, in fair condition.
   #. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction: in the setting of relative
   hypotension, severe valvular disease as well as anemia. Suspect this
   constitutes a demand event relative hypovolemia. [**Name2 (NI) 1082**] risk score is 4
   (age, aspirin, known lesion and ST changes > 0.5mm). Given possible
   occult bleeding at this time however, risk of heparin drip in the
   setting of decreasing troponins likely outweighs benefit
   n        Serial ECG
   n        Continue daily aspirin
   n        Without symptoms, would not start heparin / plavix, especially
   given likely bleeding
   n        Volume expand with blood, given critical AS however will need
   to infuse very slowly (6 hours); goal near 30
   n        ECG findings suggestive of inferior ischemia, consistent with
   RCA territory; patient will likely be pre-load dependent
   n        Cardiac enzymes in AM
   #. Hypotension: improved, now near baseline
   n        Gentle volume expansion as above
   n        F/U cultures, no signs of infection / sepsis at this time
   #. Anemia: Acute on chronic, with macrocytic pattern
   n        transfuse as above
   n        No clear source of bleeding, negative imaging now and no
   indication of any other losses
   n        GUAIAC all stools
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely pre-renal azotemia, FeNA 0.8%
   n        Blood transfusion as above
   #. Inappropiate lack of tachycardia: although concerning that patient
   is not tachycardic with systemic hypotension, tachycardia would lead to
   further hemodynamic compromise due to inability to have forward flow
   n        Although would avoid any nodal agents, tachycardia should be
   avoided, anticipate euvolemia will help maintain normal heart rate
   #. Systolic heart failure: Appears well compensated now, although per
   history, it appears she recently had a decompensation with severe lower
   extremity edema
   n        Hold diuretics for now
   n        Hold ACE-inhibitor
   #. Valvular heart disease: Critical AS and moderate MR concerning for
   high risk of pulmonary edema, especially at faster heart rates.
   -- Monitor carefully, minimal crackles at this time
   #. Cervical fracture: Unclear if acute or chronic. Patient with soft
   collar that she tolerates very poorly
   n        Hard [**Location (un) 1083**] J collar now
   n        Neurosurgery called, will re-visit need for collar in AM:
   #. Urinary track infection? Equivocal UA, with small leukocyte esterase
   in absence of symptoms
   n        Would not treat unless urine culture is positive.
   #. Conjunctivitis: Ciprofloxacin eye drops for 7 days
   ICU Care

Her condition is described as fair.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction: The patient is suspected to have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction due to ECG changes and cardiac enzyme elevation. This is further supported by her relative hypotension, severe valvular disease, and anemia.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and there is concern for inadequate perfusion. Gentle volume expansion is recommended.
3. Anemia: The patient has acute-on-chronic anemia with a macrocytic pattern. Blood transfusion is advised.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient is likely experiencing pre-renal azotemia. Blood transfusion and careful monitoring are needed.
5. Inappropriate lack of tachycardia: Despite systemic hypotension, the patient is not tachycardic. Tachycardia should be avoided due to potential hemodynamic compromise.
6. Systolic heart failure: The patient's systolic heart failure appears well-compensated at the moment, but"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of mild systolic heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation. She was admitted to the hospital after a fall and now presents with ECG changes and cardiac enzyme elevation in the setting of hypotension. The patient is in fair condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction: The patient's ECG changes and cardiac enzyme elevation suggest a possible non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. This is further supported by her severe valvular disease, anemia, and relative hypovolemia.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to several factors including the myocardial infarction, anemia, or valvular disease. Gentle volume expansion is recommended.

3. Anemia: The patient has acute-on-chronic anemia with a macrocytic pattern. Blood transfusion is advised as the cause of bleeding is unclear.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has pre-renal azotemia. Blood transfusion and careful monitoring of fluid balance are necessary.

5. Inappropriate lack of tachycardia: Despite systemic hypotension, the patient does not have a compensatory increased heart rate. Tachycardia should be avoided due to the risk of further hemodynamic compromise.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, an 87-year-old woman with a history of mild systolic heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, osteoporosis, and a recent fall, was admitted to the hospital. She developed ECG changes and cardiac enzyme elevation in the setting of hypotension, which is consistent with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's low blood pressure and minimal urine output were addressed with blood transfusion and fluid expansion. Her anemia was found to be acute on chronic with a macrocytic pattern, and she received a blood transfusion. The patient also had acute renal failure, likely pre-renal azotemia, and her creatinine level returned to baseline with blood transfusion. Other conditions noted include systolic heart failure, valvular heart disease with critical aortic stenosis and moderate mitral regurgitation, potential cervical fracture, and conjunctivitis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. NSTEMI: The patient's ECG changes and cardiac enzyme elevation suggest an ongoing myocardial infarction. This condition can lead to further ischemia, arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiogenic shock if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypotension: The patient's intermittent low blood pressure requires ongoing monitoring and management to ensure adequate organ perfusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of mild systolic heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, osteoporosis, and a recent fall. She was admitted to the hospital and is now experiencing ECG changes and cardiac enzyme elevation while also showing signs of hypotension. The patient's blood pressure has been stable over the past 12 hours after receiving fluid boluses and blood transfusions. There are no signs of infection, although her urine analysis showed 11-20 white blood cells. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate bump in hematocrit. It is unclear if she had an occult bleed.

The patient's current conditions include NSTEMI (likely demand ischemia), hypotension (possibly due to hypovolemia or occult bleed), anemia, systolic heart failure, valvular heart disease (critical aortic stenosis and moderate mitral regurgitation), cervical fracture, and conjunctivitis.

Assessment and Plan:

1) Continue ASA (aspirin) and check lipid panel. Consider starting a statin.
   Start beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor when blood pressure is stable.
   
2) Recheck urine analysis and urine culture. Administer a 500cc bolus now since she appears dry on exam. Provide IV fluids if necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of mild systolic heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation. She was admitted to the hospital after a fall and now presents with ECG changes and cardiac enzyme elevation in the setting of hypotension. Her current condition is fair.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction: The patient is suspected to have a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction due to relative hypotension, severe valvular disease, and anemia. This could be a demand event relative hypovolemia.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure was low intermittently throughout the day, ranging from 82-85 systolic. It improved with blood transfusion and cardiac enzymes are decreasing, indicating an improvement in the hypotension.
3. Anemia: The patient has acute-on-chronic anemia with a macrocytic pattern. She has been transfused with blood products to correct this.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely pre-renal azotemia. Blood transfusion has been given to improve renal function.
5. Inappropriate lack of tachycardia: Despite systemic hypotension, the patient is not tachycardic. Tachycardia could lead to further hemodynamic compromise due to the inability to maintain forward flow.

","The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of mild systolic heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation. She was admitted to the hospital after a fall without evidence of acute fracture. The patient is now developing ECG changes and cardiac enzyme elevation in the setting of hypotension. She has been diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) due to relative hypotension, severe valvular disease, and anemia. The medical team suspects this to be a demand event related to hypovolemia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 82-85 systolic to 50-61 diastolic, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, there is a slight elevation in creatinine levels. The cardiac enzymes Troponin-T and CK-MB are elevated. 

Imaging reveals increasing pulmonary vascularity consistent with volume overload. 

The patient's plan includes serial ECG monitoring, continuing daily aspirin, and avoiding heparin or Plavix due to possible occult bleeding. The patient will be volume expanded with blood, but infused slowly due to critical aortic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of poor urine output. The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, acute coronary syndrome, falls, cervical fracture, and no known drug allergies. On admission, the patient received a bolus of 500cc due to poor urine output, but repeat urinalysis suggests no infection. The patient was kept in the MICU given the poor urine output and borderline hypotension. Oxycodone liquid was started for pain control.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/46 to 132/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows sinus rhythm with stable blood pressure and heart rate. Fluid balance indicates a total input of 1,865 mL, including 210 mL of IV fluids, and total output of 600 mL through urine and 170 mL through blood products. Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula, with SpO2 at 99%.

Physical examination findings are not provided in the progress note. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (116 K/uL) and troponin-T level (0.66). Other lab values are within normal ranges. Imaging and microbiology reports are pending. The patient's disposition is"

   hypotension, in fair condition.
   1)NSTEMI: Likely demand ischemia in the setting of hypovolemia. Occult
   bleeding was also a possibility given acute bleed.
   - Continue ASA
   - Check lipid panel and then consider starting statin
   - Consider starting beta-blocker and ace-inhibitor when blood pressure
   stable
   2) Hypotension: Likely [**1-9**] hypovolemia but an occult bleed was also on
   the differential given drop in Hct.  Blood pressure has remained stable
   over past 12 hours after receiving several fluid boluses and blood.  No
   signs of an infection although U/A had 11-20 WBCs.
   - Recheck U/A and urine culture
   - 500cc bolus now since she appears dry on exam
   - Bolus with IVFs if necessary
   3) Anemia: Patient presented with acute Hct drop. She received 2 units
   pRBCs with an appropriate bump. Unclear if she had an occult bleed.
   - Monitor daily Hct
   4) Systolic heart failure: Patient does not seem significantly volume
   overloaded on physical exam. Diuretics and anti-hypertensives being
   held in light of her hypotension.
   - Hold diuretics for now
   - Hold ACE-inhibitor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of mild systolic heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation. She was admitted to the hospital after a fall without evidence of acute fracture. The patient is now developing ECG changes and cardiac enzyme elevation in the setting of hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. NSTEMI: The patient may have experienced demand ischemia due to hypovolemia, with occult bleeding being a possibility as well.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to hypovolemia, and she did not receive any additional fluid boluses overnight.
3. Anemia: The patient presented with an acute drop in hematocrit, which was managed by transfusing two units of packed red blood cells. Her hematocrit remains stable at 34% this morning.
4. Systolic heart failure: The patient is not significantly volume overloaded on physical examination, and diuretics and anti-hypertensives are being held due to her hypotension.
5. Valvular heart disease: The patient has critical aortic stenosis and moderate mitral regurgitation. She does not appear to be significantly volume overloaded.
6. Cervical fracture: The patient is wearing a hard collar, and neurosurgery recommendations have been made.
