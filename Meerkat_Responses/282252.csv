   Assessment and Plan
   75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of S. aureus
   bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic CHF
   # Bacteremia - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles growing
   Staphylococcus aureus. Concern for endovascular source of infection
   given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the patient
   denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given his
   presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of [**12-23**]
   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia speciation per new
   outside hospital records this morning.
   - Will switch to Nafcillin for better coverage of MSSA
   - TTE this AM
   - TEE today given bioprosthetic aortic valve
   - If evidence of vegetation or new/worsening valvular dysfunction,
   consider addition of gentamicin/rifamplin for S. aureus prosthetic
   valve endocarditis
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.
   - Continue to taper dopamine
   - Continue lasix gtt
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   - TEE as above to evaluate EF/valvular dysfunction
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - continue lasix gtt
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated.
   - check HIV
   - F/U B12/folate
   - Trend INR
   - Check peripheral smear
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension. Not
   concerned for ACS.
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - Consider repeat Head CT ; will likely need MRI in future when can
   tolerate to eval for septic emboli
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis
   - holding meds ; does not  likely need further stress dose steroids

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous cardiac surgeries including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). The patient was admitted to the ICU with S. aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has a high-grade bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). There is a concern for endovascular source of infection, particularly given the bioprosthetic aortic valve. The patient will be switched to nafcillin for better coverage of MSSA, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be performed to evaluate for vegetation or new/worsening valvular dysfunction.

2. Hypotension: The patient presented with hypotension in the setting of bacteremia. This could be consistent with sepsis, but the patient also has a mixed picture with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 32 and central venous pressure (CVP) of 14-24. There is also a possibility of worsening aortic valvular function due to endocarditis. The patient appears volume overloaded with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and the use of diuretics has been initiated to manage"

   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - Consider repeat Head CT ; will likely need MRI in future when can
   tolerate to eval for septic emboli
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis
   - holding meds ; does not  likely need further stress dose steroids

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was transferred to the ICU for management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has been experiencing encephalopathy, thirst, and multiple episodes of diarrhea, including one episode of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection. He has also been receiving treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of hypotension and fever could be consistent with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

2. Endocarditis: Given the patient's history of bacteremia and symptoms of prolonged duration, there is a high risk for complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia speciation was noted, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been ordered to evaluate for vegetations or new/worsening valvular dysfunction.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a chronic thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. The differential diagnosis includes immune thrombocytopenia (ITP),"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Bacteremia - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles growing
   Staphylococcus aureus. Concern for endovascular source of infection
   given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the patient
   denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given his
   presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of [**12-23**]
   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. By Duke Criteria - he has major
   criteria of high gradebacteremia with typical organism, by minor
   criteria he has fever, predisposing heart condition, he also has skin
   findings of petechiae however difficult to interpret in the setting of
   significant thrombocytopenia.
   - Will continue Vancoymcin dosed 1 gm Q 12
   - Contact[**Name (NI) **] OSH micro lab - SA is likely MSSA but sensitivities are not
   finalized, will fax results in am - if so, plan to transition to
   nafcillin
   - TEE given bioprosthetic aortic valve
   - If evidence of vegetation or new/worsening valvular dysfunction,
   consider addition of gentamicin/rifamplin for S. aureus prosthetic
   valve endocarditis
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - ID consult in am given high grade Staph aureus bacteremia
   .
   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.
   - Continue to taper dopamine
   - Continue lasix gtt
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   - TEE as above to evaluate EF/valvular dysfunction
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - continue lasix gtt
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated.
   - F/U B12/folate
   - Trend INR
   - Check peripheral smear
   - Consider hematology consult in am
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter however this is in the setting of
   pressors
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - Consider repeat Head CT
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. These include:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has a high-grade bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. This increases the risk of complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and a TEE (transesophageal echocardiogram) is planned to evaluate for vegetation or valvular dysfunction.

2. Hypotension: The patient's presentation of hypotension in the setting of bacteremia could be consistent with sepsis. However, the patient also has evidence of a mixed picture, including a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 32 and central venous pressure (CVP) of 14-24. Worsening aortic valvular function in the setting of endocarditis is also a consideration. The patient appears volume overloaded with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), and pressor requirements have decreased since starting diuresis. Dopamine was weaned off overnight but restarted.

3. Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient currently shows evidence of volume overload, indicating acute decompensation of chronic systolic heart failure. Lasix drip is being continued, and plans are in place for beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy once the blood pressure allows.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a chronic thrombocytopenia of"

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and aortic valve replacement (AVR), presenting with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure. The patient's condition is complicated by several potential medical complications.

1. Endocarditis: The patient's presentation with bacteremia and symptoms of 12-23 day duration prior to presentation puts him at high risk for complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis. The bioprosthetic aortic valve further increases the risk. The decision to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) today is to evaluate for vegetations or new/worsening valvular dysfunction.

2. Hypotension: The patient's presentation of hypotension in the setting of bacteremia could be consistent with sepsis. However, the patient has a mixed picture given the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 32 and central venous pressure (CVP) 14-24. Hypotension may also be related to worsening aortic valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. The patient appears volume overloaded with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). Pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis. Dopamine was weaned off overnight but restarted. The patient self-removed the pulmonary artery (PA) catheter this morning.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and aortic valve replacement who presented to the ICU with acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. The patient is currently being treated for suspected endocarditis, including antibiotic therapy with nafcillin. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, thrombocytopenia, atrial flutter, elevated cardiac enzymes, encephalopathy, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient is already being treated for suspected endocarditis, which is a serious infection of the heart valves. If left untreated or not properly managed, endocarditis can lead to further valve damage, heart failure, or even systemic infection.

2. Hypotension: The patient's presentation of hypotension in the setting of bacteremia could be consistent with sepsis. If not properly managed, hypotension can progress to shock and organ failure.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a chronic thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. If the underlying cause is not identified and managed appropriately, it could lead to increased bleeding risk and complications.

4. Atrial Flutter: The patient is currently experiencing atrial flutter, which can increase the risk of stroke if not properly managed with rate control medications. Additionally, atrial flutter may be associated with underlying"

   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.

   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) in [**2164**]. The patient was transferred to another hospital for management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has suspected endocarditis, likely due to Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. He is being treated with nafcillin, and if the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is positive, gentamicin and rifampin will be added for 2 and 6 weeks, respectively.

2. Hypotension: The patient presented with hypotension in the setting of bacteremia, which could be consistent with sepsis. However, the patient also has evidence of volume overload with an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). The patient's blood pressure has been in the 80s systolic since the PA catheter self-decannulated, but it has improved after restarting IV access and diuretics.

3. Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient currently shows signs of volume overload, such as elevated JVP and crackles laterally on lung auscultation. The patient's CHF is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and aortic valve replacement (AVR) in 2014. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis: The patient has a small vegetation on his bioprosthetic aortic valve, consistent with endocarditis. He is being treated with appropriate antibiotics.
2. Hypotension: The patient presents with persistent hypotension, which could be due to sepsis or worsening aortic valvular function. He is receiving pressor support.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has elevated creatinine levels, suggesting possible pre-renal AKI due to poor forward flow. There is also a possibility of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) given the presence of urine white blood cells (WBCs).
4. Acute on chronic systolic CHF: The patient has evidence of volume overload.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a chronic thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology, with a history of easy bleeding and bruising. Differential diagnoses include immune thrombocytopenic purpura (IT"

   Assessment and Plan
   75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of S. aureus
   bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic CHF
   # Bacteremia - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles growing
   Staphylococcus aureus. Concern for endovascular source of infection
   given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the patient
   denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given his
   presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of [**12-23**]
   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia speciation per new
   outside hospital records this morning.
   - Continue nafcillin given aortic vegetation
   - confer with ID concerning gent/rifampin dosing.
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.
   - neo as needed.
   - will try to keep even as patient has possibly distributive shock
   picture from bacteremia.
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   # Acute Kidney injury
 may be pre-renal currently due to poor forward
   flow, although urine WBCs suggest potentially AIN.  No red cell casts
   that would be consistent with glomerulonephritis.
   -          trend creatinine
   -          appreciate renal recs.
   -          Follow up anca/[**Doctor First Name **]
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - lasix if patient has respiratory distress, however keep even for now.
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   .
   #Hyperbilirubinemia
 will acquire RUQ ultrasound to evaluate for
   cholecystitis, although acalculous cholecystitis possible in setting of
   critical illness.  Also look for obstructing mass.
   - fractionate bilis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - check HIV
   - F/U B12/folate
   - Trend INR
   - appreciate heme recs.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension. Not
   concerned for ACS.
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - repeat Head CT ; will likely need MRI in future when can tolerate to
   eval for septic emboli
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis
   - holding meds ; does not  likely need further stress dose steroids

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous CABG surgery, who was transferred to the ICU for management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia and there is a concern for endovascular source of infection, especially given his history of bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has shown small vegetation on the aortic valve. If vegetation or new/worsening valvular dysfunction is seen, the addition of gentamicin/rifampin for S. aureus prosthetic valve endocarditis may be considered.

2. Sepsis: The patient presents with hypotension in the setting of bacteremia, which could be consistent with sepsis. However, the patient also has a mixed picture with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 32 and central venous pressure (CVP) of 14-24, indicating potential volume overload.

   Assessment and Plan
   75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of S. aureus
   bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic CHF
   # Bacteremia - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles growing
   Staphylococcus aureus. Concern for endovascular source of infection
   given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the patient
   denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given his
   presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of [**12-23**]
   day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for complicated
   bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia speciation per new
   outside hospital records this morning.
   - Continue nafcillin given aortic vegetation
   - confer with ID concerning gent/rifampin dosing.
   - Will obtain surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypotension - Presentation of hypotension in setting of bacteremia
   could be consistent with sepsis, however the patient has a mixed
   picture given PCWP of 32 and CVP 14-24. Also consider worsening aortic
   valvular function in the setting of endocarditis. Currently, the
   patient appears volume overloaded with elevated JVP. Per reports
   pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis.  Neo
   weaned off.  Dopamine weaned off overnight but restarted.  Patient
   pulled out PA catheter this AM.
   - neo as needed.
   - will try to keep even as patient has possibly distributive shock
   picture from bacteremia.
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   # Acute Kidney injury
 may be pre-renal currently due to poor forward
   flow, although urine WBCs suggest potentially AIN.  No red cell casts
   that would be consistent with glomerulonephritis.
   -          trend creatinine
   -          appreciate renal recs.
   -          Follow up anca/[**Doctor First Name **]
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - lasix if patient has respiratory distress, however keep even for now.
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   #Hyperbilirubinemia
 will acquire RUQ ultrasound to evaluate for
   cholecystitis, although acalculous cholecystitis possible in setting of
   critical illness.  Also look for obstructing mass.
   - fractionate bilis
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - check HIV
   - F/U B12/folate
   - Trend INR
   - appreciate heme recs.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Elevated CK/Troponin - No prior ECG for comparison, no clear
   ischemia. Trop bump most likely occurred in the setting of hypotension
   secondary to infection.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension. Not
   concerned for ACS.
   - Continue statin
   - Start BB and ACE-I as BP allows
   .
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - repeat Head CT ; will likely need MRI in future when can tolerate to
   eval for septic emboli
   # Rheumatoid Arthritis
   - holding meds ; does not  likely need further stress dose steroids

","The patient is a 75-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and prosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR), who was admitted to the ICU for management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient presented with symptoms of bacteremia for 12-23 days prior to presentation, putting him at high risk for complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has a confirmed MSSA bacteremia. It is important to continue nafcillin and consult with an infectious disease specialist for gentamicin and rifampin dosing. Surveillance blood cultures should also be obtained.
2. Hypotension: The patient's presentation of hypotension could be consistent with sepsis. However, the patient has a mixed picture given the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 32 and central venous pressure (CVP) of 14-24. Worsening aortic valvular function in the setting of endocarditis should also be considered. The patient appears volume overloaded with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). Pressor requirements have decreased since beginning diuresis. Neo has been weaned off, but dopamine has been restarted. The patient pulled out the pulmonary artery (PA) catheter this morning.

   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of S. aureus
   bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic CHF
   # Bacteremia/ Endocarditis - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles
   growing Staphylococcus aureus. Concern for endovascular source of
   infection given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as the
   patient denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms. Given
   his presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms of
   [**12-23**] day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for
   complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia
   speciation.  + vegetation on bioprosthetic aortic valve.
   - On nafcillin given aortic vegetation but may need to switch to Vanc
   in setting of possible AIN
   - has not started Gent due to worsening renal function
   - continue surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Hypotension -  appears to be in Distributive shock.  Neo weaned off
   with fluid challenge last night but restarted early this AM.  AM
   cortisol yesterday normal.
   - will try to keep even as patient has possibly distributive shock
   picture from bacteremia.  Holding diuresis
   - Treat bacteremia as above
   - will fluid challenge very slowly and gently today
   - consider Swan tomorrow to help w fluid management if not improving
   - continue phenylephrine and attempting to wean
   # Acute Kidney injury
 Multifactorial, may be pre-renal currently due
   to poor forward flow, in addition to AIN as suggested by urine WBCs.
   Possibly also contribution of immune-mediated complexes.
   - may need to switch Nafcillin to Vancomycin in setting of AIN
   -          trend creatinine
   -          appreciate renal recs.
   -          Follow up anca/[**Doctor First Name **]
   .
   # Rash-  appears to be petechiae, increasing on back, unknown
   etiology.  Consider vasculitis vs chronic ITP
   - Rheumatology consult to consider restarting steroids
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above
   - lasix if patient has respiratory distress, however keep even for now
   or mildly positive with fluid challenges.
   - Plan for beta blocker and ACE-I once BP allows
   #Hyperbilirubinemia
 RUQ ultrasound did not show evidence of septic
   emboli. Fractionated Bili shows increased Direct.  Stable from
   yesterday.
   - continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - appreciate heme recs.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   -          Monitor on telemetry

   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.  Getting olanzapine
   here for agitation
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and aortic valve replacement, who was admitted to the ICU for management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure. He has been experiencing symptoms for 12-23 days prior to presentation and is at high risk for complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia speciation is confirmed. Vegetation on the bioprosthetic aortic valve is present.

The patient is currently hypotensive and appears to be in distributive shock. Neo has been weaned off phenylephrine, but the patient requires ongoing fluid challenges. The patient's renal function is worsening, and he has developed acute kidney injury, which may be pre-renal due to poor forward flow, as well as acute tubular necrosis (AIN) suggested by urine WBCs. Immune-mediated complexes may also contribute to the renal injury.

The patient has developed a rash of petechiae on the back, which is increasing in severity. The etiology is unknown, and vasculitis or chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) could be considered. Rheumatology consult has been requested to consider restarting steroids.

The patient's acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) is being managed with diuretics and fluid challenges. Beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors will be considered"

   - On nafcillin given aortic vegetation (consider switching to vanc for
   AIN)
   - hold on gent due to renal function, hold on rifampin
   - continue surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - consider further imaging to eval for AI - ? repeat TEE if worried (no

   # Hypotension -  has a mixed picture. Seems to be some component of
   distributive and cardiac shock. Phenylephrine was weaned off after
   successful fluid challenege. However, overnight patient became
   hypotensive requiring phenylephrine. Appears fluid overloaded on exam.
   - consider PA catheter for further hemodynamic monitoring
   - continue to treat endocarditis as above
   - wean pressor as tolerated
   - TTE
   # Acute kidney injury - less likely pre-renal. Likely AIN but may have
   immune-mediated complexes as well.

   - lasix prn
   - plan for beta blocker, acei once bp allows
   # Rash-  appears to be petechiae, increasing on back, unknown
   etiology.  Consider vasculitis vs chronic ITP. Derm thinks likely heat
   rash. No need to biopsy.
   - keep back dry
   - cream for back
   #Hyperbilirubinemia
 RUQ ultrasound did not show evidence of septic
   emboli. Fractionated Bili shows increased Direct.  Stable from
   yesterday.
   - continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - appreciate heme recs
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - hold anticoagulation due to thrombocytopenia
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.  Getting olanzapine
   here for agitation
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - MRI in future when can tolerate to eval for septic emboli
   # other
   - ionized calcium

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease and previous cardiac surgeries, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was transferred to the hospital for management of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's current condition includes hypotension, respiratory distress, and signs of fluid overload. He also has a history of thrombocytopenia, easy bleeding, and bruising. The patient is currently receiving treatment for MSSA bacteremia and endocarditis, acute kidney injury, acute on chronic systolic CHF, and other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Complicated bacteremia: Given the patient's presentation with MSSA bacteremia and symptoms of 12-23 day duration prior to presentation, he is at high risk for complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis.
2. Endocarditis: The presence of vegetation on the bioprosthetic aortic valve observed during transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) indicates a possible diagnosis of endocarditis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension appears to be multifactorial, involving distributive and cardiac shock. Phenylephrine was initially used but had to be weaned off due to fluid overload.
4. Acute kidney"

   Assessment and Plan
   75y/o M with a PMH of CAD s/p CABG with AVR in [**2164**] and
   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of MSSA bacteremia
   and acute on chronic systolic CHF c/b hypotension
   # Bacteremia/ Endocarditis - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles
   growing Staphylococcus aureus at OSH. Concern for endovascular source
   of infection given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as
   the patient denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms.
   Given his presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms
   of [**12-23**] day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for
   complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia
   speciation.  + vegetation on bioprosthetic aortic valve as witness on
   TEE.
   - On nafcillin given aortic vegetation (consider switching to vanc for
   AIN)
   - hold on gent due to renal function, hold on rifampin
   - continue surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - consider further imaging to eval for AI - ? repeat TEE if worried (no
   new murmur, pulse pressure widening, EKG QRS prolongation)
   - appreciate CSurg recs
   # Hypotension -  has a mixed picture. Seems to be some component of
   distributive and cardiac shock. Phenylephrine was weaned off after
   successful fluid challenege. However, overnight patient became
   hypotensive requiring phenylephrine. Appears fluid overloaded on exam.
   - consider PA catheter for further hemodynamic monitoring
   - continue to treat endocarditis as above
   - wean pressor as tolerated
   - TTE
   # Acute kidney injury - less likely pre-renal. Likely AIN but may have
   immune-mediated complexes as well.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - urine lytes
   - trend BUN/Cr
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], ANCA
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above. Required lasix last night for likely pulmonary
   edema.
   - consider PA catheter
   - lasix prn
   - plan for beta blocker, acei once bp allows
   # Rash-  appears to be petechiae, increasing on back, unknown
   etiology.  Consider vasculitis vs chronic ITP. Derm thinks likely heat
   rash. No need to biopsy.
   - keep back dry
   - cream for back
   #Hyperbilirubinemia
 RUQ ultrasound did not show evidence of septic
   emboli. Fractionated Bili shows increased Direct.  Stable from
   yesterday.
   - continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - appreciate heme recs
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - hold anticoagulation due to thrombocytopenia
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.  Getting olanzapine
   here for agitation
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection
   - MRI in future when can tolerate to eval for septic emboli

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). The patient was transferred to the current hospital for management of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Bacteremia/Endocarditis: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which is a high-grade bacteremia. There is a concern for endovascular infection, possibly endocarditis, especially considering the presence of vegetation on the bioprosthetic aortic valve seen on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The patient is currently being treated with nafcillin and will likely need to switch to vancomycin due to antibiotic-associated nephrotoxicity (AIN).

2. Hypotension: The patient exhibits hypotension with a mixed picture of distributive and cardiac shock. Phenylephrine was weaned off after successful fluid resuscitation, but the patient became hypotensive overnight and required phenylephrine again. There is evidence of volume overload, and the patient has received lasix for pulmonary edema.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has AKI, which is less likely to be pre-renal in nature."

   thrombocytopenia transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for management of MSSA bacteremia
   and acute on chronic systolic CHF c/b hypotension
   # Bacteremia/ Endocarditis - The patient was found to have 4/4 bottles
   growing Staphylococcus aureus at OSH. Concern for endovascular source
   of infection given high grade bacteremia. No clear portal of entry as
   the patient denies recent procedures/dental work, no focal symptoms.
   Given his presentation with community acquired bacteremia with symptoms
   of [**12-23**] day duration prior to presentation pt is at high risk for
   complicated bacteremia, including endocarditis. MSSA bacteremia
   speciation.  + vegetation on bioprosthetic aortic valve as witness on
   TEE.
   - On nafcillin given aortic vegetation (consider switching to vanc for
   AIN)
   - hold on gent due to renal function, hold on rifampin
   - continue surveillance blood cultures
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - consider further imaging to eval for AI - ? repeat TEE if worried (no
   new murmur, pulse pressure widening, EKG QRS prolongation)
   - appreciate CSurg recs
   # Hypotension -  has a mixed picture. Seems to be some component of
   distributive and cardiac shock. Phenylephrine was weaned off after
   successful fluid challenege. However, overnight patient became
   hypotensive requiring phenylephrine. Appears fluid overloaded on exam.
   - consider PA catheter for further hemodynamic monitoring
   - continue to treat endocarditis as above
   - wean pressor as tolerated
   - TTE
   # Acute kidney injury - less likely pre-renal. Likely AIN but may have
   immune-mediated complexes as well.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - urine lytes
   - trend BUN/Cr
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **], ANCA
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF - Pt currently with evidence of volume
   overload as above. Required lasix last night for likely pulmonary
   edema.
   - consider PA catheter
   - lasix prn
   - plan for beta blocker, acei once bp allows
   # Rash-  appears to be petechiae, increasing on back, unknown
   etiology.  Consider vasculitis vs chronic ITP. Derm thinks likely heat
   rash. No need to biopsy.
   - keep back dry
   - cream for back
   #Hyperbilirubinemia
 RUQ ultrasound did not show evidence of septic
   emboli. Fractionated Bili shows increased Direct.  Stable from
   yesterday.
   - continue to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia - Per OSH reports the patient has a chronic
   thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology. Pt reports history of easy
   bleeding & bruising. DDx is broad and includes ITP, myelodysplastic
   syndrome, drug induced - ex. hydroxychloroquin, unclear when this was
   started, infection with HIV or HCV, nutritional deficiency
   (B12/Folate), EtOH toxicity however no clear history of this. DIC less
   concerning given long history of thrombocytopenia and fibrinogen
   normal. HIT also unlikely given documented long history of
   thrombocytopenia.  LFTs and LDH elevated. Peripheral smear showed no
   schistocytes.
   - appreciate heme recs
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter - the pt reports a history of AF
   however no documented history of this, pt not on anticoagulation.
   Currently ECG shows A. flutter in the setting of pressors.  Currently
   Rate controlled.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - hold anticoagulation due to thrombocytopenia
   # Encephalopathy - Most likely toxic/metabolic in the setting of
   infection. Per report OSH Head CT negative for acute process. Pt also
   had been treated with sedatives at OSH ativan/precedex .  Continues to
   be encephalopathic, though appears mildly improved.  Getting olanzapine
   here for agitation
   - Hold sedating medications
   - Treat infection

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and a previous CABG with AVR surgery. He was transferred to the ICU for management of MSSA bacteremia and acute on chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be due to a combination of distributive and cardiac shock. Phenylephrine was initially used as a pressor but was weaned off after successful fluid resuscitation. However, the patient became hypotensive again overnight and required the reintroduction of phenylephrine. Fluid overload is also present on examination. Further hemodynamic monitoring with a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter may be necessary.

2. Bacteremia/Endocarditis: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which is concerning for endocarditis, especially given his presentation with community-acquired bacteremia and symptoms lasting more than 12 days. Vegetations were seen on a bioprosthetic aortic valve during transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The patient is being treated with nafcillin, and further imaging, such as repeat TEE, may be required to evaluate for aortic insufficiency (AI).

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient likely has AKI, possibly due to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN"

- The patient presented with symptoms of bacteremia with no clear portal of entry, and subsequent testing revealed vegetation on a bioprosthetic aortic valve, indicating endocarditis.
- The patient has been treated with nafcillin for the MSSA bacteremia and is being considered for vancomycin due to aortic valve vegetation.
- The patient also experienced hypotension, which was initially attributed to distributive and cardiac shock. Phenylephrine was used as a vasopressor but was weaned off after successful fluid challenge. However, the patient became hypotensive again overnight and required phenylephrine.
- The patient's renal function is impaired, and there is suspicion of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN).
- The patient has evidence of volume overload and required diuretics for pulmonary edema.
