   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypotension: Likely septic shock given Actinobacter bacteremia for
   which he was sent from [**Hospital1 **]. This + blood culture was from his
   tunnelled R femoral line.
   - based on sensitivities, will change antibiotics to unasyn and
   tobramycin to cover acinetobacter and add Vanc to cover MRSA (recent
   staph cx sensitive to Vanc)
   -- surveillance blood cultures
   -- Contact IR to replace fem dialysis line and to place an additional
   triple lumen cath (difficult access)
   - will check MVO2 as no JVP assessment to guide recussitation
   .
   # Respiratory failure: His O2 sats were difficult to obtain on the
   floor.  He had very altered mental status so was intubated for airway
   protection.  No obvious infiltrates on CXR.
   -- hold pscyhotropic drugs: gabapentin and narcotics. Continued celexa
   to avoid rebound.
   .
   # Cdiff: During last hospitalization, he was found to have + cdiff
   stool culture on [**1-6**] and was discharged on Flagyl. Given clinical
   picture of infection with high leukocytosis, will continue Flagyl for
   now even though he has no stool.
   -- continue Flagyl given broad-spectrum antibiotics
   -- surveillance Cdiff cultures
   .
   # ?SBO: Surgery following. He was passing flatus prior to the code.
   -- surgery following
   -- OGT/NPO
   -- monitor for flatus and BM
   .
   # History of graft thrombosis: Multiple clots in grafts and IVC
   in past.  INR 3.1.  Goal INR [**2-11**].  [**Month (only) 60**] need FFP for line change.
   - T&S
   - heparin ggt if INR < 2
   .
   # HIV: Last VL was undetectable in [**6-16**].  Continue outpatient HAART
   regimen.
   - Stavudine 20 mg PO Q24H, RiTONAvir 100 mg PO BID, Indinavir Sulfate
   800 mg PO BID, LaMIVudine 150 mg PO Q TUES AND THURS
   .
   # HCV: no recent VL but last VL in 07 was 4,290 IU/mL.  Unclear
   synthetic fx of liver although recent albumin in [**Month (only) 821**] was 2.5.  INR 3.1
   which is presumably from anticoagulation.  MRI of abdomen showed
   hemosiderosis of liver.
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 35-40% which is global and likely
   from either etoh or cocaine.  Currently hypotensive but this is likely
   from septic shock but not CHF.  PO2 low even on 1.0 FIO2 so will not
   give additional fluids.
   .
   # Anemia: Macrocytic so possibly from liver disease vs HAART.  Appeared
   to iron-deficient in [**Month (only) 102**].  Also ESRD on HD so likley this is a
   contributor.  HCT higher than on discharge on [**1-8**].
   - trend for now
   - check b12/folate
   - guaic stools
   .
   # DM: sliding scale insulin
   .
   # HTN: nifedipine and metoprolol
   .
   # ESRD: on HD
   -- appreciate renal following, will need a new HD line for CVVH
   .
   # L3 compression deformity: chronic
   .
   # FEN: NPO
   # PPX: PPI and anticoagulated
   # CODE: confirmed full w/ HCP fiance-[**Name (NI) 1288**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7496**] but his
   brothers-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 7473**] and fiance will talk today about overall goals of
   care given that he had recently requested DNR/DNI status at last
   admission.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The key points from the note are as follows:

1. The patient required three pressors overnight, including a supratherapeutic dose of LEVO/NEO and maximum dose vasopressin. This indicates severe hypotension and possible septic shock.

2. The patient has an elevated PT/PTT/INR, suggesting a coagulation disorder or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

3. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected Actinobacter bacteremia and MRSA infection.

4. The patient has respiratory failure and is on invasive ventilation support.

5. The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35-40%.

6. The patient is anemic with a macrocytic anemia, which may be related to liver disease, HAART therapy, or chronic kidney disease.

7. The patient has diabetes mellitus type II and is on sliding scale insulin.

8. The patient has hypertension and is on nifedipine and metoprolol.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypotension: Likely septic shock given Actinobacter bacteremia for
   which he was sent from [**Hospital1 **]. This + blood culture was from his
   tunnelled R femoral line.
   -Continue abx:  based on sensitivities, will change antibiotics to
   unasyn and tobramycin to cover acinetobacter and add Vanc to cover MRSA
   (recent staph cx sensitive to Vanc)
   -- surveillance blood cultures
   -- IR placed L femoral and double lumen pick yesterday
   -- Hold CVVH in setting of hypotension and labile pressures and fluid
   shifts.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: His O2 sats were difficult to obtain on the
   floor.  He had very altered mental status so was intubated for airway
   protection.  No obvious infiltrates on CXR.
   -- hold pscyhotropic drugs: gabapentin and narcotics. Continued celexa
   to avoid rebound.
   .
   # Cdiff: During last hospitalization, he was found to have + cdiff
   stool culture on [**1-6**] and was discharged on Flagyl. Given clinical
   picture of infection with high leukocytosis, will continue Flagyl for
   now even though he has no stool.
   -- continue Flagyl given broad-spectrum antibiotics
   -- surveillance Cdiff cultures
   .
   # ?SBO: Surgery following. He was passing flatus prior to the code.
   -- surgery following
   -- Drop OG tube today in attempt to decompress at least hernia
   -- monitor for flatus and BM
   -- F/U on repeat KUB
   .
   # History of graft thrombosis: Multiple clots in grafts and IVC
   in past.  INR 3.1.  Goal INR [**2-11**].  [**Month (only) 60**] need FFP for line change.
   - T&S
   - heparin ggt if INR < 2
   .
   # HIV: Last VL was undetectable in [**6-16**].  Continue outpatient HAART
   regimen.
   - Stavudine 20 mg PO Q24H, RiTONAvir 100 mg PO BID, Indinavir Sulfate
   800 mg PO BID, LaMIVudine 150 mg PO Q TUES AND THURS
   .
   # HCV: no recent VL but last VL in 07 was 4,290 IU/mL.  Unclear
   synthetic fx of liver although recent albumin in [**Month (only) 821**] was 2.5.  INR 3.1
   which is presumably from anticoagulation.  MRI of abdomen showed
   hemosiderosis of liver.
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 35-40% which is global and likely
   from either etoh or cocaine.  Currently hypotensive but this is likely
   from septic shock but not CHF.  PO2 low even on 1.0 FIO2 so will not
   give additional fluids.
   .
   # Anemia: Macrocytic so possibly from liver disease vs HAART.  Appeared
   to iron-deficient in [**Month (only) 102**].  Also ESRD on HD so likley this is a
   contributor.  HCT higher than on discharge on [**1-8**].
   - trend for now
   - check b12/folate
   - guaic stools
   .
   # DM: sliding scale insulin
   .
   # HTN: nifedipine and metoprolol

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including chronic renal failure, chronic systolic heart failure, type II diabetes mellitus, HIV, and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of graft thrombosis, c.difficile infection, small bowel obstruction, and line infections. He is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and HAART for HIV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and requirement for multiple pressors suggest ongoing sepsis. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor for any signs of deterioration.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and need for invasive ventilation indicate acute respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
3. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's symptoms of vomiting and inability to tolerate a procedure suggest possible SBO. Monitoring for signs of bowel ischemia or perforation is crucial.
4. Line infections: The patient has a history of line infections, including central or arterial line infections. Regular monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate line management are important.
5. Chronic renal failure: The patient's anemia and elevated creatinine levels indicate chronic renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly are necessary.
6. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's low blood pressure and ejection fraction"

   synthetic fx of liver although recent albumin in [**Month (only) 821**] was 2.5.  INR 3.1
   which is presumably from anticoagulation, but may represent a different
   acute process related to infection.  MRI of abdomen showed
   hemosiderosis of liver.
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 35-40% which is global and likely
   from either etoh or cocaine.  Currently hypotensive but this is likely
   from septic shock but not CHF.  PO2 low even on 1.0 FIO2 so will not
   give additional fluids.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities, including chronic renal failure, chronic systolic heart failure, type II diabetes mellitus, HIV, and hepatitis C. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient has a history of graft thrombosis, C. difficile infection, small bowel obstruction, and previous admissions for similar conditions. He is currently intubated, on mechanical ventilation, and receiving multiple vasopressors. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), and low platelet count. Imaging studies show evidence of liver hemosiderosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient is already experiencing hypotension and requires high-dose vasopressors, indicating ongoing sepsis.
2. Acinetobacter bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for Acinetobacter, indicating a potential bloodstream infection.
3. Multi-organ dysfunction: Given the patient's comorbidities and current critical condition, there is a risk of multi-organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hepatic dysfunction.
4. C. difficile infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, which may increase the risk of recurrence.
5. Small bowel obstruction:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, type II diabetes mellitus, line infection, septic shock, wound infection, acute respiratory failure, and small bowel obstruction. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation. He has been receiving vasopressor support but had it weaned and then restarted. There are concerns about CVVH today. The patient has ongoing antibiotic coverage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening of chronic renal failure due to septic shock, dehydration, or medications.
2. Progression of chronic heart failure leading to further cardiac dysfunction.
3. Diabetic complications such as hyperglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis.
4. Development of new infections due to prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines.
5. Respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotrauma.
6. Gastrointestinal complications like bowel ischemia or perforation due to small bowel obstruction.
7. Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy.
8. Metabolic disturbances such as electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disorders.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Hypotension: Likely septic shock given Actinobacter bacteremia for
   which he was sent from [**Hospital1 **]. This + blood culture was from his
   tunnelled R femoral line.
   -Continue abx:  based on sensitivities, will change antibiotics to
   unasyn and tobramycin to cover acinetobacter and add Vanc to cover MRSA
   (recent staph cx sensitive to Vanc)
   -- surveillance blood cultures
   -- IR placed L femoral and double lumen pick yesterday
   -- Hold CVVH in setting of hypotension and labile pressures and fluid
   shifts.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: His O2 sats were difficult to obtain on the
   floor.  He had very altered mental status so was intubated for airway
   protection.  No obvious infiltrates on CXR.
   -- hold pscyhotropic drugs: gabapentin and narcotics. Continued celexa
   to avoid rebound.
   .
   # Cdiff: During last hospitalization, he was found to have + cdiff
   stool culture on [**1-6**] and was discharged on Flagyl. Given clinical
   picture of infection with high leukocytosis, will continue Flagyl for
   now even though he has no stool.
   -- continue Flagyl given broad-spectrum antibiotics
   -- surveillance Cdiff cultures
   .
   # ?SBO: Surgery following. He was passing flatus prior to the code.
   Possible ileus vs. abscess or other primary infection from
   acinetobacter seeding abdomen
   -- surgery following
   -- Drop OG tube today in attempt to decompress at least hernia
   -- monitor for flatus and BM
   -- F/U on repeat KUB
   .
   # History of graft thrombosis: Multiple clots in grafts and IVC
   in past.  INR elevated today.  Goal INR [**2-11**].  [**Month (only) 60**] need FFP for line
   change.
   - T&S
   - heparin ggt if INR < 2
   -Check labs for possible DIC-fibrinogen currently elevated, will eval
   RBC morph
   .
   # HIV: Last VL was undetectable in [**6-16**].  Continue outpatient HAART
   regimen.
   - Stavudine 20 mg PO Q24H, RiTONAvir 100 mg PO BID, Indinavir Sulfate
   800 mg PO BID, LaMIVudine 150 mg PO Q TUES AND THURS
   .
   # HCV: no recent VL but last VL in 07 was 4,290 IU/mL.  Unclear
   synthetic fx of liver although recent albumin in [**Month (only) 821**] was 2.5.  INR 3.1
   which is presumably from anticoagulation, but may represent a different
   acute process related to infection.  MRI of abdomen showed
   hemosiderosis of liver.
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: EF 35-40% which is global and likely
   from either etoh or cocaine.  Currently hypotensive but this is likely
   from septic shock but not CHF.  PO2 low even on 1.0 FIO2 so will not
   give additional fluids.
   .
   # Anemia: Macrocytic so possibly from liver disease vs HAART.  Appeared
   to iron-deficient in [**Month (only) 102**].  Also ESRD on HD so likley this is a
   contributor.  HCT higher than on discharge on [**1-8**].
   - trend for now
   - check b12/folate
   - guaic stools

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock given their Actinobacter bacteremia. The hypotension is likely due to the infection and sepsis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's O2 sats were difficult to obtain on the floor, and they had an altered mental status. As a result, they were intubated for airway protection. There are no obvious infiltrates on the chest X-ray.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient had a positive stool culture for C. diff during their last hospitalization and was discharged on Flagyl. The clinical picture suggests that the infection is still present, so it is recommended to continue Flagyl and perform surveillance C. diff cultures.

4. Possible small bowel obstruction (SBO): The patient may have a possible ileus, abscess, or primary infection from Actinobacter seeding the abdomen. Surgery is being followed, and the plan is to decompress at least the hernia by dropping the OG tube today. Monitoring for flatus and bowel movements is important, along with repeat kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) follow-up.

5. History of graft thrombosis: The patient has had multiple clots in their grafts and inferior vena cava (IVC) in the past. The"
