","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic renal cell cancer to the lungs. He presents with acute on chronic fatigue and shortness of breath. The patient has been in the ICU and is currently experiencing hypotension, which may be due to hypovolemia and/or sepsis. He also has right lower lobe consolidation, indicating possible pneumonia. Additionally, there is a concern for acute blood loss and potential hemolysis. The patient's renal function appears to be prerenal in nature, and he has hypercalcemia likely secondary to metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The patient has been started on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and is being managed with a regular diet, repletion of electrolytes as needed, and IV fluids. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI. Disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to hypovolemia and/or sepsis. This can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs and increase the risk of organ failure.
2. Right lower lobe consolidation: This indicates possible pneumonia, which can worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Acute blood loss: The patient may have experienced a bleed in the pelvis, which could be due to various causes such as trauma, tumor invasion, or coag"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yom with acute on chronic fatigue and SOB, h/o metastatic renal cell
   cancer to lungs.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to possible new infection/sepsis, or

   SEPSIS -- concerns include lung infection or line related
   infections.    Evaluation in progress.
   DYSPNEA -- Multifactorial, likely predominatly attributed to
   progressive lung involvement by renal cell CA, possible superimposed
   acute infection (bacterial, viral, fungal).  Less likely due to
   intraparenchymal bleed.  Doubt Pulmonary embolism.  Monitor RR, SaO2.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Monitor urine
   output, BUN, creatinine.
   HYPERCALCEMIA
 Likely related to malignancy.  Improved with volume

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell cancer to the lungs. The patient presents with hypotension, dyspnea, and potential medical complications.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 108/48 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on norepinephrine infusion for blood pressure support. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and normal heart sounds with no murmurs. The respiratory system is clear bilaterally, and the abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. There is trace edema in the right lower extremity.

The laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.3 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 338 K/uL, and renal insufficiency with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL. The electrolytes show hypercalcemia with a calcium level of 21 mg/dL. 

The assessment and plan include hypotension potentially due to infection/sepsis or underlying malignancy, sepsis concerns including lung infection or line-related infections, dyspnea attributed to progressive lung involvement by renal cell carcinoma with possible superimposed acute infection, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia likely related to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell cancer to the lungs. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute on chronic fatigue and shortness of breath. The patient has been receiving IV fluids and vasopressors due to hypotension, which is attributed to possible new infection/sepsis or underlying malignancy (TNF release). There are concerns about lung infection or line-related infections leading to sepsis. The patient also experiences dyspnea, which is likely multifactorial, predominantly attributed to progressive lung involvement by renal cell cancer, possible superimposed acute infection, and less likely due to intraparenchymal bleed. The patient's renal function is acute on chronic renal insufficiency, and there is hypercalcemia likely related to malignancy. The patient has metastatic renal cell carcinoma, which is progressive and has a poor prognosis. He also has hypothyroidism and is on levothyroxine. The patient's code status is full code, and he is receiving ICU care with prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic renal cell cancer to the lungs. He presents with acute on chronic fatigue and shortness of breath. He has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including hypotension, acute on chronic renal failure, hypercalcemia, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate a decreased blood flow to vital organs, which can lead to organ damage if not properly managed.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's worsening kidney function may progress to complete renal failure if not treated promptly. This can result in the buildup of toxins in the body and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient's elevated levels of calcium can lead to complications such as kidney stones, decreased kidney function, and bone demineralization.
4. Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: The spread of cancer from the kidneys to the lungs can worsen over time and potentially lead to further respiratory complications.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's underactive thyroid gland may cause symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, and mental health issues if not properly managed.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, renal function, electrolyte levels, and cancer progression to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic renal cell cancer to the lungs. He presented with acute on chronic fatigue and shortness of breath. He was found to have right lower lobe consolidation, which is concerning for pneumonia. The patient has been receiving treatment with Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and Ciprofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which could be due to distributive shock caused by sepsis secondary to pneumonia. Another possible source of hypotension is a pelvic hematoma noted on CT scan. Monitoring and management of blood pressure with appropriate fluids and medications are essential.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient appears to have prerenal acute kidney injury, possibly due to hypovolemia. Volume resuscitation and careful monitoring of renal function are necessary. Renal dose medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins should also be considered.

3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated calcium levels, likely secondary to metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Regular monitoring of ionized calcium levels and appropriate management are required.

4. Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: The patient's underlying malignancy needs ongoing evaluation and management according to oncology recommendations.

5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has been recently started on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. It is"

   ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Mr. [**Known lastname 1885**] is a 68-year-old gentleman who was
   in his usual state of health until early [**2099-8-19**] when he
   developed dyspnea. CXR revealed a large right-sided pleural
   effusion. CT torso on [**2099-8-24**] showed a large right pleural
   effusion. It also revealed a 2.3 cm RML nodule and pleural
   studding. A 9-cm mixed attenuation mass was seen in the mid
   portion of the right kidney, extending laterally into the left
   renal vein. There were no focal liver abnormalities and no
   adenopathy. Thoracentesis on [**2099-8-24**] drained 1.4 L of bloody
   pleural fluid. Cytology was negative. He was seen at [**Hospital1 1**] on
   [**2099-9-1**] and was admitted on [**2099-9-5**] for recurrent pleural
   effusion. He underwent thoracentesis which was negative for
   malignancy and bronchoscopy which revealed no endobronchial
   lesions. He returned on [**2099-9-9**] for an elective thoracoscopy,
   pleural biopsy, talc pleurodesis, and pleurex catheter placement.
   Pathology from the pleural biopsy showed metastatic poorly
   differentiated carcinoma with clear cell features. He was then
   readmitted on [**2099-9-15**] with a severe drug rash, felt to be due to
   dilaudid. His pleurex catheter was removed on [**2099-9-15**]. He
   underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy on [**2099-9-21**] and pathology
   revealed renal cell carcinoma, conventional clear cell type,
   grade II, greatest dimension 7.5cm. Tumor extended into
   perinephric tissues and renal vein. Margins at Gerota's fascia
   were positive for tumor. Papillary adenomas were also seen. No
   lymph nodes were sent for review. He initially enrolled in
   clinical trial 04-117, with the goal of creating a dendritic cell
   + tumor fusion vaccine, but he had radiographic and clinical
   signs of disease progression so was taken off trial. He was
   admitted for hypercalcemia from [**11-13**] to [**11-15**]. He
   enrolled in clinical trial 08-219, comparing pazopanib vs.
   sunitinib for locally advanced or metastatic RCC, on [**2099-11-17**] and
   was randomized to receive pazopanib. Treatment was held from
   [**2100-1-19**] to [**2100-2-2**] for grade 3 elevation in his ALT
   (grade 2 in AST). He was restarted at 600mg daily when his LFTs
   normalized.
   His pazopanib was on hold from [**7-9**] thru [**2100-7-28**] because he needed
   urgent dental surgery including bone removal.  During this time
   he had rapid growth of an intramuscular lesion on the right chest
   wall.
   PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
   -Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
   -History of recurrent malignant pleural effusion, S/P right
   pleurodesis.
   -Right chest wall pain as well as dyspnea and worsening disease
   in the right lung.
   -Hypthyroidism, started on levothyroxine two days ago
   -Hypertension
   -Severe dermatitis reaction, which was thought secondary to

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma presenting with acute on chronic fatigue, hypotension, and a productive cough. He has been admitted multiple times for various conditions including recurrent pleural effusion, severe drug rash, and hypercalcemia. The patient's current vital signs show a low blood pressure, and he is requiring pressors to maintain it. His oxygen saturation is within normal range, and his respiratory rate is slightly elevated.

The patient has a history of renal cell carcinoma with lung metastases, and his recent CT scan showed consolidation in the right lower lobe, which may represent a new infectious process or neoplastic infiltration. He also has a moderate amount of free fluid in the pelvis, which could indicate blood or an infectious process.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. His blood chemistry reveals elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, indicating possible acute kidney injury. His liver enzymes are within normal range, and his electrolytes are mostly within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level.

The patient's medical history includes hypothyroidism, hypertension, and severe dermatitis reaction. He is currently on multiple medications for his various conditions, including pain management, antibiotics, and antihypertensives.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, meaning he does not wish to be resuscitated or receive life-sustaining"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with acute on chronic fatigue, shortness of breath, and a history of metastatic renal cell cancer to the lungs. He was found to have right lower lobe consolidation, which is concerning for pneumonia. The patient is currently hypotensive and requires the use of Levophed. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/40 to 124/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 3L NC. His weight remains unchanged at 78 kg. The patient has received multiple antibiotics including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Vancomycin, Piperacillin, and Ciprofloxacin.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,421 mL and output of 1,350 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,071 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids and his urine output is 1,350 mL. He is also receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula and his ABG results are within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals a pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress, with a regular rhythm and normal rate. He has a systolic murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border, along with jugular venous distention of 7 cm. Decreased breath sounds are noted in the right lower lung field, with some rales at the right apex. The patient has 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema and is alert and oriented to time, place, and person.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood cultures were obtained on multiple occasions, with negative results. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, glucose, and liver function tests are within normal limits. The patient's calcium and magnesium levels are slightly elevated.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of hypotension, acute on chronic renal failure, hypercalcemia, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, hypothyroidism, and anxiety. The patient is to continue on Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for hospital-acquired pneumonia coverage, wean off Levophed if possible, and undergo a transthoracic echo to evaluate for pericardial space infiltration by metastatic RCC. Antihypertensives are to be held, and final read of the CT scan from yesterday is to be reviewed. The patient is also to be checked for Clostridium difficile infection and have an active tuberculosis test. Incentive spirometry is encouraged, and the patient's hematocrit is to be followed up."

   68 y/o gentleman with acute on chronic fatigue and SOB, h/o metastatic
   renal cell cancer to lungs, found to have RLL consolidation concerning
   for pneumonia.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Likely distributive shock.  RLL consolidation
   concerning for PNA, although differential includes neoplastic
   infiltration.  Hemolysis labs negative.  Guaic negative in ED.  On CT a
   possible hematoma was noted in the pelvis. If expanding, this could be
   a source of hypotension.  Influenza DFA and urinary legionella antigen
   negative.
   - Continue Vanc/zosyn/cipro to cover HCAP
   - Consider CT thorax to evaluate for hemothorax and evaluate fluid
   collection in pelvis for progression
   - Follow up pending cultures
   - wean off of levophed if possible
   - echocardiogram to evaluate pericardial space
   - hold antihypertensives
   - follow up official read of CT scan
   - check C. diff given diarrhea
   - active T+S
   .
   # Acute on Chronic renal failure: Appears to be prerenal in etiology.
   - volume resuscitation as above
   - trend renal function
   - renally dose meds/avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Hypercalcemia:  Secondary to metastatic renal cell CA.
   - IVF as above
   - trend ionized calcium
   .
   # Metastatic renal cell carcinoma:
   - appreciate heme/onc recs

","The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with acute on chronic fatigue and shortness of breath, with a history of metastatic renal cell cancer to the lungs. He was found to have right lower lobe consolidation, which is concerning for pneumonia. 

His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1Â°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/40 to 124/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. He is in sinus rhythm and has a regular heart rhythm. 

The patient has required the use of Levophed to maintain his systolic blood pressure in the 70-80s. A CT chest without contrast revealed no significant change in the right lower lobe. 

The patient reports continued fatigue but is no longer experiencing shortness of breath or cough. He has required a smaller amount of Levophed this morning. 

The patient has received several antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Vancomycin, Piperacillin, and Ciprofloxacin. He is currently receiving Norepinephrine at a rate of 0.08 mcg/kg/min and Pantoprazole (Protonix). He is also on heparin sodium for prophylaxis. 

His laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.7-5.8 thousand/mmÂ³,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with acute on chronic fatigue and shortness of breath, who has a history of metastatic renal cell cancer to the lungs. He was found to have right lower lobe consolidation, which is concerning for pneumonia. The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension, acute on chronic renal failure, hypercalcemia, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, hypothyroidism, and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of right lower lobe consolidation raises concerns for pneumonia. This is a potential medical complication that needs to be addressed promptly.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen due to various factors such as hypotension, sepsis, or medications. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating persistent hypotension. This could be due to sepsis, volume depletion, or medication side effects. Appropriate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support may be required.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated calcium levels, which are likely secondary to metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Regular monitoring of calcium levels and potentially adjusting treatment for hypercalcemia is necessary.
5. Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: As the patient has metastatic disease, ongoing management and coordination with the oncology team are essential to control the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic renal cell cancer, who presented with acute on chronic fatigue and shortness of breath. He was found to have right lower lobe lung consolidation, which is concerning for pneumonia but could also be due to neoplastic infiltration. The patient was initially hypotensive, but this has resolved. His hemolysis labs are negative, and he does not have gastrointestinal bleeding. A possible pelvic hematoma was noted on CT, which could be a source of hypotension if expanding. However, the patient's hematocrit levels have been stable. Influenza DFA and urinary Legionella antigen tests were negative. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's right lower lobe lung consolidation may progress to pneumonia if not appropriately treated.
2. Neoplastic infiltration: The consolidation in the right lower lobe could also be due to neoplastic infiltration from the patient's metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
3. Hemodynamic instability: If the pelvic hematoma expands, it could cause hypotension and hemodynamic instability.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.
5. Stress ulcers: The patient is on pantoprazole prophyl"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with acute on chronic fatigue and shortness of breath, with a history of metastatic renal cell cancer to the lungs. The patient was found to have right lower lobe consolidation, which is concerning for pneumonia. The patient also has hypotension, which could be due to distributive shock or potential hematoma in the pelvis. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is elevated today despite no intervention since yesterday, likely due to appropriate hematopoiesis versus volume depletion. 

The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is within normal range, but there is a slight variation over the past few days. The platelet count (Plt) is also within normal range. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are stable and close to baseline, indicating that the acute on chronic renal failure is being managed appropriately. The patient's calcium level is slightly elevated, but stable and secondary to metastatic renal cell carcinoma. 

The patient has several medical conditions, including metastatic renal cell carcinoma, hypothyroidism, anxiety, and hypercalcemia. The patient is currently receiving various treatments, medications, and interventions for these conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening pneumonia, exacerbation of hypotension, further decline in renal function, and progression of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The patient's anxiety should also be monitored and managed appropriately."

   renal cell cancer to lungs, found to have RLL consolidation concerning
   for pneumonia.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Resolved. Was likely  [**12-21**] distributive shock.  RLL
   consolidation concerning for PNA, although differential includes
   neoplastic infiltration.  Hemolysis labs negative.  Guaiac negative in
   ED.  On CT a possible hematoma was noted in the pelvis. If expanding,
   this could be a source of hypotension.  However, Hct has been stable.
   Influenza DFA and urinary Legionella antigen negative.
   - Continue Vanc/zosyn to cover HCAP
   - Follow up pending cultures
   - TTE to evaluate for pericardial space infiltration by metastatic RCC.
   - hold antihypertensives for now
   - check C. diff given diarrhea
   - active T+S
   - Encourage incentive spirometry
   .
   # Hypercalcemia:  Secondary to metastatic renal cell CA, stable.
   -continue to trend ionized calcium
   .
   # Metastatic renal cell carcinoma:
   - appreciate heme/onc recs
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Recently started on levothyroxine.
   - continue home levothyroxine
   # Depression/Anxiety:
   - Re-start outpatient Ativan PRN for anxiety and Megace for appetite
   - f/u heme/onc and palliative care recs

   Code status: DNR/DNI
   Disposition: to ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old gentleman with a history of metastatic renal cell cancer. He was admitted with acute on chronic fatigue and shortness of breath. The patient has been diagnosed with right lower lobe consolidation, which could be pneumonia or neoplastic infiltration. His hypotension has resolved, and he is currently on vasopressors. The patient also has hypercalcemia secondary to metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Pneumonia: The right lower lobe consolidation could progress to pneumonia if not appropriately managed with antibiotics.

2. Neoplastic infiltration: The consolidation in the right lower lobe could also be due to neoplastic infiltration from the metastatic renal cell carcinoma. This needs to be evaluated further with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess for pericardial space infiltration.

3. Hemodynamic instability: Although the patient's hypotension has resolved, there is a possibility of hemodynamic instability if the pelvic hematoma expands, as noted on the CT scan. Monitoring the patient's vital signs and hemodynamic status closely is essential.

4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has stable hypercalcemia secondary to metastatic renal cell carcinoma. It is important to monitor the patient's calcium levels and provide appropriate management to prevent complications associated with high calcium levels.

5. Hypothyroidism: The patient recently started on"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yom with acute on chronic fatigue and SOB, h/o metastatic renal cell
   cancer to lungs.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Attributed to possible new infection/sepsis.
   Possible contributionof underlying malignancy (TNF release).
   SEPSIS -- concerns include lung infection or line related
   infections.    Continue current level of care.
   DYSPNEA -- Multifactorial, likely predominatly attributed to
   progressive lung involvement by renal cell CA, possible superimposed
   acute infection (bacterial, viral, fungal) --> Likely superimposed lung
   infection.  Less likely due to intraparenchymal bleed.  Doubt Pulmonary
   embolism.  Monitor RR, SaO2.
   LUNG INFILTRATES -- progressive, evolving.  Suggests pneumonia on
   background of renal cell involvement.  Continue antimicrobials
   (Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro) for HCAP.
   ANEMIA -- in part attributable to net volume resussitation, but at risk
   for bleed (vascular tumor), esp. intraabdominal.  If Hct continues to
   decline, reimage abdomen to assess for increased intraperitoneal bleed.
   HYPONATREMIA -- chronic, stable.  Monitor Na.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Now at
   baseline.  Monitor urine output, BUN, creatinine.  Avoid nephrotoxins.
   HYPERCALCEMIA
 Likely related to malignancy.  Improved with volume
   resussitation intervention.
   RENAL CELL CA -- Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, progressive, poor
   prognosis
   HYPOTHYROIDISM -- continue levothyroxine.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell cancer to the lungs.
- The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with sepsis, hypotension (resolved), dyspnea, lung infiltrates, anemia, hyponatremia, renal function impairment, hypercalcemia, and hypothyroidism.
- The patient's condition is critical, and he is on multiple medications including antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia and supportive care.
- The patient has a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and is considered to have a poor prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypotension: The patient previously experienced hypotension, which can compromise blood flow to vital organs and increase the risk of organ damage.
3. Dyspnea: The patient's difficulty in breathing may be attributed to progressive lung involvement by renal cell cancer or a superimposed acute infection.
4. Lung Infiltrates: The presence of lung infiltrates suggests pneumonia, which can worsen the patient's respiratory status and increase the risk of sepsis.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which can be exacerbated by ongoing bleeding from the renal cell cancer, particularly intraabdominal bleeding.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yom with acute on chronic fatigue and SOB, h/o metastatic renal cell
   cancer to lungs.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Attributed to possible new infection/sepsis.
   Possible contribution of underlying malignancy (TNF release).
   Marginal cortisol level and response to cotrosyn stimulation test.
   Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   SEPSIS -- concerns include lung infection or line related
   infections.    Continue current level of care, including
   antimicrobials.
   DYSPNEA -- Multifactorial, likely predominatly attributed to
   progressive lung involvement by renal cell CA, possible superimposed
   acute infection (bacterial, viral, fungal) --> Likely superimposed lung
   infection, and progression of pulmonary hypertension (suggested on
   current cardiac echo).   No evidence for pulmonary embolism by CTA.
   Monitor RR, SaO2.
   LUNG INFILTRATES -- progressive, evolving.  Suggests pneumonia on
   background of renal cell involvement.  Continue antimicrobials
   (Vanco/Zosyn/Cipro) for HCAP.
   ANEMIA -- in part attributable to net volume resussitation, but at risk
   for bleed (vascular tumor), esp. intraabdominal.  If Hct continues to
   decline, reimage abdomen to assess for increased intraperitoneal bleed.
   HYPONATREMIA -- chronic, stable.  Monitor Na.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  Now at
   baseline.  Monitor urine output, BUN, creatinine.  Avoid nephrotoxins.
   HYPERCALCEMIA
 Likely related to malignancy.  Improved with volume
   resussitation intervention.
   RENAL CELL CA -- Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, progressive, poor
   prognosis
   HYPOTHYROIDISM -- continue levothyroxine.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is sepsis. The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of metastatic renal cell cancer to the lungs. The patient's condition has improved with vasopressor weaning and feeling better overall, but some dyspnea is still noted.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.4Â°C (97.6Â°F)
- Heart rate: 92 bpm (normal range: 79-107 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 94/32 mmHg (normal range: 49-131/55-73 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (normal range: 12-31 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 97% (normal range: 90-100%)

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,042 mL and a total output of 1,525 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,517 mL.

The patient's lab results indicate:
- Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL (normal range: 13.5-17.5 g/dL)
- White blood cell count: 252 K/uL (normal range: 4.5-11 K/uL)
- Platelet count: 338 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
