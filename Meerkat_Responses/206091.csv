","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a medical history of angioedema, allergies to lisinopril, and previous myocardial infarction. The patient presented to the ICU with altered mental status, hypoglycemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and alcohol poisoning. The patient received thiamine supplementation, half an ampule of D50 for hypoglycemia, and one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 112/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels. There are also abnormalities in liver enzymes and electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wernicke's encephalopathy: The patient's history of alcoholism and hypoglycemia puts him at risk for Wernicke's encephalopathy. Thiamine supplementation has been given to prevent this condition.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding increases the risk of further bleeding complications.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low blood sugar level requires close monitoring and management to prevent recurrent episodes.
4. Alcohol withdrawal"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with Hep C & ETOH cirrhosis who presented with 1 day of BRBPR
   and was found to have elevated anion gap, glucose 55 and ETOH level
   145.
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Multiple possible etiologies for elevated gap.
   Lactate elevated at 4.4, ETOH level 145 with serum osms of 340, urine
   ketones positive.  Given h/o poor po intake, ETOH abuse and cirrhosis,
   suspect this is due alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis.  Lactate
   improving after hydration.
   - received thiamine 100mg IV followed by dextrose for low BS
   - received banana bag followed by D5 1/2NS
   - continue D5 1/2NS until nutritional status improves
   - trend lactate and ABGs
   - monitor MS
   .
   # BRBPR: Pt underwent EGD in [**1-2**] that revealed gastritis &
   duodenitis, colonoscopy in [**10-3**] was normal.  Hct has been stable with
   IVF and HD stable.  Suspect that may be a slow bleed due to gastritis
   or possible hemorrhoids.  No frank melena on exam to suggest brisk
   upper GI bleed.  INR elevated at 2.1 on presentation in setting of GI
   bleed.
   - NPO for now, apprec GI recs
   - IV Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - typed and crossed for 2u prbcs
   - trend hct q6hrs, transfuse if acute hct drop or hct<21 (tx 1U PRBC on
   [**3-8**])
   - given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed, will trend plts
   - admin Vitamin K 10mg po x 3 days
   - PIV x 2
   .
   # ETOH level/withdrawl: Pt with poor nutrition status and long history
   of ETOH abuse. She denies h/o withdrawal and current ETOH level of
   145.  Will place on CIWA scale for now.  Required total of 4mg IV
   Ativan [**3-8**] PM.
   - CIWA scale
   - Ativan 1mg q2hr prn CIWA >10

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcohol abuse presenting with 1 day of brown rice blood and being found to have elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, and an ethanol level of 145. The patient has a history of poor oral intake, cirrhosis, and cocaine abuse. 

Medical Complications:
1. Anion gap acidosis: The patient has an elevated anion gap, indicating a metabolic acidosis. The cause of this could be alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis, which is suspected due to the patient's history of poor oral intake, alcohol abuse, and elevated lactate levels.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has low blood sugar levels, which could be related to their history of poor oral intake and potential alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis. Immediate treatment with thiamine and dextrose has been initiated.

3. GI bleeding: The patient has experienced a gastrointestinal bleed, as indicated by the presence of brown rice blood and an elevated INR. This may be due to gastritis, duodenitis, or possible hemorrhoids. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been stable, but close monitoring is required.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, likely due to alcohol abuse. Given the GI bleed, platelet transfusion may be considered if there is a significant drop in platelet count or"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C, alcohol abuse, and cirrhosis. She presented with one day of brownish-red blood per rectal passage (BRBPR) and was found to have elevated anion gap, low glucose, and an alcohol level of 145. 

The patient is suspected to have alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis, given her history of poor oral intake, alcohol abuse, and cirrhosis. She received thiamine 100mg IV followed by dextrose for low blood sugar. She also received a banana bag followed by half-normal saline (D5 1/2NS) IV fluids. The plan is to continue D5 1/2NS until her nutritional status improves, monitor lactate and arterial blood gases (ABGs), and trend mean systemic (MS) pressure.

The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that revealed gastritis and duodenitis, but a colonoscopy was normal. Her hematocrit (Hct) has been stable with IV fluids and hemodialysis (HD), suggesting a slow bleed possibly due to gastritis or hemorrhoids. No brisk upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed was observed. An elevated INR of 2.1 on presentation is consistent with a GI bleed. The Hct has been mostly stable, making it unlikely to be a significant bleed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcohol abuse, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient presented with bloody stools, indicating a possible upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She was transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and platelets. Her hemoglobin (Hct) level has been stable, and the INR improved after Vitamin K administration. The patient also experienced mild ethanol/cocaine withdrawal symptoms and was placed on the CIWA scale for monitoring. Social work was consulted, and the patient refused detoxification again. The patient has a history of poor nutrition status, long-term alcohol abuse, and previous admission where she abused alcohol while in the hospital. The patient's anion gap acidosis resolved, likely due to lactate, ethanol, and ketonemia from starvation. Thiamine was administered, followed by dextrose for low blood sugar levels. The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to alcohol abuse, but it needs to be monitored closely due to the recent GI bleed. The patient's hypoglycemia resolved, and she was started on a regular diet. Prophylactic measures such as pneumoboots, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and bowel regimen were initiated. The patient has two peripheral IV lines, one 18-gauge and one 22-gauge."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with Hep C & ETOH cirrhosis with resolved BRBPR, stable Hct,
   no gap, in mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawl.
   # BRBPR: Pt underwent EGD in [**1-2**] that revealed gastritis &
   duodenitis, colonoscopy in [**10-3**] was normal.  Hct has been stable with
   IVF and HD stable.  Suspect that may be a slow bleed due to gastritis
   or possible hemorrhoids (seen on recent colonoscopy).  No frank melena
   on exam to suggest brisk upper GI bleed.  INR improved with Vit K
   administration. GI decided not to scope the patient. Transfuse Hct<21.
   - IV Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - transfused PRBC and platlets
   - do [**Hospital1 **] Hct, transfer back to unit for central line if BRBPR
   - given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed, will trend plts
   - admin Vitamin K 10mg po x 3 days
   - PIV x 2, 20g
   .
   # mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawl: Pt with poor nutrition status and long
   history of ETOH abuse. She denies h/o withdrawal and denies EtOH use
   within past 2-3 weeks, but current ETOH level of 145.  Will place on
   CIWA scale for now.  - CIWA scale
   - Ativan 1mg q2hr prn CIWA >10
   - Banana bag with MVI, folate, thiamine IV for two more days since not
   tolerating PO
   - Patient was seen by social work and refused detox last admission.
   Patient on previous admission was abusing while in the hospital.
   Section 35 was again discussed, but decided against the facilities that
   are part of Section 35 and will attempt to convince patient to get
   voluntary commitment
   - called psych so aware for possible section 35
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: resolved, Appears to have been caused by lactate,
   EtOH, and ketonemia from starvation. Given h/o poor po intake, ETOH
   abuse and cirrhosis, suspect this is due to alcoholic/starvation
   ketoacidosis. Lactate was elevated at 4.4, ETOH level was 145 with
   serum osms 340, urine ketones positive.  - received thiamine 100mg IV
   followed by dextrose for low BS. Lactate improved after hydration.
   - continuing to receive banana bag and D5 1/2NS
   .
   # Cocaine Abuse: Pt with long history of substance abuse and tox screen
   + for cocaine.  Pt has a h/o NSTEMI in setting of cocaine abuse. Pt
   currently denying CP, EKGs unchanged from prior.
   - cardiac enzymes negative
   - monitor on telemetry
   - no aspirin given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed
   - SW consult in am
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely due ETOH abuse, essentially at baseline.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcohol abuse, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding (BRBPR), mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawal, hypoglycemia, and anion gap acidosis. She has received transfusions of packed red blood cells and platelets, as well as IV Protonix for gastritis and duodenitis. Her Hct has been stable, and INR has improved with Vitamin K administration. The patient is alert, oriented, and shows no acute distress. Her vital signs are stable, and she is receiving IV fluids and antibiotics.

Potential Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's initial presentation of BRBPR indicates active bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. This could lead to further blood loss and hemodynamic instability if not managed appropriately.
2. Hepatitis C: The patient's history of Hepatitis C puts her at risk for liver disease progression, including cirrhosis and liver failure. This can lead to complications such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and increased susceptibility to infections.
3. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawal symptoms, which can progress to more severe withdrawal symptoms if not treated appropriately. This can include agitation, seizures, and delirium tremens.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is thrombocytopenic. This places"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, myocardial infarction, alcohol poisoning, and hypoglycemia. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, hypertension, tachycardia, tactile hallucinations consistent with cocaine/EtOH withdrawal, and a recent episode of gross blood in stool. He received a blood transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells and platelets, with stable hematocrit levels and improved INR. The patient became nauseous and was given ondansetron, switching medications to IV. He developed hypertensive, anxious, tachycardic, and tactile hallucinations in the evening, which are consistent with cocaine/EtOH withdrawal. The patient was placed on the CIWA scale with IV diazepam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient's recent episode of gross blood in the stool indicates active gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and potential shock.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of hypoglycemia, and the current glucose level is low at 52 mg/dL. Hypoglycemia can cause altered mental status, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias if not promptly treated.
3. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has a history of acute myocardial infarction, which"

   62 y/o F with Hep C & ETOH cirrhosis who presented with 1 day of BRBPR
   and was found to have elevated anion gap, glucose 55 and ETOH level
   145.
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Multiple possible etiologies for elevated gap.
   Lactate elevated at 4.4, ETOH level 145 with serum osms of 340, urine
   ketones positive.  Given h/o poor po intake, ETOH abuse and cirrhosis,
   suspect this is due to alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis.  Lactate
   improving after hydration.
   - received thiamine 100mg IV followed by dextrose for low BS
   - received banana bag followed by D5 1/2NS
   - continue D5 1/2NS until nutritional status improves
   - trend lactate and ABGs
   - monitor MS
   .
   # BRBPR: Pt underwent EGD in [**1-2**] that revealed gastritis &
   duodenitis, colonoscopy in [**10-3**] was normal.  Hct has been stable with
   IVF and HD stable.  Suspect that may be a slow bleed due to gastritis
   or possible hemorrhoids (seen on recent colonoscopy).  No frank melena
   on exam to suggest brisk upper GI bleed.  INR elevated at 2.1 on
   presentation in setting of GI bleed.  HCT mostly stable, unlikely to be
   significant bleed.
   - GI with no plan to scope
   - IV Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - typed and crossed for 2u prbcs
   - trend hct q6hrs, transfuse if acute hct drop or hct<21 (tx 1U PRBC on
   [**3-8**])
   - given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed, will trend plts
   - admin Vitamin K 10mg po x 3 days
   - PIV x 2
   .
   # ETOH level/withdrawl: Pt with poor nutrition status and long history
   of ETOH abuse. She denies h/o withdrawal and denies EtOH use within
   past 2-3 weeks, but current ETOH level of 145.  Will place on CIWA
   scale for now.  Required total of 4mg IV Ativan [**3-8**] PM.
   - CIWA scale
   - Ativan 1mg q2hr prn CIWA >10
   - Banana bag with MVI, folate, thiamine
   - Patient was seen by social work and refused detox last admission.
   Patient on previous admission was abusing while in the hospital.
   Section 35 was again discussed, but decided against the facilities that
   are part of Section 35 and will attempt to convince patient to get
   voluntary commitment
   - will need SW c/s to re-address this issue
   .
   # Cocaine Abuse: Pt with long history of substance abuse and tox screen
   + for cocaine.  Pt has a h/o NSTEMI in setting of cocaine abuse. Pt
   currently denying CP, EKGs unchanged from prior.
   - cardiac enzymes negative
   - monitor on telemetry
   - no aspirin given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed
   - SW consult in am
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: Pt reports poor po intake, concern for
   alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis given elevated gap and low BS.
   - received thiamine 100mg IV to prevent Wernickes
   - dextrose [**1-27**] amp after thiamine
   -  D5 1/2NS IVF until eating
   - hold on insulin regimen
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely due ETOH abuse, essentially at baseline.
   However, given GI bleed, would consider plt transfusion if dropping hct
   or plt count
   - transfuse 1u plts prn
   - f/u plt count
   .
   # FEN: Regular diet
   - s/p Thiamine 100mg IV, banana bag and D5 1/2NS
   - aggressive electrolyte repletion
