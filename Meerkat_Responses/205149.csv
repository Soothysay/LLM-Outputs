   Assessment and Plan
   32 y/o M with hx of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures
   presents with UTI on [**7-18**].  He then developed fevers and hypotension
   overnight on [**7-19**] and has coag + SA in his blood cultures.  On exam, has
   new fullness of R jaw and tenderness to palpation, concerning for
   possible abscess.
   .
   # Bacteremia - has new staph aureus bacteremia, source unknown at this
   time, but concerning for facial abscess.  Hemodynamics unstable on the
   floor with hypotension but since admission to MICU have been stable.
   CT scan showed submandibular enlargement and stranding.  Has R IJ
   thrombus.  Possible Lemmiere
s syndrome.
   - ENT consult today
   - neurosurg consult for possible removal of shunts as they run through
   infected neck space
   - cont vanco
   - cont Zosyn for anaerobe and gram neg coverage from mouth flora
   - surveillance blood cultures
   .
   # RIJ thrombophlebitis
 will start heparin gtt once procedures
   completed
   .
   # Hypotension - in the setting of high grade bacteremia, responded to
   fluid boluses on the floor, continues to be mildly hypotensive on the
   floor.
   - IVFs as needed
   - monitor urine output
   - monitor respiratory status for fluid overload, stable now
   - will obtain central access for possible need of pressor support
   .
   # UTI - has pan-[**Last Name (un) **] proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process
   from the staph aureus bacteremia
   - stopped ceftriaxone, Zosyn will cover proteus [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **]
   - foley changed and negative urine cx since change
   - does not have indwelling foley, once stabalized, consider d/c'ing
   foley and using home diapers
   .
   # Cough/SOB - CXR without evidence of pneumonia, no obvious source.
   Patient passed a speech and swallow.
   - has risk of septic pulmonary embolic
   - heparin and abx as above
   - otherwise no obvious source for cough at this time, no hypoxic
   .
   # Hydrocephalus - has known hydrocephalus and a shunt that was last
   imaged in [**7-24**] that showed a non-working shunt; in setting of new
   bacteremia and foreign body, would need to consider seeding, no
   evidence of altered mental status at this time, though.
   - head CT without change from last year
   - would need to consider lumbar puncture or shunt tap if the suspected
   source of bacteremia is negative
   - f/u neurosurg recs
   .
   # Seizures - stable, last seizure one year ago
   - continue keppra at home dose
   .
   # Contractures - stable, moves upper extremities, need to keep L arm
   restrained because patient likes to bite on it.
   - continue baclofen as has case reports of withdrawl from it
   - hold if hypotensive
   .
   # FEN - NPO for now, has passed speech and swallow and can have regular
   diet when he proves to be hemodynamically stable
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures. He presents with urinary tract infection (UTI) on [**7-18**], followed by fevers and hypotension overnight on [**7-19**]. The patient has coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in his blood cultures, suggesting bacteremia. He also has a facial abscess, which may be the source of bacteremia. The patient is experiencing hemodynamic instability and has a right internal jugular (IJ) thrombus. There is a possibility of Lemierre syndrome, which is a rare complication of oropharyngeal infection leading to thrombophlebitis of the IJ vein.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Bacteremia - The patient has new staph aureus bacteremia, with a possible source being the facial abscess. Hemodynamics are unstable due to hypotension, but the patient has been stable since admission to the MICU. A CT scan showed submandibular enlargement and stranding. ENT consult is recommended today, as well as a neurosurg consult for possible removal of shunts since they run through the infected neck space. Continuous vancomycin and Zosyn for anaerobic and gram-negative coverage from mouth flora are advised, along with surveillance blood cultures.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever and hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various tests and treatments. Notably, the patient's blood cultures were taken at 04:00 AM, and he was febrile around 1am. The patient also has an enlarged right submandibular gland with surrounding fat stranding, concerning for cellulitis. Additionally, there are findings suggestive of likely right internal jugular (IJ) thrombosis, with vein wall enhancement and peri-venous inflammation. The patient's blood pressure is trending down in the 80s/50s, and he has been responding to 1L NS and stabilized with heart rates in the 90s and blood pressures in the 90s/60s. The patient's central venous access has been poor, and he has lost a new peripheral IV, with orders for a PICC evaluation in the morning.

Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Bacteremia: The patient's fever and positive blood cultures indicate the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream, which can lead to systemic infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates inadequate blood flow to vital organs, which can result in organ damage or failure if not promptly addressed.
3. Thrombosis: The findings suggestive of right internal jugular (IJ) throm"

   Assessment and Plan
   32 y/o M with hx of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures
   presents with UTI on [**7-18**].  He then developed fevers and hypotension
   overnight on [**7-19**] and has coag + SA in his blood cultures.  On exam, has
   new fullness of R jaw and tenderness to palpation, concerning for
   possible abscess.
   .
   # Bacteremia - has new staph aureus bacteremia, source unknown at this
   time, but concerning for facial abscess.  Hemodynamics unstable on the
   floor with hypotension but since admission to MICU have been stable.
   - trend fever curve
   - add diff on to labs
   - cont vanco for staph coverage
   - CT neck with contrast
   - ENT consult if abscess
   - IVFs as needed for hypotension, tachycardia
   - if persistently hypotensive, would place a-line
   - consider CVL if needed later tonight
   - echo in the AM to rule out endocarditis
   .
   # Hypotension - in the setting of high grade bacteremia, responded to
   fluid boluses on the floor.
   - IVFs as needed
   - monitor urine output
   - trend lactates if worrisome, normal this afternoon; elevated on
   admission
   - monitor respiratory status for fluid overload, stable now
   .
   # UTI - has pan-[**Last Name (un) **] proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process
   from the staph aureus bacteremia
   - cont ceftriaxone for 7 day complicated UTI course, day [**2-20**]
   - foley changed and negative urine cx since change
   - does not have indwelling foley, once stabalized, consider d/c'ing
   foley and using home diapers
   .
   # Cough/SOB - CXR without evidence of pneumonia, no obvious source.
   Patient passed a speech and swallow.
   - continue to monitor for airway compromise in setting of possible
   abscess
   - continue to monitor continuous O2 sat
   - CXR if hypoxic
   - NPO for now to reduce aspiration risk
   .
   # Hydrocephalus - has known hydrocephalus and a shunt that was last
   imaged in [**7-24**] that showed a non-working shunt; in setting of new
   bacteremia and foreign body, would need to consider seeding, no
   evidence of altered mental status at this time, though.
   - start with head CT
   - would need to consider lumbar puncture or shunt tap if the suspected
   source of bacteremia is negative
   .
   # Seizures - stable, last seizure one year ago
   - continue keppra at home dose
   .
   # Contractures - stable, moves upper extremities, need to keep L arm
   restrained because patient likes to bite on it.
   - continue baclofen as has case reports of withdrawl from it
   - hold if hypotensive
   .
   # FEN - NPO for now, has passed speech and swallow and can have regular
   diet when he proves to be hemodynamically stable

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures. He presents with urinary tract infection (UTI) on July 18th, followed by fevers and hypotension overnight on July 19th. The patient also has coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus in his blood cultures, indicating a possible bacteremia. On examination, he has new fullness of the right jaw and tenderness to palpation, suggesting a possible facial abscess.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate in the 80s, blood pressure in the 80s/50s, respiratory rate in the 90s, and oxygen saturation at 99%. He is currently on prophylactic heparin, vancomycin, and piperacillin-tazobactam.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and slightly abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, but his lactic acid level is elevated.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has new-onset Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, possibly due to a facial abscess. Source control and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient responded to fluid boluses but remains hypotensive. IV fluids will"

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures. He presents with urinary tract infection (UTI) on [7-18], followed by fevers and hypotension overnight on [7-19]. He also has coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus in his blood cultures. On examination, he has new fullness and tenderness in his right jaw, which is concerning for a possible abscess.

Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia - The patient has new staphylococcus bacteremia, with the source unknown at this time, but it is concerning for facial abscess.
2. Hypotension - The patient is experiencing unstable hemodynamics, with persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation.
3. UTI - The patient has a pan-prostate Proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process from the staphylococcus bacteremia.
4. Cough/SOB - The patient has cough and shortness of breath, but his chest X-ray does not show evidence of pneumonia. No obvious source of infection has been identified.
5. Hydrocephalus - The patient has known hydrocephalus and a shunt that was last imaged on [7-24], showing a non-working shunt. In the setting of new bacteremia and foreign body, consideration should be given to seeding, although there is no evidence of altered mental status at this time.
6. Seizures - The patient is stable and has not had a seizure in the past year. He is currently on keppra at home dose.
7. Contractures - The patient has upper extremity contractures and needs to keep his left arm restrained.
8. FEN - The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth), but has passed speech and swallow and can have a regular diet when he proves to be hemodynamically stable.
9. Access - The patient has two peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines.
10. PPx - The patient is receiving subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and no gastrointestinal prophylaxis is indicated. Bowel regular per rectum (PRN), head of bed altered while mental status depressed.

Please note that this summary and list of potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and assessment may be required to determine the exact nature and severity of the patient's condition."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), presenting with sepsis. He has multiple comorbidities including a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Proteus species, and there are concerns about suppurative thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein (IJ). 

The patient's vital signs show fever, mild hypotension, and tachypnea. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula with a SpO2 of 99%. The physical examination reveals swelling and tenderness on the right cheek and neck, warm extremities, and poor dentition.

Laboratory results indicate anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies show a right lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray, which is stable, and a neck CT scan indicating a potential right IJ thrombus. Microbiology reports suggest coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia.

The assessment and plan include neurosurgery and ENT consults, continuation of vancomycin, addition of Zosyn for presumed polymicrobial infection, consideration of a CT looking for septic emboli, ID consult for antibiotic choice and duration, initiation of anticoagulation, continuation of antiepileptic medication, management of UTI, access for central venous catheterization, ICU care, and prophylaxis for"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and previous non-functional ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. He was initially admitted with ""blue spells"" but was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) in the emergency department. He was also found to be hypotensive with positive blood cultures while on the floor, leading to transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

The patient has been experiencing mild hypotension overnight, which responded to fluids. He has a fever and shows signs of respiratory distress. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 98/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. His blood cultures are positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.

Physical examination reveals poor dentition, right cheek and neck swelling, and trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurological examination is significantly impaired due to his TBI. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies include a head CT scan showing no significant changes, a chest X-ray revealing a right lower lobe opacity that is stable, and a neck CT scan indicating possible suppurative thrombophlebitis of the"

   [**2106-7-21**].
   - ID consulted.  They recommended narrowing coverated to Zosyn alone as
   it covers gram negative, anaerobes and has good MSSA coverage.  They
   agreed with removal of VA shunt by Neurosurg.  They are recommending
   consideration of TEE.
   - ENT consulted; recommended sour candy/[**Doctor Last Name 9897**] wedges to stimulate
   submandibular secretions and to monitor for neck fullness
   - Neurosurg consulted;  They will remove the Ventricular-Atrial Shunt
   on Friday after talking to the family.
   - Femoral line placed
   - Patient became hypotensive to the 70s at 10 PM after becoming
   febrile.  He was given 3LNS and then started on Levophed.  An a-line
   was also placed.  Remains on Levophed 0.08.
   - Patient transiently bradycardic to 30s, but recovered on his own, in
   setting of hypotension.
   - Radiology confirmed that one shunt is a V-P shunt and the other shunt
   is a ventricular-atrial shunt that runs through the right IJ
   - Per family, patient had a shunt placed in [**2091**] due to seizure
   activity.  He had no improvement with the first shunt, so a second was

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male admitted to the ICU with septic thrombophlebitis and right submandibular space infection. The patient has a history of seizures for which he had shunts placed, but did not show improvement with the first shunt, so a second one was placed, and seizures resolved. The patient is currently unable to provide history due to being sedated and encephalopathic.

24-hour events include:
- ID consultation recommending narrowing coverage to Zosyn alone, which covers gram-negative, anaerobes, and has good MSSA coverage. They agreed with removal of VA shunt by Neurosurg and recommended consideration of TEE.
- ENT consultation recommended sour candy/Doctor Last Name 9897 wedges to stimulate submandibular secretions and monitor for neck fullness.
- Neurosurg consultation agreed to remove the Ventricular-Atrial Shunt on Friday after talking to the family.
- Femoral line placement.
- Patient became hypotensive to the 70s at 10 PM after becoming febrile. Given 3LNS and started on Levophed. An arterial line was also placed. Remains on Levophed 0.08.
- Patient transiently bradycardic to 30s, but recovered on his own, in the setting of hypotension.

   32 y/o M with hx of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures
   presents admitted with UTI now here with submandibular infection and
   septic thrombophelbitis of the Right IJ associated with
   Ventricular-Atrial shunt that runs through the IJ with high grade staph
   aureaus bacteremia.
   .
   Septic thrombophlebitis/ Submandibular infection.  Patient has
   significiant right jaw swelling with R IJ thrombophlebitis and an
   adjacent submandibular space infection.  Patient has worsening of jaw
   swelling over the course of 36 hours.  Currently no drainable fluid
   collection and airway currently intact though tongue swelling is
   progressing.  Only positive culture data is high grade staph
   bacteremia.
   - continue zosyn for MSSA coverage and for coverage of oral GNRs and
   anaerobes
   - serial clinical exams
   - [**Doctor Last Name 9897**] wedges to stimulate submandibular gland secretions
   - monitor for signs of airway compromise
   - ID following
   - awaiting removal of V-A shunt which is presumed to be infected given
   staph bacteremia and presence of line at the site of septic
   thrombophlebitis
   - heparin drip for Right IJ thrombus
   - f/u RUE ultrasound to confirm presence of occlusive thrombus
   - consider CTA to look for septic pulmonary emboli if develops
   respiratory symptoms
   - will defer panorex given inability of patient to particapte in the
   studies
   .
   # Septic shock.  Source of infection is likely infected V-A shunt in
   Right IJ and adjacent submandibular infection.  Now with staph aureus
   bacteremia.  Also has proteus UTI.
   - zosyn to cover MSSA and oral anaerobes and GNS
   - IVF boluses to wean pressors
   - continue levophed
   - will discuss with neurosurg more urgent removal of V-A shunt given
   worsening of clnical status
   .
   # UTI - has pan-[**Last Name (un) **] proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process
   from the staph aureus bacteremia
   - continue Zosyn though repeat culture is negative
   .
   # Hydrocephalus - has known hydrocephalus and a shunt that was last
   imaged in [**7-24**] that showed a non-working shunt; in setting of new
   bacteremia and foreign body, would need to consider seeding, no
   evidence of altered mental status at this time, though.
   - head CT without change from last year
   - would need to consider lumbar puncture or shunt tap if the suspected
   source of bacteremia is negative
   - f/u neurosurg recs
   .
   # Seizures - stable, last seizure one year ago
   - continue keppra at home dose
   .
   # Contractures - stable, moves upper extremities, need to keep L arm
   restrained because patient likes to bite on it.
   - continue baclofen as has case reports of withdrawl from it
   - hold if hypotensive

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures. He presents with a submandibular infection, septic thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein (IJ), and high-grade Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. The patient has worsening jaw swelling, and there is a ventricular-atrial shunt that runs through the IJ. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway Compromise: The patient has significant tongue swelling, which can progress and potentially compromise his airway.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing hypotension and fever, suggesting septic shock. Immediate medical intervention is required to stabilize the patient's condition.
3. Infection: The patient has a submandibular infection and septic thrombophlebitis. There is a need for ongoing antibiotic coverage and consideration of source control measures, such as removal of the infected shunt.
4. UTI: The patient has a Proteus urinary tract infection, which requires appropriate antibiotic therapy.
5. Hydrocephalus: The patient has known hydrocephalus, and there is a concern about the possibility of shunt infection. Further evaluation, including a head CT scan, may be necessary to assess the situation.
6. Contractures: The patient has contractures in his feet and requires ongoing management and physical therapy.
7. Access: The patient requires central line access"

   presents admitted with UTI now here with submandibular infection and
   septic thrombophelbitis of the Right IJ associated with
   Ventricular-Atrial shunt that runs through the IJ with high grade staph
   aureaus bacteremia.
   .
   Septic thrombophlebitis/ Submandibular infection.  Patient has
   significiant right jaw swelling with R IJ thrombophlebitis and an
   adjacent submandibular space infection.  Patient has worsening of jaw
   swelling over the course of 36 hours.  Currently no drainable fluid
   collection and airway currently intact though tongue swelling is
   progressing.  Only positive culture data is high grade staph
   bacteremia.
   - continue zosyn for MSSA coverage and for coverage of oral GNRs and
   anaerobes
   - serial clinical exams
   - [**Doctor Last Name 9897**] wedges to stimulate submandibular gland secretions
   - monitor for signs of airway compromise
   - ID following
   - awaiting removal of V-A shunt which is presumed to be infected given
   staph bacteremia and presence of line at the site of septic
   thrombophlebitis
   - heparin drip for Right IJ thrombus
   - f/u RUE ultrasound to confirm presence of occlusive thrombus
   - consider CT chest to look for septic pulmonary emboli if develops
   respiratory symptoms
   - will defer panorex given inability of patient to particapte in the
   studies
   - will discuss with ENT re: direct visualization of the airway given
   worsening clinical exam
   .
   Septic shock.  Source of infection is likely infected V-A shunt in
   Right IJ and adjacent submandibular infection.  Now with staph aureus
   bacteremia.  Also has proteus UTI.
   - zosyn to cover MSSA and oral anaerobes and GNS
   - IVF boluses to wean pressors
   - continue levophed
   - will discuss with neurosurg more urgent removal of V-A shunt given
   worsening of clnical status
   .
   UTI - has pan-[**Last Name (un) **] proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process from
   the staph aureus bacteremia
   - continue Zosyn though repeat culture is negative
   .
   Hydrocephalus - has known hydrocephalus and a shunt that was last
   imaged in [**7-24**] that showed a non-working shunt; in setting of new
   bacteremia and foreign body, there is concern for hardware infection.
   - discuss with neurosurg re: removal of hardware
   .
   Seizures - stable, last seizure one year ago
   - continue keppra at home dose
   .
   Contractures - stable, moves upper extremities, need to keep L arm
   restrained because patient likes to bite on it.
   - continue baclofen as has case reports of withdrawl from it
   - hold if hypotensive
   .
   FEN - NPO for now given neck/airway swelling, has passed speech and
   swallow and can have regular diet when he proves to be hemodynamically
   stable

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures.
- He presented with a urinary tract infection and is now being treated for submandibular infection and septic thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein (IJ).
- The patient has a ventricular-atrial shunt that runs through the right IJ, which is associated with high-grade Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
- The patient's condition is worsening, with significant right jaw swelling, tongue swelling, and a submandibular space infection.
- Cultures have only shown high-grade Staphylococcus bacteremia, and there is no drainable fluid collection.
- The patient is currently on zosyn for MSSA coverage and for coverage of oral Gram-negative rods and anaerobes.
- Serial clinical exams are being performed, and [Doctor Last Name 9897] wedges are being used to stimulate submandibular gland secretions.
- The patient's airway is currently intact, but there is a concern for airway compromise.
- Infectious disease (ID) follow-up is recommended.

   Septic thrombophlebitis, right submandibular space infection
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2106-7-21**].
   - ID consulted.  They recommended narrowing coverated to Zosyn alone as
   it covers gram negative, anaerobes and has good MSSA coverage.  They
   agreed with removal of VA shunt by Neurosurg.  They are recommending
   consideration of TEE.
   - ENT consulted; recommended sour candy/[**Doctor Last Name 9897**] wedges to stimulate
   submandibular secretions and to monitor for neck fullness
   - Neurosurg consulted;  They will remove the Ventricular-Atrial Shunt
   on Friday after talking to the family.
   - Femoral line placed
   - Patient became hypotensive to the 70s at 10 PM after becoming
   febrile.  He was given 3LNS and then started on Levophed.  An a-line
   was also placed.  Remains on Levophed 0.08.
   - Patient transiently bradycardic to 30s, but recovered on his own, in
   setting of hypotension.
   - Radiology confirmed that one shunt is a V-P shunt and the other shunt
   is a ventricular-atrial shunt that runs through the right IJ
   - Per family, patient had a shunt placed in [**2091**] due to seizure
   activity.  He had no improvement with the first shunt, so a second was
   place, and seizures resolved.  Will need to obtain these records from
   [**Hospital 927**] [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**State **]
   - more episodes of sinus bradycardia to 50s overnight while sleeping;
   vagal tone while sleeping +/- neck pressure from neck swelling
   - worsening neck swelling --> CT scan versus ENT eval in AM?

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures. He presented with a urinary tract infection (UTI) on July 18th and subsequently developed fevers and hypotension overnight on July 19th. He has coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and a possible facial abscess. He also has a right internal jugular (RIJ) thrombus and is being evaluated for Lemierre's syndrome. The patient has been stable since admission to the MICU but remains mildly hypotensive. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Facial abscess: The patient's symptoms, including increased right jaw swelling and tenderness to palpation, are concerning for a facial abscess. Further evaluation and treatment by an ENT consultant is recommended.
2. Lemierre's syndrome: The presence of an RIJ thrombus and bacteremia raises the suspicion of Lemierre's syndrome. This condition is a rare complication of oropharyngeal infection leading to thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein and septic emboli. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of septic pulmonary emboli.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been mildly hypotensive since admission. This may be due to septic shock secondary to the bacteremia. Continuous monitoring and appropriate management with IV fluids and pressor support as needed are necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and multiple shunts, presenting with right internal jugular (RIJ) thrombophlebitis and MSSA bacteremia. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ongoing sepsis: The patient has shown signs of recurrent fever and hypotension, indicating a possible ongoing infection, likely from a foreign object such as the shunt.
2. Septic shock: Due to the suspected ongoing sepsis, there is a risk of developing septic shock, which can lead to organ failure and potentially be life-threatening.
3. Airway compromise: The patient's neck swelling and tongue enlargement may pose a risk for airway obstruction, especially during procedures or if the swelling worsens.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The presence of an RIJ thrombophlebitis increases the risk of developing a DVT, which could lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism.
5. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: With MSSA bacteremia and potential sepsis, there is a risk of sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including renal dysfunction, respiratory failure, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
6. Surgical complications: The planned removal of the VA shunt by neurosurgery may carry its own risks, including bleeding"

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and multiple shunts. He presents with right internal jugular (RIJ) thrombophlebitis and MSSA bacteremia. The patient is currently experiencing recurrent fever and hypotension, suggesting ongoing sepsis, possibly due to a foreign object. He is awaiting removal of his ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt by neurosurgery. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 117/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is receiving heparin, norepinephrine, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is not able to provide his own medical history as he is unresponsive and has encephalopathy. His allergies include sulfonamides, and his last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 07/21/2106 at 08:00 AM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ongoing sepsis: The patient's recurrent fever and hypotension indicate ongoing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly managed.
2. Thrombophlebitis: The presence of RIJ thrombophlebitis increases the risk of deep vein throm"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 BACTEREMIA
   32 y/o M with hx of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures
   presents admitted with UTI now here with submandibular infection and
   septic thrombophelbitis of the Right IJ associated with
   Ventricular-Atrial shunt that runs through the IJ with high grade staph
   aureaus bacteremia.
   .
   Septic thrombophlebitis/ Submandibular infection.  Patient has
   significiant right jaw swelling with R IJ thrombophlebitis and an
   adjacent submandibular space infection.  Patient has worsening of jaw
   swelling over the course of 36 hours.  Currently no drainable fluid
   collection and airway currently intact though tongue swelling is
   progressing.  Only positive culture data is high grade staph bacteremia
   of coag neg and positive types.
   - continue zosyn for MSSA coverage and for coverage of oral GNRs and
   anaerobes
   - serial clinical exams
   - [**Doctor Last Name 9897**] wedges to stimulate submandibular gland secretions
   - monitor for signs of airway compromise
   - ID following
   - awaiting removal of V-A shunt which is presumed to be infected given
   staph bacteremia and presence of line at the site of septic
   thrombophlebitis
   - heparin drip for Right IJ thrombus
   - RUE u/s confirms presents of IJ clot. CT neck as above. ECHO showing
   tip of shunt in RA.
   - CT chest.
   - will defer panorex given inability of patient to particapte in the

   - will discuss with ENT re: direct visualization of the airway if
   worsening clinical exam
   .
   Septic shock.  Source of infection is likely infected V-A shunt in
   Right IJ and adjacent submandibular infection.  Now with staph aureus
   bacteremia.  Also has proteus UTI.
   - zosyn to cover MSSA, coag neg staph, and oral anaerobes and GNS
   - IVF boluses to wean pressors
   - continue levophed
   - will discuss with neurosurg/vasc  re: removal of V-A shunt given
   worsening of clnical status
   .
   UTI - has pan-[**Last Name (un) **] proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process from
   the staph aureus bacteremia
   - continue Zosyn though repeat culture is negative
   .
   Hydrocephalus - has known hydrocephalus and a shunt that was last
   imaged in [**7-24**] that showed a non-working shunt; in setting of new
   bacteremia and foreign body, there is concern for hardware infection.
   - discuss with neurosurg re: removal of hardware
   .
   Seizures - stable, last seizure one year ago
   - continue keppra at home dose
   .
   Contractures - stable, moves upper extremities, need to keep L arm
   restrained because patient likes to bite on it.
   - continue baclofen as has case reports of withdrawl from it
   - hold if hypotensive
   .
   FEN - NPO for now given neck/airway swelling, has passed speech and
   swallow and can have regular diet when he proves to be hemodynamically
   stable. Will place NGT today.

","The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures. He was admitted with a urinary tract infection and is now presenting with submandibular infection and septic thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein (IJ), associated with a ventricular-atrial shunt that runs through the IJ. He has high-grade Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.

The patient has significant right jaw swelling with R IJ thrombophlebitis and an adjacent submandibular space infection. The swelling has been worsening over the course of 36 hours. Currently, there is no drainable fluid collection, and the airway is intact, although tongue swelling is progressing. The only positive culture data is high-grade staph bacteremia of coag-negative and positive types.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 162/150 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is receiving intravenous fluids and has a central venous pressure line in the femoral vein and an arterial line in the right radial artery.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 343 K/uL,"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. They have a history of unresponsiveness and require life support. The patient is experiencing hypotension, bacteremia, thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein (RIJ), Lemierre's syndrome, and odontogenic disease/infection. They are also on various medications, including IVF with bicarb, Keppra changed to IV, baclofen discontinued, and antibiotics such as zosyn and meropenem. The patient has undergone several tests, including blood cultures, an echo confirming the presence of a shunt in the right atrium, a CT scan of the neck showing thrombus within the RIJ with hyperenhancement of the wall and adjacent inflammatory stranding, and a neck CT revealing facial swelling and edema in the oropharyngeal mucosa and uvula. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 162/150 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, anemia, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension and bacteremia, and their condition requires ongoing monitoring and management in the ICU.

 BACTEREMIA
   32 y/o M with hx of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures
   presents admitted with UTI now here with submandibular infection and
   septic thrombophelbitis of the Right IJ associated with
   Ventricular-Atrial shunt that runs through the IJ with high grade staph
   aureaus bacteremia.
   .
   Septic thrombophlebitis/ Submandibular infection.  Patient has
   significiant right jaw swelling with R IJ thrombophlebitis and an
   adjacent submandibular space infection.  Patient has worsening of jaw
   swelling over the course of 36 hours.  Currently no drainable fluid
   collection and airway currently intact though tongue swelling is
   progressing.  Only positive culture data is high grade staph
   bacteremia.
   - continue zosyn for MSSA coverage and for coverage of oral GNRs and
   anaerobes
   - serial clinical exams
   - [**Doctor Last Name 9897**] wedges to stimulate submandibular gland secretions
   - monitor for signs of airway compromise
   - ID following
   - awaiting removal of V-A shunt which is presumed to be infected given
   staph bacteremia and presence of line at the site of septic
   thrombophlebitis
   - heparin drip for Right IJ thrombus
   - f/u RUE ultrasound to confirm presence of occlusive thrombus
   - consider CT chest to look for septic pulmonary emboli if develops
   respiratory symptoms
   - will defer panorex given inability of patient to particapte in the
   studies
   - will discuss with ENT re: direct visualization of the airway given
   worsening clinical exam
   .
   Septic shock.  Source of infection is likely infected V-A shunt in
   Right IJ and adjacent submandibular infection.  Now with staph aureus
   bacteremia.  Also has proteus UTI.
   - zosyn to cover MSSA and oral anaerobes and GNS
   - IVF boluses to wean pressors
   - continue levophed
   - will discuss with neurosurg more urgent removal of V-A shunt given
   worsening of clnical status
   .
   UTI - has pan-[**Last Name (un) **] proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process from
   the staph aureus bacteremia
   - continue Zosyn though repeat culture is negative
   .
   Hydrocephalus - has known hydrocephalus and a shunt that was last
   imaged in [**7-24**] that showed a non-working shunt; in setting of new
   bacteremia and foreign body, there is concern for hardware infection.
   - discuss with neurosurg re: removal of hardware
   .
   Seizures - stable, last seizure one year ago
   - continue keppra at home dose
   .
   Contractures - stable, moves upper extremities, need to keep L arm
   restrained because patient likes to bite on it.
   - continue baclofen as has case reports of withdrawl from it
   - hold if hypotensive
   .
   FEN - NPO for now given neck/airway swelling, has passed speech and
   swallow and can have regular diet when he proves to be hemodynamically
   stable

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures. He was admitted with a urinary tract infection and now presents with submandibular infection and septic thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein (IJ) associated with a ventricular-atrial shunt that runs through the IJ. The patient has significant right jaw swelling with R IJ thrombophlebitis and an adjacent submandibular space infection. He is experiencing worsening jaw swelling over the course of 36 hours, and his airway is currently intact, although tongue swelling is progressing. The only positive culture data is high-grade Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, which may be due to septic shock caused by the infected shunt and submandibular infection.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has a high-grade Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, which increases the risk of further systemic infection.
3. Septic Thrombophlebitis: The patient has developed septic thrombophlebitis in the right IJ, which could lead to embolic events such as septic pulmonary emboli.
4. Submandibular Infection: The patient has an adjacent submandibular space infection, which can potentially compromise the air"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and a ventriculoperitoneal (VA) shunt. He is currently experiencing suppurative thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein (IJ) and polymicrobial bacteremia. The patient is in septic shock and awaiting surgical removal of the VA shunt.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient already has polymicrobial bacteremia and septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not properly managed.
2. Thrombosis: The patient has suppurative thrombophlebitis of the right IJ, and there is minimal questionable thrombus adjacent to the wall of the superior vena cava (SVC). This increases the risk of further clot formation and potential embolization.
3. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's critical condition may result in organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, or neurological dysfunction.
4. Infection: With polymicrobial bacteremia and the presence of a VA shunt, the patient is at risk for developing additional infections.
5. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient requires ongoing pressor support, indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability. This could lead to fluctuations in blood pressure and compromised organ perfusion.
6. Nutritional Support: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth), which may lead to malnutrition and delayed wound"

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures. He was admitted with a urinary tract infection and now presents with a submandibular infection and septic thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein (IJ) associated with a ventricular-atrial shunt that runs through the IJ. He has high-grade Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Septic thrombophlebitis/submandibular infection: The patient has significant right jaw swelling with R IJ thrombophlebitis and an adjacent submandibular space infection. He is currently on Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) for MSSA coverage and oral GNRs and anaerobes. Serial clinical exams are being conducted, and airway compromise is being monitored. An infectious disease consultation is pending, and removal of the V-A shunt is planned due to suspected infection. Heparin drip is being administered for the right IJ thrombus.

2. Septic shock: The source of infection is likely the infected V-A shunt in the right IJ and adjacent submandibular infection. He has Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and a Proteus UTI. Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) is being continued to cover MSSA, coag-negative"

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures. He presented with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is now being treated for submandibular infection and septic thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein (IJ) associated with a ventricular-atrial shunt that runs through the IJ. The patient has significant right jaw swelling and an adjacent submandibular space infection, which is improving with antibiotics. Blood cultures have been positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has multiple infections, including submandibular infection, septic thrombophlebitis of the right IJ, UTI, and possible hardware infection of the ventricular-atrial shunt.
2. Septic Shock: The patient was previously in septic shock, but now off pressors for over 24 hours. There is a concern for recurrence due to ongoing bacteremia and potential source of infection.
3. Hydrocephalus: The patient has known hydrocephalus and a shunt that was last imaged on [7-24] showing a non-working shunt. In the setting of new bacteremia and foreign body, there is concern for hardware infection.

   32 y/o M with hx of traumatic brain injury, paraplegia, and seizures
   presents admitted with UTI now here with submandibular infection and
   septic thrombophelbitis of the Right IJ associated with
   Ventricular-Atrial shunt that runs through the IJ with high grade staph
   aureaus bacteremia.
   .
   Septic thrombophlebitis/ Submandibular infection.  Patient has
   significiant right jaw swelling with R IJ thrombophlebitis and an
   adjacent submandibular space infection.  Patient has worsening of jaw
   swelling over the course of 36 hours.  Currently no drainable fluid
   collection and airway currently intact though tongue swelling is
   progressing.  Only positive culture data is high grade staph bacteremia
   of coag neg and positive types.
   - continue zosyn for MSSA coverage and for coverage of oral GNRs and
   anaerobes
   - serial clinical exams
   - [**Doctor Last Name 9897**] wedges to stimulate submandibular gland secretions
   - monitor for signs of airway compromise
   - ID following
   - awaiting removal of V-A shunt which is presumed to be infected given
   staph bacteremia and presence of line at the site of septic
   thrombophlebitis
   - heparin drip for Right IJ thrombus
   - RUE u/s confirms presents of IJ clot. CT neck as above. ECHO showing
   tip of shunt in RA.
   - CT chest.
   - will defer panorex given inability of patient to particapte in the
   studies
   - will discuss with ENT re: direct visualization of the airway if
   worsening clinical exam
   .
   Septic shock.  Source of infection is likely infected V-A shunt in
   Right IJ and adjacent submandibular infection.  Now with staph aureus
   bacteremia.  Also has proteus UTI.
   - zosyn to cover MSSA, coag neg staph, and oral anaerobes and GNS
   - IVF boluses to wean pressors
   - continue levophed
   - will discuss with neurosurg/vasc  re: removal of V-A shunt given
   worsening of clnical status
   .
   UTI - has pan-[**Last Name (un) **] proteus UTI, which is likely a separate process from
   the staph aureus bacteremia
   - continue Zosyn though repeat culture is negative
   .
   Hydrocephalus - has known hydrocephalus and a shunt that was last
   imaged in [**7-24**] that showed a non-working shunt; in setting of new
   bacteremia and foreign body, there is concern for hardware infection.
   - discuss with neurosurg re: removal of hardware
   .
   Seizures - stable, last seizure one year ago
   - continue keppra at home dose
   .
   Contractures - stable, moves upper extremities, need to keep L arm
   restrained because patient likes to bite on it.
   - continue baclofen as has case reports of withdrawl from it
   - hold if hypotensive

","The patient is a 32-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), ventriculoperitoneal (VP) and ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt, presenting with septic thrombophlebitis of the right internal jugular vein (RIJ) and polymicrobial bacteremia. He has been improving without surgical intervention and is now on medical management.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/79 mmHg to 100/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in sinus tachycardia.

The patient's flow sheet data shows an intake of 5,808 mL of fluids, with an output of 3,920 mL through the urine. The NG tube output is 39 mL. The patient has received a total of 5,769 mL of IV fluids and 997 mL of blood products. The patient's balance shows a deficit of 680 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 10.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, platelet count of 358 K/uL, blood glucose level of 102 mg/dL, sodium level of 141 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L, creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, and total bilirubin level of 28.0%. The PT/PTT/INR values are within normal limits, as well as the liver enzymes and other electrolyte levels.

Imaging and microbiology results are pending. The patient's current assessment and plan include continuing antibiotic therapy, including vancomycin, awaiting sensitivity results for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. No surgical intervention is planned due to the patient's improvement on medical management. The patient will continue on lovenox indefinitely, with a possible transition to coumadin if reliable oral access is obtained.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis due to polymicrobial bacteremia. Continued monitoring for signs of sepsis and prompt management is essential.

2. Thrombophlebitis: The patient has septic thrombophlebitis of the RIJ. Close monitoring for signs of infection or thrombosis in the affected vein is necessary.

3. Organ dysfunction: The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and lactic acid. Regular monitoring of organ function and prompt management of any abnormalities is required.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to prevent the development of DVT"
