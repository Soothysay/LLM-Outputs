","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with dwarfism who was admitted to the ICU for lower extremity cellulitis, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient has a history of chronic lymphedema in the lower extremities, recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis, and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to an inciting cause such as pulmonary embolism, pulmonary edema, or intracranial events. Close monitoring of ABG, SBT, and RSBI is recommended, and consideration should be given to the administration of lasix if there is concern for pulmonary edema.
2. Bilateral lower extremity cellulitis: The presence of cellulitis in the lower extremities may indicate a worsening of the patient's chronic lymphedema. It is important to continue with vancomycin therapy and consider elevating the legs.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be monitored closely. The current outpatient regimen of metoprolol and terazosin should be continued.
4. Stage II sacral decubitus: The patient has a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer that requires wound care and consideration for wound consultation for debridement or other treatments.
5. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's volume status is unclear, so close monitoring and repletion of electrolytes"

The patient is a 49-year-old male with dwarfism, chronic lower extremity lymphedema, and recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis. He presented with tachycardia, dyspnea, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which required intubation. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and has been receiving midazolam (Versed) infusion. 

On the current day, the patient experienced a spike in temperature to 101.7 degrees Celsius. Vital signs show a heart rate within normal limits, blood pressure is elevated, respiratory rate is controlled on the ventilator, and oxygen saturation is maintained at 97%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals intubation, sedation, non-responsive to voice but responds to noxious stimuli, pupils small and reactive to light, oxygen and enteral tubes in place, clear lung sounds anteriorly, regular heart rhythm, no bowel sounds, obese abdomen, chronic skin thickening on both lower extremities, and lymphedematous arms and legs. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated potassium levels. Imaging studies show no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect, but there is dilation of the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with dwarfism, chronic lower extremity lymphedema, and recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis. He presented with respiratory distress, altered mental status, and an unclear inciting cause for respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary embolism, pulmonary edema, intracranial event, pneumonia, and chronic hypercarbia. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His dyspnea and sinus tachycardia may be related to a pulmonary embolus, pulmonary edema, or pneumonia. He also has bilateral lower extremity cellulitis, hypertension, and a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. To reduce this risk, the healthcare team should maintain a semi-upright head-of-bed position, perform daily sedation assessments, monitor for changes in sputum color or odor, and perform regular bronchoscopic evaluation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE): Due to the patient's chronic lower extremity lymphedema and recent cellulitis, there is an increased risk of DVT/PE. The patient is receiving subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis to reduce this risk.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient has a stage II sac"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 901**] is a 49 yo M with achondroplasia, chronic LE lymphedema
   with recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis c/b tachycardia,
   dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Altered Mental Status - unclear
   inciting cause for respiratory failure in the ED which prompted
   intubation, ddx includes pulmonary embolism although prelim read from
   CTA with no evidence of large PE.  Likely has a component of chronic
   hypercarbia +/- acute hypercarbia as well given CO2 of 90 on
   admission.  Other considerations include pneumonia, UTI, pulmonary
   edema, intracranial event such as CVA or hemorrhage although not seen
   on CT scan.   Pneumonia more likely given infiltrate on CT scan.
   - mental status improved; when sedation is decreased pt responds to his
   name and follows basic commands.
   -continue with mechanical ventilation
   -check ABG
   -in face of PEEP of 10 and high FiO2 requirements not likely to
   extubate today.
   -consider lasix after ECHO if concern for pulmonary edema
   .
   #dyspnea, sinus tachycardia- unclear etiology, main concern at OSH was
   for pulmonary embolus, less likely in face of negative CTA [**2133-8-10**],
   other possibilities include pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
   - continue levoquin
   -hold off on additional abx for now, consider adding cefepime for
   additional GN coverage such as cefepime if continues to spike fevers or
   elevated WBC
   -ECHO today to further evaluate cardiac function
   -consider lasix pending echocardiogram
   .
   #Bilateral LE cellulitis -  appears to be chronic stasis in setting of
   lymphedema.  No WBC or fever at OSH, unclear if appearance has changed
   since IV abx.
   -continue vancomycin for now, will increase dose given low trough
   - vanc trough pending
   .
   #Hypertension
 blood pressure has increased this AM; if pt continues
   to maintain BP and UOP consider starting home dose of metoprolol and
   terazosin
   .
   #Stage II Sacral Decubitus - noted at osh, not apparent on exam here
   -wound care consult not necessary at this time
   # FEN
   -          Request nutrition consult
   -           Can start tube feeds.  Hold tube feeds prior to any attempt
   to extubate.

The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia, chronic lower extremity lymphedema, and recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis. He presented with respiratory distress and altered mental status, which required intubation. The patient has been experiencing fevers and has been on antibiotics, including levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 163/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse coarse breath sounds, obesity, distended abdomen, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, with normal kidney function. The patient's assessment includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, altered mental status, dyspnea, sinus tachycardia, bilateral lower extremity cellulitis, hypertension, and stage II sacral decubitus ulcer. The plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation, checking ABG, considering lasix after an echo for concern of pulmonary edema, holding off on additional antibiotics for now, and evaluating cardiac function with an echo.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 901**] is a 49 yo M with achondroplasia, chronic LE lymphedema
   with recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis c/b tachycardia,
   dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Altered Mental Status - unclear
   inciting cause for respiratory failure in the ED which prompted
   intubation, ddx includes pulmonary embolism although prelim read from
   CTA with no evidence of large PE.  Likely has a component of chronic
   hypercarbia +/- acute hypercarbia as well given CO2 of 90 on
   admission.  Other considerations include pneumonia, UTI, pulmonary
   edema, intracranial event such as CVA or hemorrhage although not seen
   on CT scan.   Pneumonia more likely given infiltrate on CT scan.
   - mental status improved; when sedation is decreased pt responds to his
   name and follows basic commands.
   -continue with mechanical ventilation
   -check ABG
   -in face of PEEP of 10 and high FiO2 requirements not likely to
   extubate today.
   -consider lasix after ECHO if concern for pulmonary edema
   #dyspnea, sinus tachycardia- unclear etiology, main concern at OSH was
   for pulmonary embolus, less likely in face of negative CTA [**2133-8-10**],
   other possibilities include pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
   - continue levoquin
   -hold off on additional abx for now, consider adding cefepime for
   additional GN coverage such as cefepime if continues to spike fevers or
   elevated WBC
   -ECHO today to further evaluate cardiac function
   -consider lasix pending echocardiogram
   .
   #Bilateral LE cellulitis -  appears to be chronic stasis in setting of
   lymphedema.  No WBC or fever at OSH, unclear if appearance has changed
   since IV abx.
   -continue vancomycin for now, will increase dose given low trough
   - vanc trough pending
   .
   #Hypertension
 blood pressure has increased this AM; if pt continues
   to maintain BP and UOP consider starting home dose of metoprolol and
   terazosin
   .
   #Stage II Sacral Decubitus - noted at osh, not apparent on exam here
   -wound care consult not necessary at this time

   -          Request nutrition consult

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia, chronic LE lymphedema, and recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis. He presented with tachycardia, dyspnea, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure/altered mental status, dyspnea/sinus tachycardia, bilateral LE cellulitis, hypertension, and stage II sacral decubitus. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's history of dyspnea and tachycardia, there is a concern for a pulmonary embolism. This can be further complicated by the use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of diffuse parenchymal opacities on the chest X-ray and potential hypercarbia may indicate pneumonia. This could lead to worsening respiratory failure.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's right ventricular cavity enlargement and borderline normal free wall systolic function seen on the trans-thoracic echo suggest the possibility of pulmonary edema. Administration of Lasix might be considered if pulmonary edema is confirmed.
4. UTI: The patient's symptoms and the presence of fever could also indicate a urinary tract infection. This should be considered, especially if the patient continues to spike fevers or has an elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 901**] is a 49 yo M with achondroplasia, chronic LE lymphedema
   with recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis c/b tachycardia,
   dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure/Altered Mental Status - unclear
   inciting cause for respiratory failure in the ED which prompted
   intubation, ddx includes pulmonary embolism although prelim read from
   CTA with no evidence of large PE.  Likely has a component of chronic
   hypercarbia +/- acute hypercarbia as well given CO2 of 90 on
   admission.  Other considerations include pneumonia, UTI, pulmonary
   edema, intracranial event such as CVA or hemorrhage although not seen
   on CT scan.   Pneumonia more likely given infiltrate on CT scan.
   - mental status improved; when sedation is decreased pt responds to his
   name and follows basic commands.
   -continue with mechanical ventilation
   -check ABG
   -in face of PEEP of 10 and high FiO2 requirements not likely to
   extubate today.
   -consider lasix after ECHO if concern for pulmonary edema
   #dyspnea, sinus tachycardia- unclear etiology, main concern at OSH was
   for pulmonary embolus, less likely in face of negative CTA [**2133-8-10**],
   other possibilities include pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
   - continue levoquin
   -hold off on additional abx for now, consider adding cefepime for
   additional GN coverage such as cefepime if continues to spike fevers or
   elevated WBC
   -ECHO today to further evaluate cardiac function
   -consider lasix pending echocardiogram
   .
   #Bilateral LE cellulitis -  appears to be chronic stasis in setting of
   lymphedema.  No WBC or fever at OSH, unclear if appearance has changed
   since IV abx.
   -continue vancomycin for now, will increase dose given low trough
   - vanc trough pending
   .
   #Hypertension
 blood pressure has increased this AM; if pt continues
   to maintain BP and UOP consider starting home dose of metoprolol and
   terazosin
   .
   #Stage II Sacral Decubitus - noted at osh, not apparent on exam here
   -wound care consult not necessary at this time
   # FEN
   -          Request nutrition consult
   -           Can start tube feeds.  Hold tube feeds prior to any attempt

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia, chronic left lower extremity lymphedema, and recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis.
- He presented with tachycardia, dyspnea, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring intubation.
- The patient has improved mental status when sedation is decreased, responding to his name and following basic commands.
- Mechanical ventilation is continued, and an ABG will be checked.
- The patient is unlikely to be extubated today, and consideration is given to Lasix after an echocardiogram if there is concern for pulmonary edema.
- The etiology of the patient's dyspnea and sinus tachycardia remains unclear, with less likelihood of pulmonary embolism due to a negative CT angiography.
- Levofloxacin is continued, and additional antibiotic coverage such as cefepime may be considered if fever or elevated white blood cell count persists.
- An echocardiogram will be performed today to further evaluate cardiac function, and Lasix may be considered pending the results.
- The patient has bilateral lower extremity cellulitis, likely chronic in nature due to lymphedema.
- Vancomycin will be continued, and its trough level will be monitored.
- The patient's blood pressure has increased, and if maintained, home doses of metoprolol and terazosin may be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 901**] is a 49 yo M with achondroplasia, chronic LE lymphedema
   with recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis c/b tachycardia,
   dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - unclear inciting cause for
   respiratory failure in the ED which prompted intubation. Likely has a
   component of chronic hypercarbia +/- acute hypercarbia as well given
   CO2 of 90 on admission.  DDx include pneumonia, pulmonary edema,
   intracranial event such as CVA or hemorrhage although not seen on CT
   scan.   Pneumonia more likely given infiltrate on CT scan.
   - mental status improved
   - Pt currently on PSV with MMV; pt  has high RR and low tidal volumes;
   is requiring frequent suctioning for sputum production; RSBI of 152
   this am.  Pt not likely to be extubated today.

   opacification at the L base, consistent with pleural fluid and
   underlying atelectasis.  Supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded.
   - continue lasix (20mg IV prn) to maintain slight negative fluids and
   attempt to reduce effusion
   - continue levaquin

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia and chronic lower extremity lymphedema. He was admitted for lower extremity cellulitis and experienced respiratory distress leading to intubation. The patient's initial presentation included tachycardia, dyspnea, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is uncertainty regarding the exact cause of the respiratory failure, but potential differential diagnoses include pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and intracranial events such as a stroke or hemorrhage. However, pneumonia seems more likely given the presence of an infiltrate on the CT scan.

The patient's mental status has improved, and he is now able to communicate using a letter board. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/69 mmHg to 148/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 262 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient has extensive lymphedema of the lower extremities, as well as opacification at the left base on a chest X-ray, consistent with pleural fluid and underlying atelect"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia, chronic left lower extremity lymphedema, and recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis. He presented with tachycardia, dyspnea, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, leading to intubation. The patient's mental status has improved, and he is responding well to commands. He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with mandatory minute volume (MMV) and is expected to undergo extubation later today. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/69 mmHg to 148/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's lungs are clear on auscultation, and his chest X-ray shows mild bilateral diffuse parenchymal opacities that could be attributable to mild overhydration. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range, but he has elevated lactic acid levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are mostly within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level. The patient has a history of hypertension and bilateral lower extremity cellulitis, for which he is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy. The patient's nutritional needs should be addressed, and a nutrition consult is requested.

   respiratory failure in the ED which prompted intubation. Likely has a
   component of chronic hypercarbia +/- acute hypercarbia as well given
   CO2 of 90 on admission.  DDx include pneumonia, pulmonary edema,
   intracranial event such as CVA or hemorrhage although not seen on CT
   scan.   Pneumonia more likely given infiltrate on CT scan.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia, chronic lower extremity lymphedema, and recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis. He presented with respiratory distress and was intubated in the emergency department. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving multiple antibiotics. His vital signs show a fever, increased heart rate, and slightly elevated blood pressure. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 262 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's ABG results are pending, and his SpO2 is 96%. His lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and normal kidney and liver function. The patient's physical examination findings are mostly not assessed due to being intubated. The patient's current medical issues include hypercarbic respiratory failure, altered mental status, bilateral lower extremity cellulitis, hypertension, and feeding intolerance. The assessment plan includes weaning off mechanical ventilation, managing the patient's cellulitis and hypertension, and addressing the feeding intolerance. Potential medical complications that can arise include pneumonia, pulmonary edema, intracranial events such as cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or hemorrhage, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia, chronic lower extremity lymphedema, and recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis. He presented with tachycardia, dyspnea, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, leading to intubation. His mental status has improved, and he is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with mandatory minute volume (MMV). The plan is to attempt to decrease PEEP and FiO2 today and check ABG and RSBI. If he does well, extubation may be considered later today. Lasix will be continued to maintain slight negative fluids, and levoquin will also be continued. Additional antibiotics may be considered if there are persistent fevers or elevated WBC count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged time on mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and daily assessment of sputum culture, chest X-ray, and ABG analysis will be important.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as early ambulation and subcutaneous heparin administration should be implemented.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness increase the risk of stress ulcers. Gastric prophylaxis with hist"

His vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/69 to 148/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals mild respiratory distress that improved with suction, diaphoretic, and warm, dry extremities with 2+ distal pulses. His laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18,400/mm3, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, as well as elevated lactate and liver enzymes. The patient's chest X-ray shows mild bilateral diffuse parenchymal opacities, which could be due to mild overhydration. An echocardiogram indicates mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with borderline normal free wall systolic function. The patient's urine culture is negative, and blood cultures are pending. The patient's past medical history includes hypertension"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia and chronic lower extremity lymphedema. He was admitted for lower extremity cellulitis and developed tachycardia, dyspnea, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient's mental status improved, but he remains on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with mandatory minute volume (MMV), requiring frequent suctioning for sputum production. He has a high respiratory rate and low tidal volumes, and his rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is 152 this morning. The patient is not likely to be extubated today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has extensive opacification at the left base on the chest X-ray, consistent with pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis. This suggests the possibility of pneumonia, which is further supported by the presence of fever and leukocytosis.

2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of chronic hypercarbia, and his initial CO2 level on admission was 90. He also has a high RSBI, indicating that his respiratory system is unable to adequately ventilate him.

3. Bilateral lower extremity cellulitis: The patient has a history of chronic stasis in the setting of lymphedema, leading to cellulitis. Although the condition has improved with antibiotic treatment, there is a risk of recurrence or worsening if appropriate measures are"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia and chronic LE lymphedema.
- He was admitted for lower extremity cellulitis and developed tachycardia, dyspnea, and hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
- The cause of respiratory failure is unclear, but it may be due to chronic hypercarbia, acute hypercarbia, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or an intracranial event such as a CVA or hemorrhage.
- The patient has shown improvement in mental status, but is still not likely to be extubated today.
- A chest X-ray revealed extensive opacification at the L base, consistent with pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis, which could indicate pneumonia.
- The patient's altered mental status has resolved, and he is now communicating with a letter board.
- He has bilateral LE cellulitis, which appears to be chronic stasis in the setting of lymphedema. It has improved with antibiotic treatment.
- The patient's hypertension is stable, and he is being continued on metoprolol, captropril, and possibly an increased dose of captropril if his blood pressure remains elevated.
- He is receiving tube feeds and will have them held after midnight for attempted extubation tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of an infiltrate on the chest X-ray suggests the possibility of pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 901**] is a 49 yo M with achondroplasia, chronic LE lymphedema
   with recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis c/b tachycardia,
   dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - unclear inciting cause for
   respiratory failure in the ED which prompted intubation. Likely has a
   component of chronic hypercarbia +/- acute hypercarbia as well given
   CO2 of 90 on admission.  DDx include pneumonia, pulmonary edema,
   intracranial event such as CVA or hemorrhage although not seen on CT
   scan.   Pneumonia more likely given infiltrate on CT scan.
   - mental status improved:  more sedated today due to switch back to
   volume control ventilation mode
   - On pressure support ventilation pt has high RR and low tidal volumes;
   Is currently on Volume control ventilation. Is still requiring frequent
   suctioning for sputum production; RSBI not attempted this am due to low
   SpO2.  Pt not likely to be extubated today.
   - CXR [**2133-8-14**]: in comparison with the study of [**8-11**] there is extensive
   opacification at the L base, consistent with pleural fluid and
   underlying atelectasis.  Supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded.
   - continue lasix (20mg IV prn) to maintain slight negative fluids and
   attempt to reduce effusion
   - continue levaquin, flagyl, vanc; consider  extending coverage.
   Discuss with wife the extent of patient
s [**Name (NI) 911**] allergy to determine
   additional abx.
   # Altered Mental Status:  resolved.  Pt communicating with letter
   board.
   -- unclear etiology; may be secondary to infection or hypercarbic
   respiratory failure
   -- continue levaquin
   #Bilateral LE cellulitis -  appears to be chronic stasis in setting of
   lymphedema.  No WBC or fever at OSH.  Wife brought in photos of pts
   cellulitis from last week.  Markedly improved on abx treatment. Pt has
   #Vesicular lesions on L hand:  continue to monitor. Likely tape
   allergy.  If continues to progress consider getting a viral culture.
   -continue vancomycin for now
   - vanco level [**2133-8-12**]: 14.6

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 901**] is a 49 yo M with achondroplasia, chronic LE lymphedema
   with recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis c/b tachycardia,
   dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - unclear inciting cause for
   respiratory failure in the ED which prompted intubation. Likely has a
   component of chronic hypercarbia +/- acute hypercarbia as well given
   CO2 of 90 on admission.  DDx include pneumonia, pulmonary edema,
   intracranial event such as CVA or hemorrhage although not seen on CT
   scan.   Pneumonia more likely given infiltrate on CT scan.
   - mental status improved
   - Pt currently on PSV with MMV; pt  has high RR and low tidal volumes;
   is requiring frequent suctioning for sputum production; RSBI of 152
   this am.  Pt not likely to be extubated today.
   - CXR [**2133-8-14**]: in comparison with the study of [**8-11**] there is extensive
   opacification at the L base, consistent with pleural fluid and
   underlying atelectasis.  Supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded.
   - continue lasix (20mg IV prn) to maintain slight negative fluids and
   attempt to reduce effusion
   - continue levaquin
   -hold off on additional abx for now, consider adding cefepime for
   additional GN coverage if continues to spike fevers or has elevated WBC
   # Altered Mental Status:  resolved.  Pt communicating with letter
   board.
   -- unclear etiology; may be secondary to infection or hypercarbic
   respiratory failure
   -- continue levaquin
   #Bilateral LE cellulitis -  appears to be chronic stasis in setting of
   lymphedema.  No WBC or fever at OSH.  Wife brought in photos of pts
   cellulitis from last week.  Markedly improved on abx treatment.
   -continue vancomycin for now
   - vanco level [**2133-8-12**]: 17.1
   - change to [**Doctor First Name **]-air mattress
   #Hypertension
 stable;
   continue metoprolol; continue captropril and consider increasing dose
   this afternoon if bp remains elevated.  (home meds: metoprolol and
   terazosin)
   # FEN
   - Continue tube feeds.  Hold after midnight for attempted extubation
   tomorrow.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia and chronic lower extremity lymphedema.
- He has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and is currently intubated.
- The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is on mechanical ventilation.
- He presented with hypercarbic respiratory distress, fever, and altered mental status.
- The patient's condition has improved since admission, with resolution of the altered mental status.
- His respiratory support has been adjusted to pressure-controlled ventilation with mandatory minute volume (PCV/PSV with MMV).
- The patient's sputum production requires frequent suctioning, and his respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 152.
- There is extensive opacification at the left base on chest X-ray, consistent with pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis. Supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded.
- The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and borderline normal kidney function.
- He is receiving multiple antibiotics, including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole.
- The patient has a history of bilateral lower extremity cellulitis, which has improved with antibiotic treatment.
- He also has a history of hypertension and is being treated with metoprolol and captropril.
- The patient is on tube feeds and will have them held after midnight for attempted extubation tomorrow."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia and chronic lower extremity lymphedema. He has been admitted to the ICU with suspected pneumonia versus pulmonary edema, and there is an unclear precipitant. The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely due to acute on chronic hypercarbia. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 116/55 to 164/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received multiple medications including midazolam, furosemide, heparin sodium, fentanyl, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. 

The physical examination reveals that the patient is awake and alert, with regular respirations and normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. The lungs show ventilated breath sounds with diminished sounds at the bases. The abdomen is soft with no tenderness or guarding. The extremities are warm, dry, and there are chronic changes consistent with lower extremity lymphedema.

The lab results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL, sodium level of 114 mg/dL, potassium level of 4."

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo M with achondroplasia, chronic LE lymphedema with recent
   admission for lower extremity cellulitis c/b tachycardia, dyspnea and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation.
   .
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure - unclear inciting cause for
   respiratory failure in the ED which prompted intubation. Likely has a
   component of chronic hypercarbia +/- acute hypercarbia as well given
   CO2 of 90 on admission.  DDx include pneumonia, pulmonary edema,
   intracranial event such as CVA or hemorrhage although not seen on CT
   scan.   Pneumonia more likely given infiltrate on CT scan.
   - mental status improved:  more sedated today due to switch back to
   volume control ventilation mode
   - On pressure support ventilation pt has high RR and low tidal volumes;
   Is currently on Volume control ventilation. Is still requiring frequent
   suctioning for sputum production; RSBI not attempted this am due to low
   SpO2.  Pt not likely to be extubated today.
   - CXR [**2133-8-14**]: in comparison with the study of [**8-11**] there is extensive
   opacification at the L base, consistent with pleural fluid and
   underlying atelectasis.  Supervening pneumonia cannot be excluded.
   - continue lasix (20mg IV prn) to maintain slight negative fluids and
   attempt to reduce effusion
   - continue levaquin, flagyl, vanc; consider  extending coverage.
   Discuss with wife the extent of patient
s [**Name (NI) 911**] allergy to determine
   additional abx.
   # Altered Mental Status:  resolved.  Pt communicating with letter
   board.
   -- unclear etiology; may be secondary to infection or hypercarbic
   respiratory failure
   -- continue levaquin
   #Bilateral LE cellulitis -  appears to be chronic stasis in setting of
   lymphedema.  No WBC or fever at OSH.  Wife brought in photos of pts
   cellulitis from last week.  Markedly improved on abx treatment. Pt has
   #Vesicular lesions on L hand:  continue to monitor. Likely tape
   allergy.  If continues to progress consider getting a viral culture.
   -continue vancomycin for now
   - vanco level [**2133-8-12**]: 14.6
   - on [**Doctor First Name **]-air mattress

 stable;
   continue metoprolol; continue captropril and consider increasing dose
   this afternoon if bp remains elevated.  Restarted low dose of home

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia, chronic left lower extremity lymphedema, and recent admission for lower extremity cellulitis. He presented with tachycardia, dyspnea, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which required intubation. The patient has been on various medications including lasix, levaquin, flagyl, vanc, and metoprolol. His vital signs are stable, and he has shown improvement in his mental status and communication. However, he still requires frequent suctioning for sputum production. There are potential medical complications such as hypercarbic respiratory failure, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and an altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation included dyspnea and hypercarbic respiratory failure, indicating impaired gas exchange and carbon dioxide retention.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of an infiltrate on the CT scan suggests possible pneumonia, which could worsen the respiratory condition and increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Pulmonary edema: The extensive opacification at the left base on the chest X-ray may indicate pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis, which can be associated with pulmonary edema.
4. Altered mental status: Although the patient's mental status has improved, it is still unclear whether this is secondary to infection or hypercarbic respiratory failure. Continued monitoring"

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia, chronic left lower extremity lymphedema, and a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation due to suspected pneumonia versus pulmonary edema. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 116/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient has been receiving various medications including midazolam, furosemide, heparin, fentanyl, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. The cultures from the ear drainage showed yellow-green pus, and the wound culture results are pending.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is awake, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. His cardiovascular system is normal with regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, and no signs of congestive heart failure. His lungs are ventilated with diminished breath sounds at the bases. His abdomen is soft and non-tender without guarding or rebound. His extremities are warm, dry, and well-perfused with chronic changes consistent with left lower extremity lymphedema.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal limits, slightly elevated hematocrit, and platelet count within normal limits. His electroly"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's progress note:

Chief Complaint: Hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly otitis externa
- The patient has been experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which means there is an accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood.
- The cause of the respiratory failure is unclear, with possible contributing factors such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
- The patient also has chronic lower extremity lymphedema, which can be associated with hypercarbic respiratory failure.

24-Hour Events:
- No significant events occurred overnight.
- The patient had a temperature of 100.9°F overnight.

Medications:
- The patient has allergies to penicillins and experienced anaphylaxis in the past.
- The patient received various antibiotics, including levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin, but it is not clear if these were related to the current condition.

Infusions:
- The patient is receiving midazolam (Versed) at a rate of 4 mg/hour.
- The patient is also receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Other ICU medications:
- Fentanyl: The patient is receiving fentanyl for pain management.
- Furosemide (Lasix): The patient is receiving Lasix for respiratory support.

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia, presenting with chronic lower extremity lymphedema and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and anaphylaxis, and he was previously treated with antibiotics for respiratory pathogens. The patient's current medications include midazolam, heparin sodium, fentanyl, furosemide, and vancomycin.

On physical examination, the patient has a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/68 to 156/126 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on ventilator support. The patient has blisters on his left hand, which are healing well, as well as thinning, thickening, and hyperpigmentation of the lower extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values, including kidney function tests and electrolytes, are mostly within normal limits, except for slightly elevated potassium levels.

The patient's vital signs and fluid balance have been monitored closely, with a total fluid intake of 2,615 mL and output of 3,085 mL since midnight. The patient's urine output has been within an acceptable range.

The patient's condition is complicated by hypercar"

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia, presenting with chronic left lower extremity lymphedema and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The exact precipitant of the hypercarbic respiratory failure is unclear. The patient is suspected to have pneumonia versus pulmonary edema, in addition to a likely component of acute-on-chronic hypercarbia. He becomes hypoxic and tachypneic with low tidal volume when fatigued on pressure support ventilation (PSV), with poor respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). The patient still has substantial secretions.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/68 to 156/126 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received several medications including midazolam, heparin, fentanyl, furosemide, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. He has also been suctioned per rectum and has had a tracheostomy tube placed.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated potassium levels, and normal creatinine, glucose, and liver function tests. The differential white blood cell count shows a predominance of neutrophils.

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo male admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and now with
   continued antibiotic support and full support with volume cycled
   ventilation..
   1)Respiratory Failure-he had significant hypercarbia and now has
   continued issues of
   A)High volume secretions
these have improved
   B)Volume overload
will move to diureis today.
   C)He has a resistance of 7 cmH2O/liter/Sec which would suggest minimal
   airways resistance despite low lung volumes.
   D)Chest wall restriction
this is multifactorial
will work with diuresis
   and continued bowel regimen as primary goal.
   Will need to maintain high vigilance for recurrent or significant
   infection.  Will have to trend fever curve as possible.
   Will need ETT tube positioned adequately.
   2)Pneumonia-
   Vanco/Levo/Flagyl
   10 day course suggested
but may move to 7 days given higher serum EOS
   and low grade fevers with rash.  Will depend on clinical status over
   next days.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. He continues to require full support with volume-cycled ventilation and antibiotic therapy. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, pneumonia, and potential complications such as volume overload, high airways resistance, and chest wall restriction. The ETT tube position needs to be confirmed, and there is a need for glycemic control, stress ulcer prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis prevention, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention. The patient's medical history, allergies, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for fever and crackles in the respiratory system. The patient's vital signs indicate a slightly elevated temperature, normal blood pressure, and heart rate within normal limits. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 2,649 mL total in, 1,323 mL PO, 1,141 mL IVF, and 3,085 mL total out with a negative balance of -436 mL. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose, and electrolytes. However, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) is elevated at 37 mmHg. Imaging reveals a very poor quality CXR, suggesting the need for confirmation of ETT placement. The patient's assessment includes ongoing respiratory failure with issues related to high volume secretions, volume overload, minimal airways resistance,"

He has been on mechanical ventilation support with pressure control mode, set tidal volume (Vt) at 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 15 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. His oxygen saturation (SpO2) is currently at 95%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate (HR) between 96-99 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 130/61 to 171/114 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 95%. The patient has been NPO since midnight for possible extubation today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's chronic lower extremity lymphedema is associated with hypercarbic respiratory failure. It is unclear what precipitated this episode. The patient requires continued full support with mechanical ventilation, fentanyl boluses for comfort, and continued antibiotics for respiratory pathogens. Suctioning will be provided as needed, and IV lasix will be continued for diuresis to improve respiratory status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia and chronic lower extremity lymphedema, presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure of unclear precipitant. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation support with pressure control mode, with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 15 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's blood gases show a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to Sao2 < 90%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate (HR) between 61-99 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 130/61 mmHg to 171/114 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) between 14-24 inspiratory minutes, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 95%. The patient has received various medications including lansoprazole, heparin sodium, furosemide, and fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure associated with hypercarbia, which can lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood."

   24 Hour Events:
   NPO past midnight for possible extubation today.
   Patient's ET tube was repositioned and appears to be correctly
   positioned.
   Had a pressure support trial this morning and the patient did fairly
   well on PSV of 5/0.  He had rr 20-30s.  His RSBI was greater than 105.
   He denied feeling dyspneic.  It was thought that perhaps some of
   difficulty of extubating him was due to altered mechanics due to body
   habitus.  We tested for a cuff leak and he did not have airflow around
   his ET tube.  The decision was made to treat with steroids for 24 hrs
   and re-eval tomorrow.
   Subjective:  Ear pain is improved.  Patient seems frustrated with being
   on the vent and does not like having the OG tube in place.

The patient has been NPO since midnight for possible extubation, but it was decided to continue ventilatory support due to altered mechanics related to body habitus. A pressure support trial was conducted with positive results, and the patient's respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) was greater than 105. The patient denied feeling dyspneic, but a cuff leak was not observed. Steroids were initiated for 24 hours, and the decision to extubate will be re-evaluated tomorrow.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and experienced anaphylaxis. He received antibiotics including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole within the last 24 hours. Other medications administered include lansoprazole, heparin sodium, furosemide, and fentanyl.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/61 mmHg to 171/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has a height of 52 inches with a total fluid input of 2,152 mL"

   49 yo M with achondroplasia, chronic LE lymphedema a/w hypercarbic
   respiratory failure with an unclear precipitant
   24 Hour Events:
   NPO past midnight for possible extubation today.
   Patient's ET tube was repositioned and appears to be correctly
   positioned.
   Had a pressure support trial this morning and the patient did fairly
   well on PSV of [**11-8**].  He had rr 20-30s.  His RSBI was 36.  He denied
   feeling dyspneic.  It was thought that perhaps some of difficulty of
   extubating him was due to altered mechanics due to body habitus.  We
   tested for a cuff leak and he did not have airflow around his ET tube.
   The decision was made to treat with steroids for 24 hrs and re-eval
   tomorrow.
   Subjective:  Ear pain is improved.  Patient seems frustrated with being
   on the vent and does not like having the OG tube in place.

   49 yo M with achondroplasia, chronic LE lymphedema a/w hypercarbic
   respiratory failure with an unclear precipitant.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure
 suspect PNA vs. pulm edema, in
   addition to a likely component of acute on chronic hypercarbia; becomes
   hypoxic, tachypneic with low Vt when tires out on PSV, poor RSBI;
   secretions are improving
   -cont. full support
   - fentanyl boluses PRN to maintain comfort
   -cont. vanco/levo/flagyl for resp pathogens, no dramatic respiratory
   improvement on current regimen
   -suction PRN
   -cont. prn diuresis with IV lasix to improve respiratory status
   -Patient did not have cuff leak signifying upper airway edema
 give
   Decadron 10mg IV Q8hr x3 and re-eval for cuff leak.
   # Low grade fevers: persist; etiology unclear; infection vs drug
   reaction
   -          Continue to watch cultures and WBC count
   -          Compare daily cxr
   -          If continues without evidence of infection will consider
   discontinuing antibiotics
   #R otitis externa
 difficult to evaluate TM involvement;
   symptomatically improving; re-examine later today.
   -polymixin-neomycin drops QID
   -consider adding better systemic anti-pseudomonal cov
g if worsens
   -follow clinically
   #HTN
   -lopressor at home dose
   -uptitrate captopril as BP will tolerate

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia, chronic lower extremity lymphedema, and a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated in the ICU and has been experiencing respiratory failure with an unclear precipitant.

The patient's 24-hour events include being NPO past midnight for possible extubation today, repositioning of the ET tube which appears to be correctly positioned, and a pressure support trial this morning. During the pressure support trial, the patient did fairly well on PSV (positive pressure support ventilation) with a respiratory rate of 20-30 breaths per minute, and his RSBI (respiratory system compliance index) was 36. He denied feeling dyspneic. The decision was made to treat with steroids for 24 hours and re-evaluate tomorrow.

The patient's subjective complaints include ear pain, which is improving, and frustration with being on the vent and having an OG tube in place. The patient has allergies to penicillins and had recent doses of antibiotics including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/61 mmHg to 171/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse expiratory wheezes and crackles bilaterally at the bases, and he appears to have less dyspnea while lying on his side. Other findings from the physical examination are described in the note.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 188 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.5 g/dL, sodium level of 112 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, and an elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL. Imaging studies show low lung volumes with no significant change from previous, pattern of interstitial infiltrates, and a CXR taken on 08/18 shows the same findings. Microbiology results are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing full support with fentanyl boluses as needed for comfort, continuing vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl for respiratory pathogens, suctioning as needed, continuing prn diuresis with IV lasix to improve respiratory status, and giving Decadron 10mg IV Q8hr x3 and re-evaluating for cuff leak. Other plans include watching cultures and WBC count, comparing daily CXR, and considering discontinuing antibiotics if there is no evidence of infection."

   49 yo male with hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to chest wall
   restriction and possible pneumonia with concern for volume overload.
   1)  Respiratory Failure-
        -Patient does have some favorable findings of improved mental
   status, some tolerance of PSV support with a RSBI that is reassuring
   earlier this morning, He has had negative fluid balance this morning as
   well.
       -Issue do remain of ongoing secretions, continued restriction of
   the chest wall due to body habitus, variable RSBI and difficult
   intubation.
       -He has had 7 days of intubation.  He has excellent mental status,
   he has Ve requirement of 10 lpm, FIO2 requirement of 0.5,
       -Given his overall stability and improvement in regards to his
   respiratory status and now being faced with some chronic ventilatory
   compromise will favor move to extubation trial with non-invasive mask
   suppport.  Will have to move to extubation with plan for re-intubation
   with difficult airway noted in past.
        -Will trial patient on SBT x 60 minutes, check cuff leak and
   repeat ABG
        -If no cuff leak seen will have to consider upper airway
   obstruction.
        -Will extubate with anesthesia back up if at all possible given
   difficult airway.
   2)Pneumonia-
       -Levofloxacin/Vanco/Flagyl

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to chest wall restriction and possible pneumonia. He has been intubated for 7 days and has shown some improvement in his respiratory status, including better mental status and reduced ventilatory requirements. However, he still faces challenges such as ongoing secretions, chest wall restriction due to body habitus, variable Respiratory System Compliance Index (RSBI), and difficult intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to chest wall restriction and possible pneumonia. Despite some favorable findings, issues remain, including ongoing secretions, continued chest wall restriction, variable RSBI, and difficult intubation. These factors increase the risk of ongoing respiratory compromise and the need for further respiratory support.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is being treated with antibiotics (Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, Flagyl), and secretions are improving. However, the patient still has a risk of developing complications related to the infection, such as worsening lung function or sepsis.
3. Upper Airway Obstruction: Given the patient's difficult airway during intubation, there is a risk of upper airway obstruction during extubation. This could lead to respiratory distress or the need for immediate re-intubation.
4. Ventilatory Compromise: The patient's chronic ventilatory compromise increases the risk of long-term respiratory complications, such"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia, chronic lower extremity lymphedema, and hypercarbic respiratory failure of unclear origin. He experienced an unplanned extubation at 4:00 AM due to violent coughing spasms, but is currently doing well without the ventilator. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, anaphylaxis, and recent antibiotic use including levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin. He is currently on various medications such as fentanyl, lasix, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood and subsequent respiratory distress.
2. Unplanned Extubation: The patient self-extubated at 4:00 AM, which can increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia and other complications.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, indicating possible uncontrolled hypertension, which can lead to cardiovascular complications.
4. Chronic Lower Extremity Lymphedema: The patient's chronic lymphedema increases the risk of infection and cellulitis, particularly in the lower extremities.
5. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and the presence of muscle enzymes (CPK) in the lab results raise concerns for potential r"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia, chronic LE lymphedema, and hypercarbic respiratory failure with an unclear precipitant.
- The patient experienced an unplanned extubation at 04:00 AM, which was likely due to a violent coughing spasm.
- The patient had 500 cc residual after restarting tube feeding and complained of abdominal pain.
- Diuresis with lasix was given twice.
- The patient has allergies to penicillins and had a previous anaphylactic reaction.
- The patient received various medications including fentanyl, lasix, heparin sodium, and others.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/67 mmHg to 161/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's lung volumes appear improved on chest X-ray, but there is increased interstitial opacity in the right lung compared to the left.
- Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose levels, and kidney function.
- The patient's microbiology cultures indicate growth of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium species, but no significant growth in blood, urine, or NG tube cultures.
- Assessment and plan include continued full support"

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo male with history of mental retardation now with evidence of
   chronic ventilatory compromise given chest wall restriction.  He may
   have a component of abdominal restriction secondary to distention, some
   evidence of pulmonary edema and additionally a relative metabolic
   alkalosis given recent diuresis attempted and ""overcompensation"" from a
   renal standpoint for the respiratory acidosis.
   Respiratory Failure
he has continued respiratory acidosis which may
   well be a chronic condition and need to be treated with intermittent
   ventilatory support
this will have to be explored over time.
   -Wean O2 as possible
   -BIPAP PRN if needed for hypoventilation
may be reasonable to trial

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of mental retardation and evidence of chronic ventilatory compromise due to chest wall restriction. He may also have abdominal restriction secondary to distention, pulmonary edema, and relative metabolic alkalosis. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and has continued respiratory acidosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely chronic in nature and may require intermittent ventilatory support.
2. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and the plan is to increase the dosing of Captopril to facilitate afterload reduction.
3. Diuresis: The patient may require PRN diuresis as needed to manage fluid balance.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's nutrition should be evaluated before returning to full oral feeds, and supervised nutrition support may be required.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to being on mechanical ventilation.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT and should receive prophylactic measures such as compression boots and subcutaneous heparin.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional are necessary for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia, chronic lower extremity lymphedema, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The precipitant of respiratory failure is unclear. The patient has undergone multiple interventions, including suctioning, administration of medications, and adjustments to his medical regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory distress: The patient's chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's chronic lower extremity lymphedema puts him at risk for rhabdomyolysis, especially if there is compromised blood flow to the affected areas.
3. Infection: The presence of rotisserie externa indicates a risk for infections, particularly in the ear and potentially spreading to other sites.
4. Hypertension: Despite adjustments to the patient's antihypertensive medication, there is a risk of uncontrolled hypertension.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating a risk of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and chronic lower extremity lymphedema increase his risk for developing DVT.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical condition and immobilization may increase the risk of developing stress ulcers.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old individual who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The cause of the respiratory failure is still unclear but has shown improvement with empiric treatment and optimization of fluid status. The patient maintains good respiratory status post-extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is a condition characterized by high carbon dioxide levels in the blood. Although the patient has improved, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Infection: The patient's history of allergies to penicillins and previous antibiotic usage indicates a potential risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection is necessary.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance data shows an intake-output discrepancy, indicating a possible fluid imbalance. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances and compromised organ function.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings show episodes of low blood pressure. Hypotension can result in inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels, such as potassium and magnesium, are abnormal. Monitoring and correcting these imbalances are crucial.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia, chronic lower extremity lymphedema, and hypercarbic respiratory failure of unclear precipitant. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing respiratory distress. The patient has been extubated but is still receiving supplemental oxygen. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/73 to 150/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's lungs show clear to slightly congested anteriorly on physical examination. His laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, but elevated potassium and creatinine levels. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated creatinine level. Imaging and microbiology results are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged respiratory distress: The patient's chronic lower extremity lymphedema and hypercarbic respiratory failure may lead to prolonged respiratory distress if not properly managed.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for symptoms such as fever, increased sputum production, and worsening oxygenation is essential.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility in"

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo M with achondroplasia, chronic LE lymphedema a/w hypercarbic
   respiratory failure with an unclear precipitant.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory distress
 unclear whether due to PNA vs. pulm
   edema.  S/P 7 day course of vanco/levo/flagyl.  There is a likely
   component of acute on chronic hypercarbia.  Patient was extubated
   yesterday and has been doing well off the vent.
   -monitor resp status, wean off O2 as tolerated.
   -cont. prn diuresis with IV lasix to improve respiratory status
 goal
   to keep patient even to slightly negative.
   #R otitis externa
 difficult to evaluate TM involvement;
   symptomatically improving; re-examine later today.
   -polymixin-neomycin drops QID day [**5-11**]
   -cx due not suggest pseudomonas as etiology.
   -follow clinically
   #HTN
   -lopressor at home dose
   -convert captopril to lisinopril at 40 mg PO daily which represents a
   slight increase from his previous dose.
   # F/E/N
   -advance to regular diet.
   -volume goal: even to negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with achondroplasia and chronic lower extremity lymphedema, who presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure of unclear precipitant. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation but was extubated yesterday and is currently breathing comfortably on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. He denies shortness of breath but reports occasional dry cough and hunger. The patient is tolerating oral intake. 

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and experienced anaphylaxis in the past. He received a course of antibiotics (metronidazole, vancomycin, and flagyl) but the cause of his respiratory failure remains unclear. There may be a component of acute-on-chronic hypercarbia. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/73 mmHg to 150/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient has some fluid balance issues, with a total fluid input of 1,875 mL and output of 1,065 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 810 mL. His lungs show clear to translucent bilateral anteriorly, and he has regular rhythm and rate with normal S1 and S2 sounds. 

Laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocytes, plate"
