   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 96**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 8991**] is 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on
   coumadin s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2
   weeks ago who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial
   effusion and tamponade physiology.  She is now s/p cardiac cath and
   pericardiocentesis, feeling well.
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion - Patient with myocardial bridge and stent 2
   weeks ago complicated with bleeding requiring balloon tamponade.  She
   had large pericardial effusion and signs of tamponade on echo and R
   cardiac cath. The size of the effusion suggests that it has been
   accumulating for the last 2 weeks and is not something acute. Now she
   does not have any pulsus and has a drain in place, draining minimal
   fluid overnight.
   - Follow up daily pulsus for evidence of tamponade
   - Flush drain with 5cc of NS q8 hours; if no drainage for the next 6
   hours (1500), will pull drain
   - Repeat echocardiogram today
   - Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 2.0, CHADS2 score is
   1, may not need coumadin at this time.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
   - F/u Hct at 2pm to make sure stable
   .
   #. Rhythm - Patient with PAFib rate controlled with diltiazem 120 mg
   daily and was anticoagulated at home with 10 mg of coumadin.
   - Continue diltiazem 120 SR daily
   - Continue digoxin as this was her home regimen and it is beneficial
   for her
   - Holding coumadin given bleeding
   - Currently in NSR
   - Continue rate control with diltiazem 120 mg po daily
   .
   Respiratory Wheezing: had excess fluid in cath/intervention.
   - Will give Lasix 20 mg  IV x 1.
   - Continue O2 and wean as tolerated
   #. Pump - No signs of failure.  Some concern for fluid overload with
   new mild wheezing on exam, no complaints of SOB.
   - CXR this am pending
   - Will try ipratropium nebs to see if this helps wheezing.
   - Stop IVF at this time.
   .
   #. CAD - Patient with no CAD and myocardial bridge s/p stent.
   - Plavix 75 mg po daily
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need ASA [**Last Name (LF) 9003**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ask interventional cardiology their
   opinion
   - No need for further therapy
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home dose of pravastatin

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: today
s echocardiogram shows ?
   residual clot in pericardial space with minimal free flowing fluid;
   ventricular function is normal and valves look fine;  I am somewhat
   concerned about the possibility of an effusive constrictive evolution
   of this pericardial problem, and she will need serial echocardiographic
   monitoring post discharge
   Above discussed extensively with patient.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of PAFib, on coumadin, post-percutaneous pacemaker implantation, and recent myocardial bridge with stenting. She presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology. She underwent cardiac catheterization and pericardiocentesis and is now feeling well.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pericardial Effusion: The patient had a large pericardial effusion that required intervention. She has a drain in place, but there is a risk of re-accumulation of fluid. Close monitoring for evidence of tamponade is necessary, and daily echocardiograms should be performed to assess the size of the effusion. If no drainage is observed for six hours, the drain may need to be pulled.

2. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding risk is increased due to her history of PAFib, recent bleeding event, and anticoagulation therapy. If she experiences any signs of bleeding, urgent consultation with a cardiologist and possibly cardiovascular surgery may be required.

3. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has a history of PAFib, which is rate-controlled with diltiazem. Anticoagulation with coumadin was previously administered, but it is currently being held due to recent bleeding. Continuous monitoring on telemetry is necessary to ensure maintenance of normal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of PAFib, recent myocardial bridge, and stent placement who presented with shortness of breath and signs of tamponade physiology due to a large pericardial effusion. She underwent cardiac catheterization and pericardiocentesis and is now stable in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial Effusion - The patient had a large pericardial effusion that required pericardiocentesis. There is a potential for recurrent effusion and tamponade physiology.
2. Bleeding - The patient has a history of bleeding complications, including a recent bleeding event requiring balloon tamponade. There is a risk of further bleeding, especially with the hold on Coumadin.
3. Rhythm Disturbances - The patient has a history of PAFib and is currently on diltiazem for rate control. There is a potential for rhythm disturbances such as atrial arrhythmias.
4. Pump Dysfunction - The patient is showing signs of mild wheezing but no signs of heart failure. However, there is a potential for fluid overload and worsening pump dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 96**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 8991**] is 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on
   coumadin s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2
   weeks ago who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial
   effusion and tamponade physiology.  She is now s/p cardiac cath and
   pericardiocentesis, feeling well.
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion - Patient with myocardial bridge and stent 2
   weeks ago complicated with bleeding requiring balloon tamponade.  She
   had large pericardial effusion and signs of tamponade on echo and R
   cardiac cath. The size of the effusion suggests that it has been
   accumulating for the last 2 weeks and is not something acute. Now she
   does not have any pulsus and has a drain in place, draining minimal
   fluid overnight.
   - Follow up daily pulsus for evidence of tamponade
   - Flush drain with 5cc of NS q8 hours; if no drainage for the next 6
   hours (1500), will pull drain
   - Repeat echocardiogram today
   - Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 2.0, CHADS2 score is
   1, may not need coumadin at this time.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
   - F/u Hct at 2pm to make sure stable
   .
   #. Rhythm - Patient with PAFib rate controlled with diltiazem 120 mg
   daily and was anticoagulated at home with 10 mg of coumadin.
   - Continue diltiazem 120 SR daily
   - Continue digoxin as this was her home regimen and it is beneficial
   for her
   - Holding coumadin given bleeding
   - Currently in NSR
   - Continue rate control with diltiazem 120 mg po daily
   .
   Respiratory Wheezing: had excess fluid in cath/intervention.
   - Will give Lasix 20 mg  IV x 1.
   - Continue O2 and wean as tolerated
   #. Pump - No signs of failure.  Some concern for fluid overload with
   new mild wheezing on exam, no complaints of SOB.
   - CXR this am pending
   - Will try ipratropium nebs to see if this helps wheezing.
   - Stop IVF at this time.
   .
   #. CAD - Patient with no CAD and myocardial bridge s/p stent.
   - Plavix 75 mg po daily
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need ASA [**Last Name (LF) 9003**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ask interventional cardiology their
   opinion
   - No need for further therapy
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home dose of pravastatin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of PAFib, on coumadin, s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding two weeks ago. She presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology. She underwent cardiac catheterization and pericardiocentesis, feeling well afterward.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. Pericardial Effusion: The patient had a large pericardial effusion and signs of tamponade on echo and R cardiac cath. She now has a drain in place, draining minimal fluid overnight. The plan is to follow up daily for evidence of tamponade, flush the drain with 5cc of NS q8 hours, and pull the drain if there is no drainage for the next 6 hours. A repeat echocardiogram is also planned today.

2. Rhythm: The patient's PAFib is rate-controlled with diltiazem 120 mg daily and she was anticoagulated at home with 10 mg of coumadin. The plan is to continue diltiazem 120 SR daily, continue digoxin as part of her home regimen, and hold coumadin due to bleeding. She is currently in NSR and will continue rate control with diltiazem.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of PAFib, on coumadin, who underwent pericardiocentesis for a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology. She is currently feeling well post-procedure, with minimal fluid drainage overnight. The patient has a history of myocardial bridge and stent placement two weeks ago, which was complicated by bleeding requiring balloon tamponade. The size of the effusion suggests it has been accumulating over the past two weeks. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial Effusion: The patient had a large pericardial effusion with signs of tamponade, indicating potential cardiac tamponade. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of tamponade physiology and follow up with serial pulsus exams. The drain should be flushed with normal saline every 8 hours, and a repeat echocardiogram should be done today to assess the progress.
2. Bleeding: Given the patient's bleeding complication in the past, it is crucial to hold the coumadin and closely monitor the INR. If bleeding occurs, urgent CT surgery and possible stent placement may be necessary.
3. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has a history of PAFib, which is currently rate-controlled with diltiazem. Holding coumadin due to bleeding is necessary, and the patient should continue to be monitored on telemetry. Maintaining normal sinus rhythm"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 96**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 8991**] is 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on
   coumadin s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2
   weeks ago who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial
   effusion and tamponade physiology.  She is now s/p cardiac cath and
   pericardiocentesis, feeling well.
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion - She had large pericardial effusion and signs
   of tamponade on echo and R cardiac cath. The size of the effusion
   suggests that it has been accumulating for the last 2 weeks and is not
   something acute. Now she does not have any pulsus and has a drain in
   place, draining minimal fluid overnight. Pulsus stable at 6 this
   morning. Elevated JVP
   - Follow up daily pulsus for evidence of tamponade
   - Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 1.5, CHADS2 score is
   1, may not need coumadin at this time.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
   - HCT stable.
   .
   #. Rhythm
 Sinsus this morning. Patient with PAFib rate controlled
   with diltiazem 120 mg daily. Stopped Coumadin for 6 months. INR this
   morning is 1.5.
   - Continue diltiazem 120 SR daily
   - Continue digoxin as this was her home regimen and it is beneficial
   for her
   - Holding coumadin given bleeding
   .
   Respiratory Wheezing: Improved this morning. Lasix 20mg IV x 2
   yesterday. Pt currently on 3L NC. Chest xray with large left sided
   pleural effusion. Possibly due to overhydration
   -          Continue O2 and wean as tolerated

- The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of PAFib, recent myocardial bridge, and bleeding two weeks ago.
- She presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology.
- She underwent cardiac catheterization and pericardiocentesis, feeling well afterward.
- The patient had a large pericardial effusion that has been accumulating for about two weeks, but it is now draining minimally through a drain.
- Her JVP is elevated, and she has stable pulses without evidence of tamponade.
- She is currently on diltiazem for rate control, digoxin as part of her home regimen, and holding coumadin due to bleeding.
- Her respiratory condition improved this morning, and she is on 3L NC. She has a large left-sided pleural effusion possibly due to overhydration.
- Her left ventricular ejection fraction is preserved, and there is volume overload in the setting of tamponade.
- She has no evidence of CAD, but has a myocardial bridge that was stented.
- She is on Plavix and ASA for CAD management, and pravastatin for dyslipidemia.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, prior percutaneous cardiac catheterization, and placement of a pacemaker. She presented with shortness of breath and was found to have a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and pericardiocentesis, and currently has a drain in place.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), a heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/52-63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 3 liters of supplemental oxygen. Her weight is currently 90.6 kg, which is slightly higher than her admission weight of 84.1 kg.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased air movement at the bases bilaterally, with increased findings on the left side. The patient's heart sounds are normal, with no murmurs, thrills, lifts, or signs of heart failure. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no masses or hepatosplenomegaly. There are no abnormalities noted in her extremities or skin. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.2-10.7 thousand/mL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g"

   Microbiology:
   Pericardial Fluid: No growth to date. Nothing seen on gram stain.
   Imaging/Studies:
   CXR [**2186-8-26**]: Left pectoral pacemaker in situ. Marked cardiomegaly with
   marked homogeneous opacification of the left hemithorax, presumably,
   due to a large pleural effusion. Only the upper half of the lung
   parenchyma is ventilated. The rest of the left lung parenchyma is
   atelectatic. On the right, no evidence of pneumonia or overhydration.
   The most lateral right part of the hemithorax are not included on the
   image.
   ECHO [**2186-8-26**]: Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is normal (LVEF>55%). with normal free wall contractility.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
   Trivial residual pericardial effusion. Large pleural effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 96**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 8991**] is 73 year-old woman with prior history of PAFib on
   coumadin s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding 2
   weeks ago who presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial
   effusion and tamponade physiology.  She is now s/p cardiac cath and
   pericardiocentesis, feeling well.
   .
   #. Pericardial Effusion - She had large pericardial effusion and signs
   of tamponade on echo and R cardiac cath. The size of the effusion
   suggests that it has been accumulating for the last 2 weeks and is not
   something acute. Now she does not have any pulsus and has a drain in
   place, draining minimal fluid overnight. Pulsus stable at 6 this
   morning. Elevated JVP
   - Follow up daily pulsus for evidence of tamponade
   - Hold coumadin at this time, INR trending down at 1.5, CHADS2 score is
   1, may not need coumadin at this time.
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - If bleeds, may need another stent and/or urgent CT surgery
   - HCT stable.
   .
   #. Rhythm
 Sinsus this morning. Patient with PAFib rate controlled
   with diltiazem 120 mg daily. Stopped Coumadin for 6 months. INR this
   morning is 1.5.
   - Continue diltiazem 120 SR daily
   - Continue digoxin as this was her home regimen and it is beneficial
   for her
   - Holding coumadin given bleeding
   .
   Respiratory Wheezing: Improved this morning. Lasix 20mg IV x 2
   yesterday. Pt currently on 3L NC. Chest xray with large left sided
   pleural effusion. Possibly due to overhydration
   -          Continue O2 and wean as tolerated
   -          FU Chest Xray this morning. Plan for lateral and decub CXR
   today
   #. Pump
 EF preserved. Volume overload in the setting of tamponade.
   .
   #. CAD - Patient with no CAD and myocardial bridge s/p stent.
   - Plavix 75 mg po daily
   - ASA 81mg po daily
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home dose of pravastatin

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: She is in and out of atrial fib.  I
   am concerned about the possibility of constriction.  She has a fairly
   sizable burden of residual clot in the pericardial space, and she has a
   Kussmaul sign.  Her large left pleural effusion is also of concern.  I
   am hoping that this is due simply to aggressive volume loading.
   However, it is necessary to follow this effusion to its spontaneous
   resolution, or else diagnose and treat it.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of PAFib, on coumadin, s/p PPM with recent myocardial bridge s/p stent and bleeding two weeks ago.
- She presented with SOB and was found to have a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology.
- She underwent cardiac cath and pericardiocentesis and is currently feeling well.
- The patient had a large pericardial effusion and signs of tamponade on echo and R cardiac cath.
- The size of the effusion suggests that it has been accumulating for the last two weeks and is not something acute.
- She does not have any pulsus and has a drain in place, draining minimal fluid overnight.
- Her JVP is elevated.
- She has a history of PAFib, rate-controlled with diltiazem 120 mg daily.
- She stopped Coumadin for six months and her INR this morning is 1.5.
- She is currently on 3L NC and her chest x-ray shows a large left-sided pleural effusion.
- Her left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF >55%).
- The patient's condition needs close monitoring due to the possibility of tamponade and a large pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient has a history of pericardial effusion and tamponade"
