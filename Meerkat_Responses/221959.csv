   Assessment and Plan
 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME (SVC)
   A/P: 61 y oM c metastatic esophageal CA p/w SVC syndrome [**3-8**] port
   associated thrombosis who is being transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for closer
   monitoring in setting of tPA infusion.
   .
   # SVC syndrome - Secondary to port associated clot that is tracking
   upwards into the azygos vein. Port was placed in [**8-10**]. Although pt had
   not been on anti-coagulation 5 days prior to admission, he had
   previously been on lovenox for one month and thus will required
   lifelong anticoagulation. Thus far, no evidence of airway obstruction.
   IR started tPA infusion and patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring.  IR assessed patient after 24 hours on tPA: partial
   resolution of clot
   - On heparin drip at nontherapeutic dose until tPA stopped
   - Started tPA infusion with initial 2 mg bolus, then 0.5 mg/hr until
   5pm on [**2145-7-27**].
   - Monitor coags, fibrinogen, platelets q3h.
   - Monitor closely for any signs of bleeding.
   - Will need neuro exams checked q4h while on tPA infusion; however, no
   known h/o brain mets.
   - Repeat venogram/possible stent/angioplasty tomorrow
   - Check Fibrinogen at 15:00 [**7-27**].  If fibrinogen < 150, stop tPA and
   call IR (will likely need cyro transfusion); if <180, will call IR for
   lower dose.
   # Esophageal cancer - With known liver and lung mets. Patient was not
   able to tolerate most recent cycle of chemotherapy. Per OMED note,
   family meeting was done as outpatient and decision was made to not give
   further chemotherapy and try to focus on quality of life. Not CMO, and
   pt is still full code.
   - Further plan per primary oncology team.
   - Transfuse for Hct < 25, plts < 10K unless actively bleeding.
   .
   # h/o hypertension:  Previously on metoprolol.  Has been taking off
   recently and remains normotensive.  Maybe due to weight loss.
   - cont. to monitor BP
   .
   # FEN/GI - s/p 1 month course of TPN in setting of colitis s/p
   chemotherapy. Now tolerating pos with nutritional supplements. Megace
   also restarted.
   - Regular diet with ensure supplementation
   - Replete lytes prn
   - NPO after midnight for potential IR intervention tomorrow

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic esophageal cancer, presenting with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome secondary to a port-associated clot.
- The patient was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring during tPA infusion.
- The patient has a history of hypertension but has been off medication and remains normotensive.
- The patient previously underwent chemotherapy, which led to colitis and was treated with total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
- The patient is now tolerating oral intake with nutritional supplements and has restarted Megace.
- The patient's code status is full code.
- The patient will require lifelong anticoagulation.
- The patient's coagulation parameters, including fibrinogen, will be monitored closely.
- Repeat venogram/possible stent/angioplasty is planned for the next day.
- The patient's neuro exams will be checked every 4 hours while on tPA infusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of bleeding due to the tPA infusion, which is a thrombolytic agent. Monitoring coagulation parameters and platelet counts is important to detect any signs of bleeding.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count may drop due to the tPA infusion, which can further increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Airway obstruction: SVC syndrome can cause compression of the airway, leading to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic esophageal cancer who is experiencing Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVC) secondary to a port-associated clot. The patient has been started on tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) infusion and is being transferred to another hospital unit for closer monitoring. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Airway obstruction: SVC syndrome can lead to compression of the airways, resulting in difficulty breathing or even complete obstruction.
2. Pulmonary edema: Increased pressure in the veins of the upper body can cause fluid to back up into the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema.
3. Hypotension: Reduced venous return to the heart can result in decreased cardiac output and subsequent hypotension.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The tPA infusion may cause a decrease in platelet count, increasing the risk of bleeding.
5. Hemorrhage: With reduced platelet count and fibrinogen levels, there is a risk of bleeding, which can be life-threatening if it involves major organs or vessels.
6. Stroke: tPA infusion is contraindicated in patients with recent brain metastases or a history of stroke due to the risk of hemorrhagic transformation.

It is important for the medical team to closely monitor the patient's condition and take appropriate measures to manage these potential complications."

   # SVC syndrome - Secondary to port associated clot that is tracking
   upwards into the azygos vein. Port was placed in [**8-10**]. Although pt had
   not been on anti-coagulation 5 days prior to admission, he had
   previously been on lovenox for one month and thus will required
   lifelong anticoagulation. Thus far, no evidence of airway obstruction.
   IR started tPA infusion and thus is being transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**].
   - On heparin drip
   - Started tPA infusion with initial 2 mg bolus, then 0.5 mg/hr until
   goes to IR in am.
   - Monitor coags, fibrinogen, platelets q3h.
   - Monitor closely for any signs of bleeding.
   - Will need neuro exams checked q4h while on tPA infusion; however, no
   known h/o brain mets.
   - Repeat venogram/possible stent/angioplasty today
   - Check Fibrinogen if pt returns from IR on TPA.  If fibrinogen < 150,
   stop tPA and call IR (will likely need cyro transfusion); if <180, will
   call IR for lower dose.
   # Esophageal cancer - With known liver and lung mets. Patient was not
   able to tolerate most recent cycle of chemotherapy. Per OMED note,
   family meeting was done as outpatient and decision was made to not give
   further chemotherapy and try to focus on quality of life. Not CMO, and

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic esophageal cancer presenting with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome due to a port-associated thrombosis.
- The patient was not on anticoagulation for the past five days but had previously been on enoxaparin for one month.
- Lifelong anticoagulation is required.
- No evidence of airway obstruction has been observed so far.
- The patient is currently being transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring during tPA infusion.
- The patient is on a heparin drip and started tPA infusion with an initial 2 mg bolus followed by 0.5 mg/hr.
- Coagulation studies, fibrinogen, and platelets are to be monitored every three hours.
- Neuro exams are to be checked every four hours while on tPA infusion.
- A repeat venogram with possible stent/angioplasty is planned for today.
- Fibrinogen levels will be checked if the patient returns from IR on tPA. If fibrinogen is less than 150, tPA should be stopped and the IR should be called (likely needing cryo-transfusion); if fibrinogen is less than 180, the IR should be called for a lower dose.
- The patient has esophageal cancer with known liver and lung metastases. The patient was unable to tolerate the most recent cycle of chemotherapy. A family meeting was"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic esophageal cancer, presenting with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome secondary to a port-associated thrombosis. The patient was started on tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) infusion and transferred to another unit for monitoring. There has been partial resolution of the clot, but the patient is still on heparin drip at a non-therapeutic dose. The plan includes monitoring coagulation parameters, closely watching for any signs of bleeding, repeating venogram, considering stent or angioplasty, and checking fibrinogen levels. The patient's esophageal cancer with known liver and lung metastases is being managed with palliative care, focusing on quality of life rather than aggressive chemotherapy. The patient remains full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: Due to the TPA infusion, there is a risk of bleeding, especially with a fibrinogen level below 150. Close monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary.
2. Airway obstruction: Although not currently evident, SVC syndrome can lead to airway compression, which may require immediate intervention to secure the airway.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is already low, and further decrease may occur due to TPA therapy or other factors. Monitoring and potential transfusion may be required.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's liver metastases,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic esophageal cancer who is experiencing superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome due to a port-associated clot in the azygos vein. The patient is currently receiving tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) infusion and awaiting a repeat venogram to determine the next intervention. The patient's primary oncology team will provide further management for his esophageal cancer with metastasis to the liver and lung. The patient also has anemia, hypertension, and fluid balance issues that need to be addressed. The patient is tolerating oral intake with nutritional supplements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SVC Syndrome: The patient's symptoms of facial swelling and dyspnea are consistent with SVC syndrome, which is a medical emergency. If left untreated, it can lead to respiratory distress and decreased cerebral perfusion.
2. Thrombolysis Complications: The use of tPA carries the risk of bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage. Monitoring for signs of bleeding is essential.
3. Port-Related Clot Complications: The presence of a port-associated clot increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if it dislodges and travels to the lungs.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates anemia. If not corrected, it can lead to decreased oxygen carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.
5. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension requires monitoring,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic esophageal cancer, experiencing Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVC) secondary to port-associated thrombosis. The patient has been on lifelong anticoagulation since the port was placed. He is currently in the ICU receiving heparin drip and has undergone tPA infusion to dissolve the clot. The patient has shown partial resolution of the clot and is stable without any complications. His esophageal cancer is advanced with known liver and lung metastases. The patient was not able to tolerate the most recent cycle of chemotherapy and the decision was made to focus on quality of life rather than further chemotherapy. The patient remains full code. Other medical history includes hypertension and recent colitis following chemotherapy. The patient is tolerating oral intake with nutritional supplements and is being monitored for glycemic control, electrolytes, and potential interventions for the clot removal."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has been diagnosed with Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVC). The patient underwent angiography on [**2145-7-27**] to assess a clot in the Superior Vena Cava (SVC), which showed partial dissolution but was still present. No intervention was performed at that time. The patient received heparin drip through the sheath and tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) through the catheter until 5 PM. After the catheter removal, therapeutic heparin was restarted.

The patient is scheduled to return to interventional radiology (IR) for further clot removal on [**7-28**]. The IR recommended discontinuing TPA and starting 1400 units of heparin. The patient's heart rate increased to 110 bpm.

The patient has allergies to penicillins and unknown allergens. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2145-7-26**] at 08:21 PM.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F) with a maximum temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F)
- Heart rate: 100 bpm with a normal range of 90-114 bpm
- Blood pressure: 131/89 mmHg with a normal range of 110/81-143/102 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute with a normal range of 10-33 breaths per minute

 SUPERIOR VENA CAVA SYNDROME (SVC)
   A/P: 61 y oM c metastatic esophageal CA p/w SVC syndrome [**3-8**] port
   associated thrombosis who is being transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for closer
   monitoring in setting of tPA infusion.
   .
   # SVC syndrome - Secondary to port associated clot that is tracking
   upwards into the azygos vein. Port was placed in [**8-10**]. Although pt had
   not been on anti-coagulation 5 days prior to admission, he had
   previously been on lovenox for one month and thus will required
   lifelong anticoagulation. Thus far, no evidence of airway obstruction.
   IR started tPA infusion and patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring.  IR assessed patient after 24 hours on tPA: partial
   resolution of clot
   - On heparin drip at nontherapeutic dose until tPA stopped
   - Started tPA infusion with initial 2 mg bolus, then 0.5 mg/hr until
   5pm on [**2145-7-27**].
   - Monitor coags, fibrinogen, platelets q3h.
   - Monitor closely for any signs of bleeding.
   - Will need neuro exams checked q4h while on tPA infusion; however, no
   known h/o brain mets.
   - Repeat venogram/possible stent/angioplasty tomorrow
   - Check Fibrinogen at 15:00 [**7-27**].  If fibrinogen < 150, stop tPA and
   call IR (will likely need cyro transfusion); if <180, will call IR for
   lower dose.
   # Esophageal cancer - With known liver and lung mets. Patient was not
   able to tolerate most recent cycle of chemotherapy. Per OMED note,
   family meeting was done as outpatient and decision was made to not give
   further chemotherapy and try to focus on quality of life. Not CMO, and
   pt is still full code.
   - Further plan per primary oncology team.
   - Transfuse for Hct < 25, plts < 10K unless actively bleeding.
   .
   # h/o hypertension:  Previously on metoprolol.  Has been taking off
   recently and remains normotensive.  Maybe due to weight loss.
   - cont. to monitor BP
   .
   # FEN/GI - s/p 1 month course of TPN in setting of colitis s/p
   chemotherapy. Now tolerating pos with nutritional supplements. Megace
   also restarted.
   - Regular diet with ensure supplementation
   - Replete lytes prn
   - NPO after midnight for potential IR intervention tomorrow

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic esophageal cancer, who presented with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome secondary to a port-associated thrombosis. The patient had not been on anticoagulation for the past five days prior to admission but had been previously on Lovenox for one month. It was determined that the patient would require lifelong anticoagulation.

The patient is currently on therapeutic heparin and has been started on tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) infusion with a 2 mg bolus followed by 0.5 mg/hr until 5 pm on [**2145-7-27**]. The patient's coagulation parameters, including fibrinogen levels, are being monitored every three hours. The patient is also being closely monitored for any signs of bleeding and neuro exams are being checked every four hours while on tPA infusion.

Further plans include repeating the venogram and possibly stenting or angioplasty tomorrow. If the fibrinogen level is less than 150, tPA should be stopped and the interventional radiology (IR) team should be called for a cryo transfusion. If the fibrinogen level is between 150 and 180, the IR team should be called for a lower dose.

The patient's primary oncology team will provide further plans for managing his esophageal cancer, considering his inability to tolerate the most recent cycle of chemotherapy."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic esophageal cancer presenting with superior vena cava syndrome (SVC) secondary to a port-associated thrombosis. The patient had partial resolution of the clot after tPA infusion but still has residual clot. Heparin drip and catheter-directed tPA were administered. The plan is to remove the sheath and perform venography with clot retrieval in the morning. The patient denies new weakness, and vital signs are stable. The patient is pleasant, interactive, and alert with no focal neurologic deficits. There are crackles in the bases bilaterally on pulmonary examination. The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently normotensive without medication. Esophageal cancer with known liver and lung metastases has been diagnosed. The patient was unable to tolerate most recent chemotherapy cycle and will focus on quality of life. The patient is full code. Other issues include fen/gi with a history of colitis after chemotherapy, now tolerating oral intake with nutritional supplements, and a planned removal of the portacath. The patient is to be transferred to the floor today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary complications: The presence of crackles in the bases bilaterally may indicate underlying pulmonary edema or infection, which can lead to respiratory distress or failure.
2. Bleeding complications: Due to the anticoagulation therapy (heparin and tPA), there is a risk of bleeding"

","The patient is in the ICU with Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVC) and is currently on heparin drip at 200u/hr through the sheath and TPA through the catheter until 5 PM. Heparin was restarted at 1400 U at 5 PM. The plan is to re-seen the patient by IR for venography and clot retrieval on the morning of the next day, and if the residual clot persists, the sheath will be removed. The patient denies any new weakness. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/89 to 143/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on sinus tachycardia. Fluid balance shows a total input of 271 mL and output of 2250 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1979 mL. 

Physical examination reveals crackles in the bases bilaterally, regular heart rhythm with no murmurs, soft abdomen, no cerebrovascular events, and no skin lesions or rash. Neurological examination shows the patient to be alert and oriented x3. 

Lab results show hemoglobin of 12.2 g/dL, hematocrit of 35.5%, leukocyte count of 7.7 K/uL, platelet count of 141 K/uL, sodium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic esophageal cancer presenting with Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome. He has undergone tPA infusion but no further interventions for IR are planned. The patient's tunneled catheter will be removed per surgery, and he will need to resume anticoagulation. The patient also has metastasis to the liver and lung, with further plans per the primary oncology team. He is anemic with a hemoglobin level of 12.2 g/dL and is being monitored for hypertension. The patient's fluid balance is maintained, and he is tolerating oral intake with nutritional supplements. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SVC Syndrome: The patient's current condition of SVC syndrome can lead to complications such as respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, and cerebral edema due to impaired blood flow through the Superior Vena Cava.
2. Catheter Removal: The removal of the tunneled catheter may lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, or thrombosis at the catheter insertion site.
3. Metastatic Esophageal Cancer: The patient's underlying condition of metastatic esophageal cancer can progress and cause complications like dysphagia, weight loss, malnutrition, and pain.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia can lead to complications such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Hypertension: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic esophageal cancer presenting with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. The patient underwent thrombolytic therapy (tPA infusion) and has a port-associated clot in the azygos vein. No further interventions for interventional radiology (IR) are planned. The tunneled catheter will be removed in approximately one month. The patient needs to resume anticoagulation.

The patient's medical history includes metastasis to the liver and lung, for which further management is planned by the primary oncology team. The patient also has anemia, hypertension, and fluid balance issues. The patient is tolerating oral intake with nutritional supplements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SVC Syndrome: This condition can lead to severe complications such as airway compression, respiratory distress, hypoxia, and even respiratory arrest.
2. Port-related complications: The presence of a port-associated clot increases the risk of further thrombosis or embolism if the clot dislodges.
3. Anemia: This can result in reduced oxygen-carrying capacity, leading to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
4. Hypertension: Uncontrolled hypertension can increase the risk of cardiovascular events like stroke or myocardial infarction.
5. Fluid imbalance: Inappropriate fluid management can lead to fluid overload or dehydration, both of which can have serious consequences.
6. Nutritional support"

   # SVC syndrome - Secondary to port associated clot that is tracking
   upwards into the azygos vein. Port was placed in [**8-10**]. Although pt had
   not been on anti-coagulation 5 days prior to admission, he had
   previously been on lovenox for one month and thus will required
   lifelong anticoagulation. Thus far, no evidence of airway obstruction.
   IR started tPA infusion and patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for
   monitoring.  Reassessment at 24 and 48 hrs on tPA showed only partial
   resolution of clot.
   - heparin temporarily held while IR removes sheath
   - restart heparin after removal, check PTT 6 hrs after restarting
   -IR to remove port tomorrow, NPO after midnight.
   # Esophageal cancer - With known liver and lung mets. Patient was not
   able to tolerate most recent cycle of chemotherapy. Per OMED note,
   family meeting was done as outpatient and decision was made to not give
   further chemotherapy and try to focus on quality of life. Not CMO, and
   pt is still full code.
   - Followed by oncology
   - Transfuse for Hct < 25, plts < 10K unless actively bleeding.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a diagnosis of metastatic esophageal cancer. He presented with superior vena cava syndrome (SVC) secondary to a port-associated clot that is tracking upwards into the azygos vein. The patient had previously been on anticoagulation therapy but had stopped 5 days prior to admission. He was transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring and received tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) infusion for clot retrieval. However, only partial resolution of the clot was achieved. The patient's port sheath for tPA administration was removed, and he will continue on long-term anticoagulation.

The patient has known liver and lung metastases and was not able to tolerate his most recent cycle of chemotherapy. A family meeting was held to discuss further treatment options, and it was decided to focus on quality of life rather than continuing chemotherapy. The patient is still full code.

The patient has a history of hypertension and was previously on metoprolol but was normotensive without medication in the unit. It is mentioned to consider restarting metoprolol upon discharge.

The patient had been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for one month due to chemotherapy-induced colitis and has now resumed oral intake with nutritional supplements. Megace has also been restarted.

The patient underwent an infusion of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and was transferred to the ICU for monitoring. Reassessment at 24 and 48 hours on tPA showed only partial resolution of the clot. Heparin was temporarily held while the inferior vena cava (IR) sheath was removed, and it was restarted after removal, with a PTT check 6 hours after restarting. The plan is to remove the port tomorrow, with the patient being NPO after midnight.

The patient also has a history of hypertension and is currently normotensive without medication in the unit. It is considered to restart metoprolol upon discharge.

Additionally, the patient had a recent episode of colitis secondary to chemotherapy and was on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for one month. Now, the patient is tolerating oral intake with nutritional supplements. Megace was also restarted.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition in the ICU is as follows:

- The patient has been diagnosed with Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVC), which is a medical condition characterized by obstruction of blood flow through the superior vena cava, leading to swelling and congestion in the upper body.
- Vital signs: The patient's temperature is within normal range, but their heart rate is elevated (109 bpm). Blood pressure is relatively stable, with readings ranging from 112/89 mmHg to 104/71 mmHg. Respiratory rate is within normal limits (21 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation is 93%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows an increased total fluid input of 692 mL since 12 AM and a total output of 2,125 mL, indicating adequate fluid balance.
- Blood product transfusion has been given, with a total output of 2,125 mL.
- The patient is not receiving respiratory support, and their ABG results are not mentioned.
- Physical examination findings are limited due to the fact that peripheral pulses, skin, neurologic assessment, and other parameters were not assessed.
- Laboratory results show stable levels of potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes. White blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count are within normal range.
- The patient has been on heparin sodium infusion at a rate of 1,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with metastatic esophageal cancer presenting with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. The patient underwent thrombolytic therapy (tPA infusion) and has a port-associated clot in the azygos vein. There are no further interventions planned for interventional radiology (IR). The plan is to remove the tunneled catheter on the 60th day and resume anticoagulation. The patient also has metastases to the liver and lung, with further planning per primary oncology team. The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level below 12.1 g/dL, hypertension, and fluid balance issues. The patient is tolerating oral intake with nutritional supplements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SVC syndrome: This condition can cause severe complications such as airway compromise, respiratory distress, hypotension, and even death if not managed promptly.
2. Thrombosis: The presence of a port-associated clot in the azygos vein indicates a risk of further thrombotic events, which can lead to pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
4. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications like stroke or heart attack.
5. Fluid balance"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of metastatic esophageal cancer presenting with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. The patient underwent a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) infusion and had a port-associated clot in the azygos vein. No further interventions are planned for interventional radiology (IR). The tunneled catheter will be removed per surgery, and anticoagulation will need to be resumed.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/90 to 103/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's review of systems is mostly unremarkable, except for occasional facial swelling and right upper quadrant discomfort.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, normal heart sounds, clear lung sounds bilaterally, and no signs of lymphadenopathy or clubbing. Neurological examination reveals the patient to be attentive, oriented, and purposeful in movements.

Laboratory results show normal hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count within the last few days. Liver function tests and electrolyte levels are also within normal limits.

The patient's current plan includes transfusion for anemia when hemoglobin level is below 25 g/dL, monitoring for hypertension, maintaining fluid balance"
