   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who has been in the hospital and has been placed on BIPAP due to respiratory failure. He has a history of Crohn's disease, chronic aspiration, ESRD (end-stage renal disease), and has received fentanyl, which may have caused hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolence. The patient also has a tunneled line and requires IVF for hypotension. He has allergies to dicloxacillin and mercaptopurine. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains sleepy and requires respiratory support. The patient's fluid balance is positive by 87 mL, and his ABG results are pending. He is receiving TPN (total parenteral nutrition) and has an NG tube in place. The patient's condition is critical, and he has a DNR/DNI status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may persist if he does not respond to BIPAP support.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to ESRD and ongoing antibiotic treatment increases the risk of infection.
3. Fluid overload: The positive fluid balance suggests the possibility of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory function.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition, as indicated by TPN administration, may contribute to delayed wound healing or increased susceptibility to infections.

   and decreased respiratory drive. He has received 0.4 X 3 IV narcan with
   improvement of sedation. Overnight, his mental status has improved to
   baseline; however, he is still retaining CO2
   - bipap for now as long as patient will tolerate
   - follow ABG
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Oxygen requirement stable at 5 L 95%.
   Secondary to possible pulmonary fungal infection, health care acquired
   and aspiration pneumonia. Patient has been afebrile and hemdynamically
   stable.
   - Today is Meropenem 500 IV Q HD day 12 of 14 for health care acquired
   - Today is Micafungin Day 7 for fungal coverage

   # Crohns disease: Pt is s/p bowel resections and has short gut.
   - replete lytes
   - will keep head of bed elevation for severe reflux
   - not currently on immune suppressants
   .
   # Anemia: baseline Hct 26-32, current Hct 28. Secondary to anemia of
   chronic disease.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing altered mental status and hypercarbia. The patient has been in the ICU and started on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) due to difficulty tolerating BiPAP. The patient's ABG results showed persistent acidosis, and they were awake and alert, pulling off the BiPAP mask frequently. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/60 to 118/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient has several medical conditions, including chronic respiratory failure with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, malnutrition, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), a toe ulcer, Crohn's disease, anemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient is also on multiple medications, such as narcan, meropenem, micafungin, testosterone, TPN, and heparin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the given information include worsening respiratory failure due to inadequate tolerance of BiPAP or development of further respiratory infections. The patient's toe ulcer may progress to cellulitis or a more severe infection. The patient's malnutrition and Crohn's disease may lead to further complications if not properly managed. The ESRD requires careful monitoring of electrolyte levels and fluid balance. The patient's"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a male with altered mental status and hypercarbia. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, chronic. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, likely due to narcotics and decreased respiratory drive. He received IV narcan with improvement in sedation. His mental status has improved to baseline, but he still retains CO2. The patient is refusing mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient requires supplemental oxygen and has a possible pulmonary fungal infection and aspiration pneumonia.

2. Malnutrition: The patient is cachectic, has been made NPO due to severe aspiration, and has low testosterone levels. He is receiving TPN via a tunneled line and his nutrition needs should be appreciated.

3. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on Hemodialysis (HD): The patient is anuric and undergoes HD three times a week. Renal recommendations should be appreciated.

4. Toe Ulcer: The patient has an erythematous toe ulcer without evidence of cellulitis. Meropenem provides adequate coverage for any potential infection.

5. Crohn's Disease: The patient has a history of bowel resections and short gut. He should have replete electrolytes, head of bed elevation for severe reflux, and may require immune suppressants.

6. Anemia: The patient has anemia secondary to anemia of chronic disease. His baseline Hct is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male who has been hospitalized and is currently in the ICU. The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a tunneled line, non-invasive ventilation, and the administration of various medications.

The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, which led to the initiation of non-invasive ventilation. However, the patient developed hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolence after receiving fentanyl. The patient's alertness improved after being given narcan twice, indicating a response to opioid overdose.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within normal range (92 bpm), blood pressure slightly on the lower side (116/60 mmHg), respiratory rate around 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a pressure of 15 cmH2O, with a tidal volume of 323 mL, respiratory rate of 26, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 99%. The ABG results indicate an acidotic state with a pH of 7.24, PaCO2 of 75 mmHg, and HCO3- of 29 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals moist mucous membranes, surgical right pupil, constricting left pupil, coarse crackles at the bases"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on BIPAP due to respiratory failure. He has a history of severe malnutrition and is receiving TPN. The patient also has pulmonary infiltrates, which may indicate an infectious process such as fungal or bacterial infection. Antibiotics have been prescribed, and repeat testing for beta glucan will be done tomorrow. The patient's condition is critical, and he is expected to stay in the ICU until his gas exchange improves. He is also experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolence, likely due to fentanyl. Other medical conditions include ESRD, Crohn's disease, and a tunneled line placed for further treatment. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his current vital signs are stable with controlled blood pressure and oxygen saturation at 99%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already present, and there is a risk of it worsening if the BIPAP is not effective or if the underlying cause of the respiratory failure is not addressed.
2. Infection: The presence of pulmonary infiltrates suggests a possible infection. If left untreated or if the antibiotics prescribed are ineffective, the infection could progress and lead to further complications.
3. Malnutrition: The patient's severe malnutrition increases the risk of complications during recovery and may prolong his stay in the ICU. If proper nutrition is not maintained,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure requiring BIPAP. He was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, which was stabilized after being placed on BIPAP. The patient also developed hypotension and required IV fluids for support. He has a history of allergies to dicloxacillin and mercaptopurine, and neutropenia. The patient received antibiotics (meropenem) and antifungal medication (micafungin). He has been on heparin sodium prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/57 to 125/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen delivery with SpO2 of 100%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 58 mmHg, PaO2 of 142, and FiO2 of 0.21. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination were not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate a WBC count of 5.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, platelet count of 174 K/uL, creatinine of 3.7 mg/dL, total CO2 of 34,"

The patient is a 68-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), chronic pulmonary infiltrates associated with hypoxemia, chronic aspiration, and sensitivity to opiates. He was admitted for respiratory failure requiring bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP). The patient's history includes fentanyl administration, development of hypercarbic respiratory failure, placement on BIPAP, stabilization, and response to narcan. He remains sleepy and requires intravenous fluids (IVF) for hypotension. The patient's allergies are to dicloxacillin and mercaptopurine. His last dose of antibiotics was meropenem on day 13/14 and micafungin for months. He has multiple infusions and medications including mirtazapine, synthroid, albuterol, heparin subcutaneously, and testosterone patch. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory issues. His vital signs show a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/57 mmHg to 125/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 4 liters of nasal cannula. The patient has sinus rhythm and his fluid balance shows an intake of 2,450 mL with output of 705 mL. He is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and his ABG results"

   Hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolence
    - likely a consequence of fentanyl and percocets (though only fent
   12.5 mcg and 2 percs)
   - will continue to support with BIPAP until gas improves.
   -  MS much improved
   - Will check ABG.  If pCO2 >60 then pre-treat with haldol
   Severe malnutrition
    - receiving TPN
   Pulmonary infiltrates
   - improvement in consolidation by CXR which does support a possible
   infectious process such as fungal or bacterial.
   - some improvement in Oxygenation but overall X-rays do  appear
   improved.
   - continue abx for now, repeat b-glucan tomorrow
   -Will repeat Cytology and Sputum Eosinophils (will ask path if copious
   eos or scant)
   -Will continue meropenem Day [**10-28**], [**Last Name (LF) 6238**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] follow Beta glucan

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with chronic respiratory failure, possible pulmonary fungal infection, malnutrition, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, toe ulcer, Crohn's disease, anemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, antifungals, TPN, and heparin prophylaxis. The patient's mental status has improved after receiving Narcan, but they are still retaining CO2. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires supplemental oxygen. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's toe ulcer is erythematous but without evidence of cellulitis, and blood cultures have been negative. The patient has a history of bowel resections and is experiencing severe reflux. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen due to their inability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Continuous monitoring of respiratory function and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary.
2. Pulmonary Fungal Infection: The patient's possible pulmonary fungal infection could progress if not appropriately managed with antifungal medications. Monitoring of symptoms, follow-up ABGs, and repeat sputum cytology will be essential.
3. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may lead to further complications"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-inch tall male who presented with respiratory failure, chronic, hypercarbic, and hypoxic. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission. He has received 0.4 X 3 IV narcan with improvement of sedation. His mental status has improved to baseline, but he is still retaining CO2. The patient is refusing BiPAP.

The patient's allergies include Dicloxacillin, rash; Mercaptopurine, neutropenia; Thrombocytopenia. The last dose of antibiotics was Meropenem at [**2175-4-21**] 05:25 PM and Micafungin at [**2175-4-21**] 08:14 PM.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 36.8 C (98.2 F), HR: 101 (83 - 101) bpm, BP: 123/57 (72) mmHg, RR: 24 (18 - 30) inspiratory minutes, SpO2: 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has a toe ulcer that is erythematous with no evidence of cellulitis. Meropenem provides adequate coverage, and blood cultures have been negative since.

The patient's lab results show a WBC of 5.3, Hct of 29.3, Plt of 174, Cr of 3.7, TCO2 of 34, Glucose of 92, and other labs including PT / PTT / INR: 15.7/43.3/1.4, Lactic Acid: 0.9 mmol/L, Ca++: 9.3 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL, PO4: 4.2 mg/dL.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure, Chronic: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly due to narcotics and decreased respiratory drive. He has received 0.4 X 3 IV narcan with improvement of sedation. Overnight, his mental status has improved to baseline; however, he is still retaining CO2. The patient is refusing BiPAP.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient requires stable oxygen at 5 L 95%. This may be secondary to possible pulmonary fungal infection, healthcare-associated, and aspiration pneumonia.
3. Malnutrition: The patient is cachectic on examination and has been made NPO due to severe aspiration. Testosterone has been started secondary to low levels.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient is anuric and undergoes HD MWF.
5. Toe Ulcer: The ulcer is erythematous with no evidence of cellulitis. Meropenem provides adequate coverage, and blood cultures have been negative since.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with a weight not mentioned. They have been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient's chief complaint is difficulty breathing, but they deny any pain. The patient's mental status is described as awake but not alert, and they are only barely answering questions. Their eyes are closed, and they appear cachectic.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/57 mmHg to 125/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics (meropenem), antifungal medication (micafungin), heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and TPN (total parenteral nutrition). They also have a tunneled Hickman line for antibiotic and TPN administration, as well as a Dobhoff line.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing both hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypoxic respiratory failure. Hypercarbic respiratory failure is likely due to decreased respiratory drive caused by narcotics. The patient has received Narcan IV but still retains CO2. They are alternating between refusing and trying BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who is currently in the ICU. He has a history of chronic respiratory failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, malnutrition, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (HD), toe ulcer, Crohn's disease, anemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient is sedated and has been NPO (nothing by mouth) due to severe aspiration. He has multiple medical complications and is receiving various treatments and medications. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged sedation and immobilization: The patient has been sedated and NPO, which may increase the risk of pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pneumonia.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of healthcare-associated fungal infection and aspiration pneumonia. There is a need for ongoing monitoring and appropriate antibiotic coverage.
3. Malnutrition: The patient is cachectic and has been made NPO. Malnutrition can impair wound healing, increase the risk of infections, and delay recovery.
4. Anemia of chronic disease: The patient has a low hemoglobin level and anemia of chronic disease. This can lead to fatigue and decreased oxygen-carrying capacity.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient is receiving IV levothyroxine due to NPO status. Hypothyroidism can affect multiple"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, malnutrition, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, toe ulcer, Crohn's disease, anemia, and hypothyroidism. He is currently in the ICU and has been made NPO (nothing by mouth) due to severe aspiration. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, and his SpO2 is stable at 98%. The patient has been improving in terms of mental status and has shown improvement after receiving IV narcan. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary fungal infection: The patient's history of being on broad-spectrum antibiotics and having a prolonged hospital stay increases the risk of developing a healthcare-associated fungal infection. The pending beta-glucan test results will help determine if this is the case.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's inability to protect his airway due to severe aspiration puts him at risk for developing aspiration pneumonia.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a net positive balance of 1,814 mL over the past 24 hours, indicating potential fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsen respiratory status.
4. Malnutrition: The patient is cachectic and has been made NPO, increasing the risk of malnutrition. This can impair wound healing and immune function.
5. Anemia: The patient's baseline Hct levels range from "

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolence
    - likely a consequence of fentanyl and percocets (though only fent
   12.5 mcg and 2 percs)
   - will continue to support with BIPAP until gas improves.
   -  MS much improved
   - Will check ABG.  If pCO2 >60 then pre-treat with haldol
   Severe malnutrition
    - receiving TPN
   Pulmonary infiltrates
   - improvement in consolidation by CXR which does support a possible
   infectious process such as fungal or bacterial.
   - some improvement in Oxygenation but overall X-rays do  appear
   improved.
   - continue abx for now, repeat b-glucan tomorrow
   -Will repeat Cytology and Sputum Eosinophils (will ask path if copious
   eos or scant)
   -Will continue meropenem Day [**10-28**], [**Last Name (LF) 6238**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] follow Beta glucan
   -Will consider steroids if + sputum eos + and if his x-rays start to
   worsen in the setting of decreased sputum production.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, chronic bronchopulmonary infiltrates associated with hypoxemia, chronic aspiration, and sensitivity to opiates. He presented with respiratory failure requiring bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) support. The patient developed hypercarbic respiratory failure after receiving fentanyl for a tunneled line placement and required IV fluids for hypotension. He remains sleepy and requires continued BIPAP support. The patient's allergies include dicloxacillin and mercaptopurine, and he has a history of neutropenia. His last doses of antibiotics were meropenem and micafungin on 04/22/2175 at 02:00 PM and 08:00 PM, respectively. The patient is on various ICU medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is in the ICU with a diagnosis of chronic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7Â°C (96.2Â°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/56 mmHg to 130/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support through CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 408 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0%.

The patient has received various medications, including dicloxacillin and mercaptopurine, with known allergies to these drugs. The patient has also received antibiotics (meropenem) and antifungal medication (micafungin). Heparin sodium is being administered for prophylaxis.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,686 mL, including 627 mL of total IV fluids, and a total output of 3,500 mL, with 195 mL of IV fluid output. The patient's blood products output is 50 mL.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, numerous bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration leading to bronchiectasis, and a history of necrotizing pneumonia. The patient presented to the MICU with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia. He was treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and received empirical micafungin. However, there was suspicion of a more chronic process such as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), malignancy, chronic aspiration, or atypical infection.

The patient's current condition includes hypercapnea, which has required the use of BiPAP. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has had multiple episodes of hypercapnea. He also has a toe ulcer, erythematous with no evidence of cellulitis, and is being treated with meropenem. The patient is anuric and undergoes hemodialysis (HD) three times a week due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He has a history of Crohn's disease, bowel resections, and short gut syndrome. The patient is cachectic and has severe anemia, likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease. He also has hypothyroidism and is being treated with IV levothyroxine.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36."

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: This is most likely in setting of narcotics
   and decreased respiratory drive. He has received 0.4 X 3 IV narcan with
   improvement of sedation. Overnight, his mental status has improved to
   baseline; however, he is still retaining CO2. Alternating with refusing
   and trying BiPAP. After discussion with patient this AM, he would not
   wish to be CMO and is willing to try bipap if absolutely necessary.
   - follow mental status, if decreased and on ABG PaCO2>60 will try BiPAP
   - try a little bit of haldol for anxiety and intolerant of BiPAP
   - avoid opiates
   - await discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 712**]
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Oxygen requirement stable at 5 L 95%.
   Secondary to possible pulmonary fungal infection, health care acquired
   and aspiration pneumonia. Patient has been afebrile and hemodynamically
   stable.   Repeat Beta-glucan and galactomannan pending.
   - Completed course of Meropenem 500 IV Q HD for health care acquired
   pneumonia
   - Today is Micafungin day 10 for fungal coverage, will need several
   months of coverage

   Assessment and Plan
   68 y/o M hx Crohns dz with esophageal involvement, numerous bowel
   resections and short gut syndrome with severe pulmonary disease
   including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, hx necrotizing
   pneumonia,  who initially presented to the MICU with severe
   malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infltrates and worsening hypoxia.
   Being tx for HAP but suspect a more chronic process such as boop,
   malignancy, chronic aspiration or atypical infection.  We adding
   antifungal therapy and if he does not improve and continues to worsen
   we will add emperic steroids.  Sputum  returned with rare very atypical
   squamous cells concerning for squamous cell CA and with Eos.  He went
   to the floor and was doing much better went to IR for a line placement
   and received 12.5 fent plus some percocets earlier and went into
   hypercarbic resp failure.  Transferred back to ICU for BiPaP.  Now with
   clotted AV fistula.
   Hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolence
   -likely a consequence of fentanyl and percocets (though only fent 12.5
   mcg and 2 percs) improved
   - will continue to support with BIPAP PRN until gas improves.
   Severe malnutrition
   -receiving TPN
   -Hold TPN until dialysis line in place
   Pulmonary infiltrates-Worsened in the setting of volume overload
   suspect chronic process and underlying COPD
   -Will repeat Cytology and Sputum Eosinophils
   - meropenem completed, Micofungin, will follow Beta glucan
   -Will consider steroids if + sputum eos + and if his x-rays start to
   worsen in the setting of decreased sputum production.
   He has difficulty with sputum expectoration and this is in large part
   related to his overall strength which is marginal
   ESRD
 Active discussion for access, surgery recommends temorary access.  He
   is clotted on the right.
   Crohn's
   - no active issues beyond nutrition
   Family: Wife is  very involved.
   DISPO: DNR/DNI.  Goal is to stabilize vent stabilize ventilatory
   status.
   -Will discuss need for access and continuing therapy.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration, and bronchiectasis. He also has a history of necrotizing pneumonia. The patient initially presented to the MICU with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia. He was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and received empiric micafungin. However, there was a suspicion of a more chronic process such as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), malignancy, chronic aspiration, or atypical infection.

The patient's recent events include losing dialysis access due to clotting, allergies to dicloxacillin and mercaptopurine, neutropenia, and a rash. He received meropenem and micafungin for HAP and suspected fungal infection, respectively. The patient is currently on various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, testosterone patch, mertazapine, and NACL. He is also receiving TPN (total parenteral nutrition) due to severe malnutrition.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature (Tmax and Tcurrent): 36.4Â°C (97.6Â°F)
- Heart rate (HR): 86 bpm (77-94 bpm)
- Blood pressure (BP): 102/39 mmHg (102"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, and severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration leading to bronchiectasis and a history of necrotizing pneumonia. The patient presented to the MICU with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia. He was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia but suspicion remains for a more chronic process such as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), malignancy, chronic aspiration, or atypical infection. The patient's sputum returned with rare atypical squamous cells concerning for squamous cell carcinoma and eosinophils.

The patient's recent events include losing dialysis access due to clotting, experiencing hypercapnea requiring BiPAP, receiving fentanyl during a procedure leading to respiratory failure, and being placed on BiPAP again. The patient also has severe malnutrition, pulmonary infiltrates worsening despite treatment, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 

Assessment and plan:
The patient is likely experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolence as a consequence of fentanyl and Percocet. This will be supported with BiPAP PRN until gas exchange improves. The patient's severe malnutrition will be addressed through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), which is currently on hold until dialysis access is established. Pulmonary infiltrates are suspected to be"

   possible with Remeron.  Also hypercalcemic after missing dialysis.
   Plan for each addressed below:
   # Hypercarbic resp failure: This is most likely in setting of narcotics
   and decreased respiratory drive. He has received 0.4 X 3 IV narcan with
   improvement of sedation. Overnight, his mental status has improved to
   baseline; however, he is still retaining CO2. Alternating with refusing
   and trying BiPAP. After discussion with patient, he would not wish to
   be CMO and is willing to try bipap if absolutely necessary. VBG today
   AM 7.19/71/65, placed on BiPAP for depressed mental status.
   - Following mental status; if decreased and on ABG PaCO2>60 will try
   BiPAP
   - PRN haldol for anxiety and intolerant of BiPAP
   - Avoiding opiates
   # Hypoglycemia: Likely iatrogenic in setting of not receiving TPN
   overnight last night. TPN was held to decrease obligate In's after
   missing HD. Now s/p D50 infusion with appropriate increase in BS.
   - Monitor FS closely
   - Start D10 gtt
   - Resume TPN today after HD then stop D10
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Oxygen requirement stable at 5 L 95%.
   Secondary to possible pulmonary fungal infection, health care acquired
   and aspiration pneumonia. Patient has been afebrile and hemodynamically
   stable.   Repeat Beta-glucan and galactomannan pending.  Has completed
   course of Meropenem 500 IV Q HD for health care acquired pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has completed a course of Meropenem for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and is currently on Micafungin. The patient's hemodialysis (HD) graft failed, so a femoral HD tunnelled catheter was placed. HD was missed yesterday, and the patient's TPN and tube feeds are on hold to limit inputs after missing HD. The patient's serum glucose level was critically low at 27 mg/dL, which was addressed with D50 infusion. He is receiving BiPAP for mental status improvement and has shown improvement in respiratory function. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing altered mental status due to hypercarbia and hypoglycemia. His blood cultures are negative since starting Meropenem, and he is being monitored for possible pulmonary fungal infection. The patient has a history of ESRD on HD, toe ulcer, Crohn's disease, anemia, hypothyroidism, and is cachectic. His code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure can worsen if BiPAP is not effective or if there is inadequate ventilation.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's low serum glucose level indicates a risk of recurrent hypoglycemia if proper monitoring and management are not maintained.
3. Fungal Infection: The patient's immune-compromised state and recent antibiotic use increase the risk of a pulmonary fungal infection. Monitoring for beta-glucan and galactomannan levels is important to identify any potential fungal infection.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient's elevated calcium level requires prompt attention and management, especially considering the missed dialysis session.
5. Clotted Graft: The failed HD graft increases the risk of complications associated with vascular access, such as infection or thrombosis.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's cachectic appearance and intermittent use of BiPAP may pose challenges in meeting nutritional requirements, which could further complicate his recovery.
7. Anemia: The patient's baseline Hct level indicates a chronic anemia condition that may require ongoing management and supplementation.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism should be monitored and managed appropriately, especially considering his NPO status and ongoing medical issues.
9. Toe Ulcer: The patient's toe ulcer requires close monitoring for signs of cellulitis or worsening infection.
10. Crohn's Disease: The patient's history of Crohn's disease may contribute to ongoing gastrointestinal symptoms and require specialized management.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional information may be required for a more comprehensive assessment."

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic respiratory failure, malnutrition, Crohn's disease, anemia, hypothyroidism, toe ulcer, and previous bowel resections. He presented to the ICU with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and possible pulmonary fungal infection.

The patient's recent events include starting dialysis through a tunnelled catheter due to a failed AV graft, missing a hemodialysis session, being placed on bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) for hypercarbic respiratory failure, receiving a D50 infusion for hypoglycemia, and having a toe ulcer that is erythematous but without evidence of cellulitis.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and increased respiratory rate. His blood gases indicate respiratory acidosis. Laboratory results reveal elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelets, and albumin levels, as well as elevated creatinine, potassium, and lactic acid levels. The patient has been receiving meropenem and micafungin for HCAP and fungal coverage, respectively.

The patient's medical complications include renal failure, malnutrition, chronic respiratory failure, hypoglycemia, hypoxic respiratory failure, clotted graft, and toe ulcer. The plan includes resuming hemodialysis, providing nutritional support, monitoring mental status and carbon dioxide levels, administering biPAP if necessary, evaluating"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), malnutrition, chronic respiratory failure, hypoglycemia, hypoxic respiratory failure, clotted graft, toe ulcer, Crohn's disease, anemia, hypothyroidism, and DNR/DNI status. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments, including hemodialysis, antibiotics, antifungals, TPN, and BiPAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of mental status and ABG PaCO2 levels is necessary. If the patient's mental status worsens and ABG PaCO2 remains elevated, BiPAP should be tried.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia overnight, likely due to missed TPN. Close monitoring of blood sugar levels is essential. Resuming TPN after hemodialysis is recommended.
3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient requires supplemental oxygen due to possible pulmonary fungal infection and aspiration pneumonia. Repeat beta-glucan and galactomannan tests are pending. Fungal coverage needs to be continued for several months.
4. Clotted Graft: The patient's hemodialysis AV graft failed, and a tunneled femoral HD catheter was placed. Hemodialysis should be resumed today"

   resections and short gut syndrome with severe pulmonary disease
   including chronic aspiration leading to bronchiectasis, hx necrotizing
   pneumonia.
   Initially presented to the MICU with severe malnutrition, bilateral
   pulmonary infltrates and worsening hypoxia.  Treated for HAP and got
   empiric micafungin,. but suspicion was there was a more chronic process
   such as boop, malignancy, chronic aspiration or atypical infection.
   Sputum  returned with rare very atypical squamous cells concerning for
   squamous cell CA and with Eos.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease, chronic aspiration leading to bronchiectasis, and a history of necrotizing pneumonia. The patient initially presented to the MICU with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia. He was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and received empiric micafungin. However, there is suspicion of a more chronic process such as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), malignancy, chronic aspiration, or atypical infection.

The patient has been experiencing repeat bouts of hypercapnea requiring BiPAP. He also has severe malnutrition, hypoglycemia, pulmonary infiltrates, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient's condition is complicated by the presence of rare atypical squamous cells in the sputum, which is concerning for squamous cell carcinoma. 

The assessment and plan include continuing BiPAP, dialysis to remove volume, and considering steroids if sputum eosinophils are positive and if the patient's x-rays start to worsen in the setting of decreased sputum production. Active discussion is ongoing for access for dialysis, with surgery recommending a temporary access due to the patient's clotted AV fistula. The patient's Crohn's disease"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, numerous bowel resections, and short gut syndrome. He also has severe pulmonary disease, including chronic aspiration leading to bronchiectasis and a history of necrotizing pneumonia.

He was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and received empirical micafungin. However, there was suspicion of a more chronic process such as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), malignancy, chronic aspiration, or atypical infection.

The patient went to the floor but returned to the MICU after receiving fentanyl during an invasive procedure for a line placement. He was transferred back to the ICU for BiPAP due to hypercapnea. The patient has been experiencing repeat bouts of hypercapnea requiring BiPAP.

24-hour events include a more erythematous TPN line, placement of a right femoral line, lethargy, and the initiation of dialysis. The patient's serum glucose level was initially high at 117 but later decreased to 80. Allergies include dicloxacillin and mercaptopurine. The patient received meropenem until the previous day and micafungin until the current day.

   her note, including assessment and plan as detailed in my note below.
   Chief Complaint: hypercapnea.
   HPI: 68 y/o M hx Crohns dz with esophageal involvement, numerous bowel
   resections and short gut syndrome with severe pulmonary disease
   including chronic aspiration leading to bronchiectasis, hx necrotizing
   pneumonia.
   Initially presented to the MICU with severe malnutrition, bilateral
   pulmonary infltrates and worsening hypoxia.  Treated for HAP and got
   empiric micafungin,. but suspicion was there was a more chronic process
   such as boop, malignancy, chronic aspiration or atypical infection.
   Sputum  returned with rare very atypical squamous cells concerning for
   squamous cell CA and with Eos.
   He went to the floor but returned to the MICU [**4-20**] after receiving
   fentanyl during IR for a line placement  Transferred back to ICU for
   BiPAP.  His MICU stay has been repeat bouts of hypercapnea requiring

   68 y/o M hx Crohns dz with esophageal involvement, numerous bowel
   resections and short gut syndrome with severe pulmonary disease
   including chronic aspiration, bronchiectasis, hx necrotizing
   pneumonia,  who initially presented to the MICU with severe
   malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infltrates and worsening hypoxia.
   Being tx for HAP but suspect a more chronic process such as boop,
   malignancy, chronic aspiration or atypical infection.  We adding
   antifungal therapy and if he does not improve and continues to worsen
   we will add emperic steroids.  Sputum  returned with rare very atypical
   squamous cells concerning for squamous cell CA and with Eos.  He went
   to the floor and was doing much better went to IR for a line placement
   and received 12.5 fent plus some percocets earlier and went into
   hypercarbic resp failure.  Transferred back to ICU for BiPaP.  Now with
   clotted AV fistula and is status post fem line for dialysis
   Hypercarbic respiratory failure and somnolence-suspect related to
   worsening respiratory reserve from volume overload.
   -Continue BiPaP
   -Dialysis to remove volume
   -Will call the wife to let her know he is not doing well.
   Severe malnutrition/hypoglycemia
   -Hold TPN until dialysis line in place and volume removed
   -D10 drip
   -Check LFTs
   Pulmonary infiltrates-Worsened in the setting of volume overload
   suspect chronic process and underlying COPD
   -Will repeat Cytology and Sputum Eosinophils
   - meropenem completed, Micofungin, will follow Beta glucan
   -Will consider steroids if + sputum eos + and if his x-rays start to
   worsen in the setting of decreased sputum production.
   He has difficulty with sputum expectoration and this is in large part
   related to his overall strength which is marginal
   ESRD
 Active discussion for access, surgery recommends temorary access.  He
   is clotted on the right.
   -Pending this am
   -Will discuss Ca and Phos with renal
   Crohn's
   - no active issues beyond nutrition
   Family: Wife is  very involved.
   -Will call her and let her know he is more sedated

   continues to decline, now hypotensive and hypothermic.  She wishes to
   make him comfort measures only at this time and withdraw aggressive
   therapy.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, numerous bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration leading to bronchiectasis, and a history of necrotizing pneumonia. The patient initially presented to the MICU with severe malnutrition, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and worsening hypoxia. He was treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and received empiric micafungin. However, there is suspicion of a more chronic process such as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), malignancy, chronic aspiration, or atypical infection.

The patient has been experiencing repeat bouts of hypercapnea requiring BiPAP. He also has a TPN line that is more erythematous, a right femoral line placed, and is more lethargic. His serum glucose level was initially 27-117 but later dropped to 80. The patient is currently on dialysis pending and has an allergy to dicloxacillin and mercaptopurine.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 C (98.1 F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 95/46 (58) mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's maximum temperature recorded over the last 24 hours is 7"

The patient is a 72-inch tall man admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has a history of allergies to dicloxacillin, rash; mercaptopurine, neutropenia; and is currently on multiple medications including morphine sulfate and lorazepam. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. His vital signs show a temperature of 36.3Â°C (97.4Â°F), heart rate of 79 bpm with a range of 75-95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/48 mmHg to 114/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with a range of 18-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on respiratory support with a face tent and has diminished breath sounds on the left anterior exam with a few inspiratory squeaks. Physical examination findings include cachexia, regular S1 and S2 heart sounds without murmurs or gallops, scaphoid abdomen that is nontender, warm palpable distal pulses, and encephalopathy with the patient not arousable to verbal stimuli or following commands. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and renal function. Other labs are within normal range.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe Crohn's disease and chronic necrotizing pneumonia. He was admitted due to malnutrition and worsening hypoxia, and is currently in the MICU. The patient is non-verbal, unable to provide history, and has encephalopathy. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/48 mmHg to 114/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on respiratory support with a face tent and receives medications such as morphine sulfate and lorazepam for comfort. His labs show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin and platelet count, high creatinine levels, and low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's condition is being managed with comfort measures only, and his disposition is uncertain. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure and dependence on respiratory support indicate a risk of further respiratory compromise.
2. Infection: The patient's chronic necrotizing pneumonia and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possibility of ongoing or recurrent infection.
3. Renal impairment: Elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, which may worsen over time.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's admission with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe Crohn's disease and chronic necrotizing pneumonia. He was admitted with malnutrition and transferred to the MICU for worsening hypoxia. The patient is currently unresponsive and not able to provide any history. He has a history of allergies to dicloxacillin and mercaptopurine, as well as neutropenia. The patient is on several medications including micafungin, meropenem, and vancomycin. He is also receiving morphine sulfate and lorazepam for comfort measures. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 91/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's lungs have diminished breath sounds on the left side with inspiratory squeaks. The abdominal examination reveals a scaphoid abdomen that is nontender. The patient has warm palpable distal pulses, and a central line in the right groin. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but other lab values indicate potential abnormalities in liver function and electrolyte imbalances.

","Summary:
The patient is a cachectic man in the ICU with a chief complaint of hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is unresponsive and unable to provide a history. The patient has a history of allergies to dicloxacillin and mercaptopurine. He has been receiving multiple antibiotics and sedatives for pain management. His vital signs show hypotension and tachypnea. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an oxygen saturation of 92%. His physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the left side and inspiratory squeaks. The patient has renal failure, chronic respiratory failure, malnutrition, and encephalopathy. His lab results indicate anemia, elevated liver enzymes, electrolyte imbalances, and low glucose levels. The patient's comfort care measures have been discussed, and his disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's compromised respiratory function and diminished breath sounds on the left side, there is a risk of pneumonia due to aspiration or poor ventilation.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): As the patient has been on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a common complication in critically ill patients.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and compromised nutritional status increase the risk of DVT in this patient.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and use of sedatives may increase the risk of stress ulcers, leading to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, numerous bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration leading to bronchiectasis, and a history of necrotizing pneumonia. He was transitioned to comfort measures only (CMO) and is currently pain-free with no distress. The patient is cachectic, lethargic, and comfortable with no acute respiratory distress. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's history of severe pulmonary disease, chronic aspiration, and bronchiectasis, there is a risk of further respiratory infections or exacerbation of existing conditions.
2. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of Crohn's disease, bowel resections, and short gut syndrome may lead to gastrointestinal issues such as malnutrition, bowel obstruction, or perforation.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's vital signs show hypotension (low blood pressure) which could indicate potential cardiovascular problems.
4. Infection-related complications: Considering the patient's immunocompromised state and history of necrotizing pneumonia, there is a risk of developing new infections or experiencing worsening of existing ones.
5. Psychological complications: The patient's DNR/DNI status and transition to CMO suggest end-of-life care, which may have emotional and psychological implications for both the patient and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, numerous bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease, chronic aspiration leading to bronchiectasis, and a history of necrotizing pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU with the main complaint of hypercapnea. The patient is cachetic, lethargic, unable to answer questions appropriately, tachycardic, and has decreased breath sounds on the left lung with scattered rales. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's severe pulmonary disease, chronic aspiration, and bronchiectasis, there is a high risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's tachycardia and cachexia put him at risk for cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state and history of necrotizing pneumonia, there is a risk of developing new infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and multiple bowel resections increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
5. Metabolic Complications: The patient's glycemic control may be challenging due to his short gut syndrome, which can lead to fluctuations in blood sugar"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with severe Crohn's disease and chronic necrotizing pneumonia. He was admitted with malnutrition and transferred to the MICU for worsening hypoxia. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 95/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is comfortable and lying in bed with a face tent on. His code status is comfort measures only.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that could arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and oxygen saturation is below normal. This could indicate respiratory distress or failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential hypotension. This can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs.
3. Infection: The patient has chronic necrotizing pneumonia, which increases the risk of further infections.
4. Malnutrition: The patient was admitted with malnutrition, which can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of complications.
5. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels suggest possible kidney dysfunction.
6. Liver dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT) suggest possible liver dysfunction.
7. Coagulopathy: The prolonged PT/PTT/INR indicate coagulopathy, which may increase the risk of bleeding.

The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 95/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's physical examination shows that he is comfortable, lying in bed with a face tent on. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including allergies to dicloxacillin and mercaptopurine, neutropenia, and a history of antibiotic use (micafungin, meropenem, vancomycin). The patient is currently receiving morphine sulfate and lorazepam infusions for comfort measures. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). There are also abnormalities in liver function tests (ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili), kidney function (creatinine/Cr), electrolyte levels (Na+/K+, Cl-, HCO3-), and blood glucose. Other lab values indicate prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR), as well as altered levels of calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), phosphate (PO4), and lactic acid. 

The patient's current assessment and plan include comfort measures only, with no signs of pain at the moment. The patient is being provided with analgesia and sedation through the use of morphine and lorazepam. Scopolamine patches have been applied for antiemetic effects. The patient's code status is comfort measures only, and he has been called out to the floor for further discussion regarding autopsy."

","The patient is comfortable this morning. The ICU fellow discussed possible autopsy with the wife, who declined. The family has hired a personal care attendant to be with the patient. 

The patient has allergies to dicloxacillin, which causes rash, and mercaptopurine, which causes neutropenia. 

The last doses of antibiotics were given as follows: Micafungin on 04/24 at 09:00 PM, Meropenem on 04/25 at 12:15 PM, and Vancomycin on 04/25 at 01:00 PM.

The patient is receiving infusions of Morphine Sulfate and Lorazepam (Ativan) as of 04/26 at 09:12 PM and 09:13 PM respectively.

There have been no changes to the patient's medical and family history, and the review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The vital signs are as follows: Heart rate (HR) is 110 bpm with a normal range of 85-111 bpm. Blood pressure (BP) is 95/55 mmHg with a normal range of 64/33-113/57 mmHg.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration leading to bronchiectasis, and a history of necrotizing pneumonia. He is currently experiencing hypercapnea. The patient is receiving various medications including morphine, lorazepam, scopolamine, and has been on different antibiotics. He has a tunneled (Hickman) line and a dialysis catheter. The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure, high heart rate, and low oxygen saturation. His laboratory results indicate low hemoglobin, elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, low glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has been in the ICU and his condition is described as death imminent. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and high respiratory rate indicate respiratory distress. Given his history of severe pulmonary disease, including chronic aspiration and bronchiectasis, there is a risk of respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and history of necrotizing pneumonia suggest an ongoing infection. This increases the risk of sepsis, especially considering his immunocompromised state due to multiple bowel resections and short gut syndrome.

3. Renal Dysfunction: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, esophageal involvement, multiple bowel resections, short gut syndrome, severe pulmonary disease including chronic aspiration leading to bronchiectasis, and a history of necrotizing pneumonia. The patient is currently experiencing hypercapnea and is in the ICU. The patient has been receiving various medications including morphine, lorazepam, scopolamine, and others. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 66/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient is on face tent oxygen delivery and has an ABG pending. Physical examination reveals that the patient is cachectic, lethargic, and comfortable with no acute respiratory distress. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function test results. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and oxygen saturation is low, indicating a compromised respiratory function. This could lead to respiratory failure if not adequately supported.

2. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count and abnormal liver function tests suggest the possibility of an infection"
