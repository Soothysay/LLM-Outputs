","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient has been experiencing repeated episodes of desaturation, with oxygen saturation levels reaching the high 80s. An arterial blood gas (ABG) test was conducted, and no signs of shortness of breath, nausea, or chest pain were observed. The patient feels tired but reports that their breathing is well.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, amoxicillin, and an unknown allergen. They have also had a reaction to Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), which caused throat swelling. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin on 08:30 PM on 2129-8-18 and Aztreonam at 02:00 AM on 2129-8-19.

The patient is receiving various infusions, including Dextrose 50% starting at 06:45 AM on 2129-8-19. They are also on other medications as part of their ICU treatment.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature range of 37.4°C to 36.9°C, heart rate between 83 and 101 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 125/65 mmHg to 80/56 mmHg, respiratory rate between 20 and 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's"

 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with
   elevated BNP, SOB and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR consistent with
   CHF exacerbation as well as fevers, leukocytosis and additional patchy
   infiltrates on CXR concerning for PNA. .
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: Productive sputum, fevers ,
   leukocytosis, cough and marked shortness of breath with desaturations
   to the 70s range on room air are all concerning for PNA. CXR shows
   bilateral edema with elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports an
   additional component of CHF exacerbation, likely prompted in setting of
   recent infection. Given her marked desaturations on room air and very
   high LDH, PCP is certainly in the differential here as well. Although
   she has perisistent elevated LDH levels in setting of her chronic
   pancreatitis. LDH can also be elevated in pulmonary infarction as well
   and patient has history of prior splenic vein thrombosis. Thus, PE is
   also on differential at this time.  Respiratory viral  culture:
   negative, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 9640**]: negative, legionella antigen: negative, HIV:
   negative
   .
   -continue on Vancomycin/Levaquin /Aztreonam
   -f/u sputum culture
   -STAT ABG
   -check urine legionella, check resp viral panel
   -continue on facemask ; wean FiO2 as tolerates
   .
   #Leukocytosis - WBC elevated to 14.3 with left shift. Likely etiology
   is PNA in setting of aforementioned symptoms of cough, fevers,
   productive sputum and dyspnea. Will also need to follow up urine
   culture as well given some small amount of WBCs & bacteria.
   .
   --continue Vancomycin, Levaquin, Aztreonam for CAP coverage
   --follow-up blood and urine cultures
   .
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea over past 2 days but denies LE edema,
   palpitations, or chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization
   and edema. She has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF
   exacerbation which was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.
   .
   --will give lasix IV tonight, monitor UOP
   --f/up TTE
   --low Na diet
   --continue to trend 2 total sets of cardiac enzymes
   --continue on beta blocker and HTN medications once BPs improve
   (holding now in setting of SBPs in low 100 range)
   .
   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Glucose in 60s
   in ED in setting of poor PO intake. Low blood glucose in AM. On 28 of
   Lantus at night and a sliding scale.
   .
   -QID fingersticks
   -continue on [**3-8**] basal glargine dose due to poor PO
   -continue on overlapping QID humalog SSI coverage PRN
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   .
   -pain control with PRN Percocet
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #.HTN - Appears well controlled now with SBPs in the low 100s range.
   --will hold amlodipine, atenolol and lisinopril to allow more room for
   diuresis.
   --continue to trend BPs
   .
   #.Anemia -Chronic in nature. Hct is 33.9 now and near usual baseline
   Hct in the 30-33 range.
   .
   --continue to trend Hcts
   --transfuse for Hct <21 or >7 point Hct drop
   --will check stool guiacs
   --add on iron studies
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.
   .
   #Tobacco use history - patient smoking 1PPD now.
   --will place on nicotine patch

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), chronic pancreatitis, hypertension (HTN), and longstanding anemia. She presents with elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), shortness of breath (SOB), diffuse pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, and fevers, leukocytosis, and patchy infiltrates on chest X-ray consistent with pneumonia (PNA).

The patient's respiratory symptoms, including cough, hypoxia, and desaturations in the 70s range on room air, along with the presence of productive sputum, suggest a possible pulmonary infection. The elevated BNP levels and findings of bilateral edema on chest X-ray also support the possibility of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. Additionally, the patient has a history of prior splenic vein thrombosis, which raises suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE) as well.

The patient is currently receiving treatment with vancomycin, levofloxacin (Levaquin), and aztreonam for coverage of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Blood and urine cultures have been ordered for follow-up. The patient is also on a facemask and FiO2 is being weaned as tolerated.

Other medical issues include chronic pancreatitis, poorly controlled IDDM, hypertension, and longstanding anemia. The patient is on insulin therapy and has a"

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with
   elevated BNP, SOB and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR consistent with
   CHF exacerbation as well as fevers, leukocytosis and additional patchy
   infiltrates on CXR concerning for PNA. .
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemic
   despite antibiotic and supportive therapy. CT of the chest shows
   ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and emphysematous changes.
   Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and sputum are most likely
   infectious (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP nondiagnostic, but unlikely given negative HIV).
   Other considerations for SOB include acute interstitial pneumonia,
   acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, crytogenic
   organizing pneumonia, as well as other interstitial pulmonary
   processes. CHF exacerbation also likely given elevated JVP and
   crackles. COPD exacerbation and PE less likely in this clinical
   picture. Since anemia also, consider tests for Wegeners and
   Goodpasture
   .
   -continue on Vancomycin (Day 2)/Levaquin (Day 2) /Aztreonam (Day 2)
   -vanc trough
   -f/u sputum culture
   -continue on facemask ; wean FiO2 as tolerates
   -If patient does not improve on therapy, consider dexamethasone for
   pulmonary interstitial disease.
   .
   #.Anemia
Has chronic anemia with baseline Hct: 30-33. Acute drop from
   31
24. Might represent hemorrhage into the lungs or possibly other body
   cavities.
   --guiaic stools
   --send hemolysis labs
   --send iron study labs
   --send type and screen
   --continue to trend Hcts
   --transfuse for Hct <21 or >7 point Hct drop
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea over past 2 days but denies LE edema,
   palpitations, or chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization
   and edema. She has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF
   exacerbation which was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.
   .
   --will give lasix IV today, monitor UOP
   --f/up TTE
   --low Na diet
   --continue on beta blocker and HTN medications once BPs improve
   (holding now in setting of SBPs in low 100 range)
   .
   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Low blood
   glucose in AM. On 28 of Lantus at night and a sliding scale.
   .
   -QID fingersticks
   -D/C Lantus. Just put patient on sliding scale.
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   .
   -pain control with PRN Percocet
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #.HTN - Appears well controlled now with SBPs in the low 100s range.
   --will hold amlodipine, atenolol and lisinopril to allow more room for
   diuresis.
   --continue to trend BPs
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.
   .
   #Tobacco use history - patient smoking 1PPD now.
   --will place on nicotine patch

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with
   elevated BNP, SOB and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR consistent with
   CHF exacerbation as well as fevers, leukocytosis and additional patchy
   infiltrates on CXR concerning for PNA. .
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemic
   despite antibiotic and supportive therapy. CT of the chest shows
   ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and emphysematous changes.
   Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and sputum are most likely
   infectious (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP nondiagnostic, but unlikely given negative HIV).
   Other considerations for SOB include acute interstitial pneumonia,
   acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, crytogenic
   organizing pneumonia, as well as other interstitial pulmonary
   processes. CHF exacerbation also likely given elevated JVP and
   crackles. COPD exacerbation and PE less likely in this clinical
   picture. Since anemia also, consider tests for Wegeners and
   Goodpasture
s. Sputum negative (poor sample).
   - f/u CXR
   -continue on Vancomycin (Day 2)/Levaquin (Day 2) /Aztreonam (Day 2)
   -vanc trough
   -f/u autoimmune labs
   -continue on facemask ; wean FiO2 as tolerates
   -If patient does not improve on therapy, consider dexamethasone for
   pulmonary interstitial disease.
   .
   #.Anemia
Has chronic anemia with baseline Hct: 30-33. Pt currently at
   baseline. Acute drop from 31
24 on [**8-19**] initially reported was LAB
   ERROR.
   --cont to follow daily labs
   .
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea over past 2 days but denies LE edema,
   palpitations, or chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization
   and edema. She has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF
   exacerbation which was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.  Responded
   well to Lasix 10 bolus yesterday.
   .
   --f/up TTE final read (only shows increased TR gradient)
   --low Na diet
   --holding home atenolol, amlodipine, lisinopril for low BPs
   .
   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Low blood
   glucose in AM. On 28 of Lantus at night and a sliding scale. FS have
   been well controlled below 100s.
   - consider decreased in SS?
   - ISS / QID fingersticks
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   -pain control with PRN Percocet
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #.HTN - Appears well controlled now with SBPs in the low 100s range.
   --will hold amlodipine, atenolol and lisinopril to allow more room for
   diuresis.
   --continue to trend BPs
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.
   .
   #Tobacco use history - patient smoking 1PPD now.
   --will place on nicotine patch

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo female with history of chronic pancreatitis and now admitted with
   hypoxemia and respiratory distress now with some improvement across the
   past 24 hours.  She still maintains significant A-a gradient hypoxemia
   and desaturations with exertion.
   1)Hypoxemia-The differential diagnosis for this is
   extensive
certainly
we have hypoxemic respiratory compromise secondary
   to diffuse interstitial lung disease with acute onset.-->
   PULMONARY EDEMA--Hydrostatic or non-hydorstatic is most likely source
   for significant changes over past 24 hours.  The notion of purely
   hydrostatic edema seems less likely.  There is certainly possible
   trigger of toxic inhalation, infection, idiopathic pneumonitis without
   clear source identified.
   PNEUMONIA-Possible and continued with Vanco/Levoflox/Aztreonam but this
   would be atypical
viral scan has been negative to date, no atypical
   bacteria identified, PCP in the setting of negative HIV is less likely.
   PNEUMONITIS--Aspriation possible, AIP, Hypersensitivity, toxic
   inhalation are possible.
   HEMORRHAGE less likely.
   -Would favor maintenance or even to negative fluid balance
   -Will continue with ABX
   -Will provide intubation if clinical worsening seen
   -Will need to consider bronchoscopy with BAL for possible PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) 9657**] have [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA, RF
   -Mycoplasma
Ig pending
   -PCP would be deserving of evaluation and would favor further sampling
   as possible with induced sputum being low yield and will trial empiric
   Rx and BAL if worsening
   -Will maintain even and negative fluid balance
   -Will hold on steroids with DIP perhaps most likely at this time and
   have initial improvement.
   -At this time risk of biopsy is excessive in the setting of some
   clinical improvement.

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PANCREATITIS, CHRONIC
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with
   elevated BNP, SOB and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR consistent with
   CHF exacerbation as well as fevers, leukocytosis and additional patchy
   infiltrates on CXR concerning for PNA. .
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemic
   despite antibiotic and supportive therapy. CT of the chest shows
   ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and emphysematous changes.
   Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and sputum are most likely
   infectious (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP nondiagnostic, but unlikely given negative HIV).
   Other considerations for SOB include acute interstitial pneumonia,
   acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, crytogenic
   organizing pneumonia, as well as other interstitial pulmonary processes
   such as DIP (the patient has been smoking for the last 36 yrs, and
   recently 2ppd). CHF exacerbation also likely given elevated JVP and
   crackles. COPD exacerbation and PE less likely in this clinical
   picture. Since anemia also, consider tests for Wegeners and
   Goodpasture
s, although acute HCT drop was spurrious lab value. Sputum
   negative (poor sample).
   - will send out for atypicals (mycoplasma, chlamydia)
   -continue on Vancomycin (Day 2) / Levaquin (Day 2) / Aztreonam (Day 2)
   -vanc trough
   -f/u autoimmune labs
   -continue on facemask ; wean FiO2 as tolerates
   -If patient does not improve on therapy, consider dexamethasone for
   pulmonary interstitial disease.
   .
   #.Anemia
Has chronic anemia with baseline Hct: 30-33. Pt currently at
   baseline. Acute drop from 31
24 on [**8-19**] initially reported was LAB
   ERROR.
   --cont to follow daily labs
   .
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea over past 2 days but denies LE edema,
   palpitations, or chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization
   and edema. She has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF
   exacerbation which was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.  Responded
   well to Lasix 10 bolus yesterday.
   .
   --f/up TTE final read (only shows increased TR gradient)
   --low Na diet
   --holding home atenolol, amlodipine, lisinopril for low BPs
   .
   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Low blood
   glucose in AM. On 28 of Lantus at night and a sliding scale. FS have
   been well controlled below 100s.
   - ISS / QID fingersticks
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   -pain control with PRN Percocet, fentanyl patch
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #.HTN - Appears well controlled now with SBPs in the low 100s range.
   BPs improving now.
   --will hold amlodipine, atenolol and lisinopril to allow more room for
   diuresis.
   --continue to trend BPs
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.
   .
   #Tobacco use history - patient smoking 1PPD now.

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PANCREATITIS, CHRONIC
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with SOB
   and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on CXR.
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemia,
   although appears better with treatment and supportive therapy. CT of
   the chest shows ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and
   emphysematous changes. Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and
   sputum are most likely inflammatory diseases such as diffuse
   interstitial pneumonitis (patient smoking for last 36 years and more
   recently 2ppd), acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic
   pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and crytogenic organizing
   pneumonia. In addition, she is currently being treated for infectious
   etiologies (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP nondiagnostic, but unlikely given negative HIV)..
   Although patient has crackles, edema and elevated JVP, CHF exacerbation
   is unlikely.  Sent tests for Wegeners and Goodpasture
s, although acute
   HCT drop was spurrious lab value. Sputum negative (poor sample).
   - will send out for atypicals (mycoplasma, chlamydia)
   -continue on Vancomycin (started [**8-18**]) / Levaquin (started [**8-18**]) /
   Aztreonam (started [**8-18**])
   -vanc trough
   -f/u autoimmune labs
   -continue on facemask ; wean FiO2 as tolerates
   -If patient does not improve on therapy, consider dexamethasone for
   pulmonary interstitial disease.
   -As an outpatient, the patient will have to have PFTs and Xrays to
   assess pulmonary function.
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea over past 2 days but denies LE edema,
   palpitations, or chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization
   and edema. She has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF
   exacerbation which was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.  Responded
   well to Lasix 10 bolus yesterday.
   --low Na diet
   --holding home atenolol, amlodipine, lisinopril for low BPs
   -Will continue to give lasix as needed

   --will hold amlodipine, atenolol and lisinopril to allow more room for
   diuresis.  Consider starting lisinopril.
   --continue to trend BPs

   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Low blood
   glucose in AM. On 28 of Lantus at night and a sliding scale.

   .
   #.Anemia
Has chronic anemia with baseline Hct: 30-33. Pt currently at
   baseline. Acute drop from 31
24 on [**8-19**] initially reported was LAB
   ERROR.
   --cont to follow daily labs
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   -pain control with PRN Percocet, fentanyl patch
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.

","The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of IDDM, chronic pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia. She presents with SOB and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on CXR. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient continues to be hypoxemic, although appears better with treatment and supportive therapy. This may indicate respiratory distress or dysfunction.

2. Inflammatory diseases: The clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and sputum production suggests possible inflammatory diseases such as diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Further diagnostic tests may be needed to confirm these conditions.

3. Infectious etiologies: The patient is currently being treated for bacterial (Streptococcus, excluding Legionella), GNR, viral (negative respiratory viral panel), fungal (no exposure history), and opportunistic infections (PCP nondiagnostic, but unlikely given negative HIV). It is important to monitor for any signs of infection and adjust treatment accordingly.

4. CHF exacerbation: Although the patient has crackles, edema, and elevated JVP, CHF exacerbation is unlikely. However, the elevated BNP levels and prominent LVH on EKG suggest diastolic dysfunction, which could potentially worsen over time. Close monitoring of cardiac function is necessary.

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a medical history of chronic pancreatitis and chronic pneumonia. He presented to the ICU with respiratory distress and hypoxia. He has been placed on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to worsening respiratory status.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 145/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.6 K/uL. The hemoglobin level is 9.3 g/dL, indicating anemia. The platelet count is 244 K/uL, which is within the normal range. Renal function tests show a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, which is slightly elevated. Liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including famotidine, heparin sodium, and aztreonam. He has also received vancomycin in the past.

The patient's recent imaging shows multiple infiltrates in the lower lobes of both lungs. A CT scan of the abdomen reveals pancreatic necrosis.

The patient's current condition is stable, but there are potential complications that could arise. These include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, deep vein"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with
   elevated BNP, SOB and diffuse pulmonary edema on CXR consistent with
   CHF exacerbation as well as fevers, leukocytosis and additional patchy
   infiltrates on CXR concerning for PNA. .
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemic
   despite antibiotic and supportive therapy. CT of the chest shows
   ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and emphysematous changes.
   Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and sputum are most likely
   infectious (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP nondiagnostic, but unlikely given negative HIV).
   Other considerations for SOB include acute interstitial pneumonia,
   acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, crytogenic
   organizing pneumonia, as well as other interstitial pulmonary processes
   such as DIP (the patient has been smoking for the last 36 yrs, and
   recently 2ppd). CHF exacerbation also likely given elevated JVP and
   crackles. COPD exacerbation and PE less likely in this clinical
   picture. Since anemia also, consider tests for Wegeners and
   Goodpasture
s, although acute HCT drop was spurrious lab value. Sputum
   negative (poor sample).
   - will send out for atypicals (mycoplasma, chlamydia)
   -continue on Vancomycin (Day 2) / Levaquin (Day 2) / Aztreonam (Day 2)
   -vanc trough
   -f/u autoimmune labs
   -continue on facemask ; wean FiO2 as tolerates
   -If patient does not improve on therapy, consider dexamethasone for
   pulmonary interstitial disease.
   .
   #.Anemia
Has chronic anemia with baseline Hct: 30-33. Pt currently at
   baseline. Acute drop from 31
24 on [**8-19**] initially reported was LAB
   ERROR.
   --cont to follow daily labs
   .
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea over past 2 days but denies LE edema,
   palpitations, or chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization
   and edema. She has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF
   exacerbation which was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.  Responded
   well to Lasix 10 bolus yesterday.
   .
   --f/up TTE final read (only shows increased TR gradient)
   --low Na diet
   --holding home atenolol, amlodipine, lisinopril for low BPs
   .
   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Low blood
   glucose in AM. On 28 of Lantus at night and a sliding scale. FS have
   been well controlled below 100s.
   - ISS / QID fingersticks
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   -pain control with PRN Percocet, fentanyl patch
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #.HTN - Appears well controlled now with SBPs in the low 100s range.
   BPs improving now.
   --will hold amlodipine, atenolol and lisinopril to allow more room for
   diuresis.
   --continue to trend BPs
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.
   .
   #Tobacco use history - patient smoking 1PPD now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 511] is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of IDDM, chronic pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to an exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) and suspected pneumonia (PNA). The patient's clinical picture suggests an infectious cause, possibly bacterial, viral, fungal, or opportunistic. Other considerations include acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and other interstitial pulmonary processes. The patient's shortness of breath and hypoxia have not improved despite antibiotic and supportive therapy. A CT scan of the chest shows ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and emphysematous changes. Her CHF exacerbation was likely triggered by a new PNA/URI. The patient responded well to Lasix 10 bolus yesterday. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious complications: Given the suspected PNA, there is a risk of worsening infection and sepsis.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's hypoxemia and persistent shortness of breath indicate potential respiratory distress or failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's CHF exacerbation may lead to further cardiac dysfunction and possible cardiogenic shock.
4. Renal complications: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function,"

   48 yo female with history of chronic pancreatitis and now admitted with
   diffuse interstitial lung disease of acute onset presenting as
   significant hypoxemia and now with reasonable response to ABX, mild
   negative fluid balance and supplemental oxygen.  The differential

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of chronic pancreatitis, currently admitted for diffuse interstitial lung disease of acute onset. She presents with significant hypoxemia but shows a reasonable response to antibiotics (ABX), mild negative fluid balance, and supplemental oxygen. The differential diagnosis includes DIP/NSIP versus atypical/viral infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's significant hypoxemia can be attributed to the interstitial pneumonitis. Continued monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent further deterioration in oxygen levels.
2. Fluid Balance: Although the patient has a mild negative fluid balance, it is essential to closely monitor her fluid intake and output to prevent dehydration or fluid overload.
3. Smoking Cessation: The patient has agreed to stopping smoking, which is crucial for her overall health and recovery. Supportive measures should be implemented to aid in smoking cessation.
4. Biopsy: Although the patient has shown clinical improvement, a biopsy may still be considered to determine the exact cause of the interstitial lung disease and guide further management.
5. Radiographic Resolution: The patient will need pulmonary follow-up to monitor the resolution of radiographic changes associated with the interstitial lung disease.
6. Chronic Pancreatitis: The patient's history of chronic pancreatitis should be managed concurrently to prevent exacerbation of symptoms and complications related to pancreatic dysfunction."

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PANCREATITIS, CHRONIC
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with SOB
   and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on CXR.
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemia,
   although appears better with treatment and supportive therapy. CT of
   the chest shows ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and
   emphysematous changes. Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and
   sputum are most likely inflammatory diseases such as diffuse
   interstitial pneumonitis (patient smoking for last 36 years and more
   recently 2ppd), acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic
   pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and crytogenic organizing
   pneumonia. In addition, she is currently being treated for infectious
   etiologies (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 365**]). Although patient has crackles, edema and
   elevated JVP, CHF exacerbation is unlikely.  Sent tests for Wegeners
   and Goodpasture
s, although acute HCT drop was spurrious lab value.
   Sputum negative (poor sample).
   - will f/u serologies for atypicals (mycoplasma, chlamydia)
   -continue on Vancomycin (started [**8-18**]) / Levaquin (started [**8-18**]) /
   Aztreonam (started [**8-18**])
   -vanc trough
   -f/u autoimmune labs
   -continue on facemask ; wean FiO2 as tolerates
   -If patient does not improve on therapy, consider dexamethasone for
   pulmonary interstitial disease.
   -As an outpatient, the patient will have to have PFTs and Xrays to
   assess pulmonary function.
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea, but denies LE edema, palpitations, or
   chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization and edema. She
   has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF exacerbation which
   was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.  Responded well to Lasix 10 bolus
   yesterday.
   --low Na diet
   --currently only on lisinopril for BP
   -Will continue to give lasix as needed
   .
   #HTN
 sbp: 140-150
   --will hold amlodipine, atenolol
   -- re-started lisinopril on [**8-21**].
   --continue to trend BPs
   .
   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Low blood
   glucose in AM. On 28 of Lantus at night and a sliding scale.
   - ISS and Lantus at night / QID fingersticks
   .
   #.Anemia
Has chronic anemia with baseline Hct: 30-33. Pt currently at
   baseline. Acute drop from 31
24 on [**8-19**] initially reported was LAB
   ERROR.
   --cont to follow daily labs
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   -pain control with PRN Percocet, fentanyl patch
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.
   .
   #Tobacco use history - patient smoking 1PPD now.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of IDDM, chronic pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia. She presents with shortness of breath and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on CXR. The patient is currently being treated for infectious etiologies, including bacterial, viral, fungal, and opportunistic infections. The differential diagnosis includes diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema indicate a risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory support may be necessary.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels suggest impaired renal function. This could be due to various factors such as sepsis, hypotension, or medications.

3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of HTN and an elevated BNP level, indicating possible cardiac involvement. There is a risk for acute heart failure exacerbation, diastolic dysfunction, or arrhythmias.

4. Infection: The patient is being treated for multiple infectious etiologies, including bacterial, viral, fungal, and opportunistic infections. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential to identify any signs of worsening infection.

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PANCREATITIS, CHRONIC
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with SOB
   and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on CXR.
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemia,
   although appears better with treatment and supportive therapy. CT of
   the chest shows ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and
   emphysematous changes. Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and
   sputum are most likely inflammatory diseases such as diffuse
   interstitial pneumonitis (patient smoking for last 36 years and more
   recently 2ppd), acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic
   pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and crytogenic organizing
   pneumonia. In addition, she is currently being treated for infectious
   etiologies (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 365**]). Although patient has crackles, edema and
   elevated JVP, CHF exacerbation is unlikely.  Sent tests for Wegeners
   and Goodpasture
s, although acute HCT drop was spurrious lab value.
   Sputum negative (poor sample).  Currently on 4L NC.
   - will f/u serologies for atypicals (mycoplasma, chlamydia)
   -continue on Vancomycin (started [**8-18**]) / Levaquin (started [**8-18**]) /
   Aztreonam (started [**8-18**])
   -vanc trough
   -f/u autoimmune labs
   -If patient does not improve on therapy, consider dexamethasone for
   pulmonary interstitial disease.
   -As an outpatient, the patient will have to have PFTs and Xrays to
   assess pulmonary function.
   #HTN
 sbp: 160-180
   --will re-start amlodipine today
   -- re-started lisinopril on [**8-21**].
   --continue to trend BPs
   --will dc a-line today
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea, but denies LE edema, palpitations, or
   chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization and edema. She
   has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF exacerbation which
   was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.  Responded well to Lasix 10 bolus
   yesterday.
   --low Na diet
   --currently only on lisinopril for BP
   -Will continue to give lasix as needed

   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Low blood
   glucose in AM. On 28 of Lantus at night and a sliding scale.

   #.Anemia
Has chronic anemia with baseline Hct: 30-33. Pt currently at
   baseline. Acute drop from 31
24 on [**8-19**] initially reported was LAB
   ERROR.
   --cont to follow daily labs
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   -pain control with PRN Percocet, fentanyl patch
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.

","The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of IDDM, chronic pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia. She presents with shortness of breath and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on chest X-ray. The patient's clinical picture is suggestive of various inflammatory diseases such as diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O PANCREATITIS, CHRONIC
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Ms. [**Known lastname 511**] is a 48-year-old female with history of IDDM, chronic
   pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia who presents now with SOB
   and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on CXR.
   ..
   #.Shortness of breath / hypoxia: The patient continues to be hypoxemia,
   although appears better with treatment and supportive therapy. CT of
   the chest shows ground-glass opacities, air bronchograms, and
   emphysematous changes. Her clinical picture of hypoxemia, SOB, and
   sputum are most likely inflammatory diseases such as diffuse
   interstitial pneumonitis (patient smoking for last 36 years and more
   recently 2ppd), acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic
   pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and crytogenic organizing
   pneumonia. In addition, she is currently being treated for infectious
   etiologies (bacterial-Streptococcus (legionella negative), GNR vs.
   viral (negative respiratory viral) vs. fungal (no exposure history) vs.
   opportunistic (PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 365**]). Although patient has crackles, edema and
   elevated JVP, CHF exacerbation is unlikely.  Sent tests for Wegeners
   and Goodpasture
s, although acute HCT drop was spurrious lab value.
   Sputum negative (poor sample).  Currently on 4L NC.
   - will f/u serologies for atypicals (mycoplasma, chlamydia)
   -continue on Vancomycin (started [**8-18**]) / Levaquin (started [**8-18**]) /
   Aztreonam (started [**8-18**])
   -vanc trough
   -f/u autoimmune labs
   -If patient does not improve on therapy, consider dexamethasone for
   pulmonary interstitial disease.
   -As an outpatient, the patient will have to have PFTs and Xrays to
   assess pulmonary function.
   #HTN
 sbp: 160-180
   --will re-start amlodipine today
   -- re-started lisinopril on [**8-21**].
   --continue to trend BPs
   --will dc a-line today
   #CHF - EKG with prominent LVH. Longstanding HTN makes diastolic
   dysfunction quite likely.  Last TTE in [**2127**] showed LVEF >55% but may
   have worsened systolic function and/or additional diastolic CHF since
   that time. She reports orthopnea, but denies LE edema, palpitations, or
   chest pain. CEs negative in ED. CXR with cephalization and edema. She
   has elevated BNP in 4k range which also supports CHF exacerbation which
   was likely triggered by new PNA/ URI.  Responded well to Lasix 10 bolus
   yesterday.
   --low Na diet
   --currently only on lisinopril for BP
   -Will continue to give lasix as needed
   .

   # IDDM- She has history of insulin dependent diabetes. Low blood
   glucose in AM. On 28 of Lantus at night and a sliding scale.
   - ISS and Lantus at night / QID fingersticks

   #.Anemia
Has chronic anemia with baseline Hct: 30-33. Pt currently at
   baseline. Acute drop from 31
24 on [**8-19**] initially reported was LAB
   ERROR.
   --cont to follow daily labs
   .
   #. Chronic pancreatitis- Per multiple OMR GI notes she is noted to have
   idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of unclear etiology after mutiple
   studies. She is seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4691**]. At current time her chronic
   abdominal pain is near usual baseline and she has normal lipase level.
   -pain control with PRN Percocet, fentanyl patch
   -continue on usual supplemental Amylase-Lipase-Protease w/meals
   .
   #Depression- Slightly flattened affect on exam. She denies any current
   suicidal ideation/homicidal ideation. Per OMR notes, long history of
   depressive symptoms. Stable at current time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of IDDM, chronic pancreatitis, HTN, and longstanding anemia. She presents with shortness of breath and diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema on CXR. The patient is currently being treated for infectious etiologies, including bacterial, viral, fungal, and opportunistic infections. She has also been tested for Wegeners and Goodpasture syndrome. The patient's symptoms, including hypoxemia, SOB, and sputum production, suggest inflammatory diseases such as diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, acute interstitial pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reaction, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. The patient has a history of smoking for the past 36 years.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient continues to be hypoxemic despite treatment and supportive therapy. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential organ damage.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The ground-glass opacities and air bronchograms seen on CT chest suggest the possibility of ARDS, which can result in severe respiratory failure and mortality if not managed appropriately.
3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient's long-standing smoking history puts her at risk for developing COPD, which can cause chronic respiratory symptoms and decreased lung function.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient has evidence of LVH on EKG and"
