   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetesI
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, DKA and NSTEMI.
   1. Pneumonia:  Patient with a history of aspiration pneumonia has
   witnessed aspiration event at rehab facility now with worsening
   hypoxia, fever, elevated WBC, left sided infiltrate on imaging
   consistent with pneumonia.  Pt was treated for prior PNA with
   Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].  Sputum growing gram positive
   cocci.
   - NPO with NGT
   - abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover aspiration (pending speciation
   of sputum, blood cx)
   - f/u sputum culture speciation and sensitivity
   - consider long term feeding with g-tube, will discuss with family and
   address GOC
   - hold on steroids for now but will continue home dose of prednisone
   4mg PO qday
   - hold on PPI given current pneumonia
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema
   - Check vanco trough before next dose
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes still rising this AM
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - TTE
   - EKG this AM
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours
   - add on lipid panel from admission labs
   - change pravastatin to atorvastatin pending echo results
   - continue aspirin 325mg daily
   - echocardiogram
   .
   3.Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection, ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure of
   anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   4. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, now with acute renal
   failure with creatinine of 2.2.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with
   dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.  Improved
   somewhat since admission following IVF.
   - renally dose medication
   - hold nephrotoxic medication (enalapril)
   - renal transplant recs
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   5.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - 125cc free water hr/24hr for correction (started at 3AM)
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex as above
   .
   6. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   7. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro, last day to be [**5-20**]
   - broad spectrum abx as above
   - f/u urine cultures
   .

","The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented after a witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

1. Pneumonia: The patient has worsening hypoxia, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and left-sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with pneumonia. He was previously treated for aspiration pneumonia with cefepime and azithromycin, but now his sputum is growing gram-positive cocci.

- Plan: NPO with nasogastric tube, antibiotics with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl to cover aspiration, follow-up sputum culture speciation and sensitivity, consider long-term feeding with gastrostomy tube, discuss with family and address Goals of Care (GOC), hold on steroids for now, continue home dose of prednisone 4mg PO qday, hold on proton pump inhibitor given current pneumonia, bumex for pulmonary edema, check vancomycin trough before next dose.

2. NSTEMI: The patient has new T-wave inversions in the anterior leads and elevated cardiac biomarkers. Cardiac enzymes are still rising this morning.

- Plan: Follow-up cardiac biomarkers, transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), EKG this morning, heparin gtt for 48 hours,"

","The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type 1 diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia who presented after a witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis), and NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction). He is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

During his stay in the ICU, the patient has undergone several procedures and treatments. On 05/20/2182, he was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. A tracheostomy was performed, and bronchoscopy was done to address any potential airway obstructions. A nasal swab and sputum culture were also obtained to identify the causative organisms of his pneumonia. A PICC line was inserted for central venous access.

The patient's medical condition has been complicated by several issues. He developed a fever of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit and showed signs of hypotension with blood pressure readings ranging from 98/49 mmHg to 60/42 mmHg. His heart rate was stable, but there were T-wave inversions observed on the EKG, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. Troponin levels increased from 0.62 to 1.47, suggesting myocardial injury. As a result, he was started on heparin, aspirin, and a statin to manage his coronary artery disease.

Additionally, the patient was diagnosed with"

   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes still rising this AM
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - TTE
   - EKG this AM
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours
   - add on lipid panel from admission labs
   - change pravastatin to atorvastatin
   - continue aspirin 325mg daily
   .
   3.Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection, ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure of
   anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs

   failure with creatinine of 2.2.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with
   dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.  Improved
   somewhat since admission following IVF.
   - renally dose medication
   - hold nephrotoxic medication (enalapril)
   - renal transplant recs
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF
   .
   5.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - 125cc free water hr/24hr for correction (started at 3AM)
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   .
   6. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   7. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro, last day to be [**5-20**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, type 1 diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
- He presented with pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- The patient underwent invasive ventilation, tracheostomy, bronchoscopy, and placement of a PICC line.
- His fever is being managed, and he has received antibiotics for pneumonia and DKA.
- Troponin levels have increased, indicating ongoing cardiac ischemia.
- The patient's condition has improved with IV fluids and insulin therapy for DKA.
- He has hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and hyperglycemia.
- The patient is immunosuppressed due to a previous renal transplant.
- He also has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and witnessed aspiration event, resulting in worsening hypoxia, fever, elevated WBC, and left-sided infiltrate on imaging. This indicates the possibility of pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotics should be continued, and sputum culture should be monitored for sensitivity.

2. NSTEMI: The patient shows new T-wave inversions in anterior leads and elevated cardiac biomarkers, indicating ongoing cardiac ischemia. Further cardiac biomarkers should be followed up, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (T"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, DKA, and NSTEMI.
   1. Pneumonia:  Patient with a history of aspiration pneumonia has
   witnessed aspiration event at rehab facility now with worsening
   hypoxia, fever, elevated WBC, left sided infiltrate on imaging
   consistent with pneumonia.  Pt was treated for prior PNA with
   Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].  Sputum growing gram positive
   cocci.
   - NPO with NGT (appears to be post-pyloric)
   - abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover aspiration
   - f/u sputum culture speciation and sensitivity
   - consider long term feeding with g-tube, will discuss with family and
   address GOC
   - hold on steroids for now but will continue home dose of prednisone
   4mg PO qday
   - hold on PPI given current pneumonia
   - consult nutrition for tube feed recommendations
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes still rising this AM
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - TTE today
   - EKG this AM
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours (to end [**2182-5-22**] @ 1900)
   - add on lipid panel from admission labs
   - change pravastatin to atorvastatin
   - continue aspirin 325mg daily
   .
   3.Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection, ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure of
   anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine
   - continue insulin gtt while receiving D5W
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   4. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, now with acute renal
   failure with creatinine of 2.2.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with
   dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.  Improved
   somewhat since admission following IVF.
   - renally dose medication
   - hold nephrotoxic medication (enalapril)
   - renal transplant recs
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF @ 100cc D5W
   - Xray with pulmonary edema; will try Bumex today and monitor UOP
   closely.
   .
   5. Bacteremia
 GPC in cocci from admission cultures.
   - continue vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u speciation/sensitivities.
   - attempt PIVs.  If possible, will remove PICC line.
   - consider ID consult after speciation
   .
   5.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - D5W @ 100 cc/hr
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   .
   6. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   7. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro, last day to be [**5-20**]
   - broad spectrum abx as above
   - f/u urine cultures

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, type 1 diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presents after a witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has worsening hypoxia, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and a left-sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with pneumonia. He was previously treated for aspiration pneumonia with cefepime and azithromycin, but now has a sputum culture growing gram-positive cocci. The plan is to continue NPO with a post-pyloric nasogastric tube, administer antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl), follow-up with sputum culture speciation and sensitivity, consider long-term feeding with a gastrostomy tube, and address goals of care.

2. NSTEMI: The patient has new T-wave inversions anteriorly and elevated cardiac biomarkers, indicating a possible heart attack. The plan includes following up with cardiac biomarkers, conducting a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), monitoring an electrocardiogram (EKG), starting heparin therapy for 48 hours, adding a lipid panel from admission labs, changing pravastatin to atorvastatin, continuing"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented after a witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's condition has been complex, with multiple medical complications requiring ongoing management.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and had a witnessed aspiration event. He is experiencing worsening hypoxia, fever, elevated WBC, and left-sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with pneumonia. He was treated with antibiotics, but sputum culture results are pending. Further management includes NPO with NGT, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and consideration for long-term feeding with a g-tube.
2. NSTEMI: The patient shows new T-wave inversions anteriorly and elevated cardiac biomarkers, indicating a heart attack. Cardiac enzymes are trending down, but a formal cardiology consult is required. Management includes heparin gtt, aspirin, lipid panel, and an echocardiogram.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient had hyperglycemia, anion gap in the twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission. This was likely caused by infection or ischemia. The patient was treated with insulin gtt, which successfully closed the anion gap and returned his blood sugar to normal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, type 1 diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's current condition includes worsening hypoxia, fever, elevated white blood cell count, left-sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with pneumonia, new T-wave inversions, elevated cardiac biomarkers, and decreased left ventricular systolic function on echocardiogram. The patient is being treated for various conditions including pneumonia, NSTEMI, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and hyperglycemia. He is receiving multiple medications and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has signs of worsening hypoxia, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and left-sided infiltrate on imaging. This suggests a possible worsening of the pneumonia or development of new pneumonia. Monitoring for further respiratory symptoms and considering appropriate antibiotic therapy based on culture results would be important.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1-1.3, but it has now increased to 2.2. This indicates acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function, fluid balance, and electrolyte levels is crucial. Adjustments in medication dosages and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents may be necessary.

   hypokinesis previously).
   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetesI
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, DKA and NSTEMI.
   #. Hypoxia:  Patient with a history of aspiration pneumonia has
   witnessed aspiration event at rehab facility now with worsening
   hypoxia, fever, elevated WBC, left sided infiltrate on imaging
   consistent with pneumonia vs atelectasis.  Pt was treated for prior PNA
   with Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].  Sputum growing gram
   positive cocci.
   - NPO with NGT
   -  initially treated with abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover
   aspiration pending speciation of sputum, blood cx; (day 1 = [**5-20**])
   - f/u sputum culture speciation and sensitivity
   - consider long term feeding with g-tube, will discuss with family and
   address GOC
   - hold on steroids for now but will continue home dose of prednisone
   4mg PO qday
   - hold on PPI given current pneumonia
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema
   - hold antibiotics for now as this likely did not represent a true
   pneumonia
   .
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - TTE with new abnormality but not consistent with changes on EKG
   - Call for formal cardiology consult
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours (to end this afternoon)
   - add on lipid panel from admission labs
   - change pravastatin to atorvastatin pending echo results
   - continue aspirin 325mg daily
   - change lopressor to 12.5mg PO BID
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles
   - follow up culture results; ensure recent blood cultures (peripherals)
   - continue current broad antibiotics
   - remove PICC line, sent tip for culture.  Request new PICC placement
   for tomorrow.
   .
   #.Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection, ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure of
   anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, now with acute renal
   failure to Cr 2.2.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with dehydration due to
   osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.  Improved since admission
   following IVF.
   - renally dose medication
   - touch base with renal regarding nephrotoxic medication (enalapril)
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   5.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - Renal recs: transition to free water boluses by tube feed as
   tolerated
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex as above
   .
   6. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   7. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro, last day to be [**5-20**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications that require attention. 

1. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and recently experienced another aspiration event. They are now showing signs of worsening hypoxia, fever, elevated WBC, and a left-sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with pneumonia or atelectasis. The patient was initially treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but considering the presence of gram-positive cocci in the sputum culture, the antibiotic regimen may need to be adjusted accordingly.

2. NSTEMI: The patient exhibits new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated cardiac biomarkers, indicating possible myocardial injury. Cardiac enzymes are now trending down. The patient has been on heparin gtt for 48 hours and will require further evaluation with a formal cardiology consult. It is important to monitor cardiac biomarkers and consider a TTE to assess any new abnormalities.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 1-1.3, but now they have acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.2. The FeNa is 0.2, suggesting pre-renal azotemia due to dehydration secondary to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA. Renal function has improved since admission following IVF. Renal dosing of medications should be considered, and nephrotoxic medication interactions should be monitored.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of anoxic brain injury, type 1 diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presented with a witnessed aspiration event, pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and now presents with worsening hypoxia, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and a left-sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with pneumonia. Antibiotics have been started, and further sputum culture speciation and sensitivity are pending.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has new T-wave inversions and elevated cardiac biomarkers, indicating ongoing cardiac injury. Cardiac enzymes are still rising, suggesting an ongoing myocardial ischemia. Heparin has been initiated, and additional tests such as an echocardiogram and lipid panel will be done.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient had hyperglycemia, anion gap in the twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission. Insulin therapy was started, leading to closure of the anion gap and normalization of blood glucose levels.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1-1.3, but it has now risen to 2.2, indicating acute renal failure. The fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 0.2, suggesting pre-renal azotemia secondary to dehydration from osmotic diuresis in DKA. Renal function is being monitored, and medications are being adjusted accordingly.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, likely due to decreased access to free water. A free water deficit of 3L has been calculated, and the patient is receiving 125cc of free water per hour for correction.
6. Immunosuppression: The patient is a post-cadaveric renal transplant recipient and is on immunosuppressive therapy including tacrolimus and prednisone.
7. Recurrent UTI: The patient had a urinary tract infection treated with ciprofloxacin, but urine cultures are still pending for further evaluation.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's progress note, and potential medical complications may arise based on the information provided."

 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   PNA:  Sputum cx. with no significant growth.  Unclear if he had a PNA.
   Respiratory failure:  More likely to be due to pulmonary edema in
   setting of acute cardiac event.  Try SBT and TC.
   NSTEMI:  EF is down with new WMA.  might benefit from ACE, but will
   touch base with renal. Start lopressor 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
   Will have cardiology see, to assess whether he should have cath.
   GPCs:  coag negative in PIC line.  Will remove PIC line once heparin
   infusion is completed.  However doubt that this is a line infection.
   DKA:  AG closed.  Continue home regimen and TFs.
   hypernatremia: continue free water bolus.

   - consider long term feeding with g-tube, will discuss with family and
   address GOC
   - hold on steroids for now but will continue home dose of prednisone
   4mg PO qday
   - hold on PPI given current pneumonia
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema
   - hold antibiotics for now as this likely did not represent a true
   pneumonia

","The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presents after a witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's current condition includes worsening hypoxia, fever, elevated white blood cell count, and left-sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with pneumonia or atelectasis. He has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. The sputum culture growing gram-positive cocci is pending.

The patient also has NSTEMI with new T-wave inversions in the anterior leads and elevated cardiac biomarkers. His cardiac enzymes are trending down, and he has abnormal findings on a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). A formal cardiology consult has been called.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1-1.3, now elevated to 2.2. His fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 0.2, suggesting pre-renal azotemia likely due to dehydration from osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA. His free water deficit is calculated at 3L.

The patient is also hypernatremic, likely due to decreased access to free water. He has been transitioned to free water boluses by tube feed as tolerated, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with history of multiple strokes, type one diabetesI
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   witnessed aspiration event with DKA and NSTEMI.
   #. Hypoxia: Hypoxia felt most likely due to acute aspiration event (but
   without development of aspiration pneumonia) and/or from volume
   overload in setting of CHF flare (c/w CXR findings) in setting of
   NSTEMI (though pt not volume overloaded on exam).
   Patient does have a history of aspiration pneumonia with possible
   aspiration event at rehab facility and mild fever and elevated WBC on
   presentation (both resolved now and may be explained by UTI), left
   sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with atelectasis.  Pt was
   treated for prior PNA with Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].
   Sputum growing gram positive cocci but culture with sparse commensals
   only.
   -  Initially treated with abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover
   aspiration pending speciation of sputum ([**Date range (1) 12158**]); discontinued as
   felt presentation more c/w fluid overload vs pneumonia
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema for goal even I/Os today (dose PRN)
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down but troponin
   slightly up today [**5-23**]
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - Daily EKG
   - TTE with new abnormality in inferolateral wall
   - Appreciate cardiology recs: will accept pt for cath on Monday and
   transfer of pt to service; team requests description of pt
s anatomy
   s/p CABG
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours (ended [**5-22**])
   - Follow-up lipid panel from admission labs
   - Continue lopressor, ASA, enalapril, statin
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles: coag-negative staph; most likely contaminant vs
   PICC colonization. PICC pulled [**5-22**].
   - follow up culture results (repeat blood cultures from [**5-22**] and PICC
   tip culture)
   - Request new PICC placement today?
   .
   # Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection vs ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure
   of anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs but
   episode of hypoglycemia in AM [**5-23**]: will decrease back to 25 tonight
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, presented with acute
   renal failure to Cr 2.2, now resolving.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal
   with dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.
   - renally dose medication
   - Enalapril restarted [**5-22**] (discussed with renal); will hold today in
   order to allow for BB (pressures drop to 80s with both meds)
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
   - trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - Renal recs: transition to free water boluses by tube feed as
   tolerated: pt receiving 250 cc q6h, but remains hypernatremic. Plan to
   increase to 250 cc q4h.
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex as above
   .
   #. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone, cellcept
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   #. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro, last day to be [**5-20**]. Now with E.
   Coli UTI.
   - Cefepime 1gm IV q 24 hours day 1 = [**5-20**], 7 day course to end [**5-27**]
   - Confirm foley was replaced
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, TFs (novasource with free water flushes)

   62 year old man with history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetesI
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, DKA and NSTEMI.
   #. Hypoxia:  Patient with a history of aspiration pneumonia had
   possible aspiration event at rehab facility now with worsening hypoxia,
   mild fever, elevated WBC, left sided infiltrate on imaging consistent
   with pneumonia vs atelectasis.  Pt was treated for prior PNA with
   Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].  Sputum growing gram positive
   cocci but culture with sparse commensals only.  Hypoxia felt most
   likely due to acute aspiration event without pneumonia or volume
   overload in setting of CHF flare due to CXR findings, though pt not
   volume overloaded on exam.
   - NPO with NGT
   -  Initially treated with abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover
   aspiration pending speciation of sputum ([**Date range (1) 12158**]); discontinued as
   felt presentation more c/w fluid overload vs pneumonia

   address GOC
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema for goal even I/Os today
   .
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - TTE with new abnormality in inferolateral wall
   - Appreciate cardiology recs: will accept pt for cath on Monday and
   transfer of pt to service
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours (ended [**5-22**])
   - Follow-up lipid panel from admission labs
   - Continue lopressor, ASA, enalapril, statin
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles: coag-negative staph; most likely contaminant vs
   PICC colonization. PICC pulled [**5-22**].
   - follow up culture results (including repeat blood cultures from [**5-22**]
   and PICC tip culture)
   - Request new PICC placement today?
   .
   # Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection vs ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure
   of anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs but
   episode of hypoglycemia in AM [**5-23**]: will decrease back to 25 tonight
   - continue home sliding scale

   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, presented with acute
   renal failure to Cr 2.2, now resolving.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal
   with dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.
   - renally dose medication
   - Enalapril restarted [**5-22**] (discussed with renal)
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - Renal recs: transition to free water boluses by tube feed as
   tolerated: pt receiving 250 cc q4h, but remains hypernatremic. Plan to
   increase to 250 cc q3h.
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex as above
   .
   #. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone, cellcept
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   #. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro, last day to be [**5-20**]. Now with E.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presents after a witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's current medical conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has worsening hypoxia, mild fever, elevated white blood cell count, and left-sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with pneumonia or atelectasis. The hypoxia is believed to be due to an acute aspiration event rather than pneumonia or fluid overload.

2. NSTEMI: The patient has new T-wave inversions in the anterior leads and elevated cardiac biomarkers, indicating myocardial injury. Cardiac enzymes are now trending down. The patient will be accepted for cardiac catheterization on Monday and transferred to the cardiology service.

3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient had hyperglycemia, anion gap in the twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission. The precipitant is likely infection versus ischemia. The patient was treated with insulin via gtt, which resulted in closure of the anion gap and return to normoglycemia.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1-1.3, and he presented with acute renal failure with a creat"

   - Nutrition: switched to Novasource/beneprotein TF with 250 cc water
   q4h for hypernatremia (equivalent to 60 cc/hr, per renal recs)
   - Renal recs: need 60 ml/hr free h20 for 1.8L deficit; also may
   consider stopping cellcept and continuing on 2 dose immunosuppresive
   regimen (prednisone/tacrolimus) once Cr is stable (so that can monitor
   for rejection by Cr level), given high risk for infections
   - Stopped vanc/cefepime/flagyl given hypoxia likely due to fluid
   overload, not PNA

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type 1 diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presents with pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- The patient had an aspiration event leading to hypoxia and possible pneumonia, but without development of aspiration pneumonia. He also has a history of aspiration events and mild fever with elevated white blood cell count on presentation.
- The patient was treated with antibiotics (vanc/cefepime/flagyl) initially, but they were discontinued as his presentation was more consistent with fluid overload rather than pneumonia.
- He is now being treated with ceftriaxone for a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli, which was sensitive to ceftriaxone. However, the patient developed a drug rash to ceftriaxone and was switched back to cefepime.
- The patient has acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1-1.3, now resolving. He is likely pre-renal with dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.
- The patient has hypernatremia, possibly due to decreased access to free water, with a calculated free water deficit of 3L. He is receiving 250 cc of free water per hour but remains hypernatremic.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetesI
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, DKA and NSTEMI.
   #. Hypoxia:  Patient with a history of aspiration pneumonia had
   possible aspiration event at rehab facility now with worsening hypoxia,
   mild fever, elevated WBC, left sided infiltrate on imaging consistent
   with pneumonia vs atelectasis.  Pt was treated for prior PNA with
   Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].  Sputum growing gram positive
   cocci but culture with sparse commensals only.  Hypoxia felt most
   likely due to acute aspiration event without pneumonia or volume
   overload in setting of CHF flare due to CXR findings, though pt not
   volume overloaded on exam.
   - NPO with NGT
   -  Initially treated with abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover
   aspiration pending speciation of sputum ([**Date range (1) 12158**]); discontinued as
   felt presentation more c/w fluid overload vs pneumonia
   - f/u sputum fungal culture
   - consider long term feeding with g-tube, will discuss with family and
   address GOC
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema for goal even I/Os today
   .
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - TTE with new abnormality in inferolateral wall
   - Appreciate cardiology recs: will accept pt for cath on Monday and
   transfer of pt to service
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours (ended [**5-22**])
   - Follow-up lipid panel from admission labs
   - Continue lopressor, ASA, enalapril, statin
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles: coag-negative staph; most likely contaminant vs
   PICC colonization. PICC pulled [**5-22**].
   - follow up culture results (including repeat blood cultures from [**5-22**]
   and PICC tip culture)
   - Request new PICC placement today?
   .
   # Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection vs ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure
   of anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs but
   episode of hypoglycemia in AM [**5-23**]: will decrease back to 25 tonight
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, presented with acute
   renal failure to Cr 2.2, now resolving.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal
   with dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.
   - renally dose medication
   - Enalapril restarted [**5-22**] (discussed with renal)
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - Renal recs: transition to free water boluses by tube feed as
   tolerated: pt receiving 250 cc q4h, but remains hypernatremic. Plan to
   increase to 250 cc q3h.
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex as above
   .
   #. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone, cellcept
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   #. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro, last day to be [**5-20**]. Now with E.
   Coli UTI.
   - Cefepime 1gm IV q 24 hours day 1 = [**5-20**], 7 day course to end [**5-27**]

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with history of multiple strokes, type one diabetesI
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   possible  aspiration event with hypoxia, DKA and NSTEMI.
   .
   #. Hypoxia: Hypoxia felt most likely due to acute aspiration event (but
   without development of aspiration pneumonia) and/or from volume
   overload in setting of CHF flare (c/w CXR findings, though pt not
   volume overloaded on exam) in setting of NSTEMI.
   Patient does have a history of aspiration pneumonia with possible
   aspiration event at rehab facility and mild fever and elevated WBC on
   presentation (both resolved now and may be explained by UTI), left
   sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with atelectasis.  Pt was
   treated for prior PNA with Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].
   Sputum growing gram positive cocci but culture with sparse commensals
   only.
   -  Treated with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover aspiration PNA pending
   speciation of sputum ([**Date range (1) 12158**]); discontinued as felt presentation
   more c/w fluid overload vs pneumonia
   - Exam much improved today; oxygen requirement decreasing: wean as
   tolerated
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema for goal even I/Os today (dose PRN)
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down but troponin
   slightly up 4/15. TTE with new abnormality in inferolateral wall.
   Lipids wnl (LDL 76).
   - Recheck cardiac biomarkers this afternoon; if still elevated will
   begin to trend
   - Daily EKG
   - Appreciate cardiology recs: will accept pt for cath on Monday and
   transfer of pt to service; team requests description of pt
s anatomy
   s/p CABG (have [**Name (NI) 420**] medical records office; awaiting report)
   - Received heparin gtt for 48 hours (ended [**5-22**])
   - Continue lopressor and uptitrate to home dose, ASA, statin; add back
   enalopril as tolerated by blood pressure
   .

 bottles: coag-negative staph; most likely contaminant vs
   PICC colonization. PICC pulled [**5-22**].
   - follow up culture results (repeat blood cultures from [**5-22**] and PICC
   tip culture)
   .
   # Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection vs ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure
   of anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs but
   episode of hypoglycemia in AM [**5-23**]: decreased back to 25 last night
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs from yesterday: do not stack insulin bolus (no repeat use
   of ss w/in 4 hours since last dose); reduce lantus from 30 to 28;
   increase sliding scale by 1 unit per interval but only give q6h with
   possible additional correction if needed (and only if it is >4 hours
   since last bolus)
   - continue home sliding scale

   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, presented with acute
   renal failure to Cr 2.2, now resolved.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with
   dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Enalapril okay to restart per renal team
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
 will recheck qod
   .
   #.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L initially.
   - Renal recs: Pt receiving free water boluses, 250 cc q2h
   - [**Hospital1 **] Na to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex to maintain even fluid balance

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of multiple strokes, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He was admitted after a possible aspiration event, hypoxia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient has shown improvement in his condition, with decreasing oxygen requirements and resolution of mild fever and elevated white blood cell count. His chest X-ray shows slightly increased lung volumes, potentially reflecting improved ventilation or increased ventilatory pressures. There is also a minimal bilateral pleural effusion, unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette, and presence of retrocardiac atelectasis and right medial basal opacities with air bronchograms.

The patient was treated for aspiration pneumonia with cefepime/azithromycin, but the sputum culture showed only gram-positive cocci with sparse commensals. He was then given vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl to cover for aspiration pneumonia, but this was discontinued as the presentation was more consistent with fluid overload rather than pneumonia.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, but troponin levels are slightly up. An echocardiogram showed a new abnormality in the inferolateral wall. The patient's lipid levels are within normal limits.

The patient has been weaned off the ventilator and is tolerating it well. His insulin regimen has been adjusted to prevent further episodes of hypoglycemia"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of multiple strokes, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia who presents after a witnessed aspiration event with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He has been treated for prior pneumonia with cefepime/azithromycin and was initially treated with antibiotics covering aspiration pending speciation of sputum, but this was discontinued as the presentation was more consistent with fluid overload versus pneumonia. He is also being treated for acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and a urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and recently experienced another aspiration event. This increases the risk of developing pneumonia.

2. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient presented with DKA, which is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. It requires prompt treatment with insulin.

3. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction: The patient also has evidence of NSTEMI, which is a type of heart attack. This requires cardiac management and monitoring.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient presented with acute renal failure, likely due to dehydration caused by osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with history of multiple strokes, type one diabetesI
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   possible  aspiration event with hypoxia, DKA and NSTEMI.
   #. Hypoxia: Hypoxia felt most likely due to acute aspiration event (but
   without development of aspiration pneumonia) and/or from volume
   overload in setting of CHF flare (c/w CXR findings, though pt not
   volume overloaded on exam) in setting of NSTEMI.
   Patient does have a history of aspiration pneumonia with possible
   aspiration event at rehab facility and mild fever and elevated WBC on
   presentation (both resolved now and may be explained by UTI), left
   sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with atelectasis.  Pt was
   treated for prior PNA with Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].
   Sputum growing gram positive cocci but culture with sparse commensals
   only.
   -  Treated with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover aspiration PNA pending
   speciation of sputum ([**Date range (1) 12158**]); discontinued as felt presentation
   more c/w fluid overload vs pneumonia
   - Exam much improved today; oxygen requirement decreasing: wean as
   tolerated
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema for goal even I/Os today (dose PRN)
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down but troponin
   slightly up 4/15. TTE with new abnormality in inferolateral wall.
   Lipids wnl (LDL 76).
   - Recheck cardiac biomarkers this afternoon; if still elevated will
   begin to trend
   - Daily EKG
   - Appreciate cardiology recs: will accept pt for cath on Monday and
   transfer of pt to service; team requests description of pt
s anatomy
   s/p CABG (have [**Name (NI) 420**] medical records office; awaiting report)
   - Received heparin gtt for 48 hours (ended [**5-22**])
   - Continue lopressor, ASA, statin; add back enalopril as tolerated by
   blood pressure
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles: coag-negative staph; most likely contaminant vs
   PICC colonization. PICC pulled [**5-22**].
   - follow up culture results (repeat blood cultures from [**5-22**] and PICC
   tip culture)
   .
   # Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection vs ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure
   of anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs but
   episode of hypoglycemia in AM [**5-23**]: decreased back to 25 last night
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs from yesterday: do not stack insulin bolus (no repeat use
   of ss w/in 4 hours since last dose); reduce lantus from 30 to 28;
   increase sliding scale by 1 unit per interval but only give q6h with
   possible additional correction if needed (and only if it is >4 hours
   since last bolus)
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, presented with acute
   renal failure to Cr 2.2, now resolved.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with
   dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Enalapril okay to restart per renal team
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
 will recheck qod
   .
   #.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L initially.
   - Renal recs: Pt receiving free water boluses, 250 cc q2h
   - [**Hospital1 **] Na to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex to maintain even fluid balance
   .
   #. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue prednisone, cellcept, tacrolimus
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   #. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro for previous UTI, last day to be
   [**5-20**]. Now with E. Coli UTI on [**5-20**]. Pan-resistant except to
   nitrofurantoin (contraindicated in renal insufficiency) and cefepime,
   ceftriaxone, ceftaz.
   - Cefepime 1gm IV q 24 hours (day 1 = [**5-20**], 7 day course to end [**5-27**])
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, TFs (novasource with free water flushes).
   Check CXR for tube placement given pt may have dislodged it yesterday.
   Speech and swallow video study pending; pt may need PEG for permanently
   feeding solution given recurrent silent aspiration events in past.

","The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of multiple strokes, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presents after a possible aspiration event with hypoxia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

1. Hypoxia: The patient likely experienced acute aspiration leading to hypoxia. There is also a possibility of volume overload due to congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, although the patient does not appear to be volume overloaded on examination. The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, and there is evidence of left-sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with atelectasis. He was previously treated for pneumonia with cefepime and azithromycin. The patient's oxygen requirement is decreasing, and it is recommended to wean off oxygen as tolerated.

2. NSTEMI: The patient has new T-wave inversions in the anterior leads and elevated cardiac biomarkers. The cardiac enzymes are trending down, but troponin levels are slightly up. An echocardiogram shows a new abnormality in the inferolateral wall. The patient's lipids are within normal limits. Daily EKGs are recommended, and the patient is scheduled for a cardiac catheterization on Monday. The patient's medical team requests a description of the patient's cardiac anatomy, as he is s/p CABG. He is currently on lopressor, aspirin, statin, and enalapril, which will be continued.

3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient presented with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the twenties, and ketones in the urine. The precipitant is likely infection versus ischemia. The patient was treated with insulin and closure of the anion gap, returning to normoglycemia. The patient's home dose of glargine was increased to 30 units, but an episode of hypoglycemia occurred, so it was decreased back to 25 units. The patient should continue with the home sliding scale, and the physician's recommendations regarding insulin dosing should be followed.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1-1.3, and he presented with acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.2, which has now resolved. The fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 0.2, suggesting pre-renal azotemia due to dehydration secondary to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA. Renal dosing of medications is recommended, and enalapril can be restarted. The renal transplant team recommends monitoring creatinine kinase (CK) in the setting of pravastatin and tacrolimus interaction.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to decreased access to free water. A free water deficit of 3 liters has been calculated."
