   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # AMS/Respiratory Support: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process.
   Cardiac etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing
   diabetes. Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning
   for pneumonia.  Intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness.  Did not
   tolerate PSV overnight, switched back to AC. NAG metabolic acidosis
   with blood sugars better controlled.
   - current metabolic acidosis
   - blood culture, UA and urine culture, sputum culture
   - repeat EKG with sinus tachycardia
   - continue PS overnight and monitor ABGs post-changes to vent settings
   .
   # Hypotension: In setting of DKA concern for infectious etiology to his
   uresponsive episode. On CXR pulmonary infiltrates could represent
   pneumonia, aspiration vs CAP vs atypical. Hemodynamically he continues
   to require pressors (levophed) with minimal UOP (450cc total at OSH)
   and was admitted to ICU with hypothermia.
   -continue pressors with goal MAP>65
   -IV NS
   -sputum cx and blood cx
   -repeat CXR
   -continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   -maintain UOP>30cc/hr
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State. Possible
   non-compliance with medications vs. underlying infection, especially in
   setting of CXR findings. Patient has history of ICU admission for
   similar presentation one year ago. It is possible pneumonia is source
   of infection, leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive
   presentation.
   -insulin gtt
   -q1h fingerstick check
   -replete K slowly
   -UA, urine lytes and osm
   -IV hydration with bicarb, switch to D5W once glucose <200
   -monitor electrolytes q4h
   -pan-cultures as above
   .
   # AG Metabolic acidosis: In setting of hyperglycemia most likely due to
   DKA. Also with some component of rhabdomyolysis (patient found down,
   unclear for how long). Although less likely, given patient was found
   down also consider ingestion.
   - IV NS plus bicarb for now, switch to D5W once glucose <200
   - trend electrolytes q4h, follow AG for resolution
   - serum/urine tox if not done at OSH
   - follow lactate, CK
   .
   # Multifocal pneumonia: Possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis in
   setting of unresponsive period, also consider community-acquired
   pneumonia vs influenza. Also, given the similar appearance of CXR from
   this and last admission, opacity on film could be pulmonary edema.
   -repeat CXR
   -sputum culture
   -blood culture
   -continue IV vanco, zosyn for broad spectrum coverage
   .
   # Acute renal failure: baseline Cr 0.7, now 2.7. Likely pre-renal in
   setting of dehydration secondary to DKA.
   -monitor UOP
   -IVF hydration
   -renally dose medications
   -follow BUN, Cr
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ? due to rescusitative efforts vs infectious process
   -pan culture
   -IV vanco and zosyn for
   -follow CBC
   .
   # FEN: NPO; monitor and replete electrolytes q4 prn; IVF as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of IDDM (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) who was found unresponsive at home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. He was intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness and did not tolerate PSV (pressure support ventilation) overnight, so he was switched back to AC (assistant-controlled) ventilation. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with hypothermia and is currently sedated and unresponsive. His vital signs include a temperature of 93.7Â°F, blood pressure of 86/45 mmHg, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on assisted ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds bilaterally with good air movement, no wheezes or rales, and 2+ pitting edema on upper and lower extremities. The patient also has cool extremities, excoriations, and abrasions on bilateral shins and left thigh, and his pupils are reactive to light with 2 mm anisocoria. The patient's neurological status is sedated and unresponsive.

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 14.7, Hct of 25.0, platelet count of 238, creatinine levels ranging from 2.9 to 3.5, troponin-T levels of"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # AMS/Respiratory Support: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process.
   Cardiac etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing
   diabetes. Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning
   for pneumonia.  Intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness.  Did not
   tolerate PSV overnight, switched back to AC. NAG metabolic acidosis
   with blood sugars better controlled.  Latest CXR with improvement in
   infiltrates, ? atelectasis at bases
   - current metabolic acidosis
   - blood culture, UA and urine culture, sputum culture pend
   - repeat EKG shows sinus tachycardia
   - on AC
 increased PEEP to 10, monitor ABGs post-changes to vent
   settings
   .
   # Hypotension: In setting of DKA with PNA fluid loss vs. sepsis.
   Hemodynamically he required pressors (levophed) on day 1 with minimal
   UOP (450cc total at OSH) and was admitted to ICU with hypothermia.  Now
   off pressors, pressures improved, UOP beginning to come up.
   - IV fluids/tube feeds
   -sputum cx and blood cx pend
   -monitor UOP
   -continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State. Possible
   non-compliance with medications vs. underlying infection, especially in
   setting of CXR findings. Patient has history of ICU admission for
   similar presentation one year ago. It is possible pneumonia is source
   of infection, leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive
   presentation.   Discussed plan with [**Last Name (un) 276**] diabetes

   setting of dehydration secondary to DKA.
   -monitor UOP
   -IVF hydration
   -renally dose medications
   -follow BUN, Cr

   # AG Metabolic acidosis: In setting of hyperglycemia most likely due to
   DKA. Also with some component of rhabdomyolysis (patient found down,
   unclear for how long).  Acidemia persists with correction of blood
   glucose, major contributor likely now renal failure.  Lactate and Ck
   trending down.
   - trend electrolytes q4h, follow AG for resolution
   - follow lactate, CK

   # Multifocal pneumonia: Possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis in
   setting of unresponsive period, also consider community-acquired
   pneumonia vs influenza. Also, given the similar appearance of CXR from
   this and last admission, opacity on film could be pulmonary edema.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of IDDM (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) who was found unresponsive at home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. He has been admitted to the ICU for various complications including hypotension, pneumonia, hyperglycemia, altered mental status, renal failure, hypothermia, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line for blood glucose monitoring. The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing efforts to manage his blood glucose levels, renal function, and infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially required pressors (levophed) due to hypotension, which is common in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). However, he is now off pressors, indicating that his blood pressure has improved. Ongoing IV fluids and tube feeds will be important to maintain adequate circulation.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration or community-acquired infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and cultures are pending. Close monitoring of respiratory status and follow-up imaging are necessary.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood sugar levels indicate DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Insulin infusions have been initiated, along with careful monitoring of fingerstick glucose levels. Electrolyte re"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 43 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process,
   although there is concern for significant brain injury given report of
   unilateral dilated pupil. Would consult neurology to determine if
   further imaging is necessary to rule out acute process such as storke,
   new-onset seizure and infection (meningitis, encephalitis). Cardiac
   etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing diabetes.
   Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning for
   pneumonia, the most likely nidus of infection on admission. Intubated
   at OSH for unresponsiveness.
   - corrent metabolic acidosis and hyperglycemia as below
   - blood culture, UA and urine culture, sputum culture
   - neurology consult re: need for MRI, EEG
   - repeat CT or f/u final read from OSH
   - EKG and cycle cardiac enzymes
   - continue PS overnight and monitor ABGs post-changes to vent settings
   -contact PCP for med list and recent history
   .
   # Sepsis: In setting of DKA concern for infectious etiology to his
   uresponsive episode. On CXR pulmonary infiltrates could represent
   pneumonia, aspiration vs CAP vs atypical. Hemodynamically he continues
   to require pressors (levophed) with minimal UOP (450cc total at OSH)
   and was admitted to ICU with hypothermia.
   -continue pressors with goal MAP>65
   -IV NS
   -sputum cx and blood cx
   -repeat CXR
   -continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   -maintain UOP>30cc/hr
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State. Possible
   non-compliance with medications vs. underlying infection, especially in
   setting of CXR findings. Patient has history of ICU admission for
   similar presentation one year ago. It is possible pneumonia is source
   of infection, leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive
   presentation.
   -insulin gtt
   -q1h fingerstick check
   -replete K slowly
   -UA, urine lytes and osm
   -IV hydration with bicarb, switch to D5W once glucose <200
   -monitor electrolytes q4h
   -pan-cultures as above
   .
   # AG Metabolic acidosis: In setting of hyperglycemia most likely due to
   DKA. Also with some component of rhabdomyolysis (patient found down,
   unclear for how long). Although less likely, given patient was found
   down also consider ingestion.
   - IV NS plus bicarb for now, switch to D5W once glucose <200
   - trend electrolytes q4h, follow AG for resolution
   - serum/urine tox if not done at OSH
   - follow lactate, CK
   .
   # Multifocal pneumonia: Possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis in
   setting of unresponsive period, also consider community-acquired
   pneumonia vs influenza. Also, given the similar appearance of CXR from
   this and last admission, opacity on film could be pulmonary edema.
   -repeat CXR
   -sputum culture
   -blood culture
   -continue IV vanco, zosyn for broad spectrum coverage
   .
   # Acute renal failure: baseline cr 0.7, now 2.7. Likely pre-renal in
   setting of dehydration secondary to DKA.
   -monitor UOP
   -IVF hydration
   -renally dose medications
   -follow BUN, Cr

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of IDDM (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) who was found unresponsive at home. He presented with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to unresponsiveness. His condition has been complicated by sepsis, pneumonia, acute renal failure, altered mental status, hypotension, hyperglycemia, and hypothermia. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, insulin drip, and IV fluids. He is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation suggests sepsis due to the presence of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover potential infections.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray, which could indicate pneumonia. Sputum and blood cultures have been obtained to identify the causative organism.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.7, which has increased to 2.7. This suggests acute renal failure, likely secondary to dehydration from diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has significant hyperglycemia, likely due to DKA. Insulin therapy has been started to manage blood glucose levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # AMS/Respiratory Support: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process.
   Cardiac etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing
   diabetes. Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning
   for pneumonia.  Intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness.  Did not
   tolerate PSV overnight, switched back to AC. NAG metabolic acidosis
   with blood sugars better controlled.  Latest CXR with improvement in
   infiltrates, ? atelectasis at bases
   - current metabolic acidosis
   - blood culture, UA and urine culture, sputum culture pend
   - repeat EKG shows sinus tachycardia
   - on AC
 increased PEEP to 10, monitor ABGs post-changes to vent
   settings
   .
   # Hypotension: In setting of DKA with PNA fluid loss vs. sepsis.
   Hemodynamically he required pressors (levophed) on day 1 with minimal
   UOP (450cc total at OSH) and was admitted to ICU with hypothermia.  Now
   off pressors, pressures improved, UOP beginning to come up.
   - IV fluids/tube feeds
   -sputum cx and blood cx pend
   -monitor UOP
   -continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State. Possible
   non-compliance with medications vs. underlying infection, especially in
   setting of CXR findings. Patient has history of ICU admission for
   similar presentation one year ago. It is possible pneumonia is source
   of infection, leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive
   presentation.   Discussed plan with [**Last Name (un) 276**] diabetes
 cont insulin
   drip, fluids and TFs
   -insulin gtt
   -q1h fingerstick check
   -replete K PRN
   -now D5W 1/2NS
   -monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   -pan-cultures as above
   .
   # Acute renal failure: baseline Cr 0.7, now 2.7. Likely pre-renal in
   setting of dehydration secondary to DKA.
   -monitor UOP
   -IVF hydration
   -renally dose medications
   -follow BUN, Cr
   .
   # AG Metabolic acidosis: In setting of hyperglycemia most likely due to
   DKA. Also with some component of rhabdomyolysis (patient found down,
   unclear for how long).  Acidemia persists with correction of blood
   glucose, major contributor likely now renal failure.  Lactate and Ck
   trending down.
   - trend electrolytes q4h, follow AG for resolution
   - follow lactate, CK
   .
   # Multifocal pneumonia: Possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis in
   setting of unresponsive period, also consider community-acquired
   pneumonia vs influenza. Also, given the similar appearance of CXR from
   this and last admission, opacity on film could be pulmonary edema.
   -follow CXRs
   -sputum culture
   -blood culture
   -continue IV vanco, zosyn for broad spectrum coverage
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ? due to rescusitative efforts vs infectious process
   -pan culture
   -IV vanco and zosyn
   -follow CBC
   .
   # FEN: NPO; monitor and replete electrolytes q4 prn; IVF as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing diarrhea and impaired skin integrity. There is also evidence of renal failure, hypothermia, respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, hypotension, and pneumonia.

Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's muddy brown casts and elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. This could be due to sepsis or direct kidney injury.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. His ABG results show a respiratory acidosis with an elevated PaCO2 level, suggesting ineffective gas exchange. There are no signs of ARDS.
3. Hypothermia: The patient has a Tmax of 38.6Â°C (101.4Â°F) and a current temperature of 38.2Â°C (100.8Â°F), indicating fever.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are consistently elevated, indicating poorly controlled diabetes.
5. Hypotension: Despite being on vasopressor support, the patient's blood pressure is still on the lower side, indicating inadequate perfusion.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest an infection in the lungs.
7. Diarrhea: The patient has been experiencing diarrhea, which could be a result of antibiotic-associated Clostridium difficile infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # AMS/Respiratory Support: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process.
   Cardiac etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing
   diabetes. Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning
   for pneumonia.  Intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness.  Did not
   tolerate PSV overnight, switched back to AC. NAG metabolic acidosis
   with blood sugars better controlled.  Latest CXR with improvement in
   infiltrates, ? atelectasis at bases.  Good aeration on phys exam.   Now
   oxygenating well on PSV.
   - current metabolic acidosis
   - on Abx
   - blood culture, UA and urine culture, sputum culture pend
   - will attempt to wean sedation and PEEP
   .
   # Acute renal failure: baseline Cr 0.7, now 2.7 up to 4.5. Likely mix
   pre-renal/ATN in setting of dehydration/hypotension secondary to DKA.
   Responded to lasix 120 IV yesterday
   -monitor UOP
   -TFs, d/c
d IVF
   -renally dose medications
   -follow BUN, Cr
   - urine lytes tomorrow to assess renal fxn
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ? due to rescusitative efforts vs infectious process,
   diarrhea with positive abd exam
   - CT scan abd/pelvis
   -pan culture, c-diff
   -IV vanco and zosyn
   -follow CBC
   .
   #Anemia: Crit down to 23 transfused 1 unit with Hct up to 26.
   Melanotic, guaiac positive stool
   - changed PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   - C-diff negative X1, will send addt
   -trend crits
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State. Possible
   non-compliance with medications vs. underlying infection, especially in
   setting of CXR findings. Patient has history of ICU admission for
   similar presentation one year ago. It is possible pneumonia is source
   of infection, leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive
   presentation.   Discussed plan with [**Last Name (un) 276**] diabetes
 cont insulin
   drip, fluids and TFs
   -insulin gtt
   -q1h fingerstick check
   -replete K PRN
   -TFs, d/c fluids
   -monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   -pan-cultures as above
   .
   # AG Metabolic acidosis: In setting of hyperglycemia most likely due to
   DKA. Also with some component of rhabdomyolysis (patient found down,
   unclear for how long).  Acidemia persists with correction of blood
   glucose, major contributor likely now renal failure.  Lactate and Ck
   trending down.
   - trend electrolytes q4h, follow AG for resolution
   - follow lactate, CK
   .
   # Multifocal pneumonia: Possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis in
   setting of unresponsive period, also consider community-acquired
   pneumonia vs influenza. Also, given the similar appearance of CXR from
   this and last admission, opacity on film could be pulmonary edema.
   -follow CXRs
   -sputum culture
   -blood culture
   -continue IV vanco, zosyn for broad spectrum coverage
   .
   # Hypotension: In setting of DKA with PNA fluid loss vs. sepsis.
   Hemodynamically he required pressors (levophed) on day 1 with minimal
   UOP (450cc total at OSH) and was admitted to ICU with hypothermia.  Now
   off pressors, pressures improved, UOP came up.  Now normo to
   hypertensive.  Resolved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of IDDM who was found unresponsive at home. He has hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient was intubated due to unresponsiveness and did not tolerate PSV overnight, so he was switched back to AC. His blood sugars are better controlled now, and his current metabolic acidosis is being managed. The patient has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely due to pre-renal/ATN in the setting of dehydration/hypotension secondary to DKA. He responded well to lasix 120 IV yesterday and his urine output has improved. The patient is being monitored closely for any changes in renal function. 

Other issues include leukocytosis, possibly due to resuscitative efforts or an infectious process, diarrhea with positive abdominal exam, and melanotic, guaiac positive stool. The patient has a history of similar ICU admission one year ago, and it is possible that pneumonia is the source of infection leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive presentation. 

The patient's diabetes is being managed with insulin gtt, fluids, and TFs. His hyperglycemia is being treated as DKA. Acidosis persists despite correction of blood glucose, and major contributors are likely now renal failure and rhabdomyolysis. 

The patient's pneumonia is multifocal and could be aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis or community-acquired pneumonia."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who was found unresponsive at home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from his current condition. These potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure, possibly caused by pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis.

2. Hypotension: The patient initially required pressors for hypotension, which improved with IV fluids. However, the underlying cause of hypotension could be sepsis or fluid loss due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient presents with hyperglycemia and possible DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. This condition requires close monitoring and management of blood glucose levels.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.7, but it has increased to 2.7, indicating acute renal failure. This may be due to pre-renal dehydration secondary to DKA.

5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an anion-gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to DKA. However, renal failure could also contribute to the persistent acidemia.

6. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting possible aspiration"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and respiratory failure. They were intubated for airway protection and management of acidosis. The patient has been receiving IV insulin, and evaluation for precipitants of DKA is ongoing. Persistent fevers have been observed, and a CT scan of the abdomen is planned due to tenderness, leukocytosis, and diarrhea. The patient's renal function is worsening, and a renal consultation has been appreciated. Lasix was attempted for negative fluid balance, but the patient continues to diuresis well. Blood pressure management is challenging due to volume overload and ongoing renal issues. The patient also has impaired skin integrity and altered mental status. They are critically ill and require ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to respiratory failure. It is essential to monitor the patient's respiratory status and reassess their readiness for extubation.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Continuous IV insulin therapy should be maintained to manage blood glucose levels and prevent further complications associated with DKA.
3. Pneumonia: Given the presence of fever, leukocytosis, and diarrhea, there is a possibility of pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotics should be administered, and further evaluation, such as a CT scan of the abdomen, may be necessary.

   Agree with plan to continue therapy for DKA with IV fluid rehydration,
   IV insulin, and evaluation for precipitant with checking EKG, troponins
   and cultures.  Careful monitoring of acidosis, glucose and electrolytes
 will ask [**Last Name (un) 276**] to consult.  No clear evidence for infection,
   ingestion or primary ischemic event.  CXR does show infiltrates -
   ?edema vs ARDS vs infection vs aspiration.  CXR this am looks slightly
   improved.  Continue full ventilatory support will try slight increase
   PEEP today as may have derecruited slightly overnight.  Await full
   culture data, continue broad spectrum antibiotics pending cultures.
   Renal function slowly worsening, will ask renal to consult today.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4Â°F, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 173/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including insulin, propofol, sodium bicarbonate, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever and diarrhea.

The flow sheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 5,334 mL of fluids since midnight, with 738 mL of urine output and 501 mL of blood product transfusion. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 450 mL, PS of 15 cmH2O, RR set at 32, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 98%.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine level, low total CO2 level, and decreased albumin level. Other lab values show elevated troponin-T, CK, CKMB, ALT, AST, LDH, and electrolyte imbalances.

The assessment and plan include diagnosis of diarrhea, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hypothermia, respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, hypotension, and pneumonia. The plan involves continuing therapy for DKA with IV fluid rehydration, IV insulin, and evaluation for precipitant. Monitoring of acidosis, glucose, and electrolytes is also recommended.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI). These complications need to be closely monitored and managed accordingly."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several medical complications. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to an inability to protect their airway and management of acidosis. They are currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a set rate of 15 breaths per minute and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The respiratory support plan should be reassessed, and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) should be checked. The patient's total body volume overload and renal acidosis are limiting factors for extubation.

2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has ongoing DKA, and IV insulin should be continued. An evaluation for precipitants should also be conducted.

3. Persistent fevers: The patient has had persistent fevers despite antibiotic therapy. A CT scan of the abdomen will be obtained to further investigate the cause of fever, tenderness, leukocytosis, and diarrhea. Follow-up cultures and maintenance of antibiotics are recommended.

4. Renal failure, acute: The patient's renal function is slowly worsening. A renal consultation is appreciated, and diuretics will be used as needed to achieve a negative fluid balance.

5. Hypotension: The patient has ongoing hypotension, which is now emerging due to volume resuscitation. It is important to maintain renal perfusion, and high blood pressure readings may be tolerated.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # AMS/Respiratory Support: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process.
   Cardiac etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing
   diabetes. Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning
   for pneumonia.  Intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness.  Did not
   tolerate PSV overnight, switched back to AC. NAG metabolic acidosis
   with blood sugars better controlled.  Requires more vent support
   overnight.  CXR worsening with increased fluid.  Persistent acidosis.
   Elevated WBC.  Still making urine.
   - persistent metabolic acidosis in setting of renal failure
   - sputum cx positive for MRSA
   - cont abx
   - blood culture, UA and urine culture
 NGTD, resend sputum b/c of
   contaminated sample
   - ABG this PM, follow UOP, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Acute renal failure: baseline Cr 0.7, now 2.7 up to 4.5 -> 4.8
   Initially mix pre-renal/ATN in setting of dehydration/hypotension
   secondary to DKA.  Fluid overloaded on exam, continues to make urine.
   -monitor UOP
   -TFs, d/c
d IVF
   -renally dose medications
   -follow BUN, Cr
   - urine lytes today to assess renal fxn
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ? due to rescusitative efforts vs infectious process,
   diarrhea with positive abd exam.  CT yesterday showed possible abcess.
   Abdominal ascites.  Surgery consulted.  Lactate remains normal.  C-diff
   X 1 neg, #2 pending.
   - f/u final CT read
 small bowel wall thickening, rectal wall
   thickening

   #Anemia: Crit down to 23 transfused 1 unit with Hct up to 26
 up to
   29.2, now at 27.6.  Had melanotic, guaiac positive stool. Now
   diarrhea.
   - changed PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   - C-diff negative X1, will send addt
l pending
   -trend crits
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State. Possible
   non-compliance with medications vs. underlying infection, especially in
   setting of CXR findings. Patient has history of ICU admission for
   similar presentation one year ago. It is possible pneumonia is source
   of infection, leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive
   presentation.   Discussed plan with [**Last Name (un) 276**] diabetes

   -replete K PRN
   -TFs, d/c fluids
   -monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   -pan-cultures as above
   .
   # AG Metabolic acidosis: In setting of hyperglycemia most likely due to
   DKA. Also with some component of rhabdomyolysis (patient found down,
   unclear for how long).  Acidemia persists with correction of blood
   glucose, major contributor likely now renal failure.  Lactate normal.
   - trend electrolytes, follow AG for resolution
   - follow lactate
   .
   # Multifocal pneumonia: Possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis in
   setting of unresponsive period, also consider community-acquired
   pneumonia vs influenza. Also, given the similar appearance of CXR from
   this and last admission, opacity on film could be pulmonary edema.
   -follow CXRs
   -resend sputum culture
   -blood culture
   -continue IV vanco, zosyn for broad spectrum coverage
   .
   # Hypotension: In setting of DKA with PNA fluid loss vs. sepsis.
   Hemodynamically he required pressors (levophed) on day 1 with minimal
   UOP (450cc total at OSH) and was admitted to ICU with hypothermia.  Now
   off pressors, pressures improved, UOP came up.  Now normo to
   hypertensive.  Resolved.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of IDDM who was found unresponsive at home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. He has been intubated for unresponsiveness and is currently on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include tachycardia, hypertension, and a body temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, anemia, renal failure, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. Imaging shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, which are concerning for pneumonia. The patient has a history of similar presentation one year ago.

1. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has ongoing metabolic acidosis, which may be due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). It is important to monitor and manage the patient's blood sugar levels, electrolytes, and acid-base balance.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level has increased from 0.7 to 2.7, indicating possible acute renal failure. This could be due to pre-renal azotemia secondary to dehydration and hypotension, or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from DKA. Close monitoring of urine output, serum electrolytes, and medication dosing adjustments will be necessary.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # AMS/Respiratory Support: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process.
   Cardiac etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing
   diabetes. Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning
   for pneumonia.  Intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness.  Did not
   tolerate PSV overnight, switched back to AC. NAG metabolic acidosis
   with blood sugars better controlled.  Requires more vent support
   overnight.  CXR worsening with increased fluid.  Persistent acidosis.
   Elevated WBC.  Still making urine.
   - persistent metabolic acidosis in setting of renal failure
   - Cont Abx
   - blood culture, UA and urine culture
 NGTD, resend sputum b/c of
   contaminated sample
   - ABG this PM, follow UOP, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Acute renal failure: baseline Cr 0.7, now 2.7 up to 4.5 -> 4.8
   Initially mix pre-renal/ATN in setting of dehydration/hypotension
   secondary to DKA.  Fluid overloaded on exam, continues to make urine.
   -monitor UOP
   -TFs, d/c
d IVF
   -renally dose medications
   -follow BUN, Cr
   - urine lytes today to assess renal fxn
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ? due to rescusitative efforts vs infectious process,
   diarrhea with positive abd exam.  CT yesterday showed possible abcess.
   Abdominal ascites.  Surgery consulted.  Lactate remains normal.  C-diff
   X 1 neg, #2 pending.
   - f/u final CT read
   - cx pending
   -IV vanco and zosyn
   -follow WBC
   .
   #Anemia: Crit down to 23 transfused 1 unit with Hct up to 26
 up to
   29.2, now at 27.6.  Had melanotic, guaiac positive stool. Now
   diarrhea.
   - changed PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   - C-diff negative X1, will send addt
l pending
   -trend crits
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State. Possible
   non-compliance with medications vs. underlying infection, especially in
   setting of CXR findings. Patient has history of ICU admission for
   similar presentation one year ago. It is possible pneumonia is source
   of infection, leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive
   presentation.   Discussed plan with [**Last Name (un) 276**] diabetes
 cont insulin
   drip, fluids and TFs
   -insulin gtt
 change to [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7240**] and ISS when extubated
   -change fing sticks to Q4
   -replete K PRN
   -TFs, d/c fluids
   -monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   -pan-cultures as above
   .
   # AG Metabolic acidosis: In setting of hyperglycemia most likely due to
   DKA. Also with some component of rhabdomyolysis (patient found down,
   unclear for how long).  Acidemia persists with correction of blood
   glucose, major contributor likely now renal failure.  Lactate normal.
   - trend electrolytes, follow AG for resolution
   - follow lactate
   .
   # Multifocal pneumonia: Possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis in
   setting of unresponsive period, also consider community-acquired
   pneumonia vs influenza. Also, given the similar appearance of CXR from
   this and last admission, opacity on film could be pulmonary edema.
   -follow CXRs
   -resend sputum culture
   -blood culture
   -continue IV vanco, zosyn for broad spectrum coverage
   .
   # Hypotension: In setting of DKA with PNA fluid loss vs. sepsis.
   Hemodynamically he required pressors (levophed) on day 1 with minimal
   UOP (450cc total at OSH) and was admitted to ICU with hypothermia.  Now
   off pressors, pressures improved, UOP came up.  Now normo to
   hypertensive.  Resolved.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of IDDM found unresponsive at home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. He has been admitted to the ICU for various complications, including acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anemia, leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, which are concerning for pneumonia. This can be a potential complication due to his unresponsive state and possible aspiration.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate renal dysfunction. This could be due to pre-renal azotemia secondary to dehydration and hypotension caused by DKA, or intrinsic renal damage from sepsis or toxic injury.

3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's high blood glucose levels and metabolic acidosis suggest DKA. It is crucial to manage his blood sugar levels and correct the acidosis.

4. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has been treated for C. diff infection, indicated by the negative stool test. However, there is a pending test, so it's important to monitor for any signs of recurrence.

5. Abdominal abscess: The patient's abdominal CT scan showed a possible abscess, which needs further evaluation and management.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # AMS/Respiratory Support: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process.
   Cardiac etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing
   diabetes. Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning
   for pneumonia.  Intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness.  Did not
   tolerate PSV overnight, switched back to AC. NAG metabolic acidosis
   with blood sugars better controlled.  Requires more vent support
   overnight.  CXR worsening with increased fluid.  Persistent acidosis.
   Elevated WBC.  Still making urine.
   - persistent metabolic acidosis in setting of renal failure
   - sputum cx positive for MRSA
   - cont abx
   - blood culture, UA and urine culture
 NGTD, resend sputum b/c of
   contaminated sample
   - ABG this PM, follow UOP, wean as tolerated
   - possible A-line today
   .
   # Acute renal failure: baseline Cr 0.7, now 2.7 up to 4.5 -> 4.8
   Initially mix pre-renal/ATN in setting of dehydration/hypotension
   secondary to DKA.  Fluid overloaded on exam, continues to make urine.
   -monitor UOP
   -TFs, d/c
d IVF
   -renally dose medications
   -follow BUN, Cr
   - urine lytes today to assess renal fxn
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ? due to rescusitative efforts vs infectious process,
   diarrhea with positive abd exam.  CT yesterday showed possible abcess.
   Abdominal ascites.  Surgery consulted.  Lactate remains normal.  C-diff
   X 1 neg, #2 pending.
   - f/u final CT read
 small bowel wall thickening, rectal wall
   thickening
   - cx pending
   -IV vanco and zosyn, add flagyl for presumptive c-diff
   -follow WBC
   .
   #Anemia: Crit down to 23 transfused 1 unit with Hct up to 26
 up to
   29.2, now at 27.6.  Had melanotic, guaiac positive stool. Now
   diarrhea.
   - changed PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   - C-diff negative X1, will send addt
l pending
   -trend crits
   - guaiac stool today
   .
   Pain/Sedation: Pt on chronic pain meds at home for neuropathy per
   father.  [**Name (NI) 7259**] on propofol for sedation
 will switch to fentanyl
   versed for sedation and pain relief.  Will readdress with pt once
   extubated.
   - switch to fentanyl/versed
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State. Possible
   non-compliance with medications vs. underlying infection, especially in
   setting of CXR findings. Patient has history of ICU admission for
   similar presentation one year ago. It is possible pneumonia is source
   of infection, leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive
   presentation.   Discussed plan with [**Last Name (un) 276**] diabetes
 cont insulin
   drip, fluids and TFs
   -insulin gtt
 change to [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7240**] and ISS when extubated
   -change fing sticks to Q4
   -replete K PRN
   -TFs, d/c fluids
   -monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   -pan-cultures as above
   .
   # AG Metabolic acidosis: In setting of hyperglycemia most likely due to
   DKA. Also with some component of rhabdomyolysis (patient found down,
   unclear for how long).  Acidemia persists with correction of blood
   glucose, major contributor likely now renal failure.  Lactate normal.
   - trend electrolytes, follow AG for resolution
   - follow lactate
   .
   # Multifocal pneumonia: Possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis in
   setting of unresponsive period, also consider community-acquired
   pneumonia vs influenza. Also, given the similar appearance of CXR from
   this and last admission, opacity on film could be pulmonary edema.
   -follow CXRs
   -resend sputum culture
   -blood culture
   -continue IV vanco, zosyn for broad spectrum coverage
   .
   # Hypotension: In setting of DKA with PNA fluid loss vs. sepsis.
   Hemodynamically he required pressors (levophed) on day 1 with minimal
   UOP (450cc total at OSH) and was admitted to ICU with hypothermia.  Now
   off pressors, pressures improved, UOP came up.  Now normo to
   hypertensive.  Resolved.
   .
   # FEN: TFs at goal, NPO; monitor and replete electrolytes

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of IDDM found unresponsive at home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
- He was intubated due to unresponsiveness and did not tolerate pressure support ventilation (PSV), so he was switched back to assist-control (AC) ventilation.
- The patient has persistent metabolic acidosis, elevated WBC count, and worsening renal function with a baseline creatinine of 0.7 now elevated to 2.7 and up to 4.8.
- He also has leukocytosis, diarrhea, positive abdominal exam, and CT findings of small bowel wall thickening and rectal wall thickening.
- The patient's pain and sedation management plan includes switching from propofol to fentanyl/versed for sedation and pain relief.
- His hyperglycemia is being managed with insulin drips, fluids, and TFs.
- The patient's metabolic acidosis is attributed to DKA, with some component of rhabdomyolysis.
- He has multifocal pneumonia, possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis, and community-acquired pneumonia vs influenza.
- His hypotension is resolved, and he is now normo to hypertensive.
- The patient's fluids and electrolytes are being monitored, and he is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and respiratory failure, requiring intubation for airway protection. They also have acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, hypotension, pneumonia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition is critical, and they are receiving full ventilatory support, antibiotics for MRSA pneumonia, diuretics for fluid overload, and insulin for DKA management. Surgical consultation was obtained for abdominal wall thickening seen on CT, but no immediate indication for surgery was found. The patient's renal function is worsening, and they have thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 86. Leukocytosis is present, and the differential diagnosis includes line infection or Clostridium difficile infection. Sedation will be switched to provide better pain control. Wound care for bilateral decubitus ulcers is also necessary. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could progress if ventilatory support is inadequate or if there is a worsening of the underlying condition causing respiratory distress.
2. Acute Renal Failure: There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, leading to the need for renal replacement therapy such as dialysis.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: Without appropriate management, the patient's metabolic acidosis could worsen, potentially leading to complications like arrhythmias or increased mortality.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA):"

","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and respiratory failure. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently intubated for airway protection due to their inability to maintain adequate ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors including altered mental status, renal failure, hyperglycemia, hypotension, pneumonia, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and on full ventilatory support. Continued monitoring and management of respiratory function will be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's acidosis is likely due to acute renal failure. Ongoing management of electrolyte imbalances and fluid balance will be required to address this condition.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Insulin therapy should be continued to manage hyperglycemia and prevent further ketone production. Evaluation for precipitants of DKA should also be pursued.
4. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers and evidence of MRSA pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and surgical consultation should be considered if there is concern for abdominal source of infection.
5. Renal Failure: Renal function is worsening, and consultation with a nephrologist is recommended. Diuretics such as Lasix may be used to manage fluid overload.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU with complaints of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and respiratory failure. They have a history of abdominal pain, fever, and copious diarrhea, with a surgical consult called but no acute indication for surgery. The patient's white blood cell count has doubled, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been ruled out. They have allergies to specific antibiotics and are currently receiving insulin, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and other medications.

24-hour events include an abdominal CT showing some bowel wall thickening in the small bowel, with no acute indication for surgery. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, and an oxygen saturation level of 96%. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg, total intake of fluids, and output including urine, NG, stool, and drains. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to PEEP > 10.

Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit (Hct), decreased platelet count (Plt), increased creatinine (Cr), low"

   1.       Resp Failure: intubated for management of acidosis and
   inability to protect his airway. Tried PSV yesterday but when went for
   ABD CT had resp distress and inability to maintain MV to defend his pH
   from met acidosis so back on AC. Rxing with full vent support for
   volume overload, MRSA PNA, and volume overload.
   2.       Metabolic Acidosis: The etiology of which is ARF and
   hyperchloremic met acidosis. We are repleting free water and trying
   diuresis.
   3.       DKA: Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 276**] input, continue IV insulin, and
   evaluation for precipitant ongoing.
   4.       Persistent fevers: clearly has MRSA PNA for which he is on Rx.
   Abd ct shows some bowel wall abnormalities but he is without need for
   surgical intervention.  Follow up cultures and maintain antibiotics.
   5.       Renal function slowly worsening, appreciate renal
   consultation. No acute indication for HD since still urinating but we
   need to use lasix to match I and OI at the least
   6.       Thrombocytopenia: down to 86 this AM DDx is HIT, check AB d/c
   sq hep,, Med effect with Vanco, also Zosyn, and finally TTP
 HUS with
   his renal failure and anemia. Will check peripheral smear, low

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # AMS/Respiratory Support: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process.
   Cardiac etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing
   diabetes. Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning
   for pneumonia.  Intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness.  Did not
   tolerate PSV overnight, switched back to AC. NAG metabolic acidosis
   with blood sugars better controlled.  Requires more vent support
   overnight.  CXR worsening with increased fluid.  Persistent acidosis.
   Elevated WBC.  Still making urine.
   - persistent metabolic acidosis in setting of renal failure
   - sputum cx positive for MRSA
   - cont abx
   - blood culture, UA and urine culture
 NGTD, resend sputum b/c of
   contaminated sample
   - ABG this PM, follow UOP, wean as tolerated
   - possible A-line today
   .
   # Acute renal failure: baseline Cr 0.7, now 2.7 up to 4.5 -> 4.8
   Initially mix pre-renal/ATN in setting of dehydration/hypotension
   secondary to DKA.  Fluid overloaded on exam, continues to make urine.
   -monitor UOP
   -TFs, d/c
d IVF
   -renally dose medications
   -follow BUN, Cr
   - urine lytes today to assess renal fxn
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ? due to rescusitative efforts vs infectious process,
   diarrhea with positive abd exam.  CT yesterday showed possible abcess.
   Abdominal ascites.  Surgery consulted.  Lactate remains normal.  C-diff
   X 1 neg, #2 pending.
   - f/u final CT read
 small bowel wall thickening, rectal wall
   thickening
   - cx pending
   -IV vanco and zosyn, add flagyl for presumptive c-diff
   -follow WBC
   .
   #Anemia: Crit down to 23 transfused 1 unit with Hct up to 26
 up to
   29.2, now at 27.6.  Had melanotic, guaiac positive stool. Now
   diarrhea.
   - changed PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   - C-diff negative X1, will send addt
l pending
   -trend crits
   - guaiac stool today
   .
   Pain/Sedation: Pt on chronic pain meds at home for neuropathy per
   father.  [**Name (NI) 7259**] on propofol for sedation
 will switch to fentanyl
   versed for sedation and pain relief.  Will readdress with pt once
   extubated.
   - switch to fentanyl/versed
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State. Possible
   non-compliance with medications vs. underlying infection, especially in
   setting of CXR findings. Patient has history of ICU admission for
   similar presentation one year ago. It is possible pneumonia is source
   of infection, leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive
   presentation.   Discussed plan with [**Last Name (un) 276**] diabetes
 cont insulin
   drip, fluids and TFs
   -insulin gtt
 change to [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7240**] and ISS when extubated
   -change fing sticks to Q4
   -replete K PRN
   -TFs, d/c fluids
   -monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   -pan-cultures as above
   .
   # AG Metabolic acidosis: In setting of hyperglycemia most likely due to
   DKA. Also with some component of rhabdomyolysis (patient found down,
   unclear for how long).  Acidemia persists with correction of blood
   glucose, major contributor likely now renal failure.  Lactate normal.
   - trend electrolytes, follow AG for resolution
   - follow lactate
   .
   # Multifocal pneumonia: Possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis in
   setting of unresponsive period, also consider community-acquired
   pneumonia vs influenza. Also, given the similar appearance of CXR from
   this and last admission, opacity on film could be pulmonary edema.
   -follow CXRs
   -resend sputum culture
   -blood culture
   -continue IV vanco, zosyn for broad spectrum coverage
   .
   # Hypotension: In setting of DKA with PNA fluid loss vs. sepsis.
   Hemodynamically he required pressors (levophed) on day 1 with minimal
   UOP (450cc total at OSH) and was admitted to ICU with hypothermia.  Now
   off pressors, pressures improved, UOP came up.  Now normo to
   hypertensive.  Resolved.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # AMS/Respiratory Support: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process.
   Cardiac etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing
   diabetes. Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning
   for pneumonia.  Intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness.  Did not
   tolerate PSV overnight, switched back to AC. NAG metabolic acidosis
   with blood sugars better controlled.  Requires more vent support
   overnight.  CXR improved with diuresis overnight.  Acidotic, but
   improved with respiratory compensation and improved renal fxn. WBC down
   to 18.7.  Still making urine.
   - sputum cx positive for MRSA
   - cont abx,
   - blood culture, UA and urine cx
   - ABG/VBG to correlate relationship to d/c fem A-line
   - d/c fem A-line
   .
   # Acute renal failure/ Metabolic acidosis: baseline Cr 0.7, now 2.7 up
   to 4.5 -> 4.8 ->5.0 ->4.5.  Initially mix pre-renal/ATN in setting of
   dehydration/hypotension secondary to DKA.  Decreasing fluid overload,
   continues to make urine.
   -monitor UOP
   -TFs, d/c
d IVF
   - trend electrolytes, follow AG for resolution
   - follow lactate
   - renally dose medications
   - follow BUN, Cr
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ? due to rescusitative efforts vs infectious process,
   diarrhea with positive abd exam.  Lactate remains normal.  C-diff X2.
   Added Flagyl for addtl cover anaerobic infxn -> possible sources in gut
   and mouth.
   -f/u final CT read
 small bowel wall thickening, rectal wall
   thickening
   -cx pending
   -IV vanco and zosyn, flagyl
   -follow WBC, fevers
   -rectal/back exam for ? abcess skin breakdown
   .
   #Anemia: Crit down to 23 transfused 1 unit with Hct up to 26
 up to
   29.2, now at 27.6 stable at 27.5.  Had melanotic, guaiac positive stool
   3 days ago. No diarrhea currently.
   - changed PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   -C-diff negative X2
   -trend crits
   -guaiac stool today
   .
   # Pain/Sedation: Pt on chronic pain meds at home for neuropathy.
   Switched to fentanyl/versed for sedation and pain relief.  Less
   hypertensive and tachycardic.
   - will order fentanyl patches and titer down drip
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of IDDM found unresponsive at home. The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. AMS/Respiratory Support: The patient was intubated due to unresponsiveness and did not tolerate PSV overnight. The switch back to AC mode indicates the need for assisted ventilation. The patient's metabolic acidosis improved with better-controlled blood sugars, and there was an improvement in renal function. The patient is still making urine, which suggests ongoing kidney function. The sputum culture was positive for MRSA, and the patient is being continued on antibiotics.

2. Acute renal failure/Metabolic acidosis: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.7, which has increased to 2.7, 4.5, 5.0, and then decreased to 4.5. This indicates an acute renal failure. Initially, it was thought to be pre-renal/ATN due to dehydration and hypotension secondary to DKA. However, the patient continues to make urine and has improved renal function. The plan includes monitoring urine output, trends in electrolytes, following acid-base balance, and adjusting medication dosages based on renal function.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to the resuscitative efforts or an infectious process. The patient also has diarrhea with a positive"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # AMS/Respiratory Support: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process.
   Cardiac etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing
   diabetes. Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning
   for pneumonia.  Intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness.  Did not
   tolerate PSV overnight, switched back to AC. NAG metabolic acidosis
   with blood sugars better controlled.  Requires more vent support
   overnight.  CXR improved with diuresis overnight.  Persistent acidosis,
   better respiratory compensation with improved renal fxn.  Elevated
   WBC.  Still making urine.
   - persistent metabolic acidosis in setting of renal failure
   - sputum cx positive for MRSA
   - cont abx
   - blood culture, UA and urine culture
 NGTD, resend sputum b/c of
   contaminated sample
   - ABG this PM, follow UOP, wean as tolerated
   - possible A-line today
   .
   # Acute renal failure: baseline Cr 0.7, now 2.7 up to 4.5 -> 4.8
   Initially mix pre-renal/ATN in setting of dehydration/hypotension
   secondary to DKA.  Fluid overloaded on exam, continues to make urine.
   -monitor UOP
   -TFs, d/c
d IVF
   -renally dose medications
   -follow BUN, Cr
   - urine lytes today to assess renal fxn
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ? due to rescusitative efforts vs infectious process,
   diarrhea with positive abd exam.  CT yesterday showed possible abcess.
   Abdominal ascites.  Surgery consulted.  Lactate remains normal.  C-diff
   X 1 neg, #2 pending.
   - f/u final CT read
 small bowel wall thickening, rectal wall
   thickening
   - cx pending
   -IV vanco and zosyn, add flagyl for presumptive c-diff
   -follow WBC
   .
   #Anemia: Crit down to 23 transfused 1 unit with Hct up to 26
 up to
   29.2, now at 27.6.  Had melanotic, guaiac positive stool. Now
   diarrhea.
   - changed PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   - C-diff negative X1, will send addt
l pending
   -trend crits
   - guaiac stool today
   .
   Pain/Sedation: Pt on chronic pain meds at home for neuropathy per
   father.  [**Name (NI) 7259**] on propofol for sedation
 will switch to fentanyl
   versed for sedation and pain relief.  Will readdress with pt once
   extubated.
   - switch to fentanyl/versed
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State. Possible
   non-compliance with medications vs. underlying infection, especially in
   setting of CXR findings. Patient has history of ICU admission for
   similar presentation one year ago. It is possible pneumonia is source
   of infection, leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive

   -change fing sticks to Q4
   -replete K PRN
   -TFs, d/c fluids
   -monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   -pan-cultures as above
   .
   # AG Metabolic acidosis: In setting of hyperglycemia most likely due to
   DKA. Also with some component of rhabdomyolysis (patient found down,
   unclear for how long).  Acidemia persists with correction of blood
   glucose, major contributor likely now renal failure.  Lactate normal.
   - trend electrolytes, follow AG for resolution
   - follow lactate
   .
   # Multifocal pneumonia: Possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis in
   setting of unresponsive period, also consider community-acquired
   pneumonia vs influenza. Also, given the similar appearance of CXR from
   this and last admission, opacity on film could be pulmonary edema.
   -follow CXRs
   -resend sputum culture
   -blood culture
   -continue IV vanco, zosyn for broad spectrum coverage
   .
   # Hypotension: In setting of DKA with PNA fluid loss vs. sepsis.
   Hemodynamically he required pressors (levophed) on day 1 with minimal
   UOP (450cc total at OSH) and was admitted to ICU with hypothermia.  Now
   off pressors, pressures improved, UOP came up.  Now normo to

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with respiratory failure due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). They were intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including metabolic acidosis, renal failure, pneumonia, hyperglycemia, hypotension, and altered mental status. They also have leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and evidence of impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and the respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 60. There is a need to assess the ability of the patient to compensate for metabolic acidosis.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to acute renal failure. The patient is receiving free water repletion and daily bicarbonate supplementation.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's DKA is being managed with IV insulin. Evaluation for precipitants of DKA is ongoing.
4. Persistent Fevers: The patient has an MRSA-positive pneumonia for which they are receiving antibiotics. An abdominal CT shows some bowel wall abnormalities and proctitis, but no surgical intervention is required. Follow-up cultures and continued antibiotic therapy are recommended. Other potential sources of fever, such as an occult dental abscess, should be considered and investigated.
5. Renal Function: The patient's renal function is slowly"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has been intubated due to the inability to protect their airway and acidosis. They are currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 60. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be attempted to assess the patient's ability to compensate for their metabolic acidosis.

The patient also has metabolic acidosis, which is a result of acute renal failure (ARF) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Free water and bicarbonate are being replenished daily.

The patient's DKA is being managed with intravenous insulin. An evaluation for potential precipitants of DKA is ongoing.

Persistent fevers are present, and the patient has MRSA pneumonia for which they are receiving antibiotic treatment. A bowel wall abnormality and proctitis are observed on abdominal CT, but surgical intervention is not required. Cultures are being monitored, and antibiotics will be continued. Other potential sources of infection, such as an occult dental abscess, are also being considered.

Renal function is slowly improving, and a renal consultation is appreciated. Fluid intake should be maintained at not more than 500 cc negative, and free water should be replenished aggressively.

Thrombocytopenia is present, with a platelet count of 93. HIT (heparin-induced thrombocyt"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV). There is a need to monitor the patient's ability to compensate for metabolic acidosis.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis with an etiology of acute renal failure (ARF) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. The treatment involves repleting free water and administering 1 amp bicarb per day.

3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has persistent hyperglycemia, and it is important to continue IV insulin and evaluate for precipitants of DKA.

4. Persistent Fevers: The patient has ongoing fevers, likely due to MRSA pneumonia for which they are receiving antibiotics. Follow-up cultures and continued antibiotic therapy are recommended. Other potential sources of infection, such as occult dental abscess, should also be considered.

5. Renal Function: The patient's renal function is slowly improving, and a renal consultation is appreciated. Aggressive repletion of free water and careful fluid management are advised.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low but stable. HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) is negative. Further evaluation for potential causes like medication effects"

The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have shown persistent fevers, worsening renal function, and altered mental status. They are on mechanical ventilation support and receiving antibiotics for MRSA pneumonia. Other concerns include diarrhea, impaired skin integrity, ineffective coping, hyperglycemia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to protect their airway and maintain adequate ventilation may require prolonged mechanical ventilation support.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to acute renal failure. Repletion of free water and diuresis are being considered.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Insulin therapy will continue to manage the patient's high blood glucose levels, and evaluation for the precipitant of DKA should be ongoing.
4. Persistent Fevers: Despite receiving antibiotics for MRSA pneumonia, the patient's fever persists. Follow-up cultures and maintenance of antibiotic therapy are advised.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is slowly worsening. A renal consultation has been appreciated, and the use of lasix is recommended to match the patient's input/output balance.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and differential diagnoses"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # AMS/Respiratory Support: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process.
   Cardiac etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing
   diabetes. Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning
   for pneumonia.  Intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness.  Did not
   tolerate PSV overnight, switched back to AC. NAG metabolic acidosis
   with blood sugars better controlled.  Requires more vent support
   overnight.  CXR improved with diuresis overnight.  Acidotic, but
   improved with less respiratory compensation and improved renal fxn. WBC
   down to 10.  Still making urine.  RSBI 38.
   - abx PNA for sputum + MRSA
   - blood culture - NGTD
   - fem-line d/c
   - extubate today
   .
   # Acute renal failure/ Metabolic acidosis: baseline Cr 0.7, now 2.7 up
   to 4.5 -> 4.8 ->5.0 ->4.5 -> 5.2 -> 5.1.  Initially mix pre-renal/ATN
   in setting of dehydration/hypotension secondary to DKA.  Decreasing
   fluid overload, continues to make urine.
   -monitor UOP
   -TFs, match fluid balance
   - trend electrolytes, follow AG for resolution
   - renally dose medications
   - follow BUN, Cr
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ? due to rescusitative efforts vs infectious process,
   diarrhea with positive abd exam.  Lactate remains normal.  C-diff X2.
   Added Flagyl for addtl cover anaerobic infxn -> possible sources in gut
   and mouth.  Resolving with current abx therapy.  Afebrile overnight.
   -cx pending
   -IV vanco and zosyn, flagyl
   -follow WBC, fevers
   -rectal/back exam for ? abcess skin breakdown
   .
   #Anemia: Crit down to 23 transfused 1 unit with Hct up to 26
 up to
   29.2, now at 26.5 (previous 27.5).  Had melanotic, guaiac positive
   stool near admission.
   - changed PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   - C-diff negative X2
   - trend crits
   .
   # Pain/Sedation: Pt on chronic pain meds at home for neuropathy.
   Switched to fentanyl/versed for sedation and pain relief.  Less
   hypertensive and tachycardic.
   - on fentanyl patches, turned off fentanyl
   - will address prn once extubated
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State. Possible
   non-compliance with medications vs. underlying infection, especially in
   setting of CXR findings. Patient has history of ICU admission for
   similar presentation one year ago. It is possible pneumonia is source
   of infection, leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive
   presentation.   Discussed plan with [**Last Name (un) 276**] diabetes
 cont insulin
   drip, fluids and TFs
   -on Lantus 10, turned off drip, start ISS
   -change fing sticks to Q4
   -replete K PRN
   -TFs, replace FW
   -monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Pneumonia: Possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis in setting of
   unresponsive period, also consider community-acquired pneumonia vs
   influenza. Also, given the similar appearance of CXR from this and last
   admission, opacity on film could be pulmonary edema.   Sputum cx + for
   MRSA
   -follow CXRs
   -continue IV meds

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # AMS/Respiratory Support: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process.
   Cardiac etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing
   diabetes. Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning
   for pneumonia.  Intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness.  Did not
   tolerate PSV overnight, switched back to AC. NAG metabolic acidosis
   with blood sugars better controlled.  Requires more vent support
   overnight.  CXR improved with diuresis overnight.  Acidotic, but
   improved with respiratory compensation and improved renal fxn. WBC down
   to 18.7.  Still making urine.
   - sputum cx positive for MRSA

   # Acute renal failure/ Metabolic acidosis: baseline Cr 0.7, now 2.7 up
   to 4.5 -> 4.8 ->5.0 ->4.5.  Initially mix pre-renal/ATN in setting of
   dehydration/hypotension secondary to DKA.  Decreasing fluid overload,
   continues to make urine.
   -monitor UOP

   - trend electrolytes, follow AG for resolution
   - follow lactate
   - renally dose medications
   - follow BUN, Cr

   # Leukocytosis: ? due to rescusitative efforts vs infectious process,
   diarrhea with positive abd exam.  Lactate remains normal.  C-diff X2.
   Added Flagyl for addtl cover anaerobic infxn -> possible sources in gut
   and mouth.

   #Anemia: Crit down to 23 transfused 1 unit with Hct up to 26
 up to
   29.2, now at 27.6 stable at 27.5.  Had melanotic, guaiac positive stool
   3 days ago. No diarrhea currently.
   - changed PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   -C-diff negative X2
   -trend crits
   -guaiac stool today
   .
   # Pain/Sedation: Pt on chronic pain meds at home for neuropathy.
   Switched to fentanyl/versed for sedation and pain relief.  Less
   hypertensive and tachycardic.
   - will order fentanyl patches and titer down drip
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State. Possible
   non-compliance with medications vs. underlying infection, especially in
   setting of CXR findings. Patient has history of ICU admission for
   similar presentation one year ago. It is possible pneumonia is source
   of infection, leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive
   presentation.   Discussed plan with [**Last Name (un) 276**] diabetes
 cont insulin
   drip, fluids and TFs
   -insulin gtt
 change to [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 7240**] and ISS when extubated
   -change fing sticks to Q4
   -replete K PRN
   -TFs, replace FW and add bicarb
   -monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   -pan-cultures as above
   .
   # Pneumonia: Possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis in setting of
   unresponsive period, also consider community-acquired pneumonia vs
   influenza. Also, given the similar appearance of CXR from this and last
   admission, opacity on film could be pulmonary edema.   Sputum cx + for
   MRSA
   -follow CXRs
   -continue IV vanco
   .
   # Hypotension: In setting of DKA with PNA fluid loss vs. sepsis.
   Hemodynamically he required pressors (levophed) on day 1 with minimal
   UOP (450cc total at OSH) and was admitted to ICU with hypothermia.  Now
   off pressors, pressures improved, UOP came up.  Now normo to

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of IDDM (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) who was found unresponsive at home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. He has multiple medical complications including:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation due to unresponsiveness and has been on mechanical ventilation. There are concerns about toxic-metabolic vs. infectious causes, with a negative CT head ruling out acute processes in the brain. The patient also shows signs of pneumonia, which could be aspiration pneumonia or community-acquired pneumonia. Sputum culture is positive for MRSA.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient initially had pre-renal and ATN (acute tubular necrosis) secondary to dehydration and hypotension due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). His baseline creatinine was 0.7, which has increased to 4.5, indicating worsening renal function. The patient is still producing urine and needs close monitoring of urine output, electrolyte trends, and adjustment of medications based on renal function.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to rescue efforts or an infectious process. He also has diarrhea with positive abdominal exam findings and C-diff X2. Additional coverage for anaerobic infection is being provided with Flagyl.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with good air movement but coarse breath sounds bilaterally. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 159/71 to 91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature of 37.5Â°C. 

The patient has been receiving several medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), metronidazole, pantoprazole (Protonix), and insulin. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, low albumin, and abnormal arterial blood gas values. 

The patient's assessment and plan include pain control, diarrhea, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, renal failure, respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, hypotension, pneumonia, and others. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, persistent fevers, renal function deterioration, thrombocytopenia, pain management, and glycemic control."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are respiratory failure and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been intubated for management of acidosis and inability to protect their airway. They are on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 60, and a trial spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is planned.

The patient's metabolic acidosis is attributed to acute renal failure (ARF) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. The patient is receiving free water repletion and daily bicarbonate supplementation, which shows an improving trend.

The patient has a history of DKA and is being treated with IV insulin. Evaluation for precipitants is ongoing. Persistent fevers are present, and the patient has methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. Antibiotic treatment is ongoing, and follow-up cultures will be maintained. Bowel wall abnormalities and proctitis are noted on abdominal CT, but surgical intervention is not required. Occult dental abscess is considered as another potential source of infection, and further investigation is planned.

Renal function is slowly improving, and the patient is receiving renal consultation. Fluid management is important to avoid negative fluid balance. Thrombocytopenia is present, but it is not severe. HIT status is negative, and the smear does not show schistocytes. Other causes such as medication effects"

Currently, they are on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 60. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) should be attempted to assess their ability to breathe independently.

The patient has metabolic acidosis, which is a result of acute renal failure (ARF) and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Free water and bicarbonate are being replenished daily, and the trend is improving.

DKA is still present, and IV insulin should continue. Evaluation for precipitants should also be ongoing.

The patient has persistent fevers, likely due to MRSA pneumonia. Antibiotics are being administered, and follow-up cultures will be done. Bowel wall abnormalities and proctitis were observed on an abdominal CT scan, but surgical intervention is not necessary at this time. Further investigation for other potential sources of infection, such as an occult dental abscess, will be pursued.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # AMS/Respiratory Support: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process.
   Cardiac etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing
   diabetes. Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning
   for pneumonia.  Intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness.  Did not
   tolerate PSV overnight, switched back to AC. NAG metabolic acidosis
   with blood sugars better controlled.  Requires more vent support
   overnight.  CXR improved with diuresis overnight.  Acidotic, but
   improved with less respiratory compensation and improved renal fxn. WBC
   down to 10.  Still making urine.  RSBI 38.
   - abx PNA for sputum + MRSA

   # Acute renal failure/ Metabolic acidosis: baseline Cr 0.7, now 2.7 up
   to 4.5 -> 4.8 ->5.0 ->4.5 -> 5.2 -> 5.1.  Initially mix pre-renal/ATN
   in setting of dehydration/hypotension secondary to DKA.  Decreasing
   fluid overload, continues to make urine.
   -monitor UOP

   - trend electrolytes, follow AG for resolution
   - renally dose medications
   - follow BUN, Cr

   # Leukocytosis: ? due to rescusitative efforts vs infectious process,
   diarrhea with positive abd exam.  Lactate remains normal.  C-diff X2.
   Added Flagyl for addtl cover anaerobic infxn -> possible sources in gut
   and mouth.  Resolving with current abx therapy.  Afebrile overnight.

   #Anemia: Crit down to 23 transfused 1 unit with Hct up to 26
 up to
   29.2, now at 26.5 (previous 27.5).  Had melanotic, guaiac positive
   stool near admission.
   - changed PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   - C-diff negative X2
   - trend crits

   # Pain/Sedation: Pt on chronic pain meds at home for neuropathy.
   Switched to fentanyl/versed for sedation and pain relief.  Less
   hypertensive and tachycardic.
   - on fentanyl patches, turned off fentanyl
   - will address prn once extubated

   # Hyperglycemia: DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State. Possible
   non-compliance with medications vs. underlying infection, especially in
   setting of CXR findings. Patient has history of ICU admission for
   similar presentation one year ago. It is possible pneumonia is source
   of infection, leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive
   presentation.   Discussed plan with [**Last Name (un) 276**] diabetes
 cont insulin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of IDDM who was found unresponsive at home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. He was intubated for unresponsiveness and did not tolerate PSV overnight, so he was switched back to AC. His NAG metabolic acidosis has improved, and his blood sugars are better controlled. He requires more vent support overnight. His CXR has improved with diuresis overnight. He is still making urine and has a RSBI of 38.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure/Metabolic Acidosis: The patient initially had a baseline Cr of 0.7, which increased to 2.7, then 4.5, 4.8, 5.0, 4.5, 5.2, and finally 5.1. This indicates a progression of renal dysfunction. Monitoring UOP, TFs, matching fluid balance, trending electrolytes, following AG for resolution, renally dosing medications, and following BUN and Cr are necessary.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated WBC count of 18.7, which may be due to rescue efforts or an infectious process. Diarrhea with a positive abdominal exam was observed, and the patient has a C-diff X2. Flagyl was added for additional coverage of anaerobic infection. The patient's condition is"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Pt was extubated without any difficulty
   - Na decreased from 148 to 142 so decreased free water flushes of NGT
   to q4H from q2H.
   - Put in speech and swallow eval for tomorrow to hopefully remove NGT
   - Decreased UOP, but found to have blocked foley, after flush put out
   800ccs.
   - Vancomycin level at 25.4, held dose
   - Blood sugars have been very elevated requiring multiple 1 time doses
   of humalog, would consider readjusting standing insulin if remains on

The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of IDDM (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) who was found unresponsive at home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. He was intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness and did not tolerate PSV (pressure support ventilation). He was switched back to AC (assistant control) and extubated. The patient's CXR (chest X-ray) improved with diuresis overnight. His acidotic state improved with decreased respiratory compensation and mildly improved renal function. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, acute renal failure, leukocytosis, anemia, hyperglycemia, hypotension, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required respiratory support and was intubated due to unresponsiveness. Although he has been extubated, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure, especially considering the presence of pneumonia.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has shown fluctuations in creatinine levels, indicating potential acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis may indicate DKA, a serious complication of diabetes. Continued monitoring and management of blood glucose levels are crucial.
4. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and there is a possibility of other infections, such"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # AMS/Respiratory Support: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process.
   Cardiac etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing
   diabetes. Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning
   for pneumonia.  Intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness.  Did not
   tolerate PSV overnight, switched back to AC. NAG metabolic acidosis
   with blood sugars better controlled.  Extubated.  CXR improved with
   diuresis overnight.  Acidotic, but improved with decreased respiratory
   compensation and mildly improved renal fxn. WBC down to 10.  Still
   making urine.
   - abx PNA for sputum + MRSA

   # Acute renal failure/ Metabolic acidosis: baseline Cr 0.7, now 2.7 up
   to 4.5 -> 4.8 ->5.0 ->4.5 -> 5.2 -> 5.1.  Initially mix pre-renal/ATN
   in setting of dehydration/hypotension secondary to DKA.  Decreasing
   fluid overload, continues to make urine.
   - monitor UOP
   - switched to POs, match I&O
   - trend electrolytes, follow AG for resolution
   - renally dose medications
   - follow BUN, Cr
   - cont to follow renal recs
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ? due to rescusitative efforts vs infectious process,
   diarrhea with positive abd exam.  Lactate remains normal.  C-diff X2.
   Added Flagyl for addtl cover anaerobic infxn -> possible sources in gut
   and mouth.  Resolving with current abx therapy.  Afebrile overnight.
   - cx pending
   - IV vanco and zosyn, flagyl
   - follow WBC, fevers
   - possible panorex of mouth/ CT Head if signs of infxn return
   .
   #Anemia: Crit down to 23 transfused 1 unit with Hct up to 26
 up to
   29.2, now at 25, last two 26 and 27.  Had melanotic, guaiac positive
   stool near admission.
   - changed PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   - C-diff negative X2
   - trend crits
   .
   # Pain/Sedation: Pt on chronic pain meds at home for neuropathy.
   Switched to fentanyl/versed for sedation and pain relief.  Less
   hypertensive and tachycardic.
   - on fentanyl patch X 2
   - IV Morphine prn for breakthru
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State. Possible
   non-compliance with medications vs. underlying infection, especially in
   setting of CXR findings. Patient has history of ICU admission for
   similar presentation one year ago. It is possible pneumonia is source
   of infection, leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive
   presentation.   [**Last Name (un) 276**] following.

   # Pneumonia: Possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis in setting of
   unresponsive period, also consider community-acquired pneumonia vs
   influenza. Also, given the similar appearance of CXR from this and last
   admission, opacity on film could be pulmonary edema.   Sputum cx + for
   MRSA
   -follow CXRs
   -continue IV meds for total of 10 days (day 7 of Vanco/Zosyn, day 3 of
   Flagyl)

   # Hypotension: In setting of DKA with PNA fluid loss vs. sepsis.
   Hemodynamically he required pressors (levophed) on day 1 with minimal
   UOP (450cc total at OSH) and was admitted to ICU with hypothermia.  Now
   off pressors, pressures improved, UOP came up.  Now normo to

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of IDDM who was found unresponsive at home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. He has been admitted to the ICU for various conditions including AMS/Respiratory Support, Acute Renal Failure/Metabolic Acidosis, Leukocytosis, Anemia, Pain/Sedation, Hyperglycemia, Pneumonia, Hypotension, and FEN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to the previous need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if he develops pneumonia or experiences any complications related to his underlying chronic pulmonary condition.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has had multiple episodes of renal dysfunction, which may progress to AKI if not managed appropriately. Close monitoring of renal function and timely intervention are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

3. Infection: The patient has multiple risk factors for infection, including diabetes, prolonged hospitalization, and immunosuppression. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, and altered mental status, is crucial. Prompt investigation and treatment of any suspected infections are essential.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of IDDM and current hyperglycemia indicate a need for careful management of his blood glucose levels. Frequent monitoring and appropriate insulin therapy are"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 47 year old man with history of IDDM found unresponsive at
   home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   .
   # AMS/Respiratory Support: Toxic-metabolic vs. infectious vs. ingestion
   (? toxicology at OSH). CT head at OSH negative for acute process.
   Cardiac etiology is also possible in a patient with long-standing
   diabetes. Lastly, CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, concerning
   for pneumonia.  Intubated at OSH for unresponsiveness.  Did not
   tolerate PSV overnight, switched back to AC. NAG metabolic acidosis
   with blood sugars better controlled.  Extubated.  CXR improved with
   diuresis overnight.  Acidotic, but improved with decreased respiratory
   compensation and mildly improved renal fxn. WBC down to 10.  Still
   making urine.
   - abx PNA for sputum + MRSA
 total of 10 days
   - blood culture - NGTD
   - attempt to wean O2 support
   .
   # Acute renal failure/ Metabolic acidosis: baseline Cr 0.7, now 2.7 up
   to 4.5 -> 4.8 ->5.0 ->4.5 -> 5.2 -> 5.1.  Initially mix pre-renal/ATN
   in setting of dehydration/hypotension secondary to DKA.  Decreasing
   fluid overload, continues to make urine.
   -monitor UOP
   -TFs, match fluid balance
   - trend electrolytes, follow AG for resolution
   - renally dose medications
   - follow BUN, Cr
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ? due to rescusitative efforts vs infectious process,
   diarrhea with positive abd exam.  Lactate remains normal.  C-diff X2.
   Added Flagyl for addtl cover anaerobic infxn -> possible sources in gut
   and mouth.  Resolving with current abx therapy.  Afebrile overnight.
   -cx pending
   -IV vanco and zosyn, flagyl
   -follow WBC, fevers
   -rectal/back exam for ? abcess skin breakdown
   .
   #Anemia: Crit down to 23 transfused 1 unit with Hct up to 26
 up to
   29.2, now at 26.5 (previous 27.5).  Had melanotic, guaiac positive
   stool near admission.
   - changed PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   - C-diff negative X2
   - trend crits
   .
   # Pain/Sedation: Pt on chronic pain meds at home for neuropathy.
   Switched to fentanyl/versed for sedation and pain relief.  Less
   hypertensive and tachycardic.
   - on fentanyl patches, turned off fentanyl
   - will address prn once extubated
   .
   # Hyperglycemia: DKA vs. Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State. Possible
   non-compliance with medications vs. underlying infection, especially in
   setting of CXR findings. Patient has history of ICU admission for
   similar presentation one year ago. It is possible pneumonia is source
   of infection, leading to metabolic decompensation and unresponsive
   presentation.   Discussed plan with [**Last Name (un) 276**] diabetes
 cont insulin
   drip, fluids and TFs
   -on Lantus 10, turned off drip, start ISS
   -change fing sticks to Q4
   -replete K PRN
   -TFs, replace FW
   -monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Pneumonia: Possible aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis in setting of
   unresponsive period, also consider community-acquired pneumonia vs
   influenza. Also, given the similar appearance of CXR from this and last
   admission, opacity on film could be pulmonary edema.   Sputum cx + for
   MRSA
   -follow CXRs
   -continue IV meds
   .
   # Hypotension: In setting of DKA with PNA fluid loss vs. sepsis.
   Hemodynamically he required pressors (levophed) on day 1 with minimal
   UOP (450cc total at OSH) and was admitted to ICU with hypothermia.  Now
   off pressors, pressures improved, UOP came up.  Now normo to
   hypertensive.  Resolved.
   .
   # FEN: TFs at goal via NGT placed; NPO for now will readdress with
   extubation

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of IDDM who was found unresponsive at home with hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. He has been in the ICU for various conditions including AMS, respiratory support, acute renal failure, leukocytosis, anemia, pain/sedation, hyperglycemia, pneumonia, hypotension, and FEN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to unresponsiveness and inability to tolerate spontaneous ventilation. Although extubated now, there is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if he develops worsening pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has been compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an ongoing infectious process. Continued surveillance for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. Blood transfusion may be required to address this issue.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, leading to frequent hyperglycemic episodes. Tight glycemic control through insulin therapy is essential to prevent further complications.
6. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, potentially secondary to aspiration or community"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Pt was extubated without any difficulty
   - Na decreased from 148 to 142 so decreased free water flushes of NGT
   to q4H from q2H.
   - Put in speech and swallow eval for tomorrow to hopefully remove NGT
   - Decreased UOP, but found to have blocked foley, after flush put out
   800ccs.
   - Vancomycin level at 25.4, held dose
   - Blood sugars have been very elevated requiring multiple 1 time doses
   of humalog, would consider readjusting standing insulin if remains on
   tube feeds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual who was extubated without difficulty. There has been a decrease in sodium levels from 148 to 142, so free water flushes through the nasogastric tube have been decreased to q4H from q2H. The patient is scheduled for a speech and swallow evaluation tomorrow to hopefully remove the nasogastric tube. The patient's urine output has decreased, but it was found that the Foley catheter was blocked. After flushing, 800ccs were output. Vancomycin levels were measured at 25.4, and the dose was held. Blood sugars have been very elevated, requiring multiple one-time doses of Humalog. Standing insulin may need to be readjusted if the patient remains on tube feeds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with complaints of respiratory failure and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has been extubated successfully and is currently on low flow oxygen through a nasal cannula. They are conscious, conversant, and able to sit up in a chair. Physical examination reveals bibasilar rales in the chest, edema, and ecchymoses on the extremities. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.4Â°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 171/67 to 174/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with net inputs and outputs. The patient is receiving various medications, including metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF) / Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has signs of ARF with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The presence of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis suggests a possible etiology of ARF. Fluid management is crucial in this case to avoid volume overload and maintain proper hydration.

2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's high blood glucose levels indicate uncontrolled diabetes."
