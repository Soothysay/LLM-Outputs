","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma. She was admitted to the ICU for tracheal stenosis and intubation. The patient has extensive lymphadenopathy and a right upper lobe mass, along with superior vena cava syndrome (SVC). The plan is to proceed with chemotherapy to decrease tumor burden and alleviate airway obstruction. Radiation oncology does not recommend immediate radiation therapy. Interventional radiology wants to perform a stent placement in the SVC today, pending the response to chemotherapy. The patient's blood counts are expected to nadir at day 10 of the next cycle of chemotherapy. Anemia, elevated liver function tests, and large right pleural effusion are also noted. The patient's code status is set to full code for now. Nutrition is being withheld due to the possibility of an upcoming procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheal stenosis and right mainstem bronchus stenosis: The large tumor burden and significant bulky adenopathy may lead to further obstruction of the airways, causing difficulty in breathing and potential respiratory failure.
2. Metastatic small cell lung carcinoma: The spread of cancer to other organs, such as the liver, can lead to additional complications and reduce the patient's overall prognosis.
3. Superior vena cava syndrome (SVC): The compression of the SVC by the tumor can cause facial and arm swelling"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma. She was admitted to the ICU for tracheal stenosis and intubation. The patient has extensive lymphadenopathy and a right upper lobe mass, which is causing airway obstruction. She also has superior vena cava syndrome (SVC) due to large tumor burden and significant bulky adenopathy.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Tracheal stenosis and right mainstem bronchus stenosis: Large tumor burden and significant bulky adenopathy. The interventional pulmonologist (IP) did a bronchoscopic evaluation and found no central stenosis. The patient's right upper lobe (RUL) bronchus is almost completely obstructed by external compression. It was decided to hold off on chemotherapy for now and not attempt stenting.

2. Metastatic small cell lung carcinoma: Known metastases to the liver. The patient received carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy, with the next cycle scheduled in four weeks.

3. SVC syndrome: Malignancy and bulky adenopathy causing compression. Clinically, the patient has moderate left facial and arm swelling. Radiation oncology consultation recommends holding off on external radiation therapy (XRT) for now. The oncology team wants to wait and see if chemotherapy decreases the size of the tumor before considering stent placement.

4. Large right ple"

   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. There is severe global left ventricular
   hypokinesis to akinesis (LVEF <20%) with sparing of the basal inferior
   and inferolateral walls. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
   with focal hypokinesis of the mid to apical free wall. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion
   which is largest adjacent to the tricuspid annulus and small (<1.0 cm
   around the remainder of the heart). The effusion appears
   circumferential.
   IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular contractile dysfunction with
   sparing of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls (?Takotsubo

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma, who presented to the hospital with superior vena cava syndrome (SVC) and tracheal stenosis. She was intubated due to airway obstruction and received chemotherapy. However, she developed respiratory distress and required reintubation. She remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has a large right pleural effusion, anemia, and elevated liver function tests, which are likely related to her metastatic disease. The patient's cardiac function has declined, with a severe global hypokinesis of the left ventricle and a reduced ejection fraction. There is also evidence of right ventricular hypokinesis. The patient's SVC syndrome has worsened, with complete occlusion of the superior vena cava. The patient's prognosis is grim, and the family has chosen to maintain full code status for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and failure to wean from the ventilator indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. She may require prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's severe global hypokinesis of the left ventricle and reduced ejection fraction suggest impaired cardiac function. This can lead to cardiogenic shock, characterized by hypotension, poor perfusion, and organ dysfunction.
3. Pulmonary Embolism:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a significant smoking history and a diagnosis of metastatic small cell carcinoma of the lung. She presented to an outside hospital with SVC syndrome, airway obstruction, and compression of the right mainstem bronchus, requiring intubation. She was transferred to our hospital for possible airway stenting and intervention on the SVC clot. The patient remained intubated and was stable overnight. During the course of her hospital stay, she developed tracheal stenosis, approximately 80% narrowing of the right upper lobe takeoff, which appeared to be an external compression. Intervention was not indicated at this point per IP service. She required mechanical ventilation for airway protection and weaning of sedation. A spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) was performed to assess for extubation. Due to the development of severe global left ventricular contractile dysfunction with sparing of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls (possibly Takotsubo cardiomyopathy), the patient's extubation was unsuccessful. She experienced tachycardia and hypertension, complaining of anxiety, and subsequently underwent reintubation. Hypotension was also noted post-intubation, requiring NS boluses. An EKG revealed ST elevation in V2, and a cardiac echo showed severe global hypokinesis EF <20% with preserved baso-lateral/inferior wall. The patient's SVC is completely occluded, with worsening stenosis"

   [**4-21**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. There is severe global left ventricular
   hypokinesis to akinesis (LVEF <20%) with sparing of the basal inferior
   and inferolateral walls. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
   with focal hypokinesis of the mid to apical free wall. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion
   which is largest adjacent to the tricuspid annulus and small (<1.0 cm
   around the remainder of the heart). The effusion appears
   circumferential.
   IMPRESSION: Severe global left ventricular contractile dysfunction with
   sparing of the basal inferior and inferolateral walls (?Takotsubo
   cardiomyopathy). Mid to apical right ventricular hypokinesis. Small to
   moderate pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of metastatic small cell carcinoma who was admitted to the ICU for tracheal stenosis. She has a history of cancer, extensive lymphadenopathy, and right upper lobe mass, and is now presenting with superior vena cava syndrome (SVC), cardiomyopathy, and respiratory failure due to tracheal/bronchial stenosis. The patient has been intubated multiple times, including an invasive ventilation event, and has experienced complications such as hypotension, tachycardia, hypertension, and anxiety after extubation. She also has severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with preserved basal inferior and inferolateral walls, which may suggest Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient's condition is complicated by SVC occlusion, large right pleural effusion, anemia, and elevated liver function tests. She is currently on multiple medications including sedatives, antibiotics, and chemotherapy. The family has been informed of her grim prognosis and wishes to maintain full code status for now."

","Summary:
- The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of smoking and metastatic small cell carcinoma of the lung.
- She presented to an outside hospital with SVC syndrome, airway obstruction, and was intubated.
- She received chemotherapy for three days but showed minimal improvement and was transferred to our hospital for possible airway stenting and intervention on SVC clot.
- The patient remains intubated and was stable overnight.
- On the following day, she experienced decreased decadron to 2mg IV q6, sedation weaned, and was extubated.
- Post-extubation, the patient became tachycardic, hypertensive, complained of anxiety, and subsequently was re-intubated.
- She also had hypotension post-intubation requiring 3L NS boluses.
- An echocardiogram showed severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with preserved basal-inferior wall.
- An EKG indicated STE in V2, leading to the initiation of ASA, BB, statin, and ACE-I (held due to BP), and CEs (Trop 0.51->0.47).
- A CTA Chest revealed a completely occluded SVC and worsening stenosis of the right middle lobe/right upper lobe with collapse.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 37.9°C, HR: 95 bpm, BP: 136/66 mmHg, RR: 16 insp/min, SpO2: 100%.
- The patient's blood work showed elevated WBC, Hct, and Troponin-T levels.
- Imaging studies included a chest X-ray showing the tip of the endotracheal tube lying approximately 3 cm above the carina, and a CT scan of the chest revealing an occluded SVC and collapse of the right middle lobe/right upper lobe.
- The patient has a history of cancer, lung, and airway obstruction.
- The patient's current diagnosis includes cardiomyopathy, other (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy), SVC syndrome, and tracheal stenosis.
- The patient's plan includes mechanical ventilation, weaning sedation, assessing for extubation, discontinuing steroids unless onc desires for post-chemo, and observation of symptoms while awaiting the effects of chemotherapy.
- The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer, and VAP precautions.
- The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's compromised respiratory function due to airway obstruction and intubation may lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Cardiac Dysfunction: The severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with preserved basal-inferior wall suggests Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which can result in reduced cardiac output and potentially lead to heart failure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) and is currently experiencing cardiomyopathy, likely due to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The patient also has superior vena cava syndrome (SVC), which is causing airway obstruction in the central/upper region. 

The patient was previously intubated and received invasive ventilation but experienced complications such as tachycardia, hypertension, and anxiety. The patient was extubated but then re-intubated due to hypotension and respiratory distress. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/66 to 176/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. The creatinine level is slightly elevated, but troponin T levels are decreasing. Other lab results show abnormal liver function tests and elevated lactate levels.

Imaging studies reveal a totally occluded superior vena cava, persistent large right effusion with worsened collapse of the right upper and middle lobes, and no pulmonary embolism. The tip of the endotracheal tube lies approximately 3 cm above the carina.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of metastatic small cell carcinoma, who was intubated for tracheal stenosis. She has extensive lymphadenopathy and right upper lobe (RUL) mass, and now presents with new global cardiomyopathy and superior vena cava (SVC) occlusion. The patient's respiratory failure and failure to wean from the ventilator are attributed to a large tumor burden and significant bulky adenopathy. She also has a large right pleural effusion due to malignancy, anemia, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and subclavian thrombus likely caused by malignancy and venous stasis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has globally depressed ejection fraction (EF) with a bump in troponin levels, suggesting mild cardiac injury. This could lead to further deterioration in cardiac function and potentially cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory failure/tracheal/bronchial stenosis: The patient's respiratory failure is worsened by her bulky adenopathy and large tumor burden, which may affect her ability to breathe independently. Tracheal and bronchial stenosis can further impede airflow and lead to respiratory distress.
3. SVC syndrome: The patient has moderate left facial and arm swelling due to SVC compression caused by malignancy and bulky adenopathy. If"

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of metastatic small cell carcinoma, who presented with extensive lymphadenopathy and right upper lobe mass. She had intubation for tracheal stenosis and developed superior vena cava syndrome (SVC), cardiomyopathy, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and large right pleural effusion.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Cardiomyopathy: Global depression of ejection fraction (EF) with mild cardiac injury indicated by elevated troponin levels. The patient is in mild cardiogenic shock, but troponin levels are trending down, suggesting a stress-induced cardiomyopathy rather than coronary artery disease (CAD). Medications include carvedilol, increased captopril, and held TF in anticipation of extubation.
2. Respiratory Failure/Tracheal/Bronchial Stenosis: The patient has a large tumor burden and significant bulky adenopathy, causing intermittent worsening per CT scan. This is affecting her respiratory failure and inability to wean from the ventilator. The patient is also on steroids and has low-grade fever. The plan is to continue sedation as needed, tapering off decadron, and perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) in the morning. If the patient fails extubation, the family will be informed, and an ABG will be done.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of metastatic small cell carcinoma of the lung. She presented to an outside hospital with SVC syndrome and compression of the trachea and right mainstem bronchus, requiring intubation. She received chemotherapy for three days with minimal improvement. She was then transferred to this hospital for possible airway stenting and intervention on the SVC clot. The patient failed extubation attempt on [4-21] with increased work of breathing and respiratory distress, necessitating reintubation. Tracheal stenosis was evaluated by IP service, revealing approximately 80% narrowing of the right upper lobe takeoff appearing as external compression in nature. No intervention was indicated at this point. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation. Effusion was drained, and it was exudative in nature. There is new diffuse hypokinesis (with a small region spared). The etiology of the decline in ejection fraction (EF) is unclear. No significant CK elevation and no diffuse ST elevations make myocarditis unlikely. Minimal EKG changes (single lead) and negative CK/MB make ischemic process unlikely. No evidence of sepsis/mediator suppression of EF. Cardiology consultation is planned, and an echo from OSH will be obtained to ensure that the difference is not related to interpretation/read. SVC syndrome is being treated with an IR-placed SVC stent and anticoagulation. Small cell lung"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma, who was intubated for tracheal stenosis and presented with extensive lymphadenopathy and right upper lobe (RUL) mass. She also has superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and a large right pleural effusion. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has globally depressed ejection fraction (EF) with a bump in troponin levels, suggesting mild cardiac injury. The EKG shows isolated ST elevation in lead V2, and the patient is clinically in mild cardiogenic shock. This may be stress-induced cardiomyopathy, especially given the absence of obvious coronary artery disease. The plan includes monitoring daily EKGs, trending C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, continuing aspirin and beta-blockers, starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), and holding statins due to elevated transaminases.

2. Respiratory Failure/Tracheal/Bronchial Stenosis: The patient has significant bulky adenopathy and large tumor burden, which are causing external airway obstruction. This is likely contributing to her respiratory failure and inability to wean from the ventilator. The plan includes continuing sedation as needed, tapering corticosteroids, and planning for a spontaneous breathing"

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and subsequent cardiac complications. The patient underwent thoracentesis, which revealed exudative pleural effusion with malignant cells. A thoracic CT scan showed extensive infiltration in the right upper lobe (RUL) of the lung, along with a right pleural effusion and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The patient also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right subclavian vein, for which an inferior vena cava (IVC) stent was placed.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 111/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 189 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 27.2 mmol/L, and elevated troponin-T levels. Imaging studies reveal a right pleural effusion with malignant cells,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU due to an acute exacerbation of their underlying lung cancer. They were placed on invasive ventilation but had a ventilator stoppage, which was resolved without complications. The patient also experienced a fall at night and required extubation. Post-extubation, they exhibited delirium and paranoia, refusing care, and were given Haldol 0.5mg IV. The patient has a history of cancer, with the most recent diagnosis being a malignant neoplasm of the lung. They have been diagnosed with a subclavian vein thrombus and are currently receiving heparin gtt. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/73 to 126/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and they have a positive troponin T level of 0.52. Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 8.7, hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 197 K/uL. Other lab results indicate elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), and amylase. The patient's electrolyte levels"

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma. She has been admitted to the ICU for stridor and respiratory distress due to extensive lymphadenopathy and right upper lobe (RUL) mass compressing the right bronchus and trachea, as well as superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. She underwent intubation, removal of 1.5 liters of pleural fluid, and placement of an SVC stent. The patient is now extubated and doing well.

The patient's medical history includes known metastases to the liver, complete compression of the RUL bronchus with resultant RUL collapse, non-obstructive tracheal compression, and complete occlusion of the SVC. She received chemotherapy on 4/16 with carboplatin and etoposide, and her white blood cell (WBC) count is nadiring at 483 granulocytes. She also has a large right-sided exudative effusion that was tapped on 4/22.

The patient's current condition includes acute pleural effusion, cardiomyopathy, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the lung, and SVC syndrome. She has globally depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 20% with a bump in troponin to suggest mild cardiac injury. The EKG shows isolated ST elevation in"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of metastatic small cell carcinoma. She was intubated for stridor and respiratory distress due to extensive lymphadenopathy and right upper lobe mass compressing the right upper lobe bronchus and trachea, as well as superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. The patient underwent removal of 1.5L pleural fluid and was extubated successfully. She is currently on chemotherapy, which is causing neutropenia.

The patient has several medical complications, including acute pleural effusion, cardiomyopathy, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, SVC syndrome, and anemia. The pleural effusion was tapped and found to be exudative without evidence of infection. The patient received carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy, and her sputum culture showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, indicating a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Therefore, she was started on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam.

The patient's cardiomyopathy is thought to be toxic due to chemotherapy or viral myocarditis. She has a globally depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 20% and elevated troponin levels. The patient also has moderate left facial and arm swelling due to SVC syndrome, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of metastatic small cell carcinoma who presented to the ICU for intubation due to tracheal stenosis. She has extensive lymphadenopathy and a right upper lobe mass, which has led to superior vena cava syndrome (SVC). The patient underwent unsuccessful extubation and was reintubated due to respiratory failure. She has been experiencing global cardiomyopathy and occlusion of the SVC.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has globally depressed ejection fraction (EF) with a bump in troponin, suggesting mild cardiac injury. EKG shows isolated ST elevation in V2, and the patient is clinically in mild cardiogenic shock. Troponin levels are trending down, and it is likely stress-induced cardiomyopathy. There are no obvious signs of coronary artery disease (CAD).

2. Respiratory Failure/Tracheal/Bronchial Stenosis: The patient has large tumor burden and significant bulky adenopathy, causing intermittent worsening per CT. This is affecting her respiratory failure and failure to wean. She also has low-grade fever on steroids. 

3. Metastatic Small Cell Lung Carcinoma: The patient has known metastases to the liver. She received carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy from [Date range (1) 6929]. Chemo is scheduled in 4 weeks.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name 404] is a 52-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma. She has undergone intubation for stridor and respiratory distress, extensive lymphadenopathy, and right upper lobe (RUL) mass compressing the right upper lobe bronchus and trachea, as well as superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. She has also had a large right-sided exudative effusion that was tapped on 04/22/21. She is currently extubated and doing well.

Medical Complications:
1. Pleural Effusion, Acute: Ms. [Known Last Name 404] has a large right-sided exudative effusion that was tapped on 04/22/21. The effusion is likely due to malignancy.

2. Cardiomyopathy: Ms. [Known Last Name 404] has a globally depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 20% with a bump in troponin levels, suggesting mild cardiac injury. The cause is likely toxic cardiomyopathy secondary to chemotherapy or viral myocarditis. Further evaluation by cardiology is recommended.

3. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT), Upper Extremity: Ms. [Known Last Name 404] has a subclavian thrombus found on venogram. She should be monitored for symptoms and switched to low molecular weight heparin (lovenox"

   Assessment and Plan
   52F 30 pack year smoking history presented [**2161-4-8**] to outside hospital
   diagnoses with metastatic small cell carcinoma of the lung.  Developed
   SVC syndrome, and compression trachea and right mainstem bronchus
   requiring intubation at OSH.   Received chemo for 3 days with minimal
   improvement.  Transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for possible airway stenting and
   intervention on SVC clot.   Pt failed extubation attempt on [**4-21**].
   Effusion drained.  Successfully extubated [**4-23**].
   Tracheal stenosis
   -IP service evaluated - no significant treacheal stenosis but did have
   ~80% narrowing RUL takeoff appearing external compression in nature
   -no intervention indicated at this point
   Mech ventilation
   -successfully extubated yesterday
   -now on room air with good sats
   Effusion
   - drained. Exudative, await cytology.
   -lung fields clear after effusion drained.  No infiltrate noted.  Can
   d/c abx given neg cultures.  Close obs.  Low threshold to restart given
   neutropenic.
   New diffuse hypokinesis (small region spared)
   -etiology of decline in EF/[**Name (NI) 6976**] unclear
   -no sig CK elevation and no diffuse ST elevations make mycocarditis
   unlikely
   -minimal EKG changes (single lead) and neg CK/MB make ischemic process
   unlikely
   -no evidence of sepsis/mediator suppression of EF
   SVC syndrome
   - IR placed SVC stent
   - thrombosis noted in SVC, anticoagulation started
   -transition heparin to LMW heparin
   Small cell lung cancer
   -s/p chemo
   -neutropenic as of today. Precautions started
   Remainder of plan per resident note

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of smoking and diagnosed with metastatic small cell lung cancer. She presented to an outside hospital with symptoms of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and tracheal compression, requiring intubation. The patient received chemotherapy for three days but showed minimal improvement. She was then transferred to another hospital for possible airway stenting and intervention on the SVC clot. The patient failed extubation attempt on 4/21 but successfully extubated on 4/23.

The patient's current condition includes tracheal stenosis with approximately 80% narrowing of the right upper lobe takeoff, which appears to be external compression in nature. There is no significant tracheal stenosis indicated by the IP service evaluation. The patient is currently on room air with good oxygen saturation levels.

The patient also has an effusion that has been drained, which is exudative, and cytology is awaited. After the drainage, the lung fields are clear, and no infiltrate is noted. Antibiotics have been discontinued due to negative cultures. The patient will be closely observed, and there is a low threshold to restart antibiotics given her neutropenic status.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing new diffuse hypokinesis with a small region spared. The etiology of the decline in ejection fraction (EF) is unclear. There are no significant CK elevation or diffuse ST elevations"
