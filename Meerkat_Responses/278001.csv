","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), diabetes mellitus type II, Parkinson's disease, chronic renal failure, cholelithiasis, and anxiety. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further management.

24-hour events include light-headedness after taking allopurinol and rash/itching following the last dose of antibiotics. The patient is receiving continuous infusions of heparin sodium and nitroglycerin. Other medications include ICU-specific medications.

Vital signs show stable temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate, but slightly low blood pressure. Oxygen saturation remains at 99% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also noted.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. Renal function tests indicate elevated creatinine levels, while liver function tests are within normal limits. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium. Blood glucose is elevated.

The patient has a history of ACS, DM type II, Parkinson's disease, chronic renal failure, cholelithiasis, and anxiety. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with multiple health conditions including diabetes mellitus, type II, coronary artery disease, chronic renal failure, cholelithiasis, anxiety, and Parkinson's disease. He presented with chest pain and EKG changes while recovering from a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

The patient's symptoms and test results suggest that he is experiencing acute coronary syndrome (ACS), possibly unstable angina or coronary ischemia. His cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating active ischemia, and he has a history of significant coronary artery disease with previous percutaneous coronary interventions.

The patient is currently receiving treatment with heparin drip, aspirin, Plavix, and metoprolol for his ACS. It is recommended that he undergoes cardiac catheterization as soon as possible.

Other ongoing treatments and plans include managing hypertension with metoprolol and valsartan, monitoring fluid status and continuing home dose lasix for acute systolic congestive heart failure, holding coumadin in setting of possible cardiac catheterization for atrial fibrillation, managing diabetes mellitus with insulin sliding scale and holding glipizide, continuing Parkinson's disease medication, and holding colchicine in setting of potential acute coronary syndrome.

The patient's current disposition is in the CCU (Cardiac Care Unit)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and Parkinson's disease. He presented with chest pain and EKG changes during recovery from a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The chest pain was relieved with nitro and foley placement, and EKG changes resolved with resolution of chest pain. The patient likely experienced demand ischemia or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). He is currently being treated with heparin, aspirin, Plavix, metoprolol, and may undergo cardiac catheterization tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's symptoms of chest pain, EKG changes, and history of significant coronary artery disease suggest a possible ACS. This is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.
2. Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's low blood pressure, decreased urine output, and evidence of fluid overload on the flow sheet indicate the possibility of acute systolic congestive heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid status and continuation of diuretic therapy are recommended.
3. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressure readings indicate uncontrolled hypertension. Continuing the current antihypertensive medications and monitoring blood pressure regularly are necessary.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output raise concerns about potential renal failure. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting fluid and medication regimens accordingly are important.
5. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate poorly controlled diabetes. Insulin sliding scale and glipizide should be continued to manage blood sugar levels effectively.
6. Parkinson's Disease: The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease, and it is essential to continue his medication regimen to manage symptoms.
7. Cholelithiasis: The patient recently underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, so monitoring for postoperative complications such as infection or biliary colic is necessary.
8. Anxiety: The patient's presentation and medical history suggest anxiety, which may require further evaluation and management.

It is crucial for the patient's well-being to address these potential medical complications promptly and effectively."

","The patient is a 74-year-old man with a medical history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and Parkinson's disease. He presented with chest pain and EKG changes during his recovery from a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The chest pain was relieved with nitro and foley placement, and the EKG changes resolved as well. The patient's current condition suggests demand ischemia versus acute coronary syndrome. He is currently on a heparin drip, aspirin, Plavix, and metoprolol. There are plans to potentially perform a cardiac catheterization tomorrow.

The patient also has other medical conditions such as hypertension, acute systolic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, gout, and migraines. His medications include insulin sliding scale and glipizide for diabetes, Seligiline for Parkinson's disease, and Dilaudid for pain management.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count and troponin-T levels, indicating possible cardiac injury. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium (K+). The patient's renal function tests indicate chronic renal failure with an elevated creatinine level.

The patient is currently in the ICU and will remain there for further management. His nutritional needs will be monitored, and glycemic control will be maintained through insulin therapy. The patient has multiple IV lines in place for medication administration and fluid management. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis"

The chest pain was relieved with nitro and Foley placement, and EKG changes resolved with resolution of chest pain. The patient has a history of significant coronary artery disease, with multiple percutaneous coronary interventions.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's presentation with chest pain and EKG changes suggests the possibility of ACS. This condition requires immediate attention and management.

2. Chronic Renal Failure (CRF): The patient has chronic renal failure, which can lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and anemia.

3. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient has type II diabetes, which needs to be managed carefully to prevent complications such as hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis.

4. Cholelithiasis: The patient recently underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and there is a risk of complications such as bile duct injury, infection, or persistent pain.

5. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may be exacerbated by the current medical situation and requires appropriate management to ensure patient comfort and well-being.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and previous percutaneous coronary interventions. He presented with chest pain and EKG changes while recovering from a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. His cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating active ischemia. The patient is currently being treated with heparin, aspirin, Plavix, and metoprolol. It is recommended to proceed with a cardiac catheterization today. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) - The patient's symptoms, EKG changes, and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest ongoing myocardial ischemia.
2. Chronic renal failure (CRF) - The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, which may worsen due to the current condition.
3. Hypertension - The patient has a history of hypertension, and it may require further management.
4. Diabetes mellitus (DM) - The patient has type II diabetes, which needs to be controlled with insulin sliding scale and possibly adjustments in medication.
5. Parkinson's disease - The patient has Parkinson's disease, and his current medications should be continued.
6. Cholelithiasis - The patient recently underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and postoperative complications like biliary colic or cholecystitis should be monitored.
7. Anxiety - The patient has a documented anxiety disorder, and appropriate management should be considered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with diabetes and coronary artery disease who presented with chest pain and EKG changes after undergoing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He has a history of significant coronary artery disease and has undergone multiple percutaneous coronary interventions. The patient's chest pain was relieved with nitro and foley placement, and his EKG changes resolved with the resolution of chest pain. However, his cardiac enzymes indicate active ischemia (CK 1868/CKMB 143/Troponin-T 3.88), suggesting a likely culprit artery in the left circumflex (LCX) or posterior descending (PAD). The patient underwent thrombectomy with drug-eluting stent placement in the LCX. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient's presentation with chest pain, EKG changes, and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest an acute coronary syndrome.
2. Hypertension: The patient had hypertension during recovery from surgery, which may require further evaluation and management.
3. Acute blood loss: The patient passed multiple blood clots per rectum overnight, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to address the blood loss and improve his hematocrit level.
4. Cholecystectomy: The patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which can cause postoperative complications such as infection or bile leak.
5. Systolic congestive heart failure"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided information. However, there are several significant events mentioned in the 24-hour progress note. The patient underwent a thrombectomy with drug-eluting stent (DES) to the left circumflex artery (LCX) at the cath lab. After the procedure, the patient experienced mild pain near the xiphoid area and received Dilaudid 0.5 mg.

The patient is on aspirin (ASA) indefinitely and Plavix for at least one year. The femoral sheath was pulled at 14:30, and a post-cath check at 20:30 hours was normal. The patient passed five to seventeen blood clots per rectum with a bowel movement. It is noted that the patient had radiation colitis, as seen on a previous c-scope examination by the GI specialist last month. The patient was given one unit of blood, and Integrilin was stopped early.

The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, unknown allergens for Presantine (Dipyridamole) and Allopurinol, light-headedness from Cipro IV, and rash and itching from Allopurinol. The last dose of antibiotics was not specified.

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature range is 36.9 to 37.1 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranges from 114/62 to 128/80 mmHg, heart rate is between 70 and 89 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 13 to 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received various infusions and other ICU medications, including asa, Plavix, Dilaudid, and Integrilin. The patient also takes other medications, but they are not specified in the provided information.

There are no changes mentioned in the patient's medical and family history. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent events.

The flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant information. The patient's lab results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and glucose, along with decreased levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit. The white blood cell count, platelet count, and electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-appearing male in pain, oriented x3, with appropriate mood and affect. There are no significant findings in the cardiac, lung, or abdominal examinations. The patient's extremities have no pulses abnormalities, and there are no skin abnormalities noted.

The patient's assessment and plan include gastrointestinal bleed, acute coronary syndrome, diabetes mellitus type II, Parkinson's disease, chronic renal failure, cholelithiasis, and anxiety. The ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (D"

The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He presented with chest pain and EKG changes, leading to a thrombectomy with drug-eluting stent placement in the left circumflex artery at the cath lab. The patient also experienced mild pain near the xiphoid area, for which he received dilaudid 0.5 mg. He has been prescribed ASA indefinitely, Plavix for at least one year, and is no longer on integrilin.

The patient passed 5-17 blood clots per rectum with his bowel movement and received 1 unit of blood. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/62 to 128/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. His physical examination shows no abnormalities in the HEENT, neck, or extremities, but there is tenderness in the abdomen and no femoral bruits.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of potassium, glucose, and troponin T, while the WBC count has decreased from 10.9 to 9.1. The Hct has improved from 28.6 to 31.6 after receiving 1 unit of packed red blood cells. Other lab values such as creatinine"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, who presented with chest pain and EKG changes. He underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and then experienced urinary retention and hypertension. The patient received nitro and had a Foley catheter placement, which relieved his chest pain, and EKG changes resolved as well. However, his cardiac enzymes indicate active ischemia (CK 1868/CKMB 143/Troponin-T 3.88). He was likely experiencing ischemia in the left circumflex artery (LCX) or posterior descending artery (PDA). The patient was continued on heparin drip, aspirin, Plavix, and metoprolol. He subsequently underwent thrombectomy with drug-eluting stent placement to the LCX at the cath lab.

The patient also had an episode of acute blood loss overnight, passing 5-17 blood clots per rectum. He has a history of radiation colitis, for which he received 1 unit of blood. The patient's white blood cell count dropped from 11.1 to 9.1 after the blood transfusion.

Additionally, the patient has other medical conditions such as hypertension, acute systolic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, gout, migraine, and cluster headaches.

","The patient is a 74-year-old man with diabetes and coronary artery disease, presenting with chest pain and EKG changes after undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He has undergone a thrombectomy with drug-eluting stent placement in the left circumflex artery at the cath lab. The patient's symptoms include mild pain near the xiphoid area, lower abdominal discomfort, increased flatus, and passing 5-17 blood clots per rectum. He has received Dilaudid 0.5 mg for pain relief. The patient is on asa indefinitely and Plavix for at least one year. His femoral sheath was pulled at 14:30, and a post-cath check at 20:30 hours was normal.

The patient has a history of significant coronary artery disease, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions, diabetes, hypertension, and Parkinson's disease. His cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating active ischemia likely involving the LCX or posterior descending artery. He has been continued on heparin drip, aspirin, Plavix, and metoprolol.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 74 year old man with diabetes, coronary artery
   disease, presenting with chest pain and ekg changes in the setting of
   hypertension while recovering from laparoscopic cholecystectomy, now
   s/p thrombectomy with DES to LCX at cath lab.
   .
   # CORONARIES: History of significant coronary artery disease s/p
   multiple percutaneous coronary interventions.  Current chest pain
   accompanied by ekg changes and new depressed ejection fraction, along
   with posterior wall hypokinesis.  The chest pain was in the setting of
   urinary retention and hypertension, and was relieved with nitro and
   foley placement.  In addition, ekg changes resolved with resolution of
   chest pain.  At the time patient thought to either have demand ischemia
   vs. acute coronary syndrome.  However, his cardiac enzymes are
   consistent with active ischemia (CK1868/CKMB143/Trops 3.88).  Likely
   c/w LCX or PAD.  Continued on heparin drip, aspirin, plavix,
   metoprolol.  Now s/p thrombectomy with DES to LCX at cath lab.
   -aspirin 325mg indefinitely
   -plavix 75 mg for at least 1 year

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of diabetes and coronary artery disease. He presented with chest pain and EKG changes while recovering from laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patient underwent thrombectomy with DES to the left circumflex artery (LCX) at the cath lab. He complains of mild pain near the xiphoid area, which was relieved with Dilaudid. The patient is to be on aspirin indefinitely and Plavix for at least one year. The femoral sheath was pulled at 14:30, and a post-cath check at 20:30 hours showed normal findings. The patient passed 5-17 blood clots per rectum with bowel movement and has a history of radiation colitis. He received one unit of blood and integrilin was stopped early. The patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness overnight, but reports lower abdominal discomfort and increased flatus. Allergies include penicillins, unknown; persantine (oral) (dipyridamole), unknown; and allopurinol, causing light-headedness. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 114/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per"

   multiple percutaneous coronary interventions.  Current chest pain
   accompanied by ekg changes and new depressed ejection fraction, along
   with posterior wall hypokinesis.  The chest pain was in the setting of
   urinary retention and hypertension, and was relieved with nitro and
   foley placement.  In addition, ekg changes resolved with resolution of
   chest pain.  At the time patient thought to either have demand ischemia
   vs. acute coronary syndrome.  However, his cardiac enzymes are
   consistent with active ischemia (CK1868/CKMB143/Trops 3.88).  Likely
   c/w LCX or PAD.  Continued on heparin drip, aspirin, plavix,
   metoprolol.  Now s/p thrombectomy with DES to LCX at cath lab.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with diabetes and coronary artery disease who presented with chest pain and EKG changes after recovering from a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He underwent thrombectomy with drug-eluting stent placement to the left circumflex artery (LCX) at the cath lab. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 139 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure of 87/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including Diltiazem, antibiotics, and other ICU medications.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 1.4 mg/dL, glucose at 166 mg/dL, white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 8.5 to 10.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 28.6% to 31.6%, and platelet count (Plt) ranging from 119 to 156 K/uL. Troponin-T levels are elevated at 3.88 ng/mL, and CK-MB level is also elevated at 143 U/L.

The patient has several medical conditions including coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, acute systolic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2197-8-30**]:  Transfused 1 unit pRBCs with appropriate Hct bump from 28.6
   to 31.  Patient's Foley clotted off in the early afternoon.  Manual
   irrigation did not work.  Urology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and they suggested
   changing the Foley from the regular 16 French to 20 French 3-way.  This
   was done and he started draining tea-colored urine after manual
   irrigation.  If it clots off again, manual irrigation will be re-tried
   and if that doesn't work CBI will be started.  GI consulted about GI
   bleed from radiation proctitis.  They would like to try Carafate enemas
   (2 grams twice daily-will take effect after 4-6 weeks) first to try to
   soothe the colitis.  Will have to call pharmacy to get these enemas
   because they are not on formulary.  If this does not work, they will
   perform a flex sig with argon laser coagulation of bleeding colitis
   (likely Friday per cardiac recs for post MI procedures unless patient
   begins having more significant bleed). Make sure to inform GI one day
   before if we want to do procedure so they can put him on schedule.
   -@10PM: Patient's systolic BP dipped to 70s after dosing metoprolol.
   Given 250cc bolus.

The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (Hct improved from 28.6 to 31.6) due to overnight blood clots per rectum. His WBC count dropped from 11.1 to 9.1. The patient's hypertension is being managed with metoprolol, and valsartan is held for now. He also has acute systolic congestive heart failure, for which fluid status is being monitored, and he is continuing home dose lasix. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on amiodarone. His INR is trending down. Diabetes mellitus is being managed with insulin sliding scale and holding glipizide. Other conditions such as Parkinson's disease, gout, migraine, and cluster headaches are being treated accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient's presentation with chest pain, EKG changes, and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest ongoing ischemia,"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2197-8-30**]:  Transfused 1 unit pRBCs with appropriate Hct bump from 28.6
   to 31.  Patient's Foley clotted off in the early afternoon.  Manual
   irrigation did not work.  Urology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and they suggested
   changing the Foley from the regular 16 French to 20 French 3-way.  This
   was done and he started draining tea-colored urine after manual
   irrigation.  If it clots off again, manual irrigation will be re-tried
   and if that doesn't work CBI will be started.  GI consulted about GI
   bleed from radiation proctitis.  They would like to try Carafate enemas
   (2 grams twice daily-will take effect after 4-6 weeks) first to try to
   soothe the colitis.  Will have to call pharmacy to get these enemas
   because they are not on formulary.  If this does not work, they will
   perform a flex sig with argon laser coagulation of bleeding colitis
   (likely Friday per cardiac recs for post MI procedures unless patient
   begins having more significant bleed). Make sure to inform GI one day
   before if we want to do procedure so they can put him on schedule.
   -@10PM: Patient's systolic BP dipped to 70s after dosing metoprolol.
   Given 250cc bolus.
   -@11:30PM: Patient's systolic again in 70s with HR irregular and in the
   140s-150s.  Given 250cc bolus.
   -@1:30AM: SBP in 100s, lungs clear, given another 250cc bolus to
   increase pressure in order for rate control to be started with
   diltiazem 10mg IV once. Did not work, HR still up to 150s.  No active
   GI bleeding since this AM, hematuria resolved.
   -@3:50AM: another 250cc bolus for refractory Afib.  given amiodarone
   150mg IV bolus-> still fast rate but improved BP.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 74 year old man with diabetes, coronary artery
   disease, presenting with chest pain and ekg changes in the setting of
   hypertension while recovering from laparoscopic cholecystectomy, now
   s/p thrombectomy with DES to LCX at cath lab.
   .
   # CORONARIES: History of significant coronary artery disease s/p
   multiple percutaneous coronary interventions.  Current chest pain
   accompanied by ekg changes and new depressed ejection fraction, along
   with posterior wall hypokinesis.  The chest pain was in the setting of
   urinary retention and hypertension, and was relieved with nitro and
   foley placement.  In addition, ekg changes resolved with resolution of
   chest pain.  At the time patient thought to either have demand ischemia
   vs. acute coronary syndrome.  However, his cardiac enzymes are
   consistent with active ischemia (CK1868/CKMB143/Trops 3.88).  Likely
   c/w LCX or PAD.  Continued on heparin drip, aspirin, plavix,
   metoprolol.  Now s/p thrombectomy with DES to LCX at cath lab.
   -aspirin 325mg indefinitely
   -plavix 75 mg for at least 1 year
   -now off integrilin (d/c
d early secondary to blood per rectum)
   -holding home dose of metoprolol now given multiple hypotensive
   episodes
   .
   # Acute blood loss: had frank blood in cathether yesterday as well as
   continued clots per rectum.  GI came and evaluated patient- recommended
   carafate enemas and flex sig on Friday.  Bleeding improved overnight-
   no frank blood in catheter this AM.
   -received 2U pRBCs on [**8-29**] (Hct improved from 28.6 to 31.6)
   -stable at 30.5 tonight.
   -re-check Hct at 3PM
   -remove foley this AM
   .
   # Cholecystectomy: POD 2.  Elevated white count s/p procedure. Surgery
   following. will advance diet to low fat.
   -stable WBC this AM (9.2)
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - give metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] today
   -monitor pressures
   -restart home dose meds when BP return to baseline
   .
   # Acute Systolic Congestive heart failure: Monitor fluid status and
   continue home dose lasix.
   - hold home metoprolol and valsartan for now.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Holding coumadin in setting of possible cardiac
   catheterization.  continue and metoprolol.
   -amiodarone gtt at 1mg
   -decrease amiodarone to .5mg for 18hrs.  After 24hrs, switch to PO
   amiodarone
   -INR is trending down
   .
   # Diabetes mellitis: insulin sliding scale, holding glipizide
   -Glucose levels better controlled this AM
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: continue seligiline
   .
   # Gout: Will restart colchicine today.
   .
   # Migraine and cluster headaches: dilaudid.
   .
   # Deconditioning
   -PT consulted yesterday- recs pending

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old man with diabetes and coronary artery disease who presented with chest pain and EKG changes after undergoing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He was found to have significant coronary artery disease and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with direct stent placement to the left circumflex artery (LCX). The patient's symptoms improved with nitro and Foley placement, but he later developed urinary retention and hypertension. He experienced chest pain accompanied by EKG changes and showed signs of acute systolic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and elevated cardiac enzymes consistent with active ischemia. The patient underwent thrombectomy with drug-eluting stent (DES) placement to the LCX at the cath lab. 

The patient has a history of significant coronary artery disease, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions, and is currently on heparin drip, aspirin, Plavix, and metoprolol. He is also being treated for acute blood loss with Carafate enemas and flexible sigmoidoscopy scheduled for Friday. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) on [8-29] to improve his hematocrit level. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 139 beats per minute (bpm) with irregular rhythm, blood pressure of 87/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths"

   # CORONARIES: History of significant coronary artery disease s/p
   multiple percutaneous coronary interventions.  Current chest pain
   accompanied by ekg changes and new depressed ejection fraction, along
   with posterior wall hypokinesis.  The chest pain was in the setting of
   urinary retention and hypertension, and was relieved with nitro and
   foley placement.  In addition, ekg changes resolved with resolution of
   chest pain.  At the time patient thought to either have demand ischemia
   vs. acute coronary syndrome.  However, his cardiac enzymes are
   consistent with active ischemia (CK1868/CKMB143/Trops 3.88).  Likely
   c/w LCX or PAD.  Continued on heparin drip, aspirin, plavix,
   metoprolol.  Now s/p thrombectomy with DES to LCX at cath lab.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, who presented with chest pain and EKG changes after undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He was found to have significant coronary artery disease and underwent thrombectomy with drug-eluting stent placement in the left circumflex artery. The patient experienced urinary retention, hypertension, and subsequent relief of chest pain with nitro and Foley catheter placement. EKG changes also resolved. The patient's cardiac enzymes indicate active ischemia, likely involving the LCX or posterior descending artery. He is currently on heparin drip, aspirin, and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient's presentation with chest pain, EKG changes, and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest ongoing myocardial ischemia. Close monitoring and continued management with antiplatelet therapy and beta-blockers are necessary to prevent further cardiac events.
2. Hypertension: The patient has had multiple episodes of hypotension, likely due to excessive antihypertensive medication administration. It is important to closely monitor blood pressure and adjust medication dosages accordingly to avoid significant fluctuations.
3. Urinary Retention: The patient initially experienced urinary retention, which was relieved with Foley catheter placement. It is important to ensure adequate bladder emptying to prevent complications such as urinary tract infections or renal dysfunction.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2197-8-30**]:  Transfused 1 unit pRBCs with appropriate Hct bump from 28.6
   to 31.  Patient's Foley clotted off in the early afternoon.  Manual
   irrigation did not work.  Urology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and they suggested
   changing the Foley from the regular 16 French to 20 French 3-way.  This
   was done and he started draining tea-colored urine after manual
   irrigation.  If it clots off again, manual irrigation will be re-tried
   and if that doesn't work CBI will be started.  GI consulted about GI
   bleed from radiation proctitis.  They would like to try Carafate enemas
   (2 grams twice daily-will take effect after 4-6 weeks) first to try to
   soothe the colitis.  Will have to call pharmacy to get these enemas
   because they are not on formulary.  If this does not work, they will
   perform a flex sig with argon laser coagulation of bleeding colitis
   (likely Friday per cardiac recs for post MI procedures unless patient
   begins having more significant bleed). Make sure to inform GI one day
   before if we want to do procedure so they can put him on schedule.
   -@10PM: Patient's systolic BP dipped to 70s after dosing metoprolol.
   Given 250cc bolus.
   -@11:30PM: Patient's systolic again in 70s with HR irregular and in the

   -@1:30AM: SBP in 100s, lungs clear, given another 250cc bolus to
   increase pressure in order for rate control to be started with
   diltiazem 10mg IV once. Did not work, HR still up to 150s.  No active
   GI bleeding since this AM, hematuria resolved.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of diabetes and coronary artery disease. He presented with chest pain and EKG changes in the setting of hypertension while recovering from laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patient underwent thrombectomy with drug-eluting stent placement to the left circumflex artery at the cath lab.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The patient's symptoms, including chest pain and EKG changes, suggest the possibility of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). ACS refers to a range of conditions, including unstable angina and myocardial infarction, which are caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm. This condition can lead to decreased cardiac output, blood clots, and an increased risk of stroke if not managed appropriately.

3. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressure readings indicate uncontrolled hypertension. Untreated hypertension can result in damage to various organs, including the heart, kidneys, and blood vessels.

4. Acute Blood Loss: The patient had frank blood in the catheter and clots per rectum, suggesting acute blood loss. This can cause hypotension and anemia if significant blood volume is lost.

5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as tea-colored urine and the need for Car"

   multiple percutaneous coronary interventions.  Current chest pain
   accompanied by ekg changes and new depressed ejection fraction, along
   with posterior wall hypokinesis.  The chest pain was in the setting of
   urinary retention and hypertension, and was relieved with nitro and
   foley placement.  In addition, ekg changes resolved with resolution of
   chest pain.  At the time patient thought to either have demand ischemia
   vs. acute coronary syndrome.  However, his cardiac enzymes are
   consistent with active ischemia (CK1868/CKMB143/Trops 3.88).  Likely

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, who presented with chest pain and EKG changes after undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. He had an unsuccessful thrombectomy with DES to LCX at the cath lab. The patient experienced urinary retention and hypertension, and his symptoms improved with nitro and Foley placement. His cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating active ischemia. He is currently on heparin drip, aspirin, Plavix, and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and history of significant coronary artery disease suggest the possibility of ACS.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient is experiencing AF with rapid ventricular response, which may require rate control and rhythm management.
3. Acute Blood Loss: The patient had frank blood in the catheter and clots per rectum, indicating potential gastrointestinal bleeding. Carafate enemas were recommended, and a flexible sigmoidoscopy with argon laser coagulation may be performed if the bleeding persists.
4. Hypotension: The patient's systolic blood pressure dipped to the 70s multiple times, indicating potential hypotension.
5. Deconditioning: The patient has been bedridden for an extended period, increasing the risk of deconditioning and muscle weakness.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2197-8-30**]:  Transfused 1 unit pRBCs with appropriate Hct bump from 28.6
   to 31.  Patient's Foley clotted off in the early afternoon.  Manual
   irrigation did not work.  Urology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and they suggested
   changing the Foley from the regular 16 French to 20 French 3-way.  This
   was done and he started draining tea-colored urine after manual
   irrigation.  If it clots off again, manual irrigation will be re-tried
   and if that doesn't work CBI will be started.  GI consulted about GI
   bleed from radiation proctitis.  They would like to try Carafate enemas
   (2 grams twice daily-will take effect after 4-6 weeks) first to try to
   soothe the colitis.  Will have to call pharmacy to get these enemas
   because they are not on formulary.  If this does not work, they will
   perform a flex sig with argon laser coagulation of bleeding colitis
   (likely Friday per cardiac recs for post MI procedures unless patient
   begins having more significant bleed). Make sure to inform GI one day
   before if we want to do procedure so they can put him on schedule.
   -@10PM: Patient's systolic BP dipped to 70s after dosing metoprolol.
   Given 250cc bolus.
   -@11:30PM: Patient's systolic again in 70s with HR irregular and in the
   140s-150s.  Given 250cc bolus.
   -@1:30AM: SBP in 100s, lungs clear, given another 250cc bolus to
   increase pressure in order for rate control to be started with
   diltiazem 10mg IV once. Did not work, HR still up to 150s.  No active
   GI bleeding since this AM, hematuria resolved.
   -@3:50AM: another 250cc bolus for refractory Afib.  given amiodarone
   150mg IV bolus-> still fast rate but improved BP.

- The patient is a 74-year-old man with diabetes and coronary artery disease.
- He presented with chest pain and EKG changes after undergoing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
- The patient had a thrombectomy with drug-eluting stent placement to the left circumflex artery in the cath lab.
- He experienced urinary retention and hypertension, which were relieved with nitro and Foley placement.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating active ischemia, likely involving the left circumflex artery or posterior descending artery.
- The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (Hct improved from 28.6 to 31.6) due to acute blood loss, including frank blood in the catheter and clots per rectum.
- The bleeding improved overnight, and no frank blood was present in the catheter this morning.
- The patient's WBC count is elevated, likely due to the recent surgery.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation and received IV amiodarone.
- The patient has hypertension and is on metoprolol, with valsartan held for now.
- The patient has acute systolic congestive heart failure, for which fluid status is being monitored and home dose lasix is continued.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2197-8-30**]:  Transfused 1 unit pRBCs with appropriate Hct bump from 28.6
   to 31.  Patient's Foley clotted off in the early afternoon.  Manual
   irrigation did not work.  Urology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and they suggested
   changing the Foley from the regular 16 French to 20 French 3-way.  This
   was done and he started draining tea-colored urine after manual
   irrigation.  If it clots off again, manual irrigation will be re-tried
   and if that doesn't work CBI will be started.  GI consulted about GI
   bleed from radiation proctitis.  They would like to try Carafate enemas
   (2 grams twice daily-will take effect after 4-6 weeks) first to try to
   soothe the colitis.  Will have to call pharmacy to get these enemas
   because they are not on formulary.  If this does not work, they will
   perform a flex sig with argon laser coagulation of bleeding colitis
   (likely Friday per cardiac recs for post MI procedures unless patient
   begins having more significant bleed). Make sure to inform GI one day
   before if we want to do procedure so they can put him on schedule.
   -@10PM: Patient's systolic BP dipped to 70s after dosing metoprolol.
   Given 250cc bolus.
   -@11:30PM: Patient's systolic again in 70s with HR irregular and in the
   140s-150s.  Given 250cc bolus.
   -@1:30AM: SBP in 100s, lungs clear, given another 250cc bolus to
   increase pressure in order for rate control to be started with
   diltiazem 10mg IV once. Did not work, HR still up to 150s.  No active
   GI bleeding since this AM, hematuria resolved.
   -@3:50AM: another 250cc bolus for refractory Afib.  given amiodarone
   150mg IV bolus-> still fast rate but improved BP.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 74 year old man with diabetes, coronary artery
   disease, presenting with chest pain and ekg changes in the setting of
   hypertension while recovering from laparoscopic cholecystectomy, now
   s/p thrombectomy with DES to LCX at cath lab.
   .
   # CORONARIES: History of significant coronary artery disease s/p
   multiple percutaneous coronary interventions.  Current chest pain
   accompanied by ekg changes and new depressed ejection fraction, along
   with posterior wall hypokinesis.  The chest pain was in the setting of
   urinary retention and hypertension, and was relieved with nitro and
   foley placement.  In addition, ekg changes resolved with resolution of
   chest pain.  At the time patient thought to either have demand ischemia
   vs. acute coronary syndrome.  However, his cardiac enzymes are
   consistent with active ischemia (CK1868/CKMB143/Trops 3.88).  Likely
   c/w LCX or PAD.  Continued on heparin drip, aspirin, plavix,
   metoprolol.  Now s/p thrombectomy with DES to LCX at cath lab.
   -aspirin 325mg indefinitely
   -plavix 75 mg for at least 1 year
   -now off integrilin (d/c
d early secondary to blood per rectum)
   -holding home dose of metoprolol now given multiple hypotensive
   episodes
   .
   # Acute blood loss: had frank blood in cathether yesterday as well as
   continued clots per rectum.  GI came and evaluated patient- recommended
   carafate enemas and flex sig on Friday.  Bleeding improved overnight-
   no frank blood in catheter this AM.
   -received 2U pRBCs on [**8-29**] (Hct improved from 28.6 to 31.6)
   -stable at 30.5 tonight.
   -re-check Hct at 3PM
   -remove foley this AM
   .
   # Cholecystectomy: POD 2.  Elevated white count s/p procedure. Surgery
   following. will advance diet to low fat.
   -stable WBC this AM (9.2)
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - give metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] today
   -monitor pressures
   -restart home dose meds when BP return to baseline
   .
   # Acute Systolic Congestive heart failure: Monitor fluid status and
   continue home dose lasix.
   - hold home metoprolol and valsartan for now.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Holding coumadin in setting of possible cardiac
   catheterization.  continue and metoprolol.
   -amiodarone gtt at 1mg
   -decrease amiodarone to .5mg for 18hrs.  After 24hrs, switch to PO

   The patient had a MI, however, the risk benefit profile makes treatment
   of his bleeding necessary, specially with need for uninterrupted ASA,
   Plavix.  Therefore, I recommend sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy as needed to
   treat bleeding with usual periprocedural care.

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and previous percutaneous coronary interventions. He presented with a STEMI in the setting of hypertension while recovering from laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and underwent thrombectomy with DES to LCX at the cath lab. 

He is currently experiencing blood per rectum, which has been attributed to acute blood loss. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased from 30.5 to 27.8, and he has received a blood transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells. His hemoglobin concentration has increased to 30.4. 

The patient also has atrial fibrillation and is being treated with amiodarone. He is off coumadin due to GI bleeding, with an INR of 1.1. 

Other findings include elevated white blood cell count due to recent surgery, hypertension, acute systolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, gout, and migraine/cluster headaches. 

The patient is on various medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, insulin sliding scale, colchicine, and dilaudid PRN. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further bleeding, worsening heart failure, recurrent atrial fibrillation, hypoglycemia, and exacerbation of Parkinson's disease symptoms."

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute blood loss: The patient continues to have episodes of blood-tinted urine and frank blood in the Foley catheter. His hemoglobin level has been decreasing, and he is at risk of further bleeding. Close monitoring of his blood counts and transfusion as necessary is required.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient remains in atrial fibrillation and is on amiodarone drip. His INR is 1.1, and he is at risk of thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation should be continued, and efforts should be made to restore sinus"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. He presented with a STEMI while recovering from a laparoscopic cholecystectomy and underwent thrombectomy with DES to the LCX at the cath lab. The patient experienced chest pain accompanied by EKG changes and a depressed ejection fraction. He also had urinary retention and hypertension, which were relieved with nitro and Foley placement. The chest pain resolved, along with the EKG changes. The patient is currently in the ICU due to acute blood loss, atrial fibrillation, elevated white count post-surgery, acute systolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, gout, migraine, and cluster headaches. The patient is awaiting sigmoidoscopy tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Blood Loss: The patient has been experiencing frank blood in the Foley catheter and continued clots per rectum. The GI bleeding has improved overnight, but the patient still has intermittent episodes of blood-tinted urine. The patient's HCT levels are low, indicating potential anemia due to blood loss. Further monitoring and possible transfusion may be required.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient remains in atrial fibrillation and is currently on amiodarone drip. The INR level is within normal range, but the patient's heart rhythm should be continuously monitored, and antiarrhythmic medications should"

During the 24-hour period, the patient experienced occasional blood per rectum, leading to a decision for sigmoidoscopy. The patient was given a fleet enema and started on sucralfate enemas. The patient's hematocrit (HCT) level decreased from 30.5 to 27.8, resulting in the transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The HCT level was rechecked at 9:45pm and raised to 30.4.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, unknown allergen for Persantine (Dipyridamole), and allopurinol. The patient experienced light-headedness with allopurinol and a rash/itching with ciprofloxacin.

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including amiodarone at a rate of 0.5 mg/min and other ICU medications not specified. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 37.7 to 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 95 and 81 beats per minute, blood pressure between 133/60 and 139/77 mmHg, respiratory rate between 22 and 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's weight is currently 118 kg, with a total fluid intake of 1,493 mL and output of 1,710 mL. The urine output is 1,710 mL.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 74 year old man with diabetes, coronary artery
   disease, presenting with a STEMI in the setting of hypertension while
   recovering from laparoscopic cholecystectomy, now s/p thrombectomy with
   DES to LCX at cath lab, now with BRBPR, awaiting sigmoidoscopy
   tomorrow.
   .
   # CORONARIES: History of significant coronary artery disease s/p
   multiple percutaneous coronary interventions.  Current chest pain
   accompanied by ekg changes and new depressed ejection fraction, along
   with posterior wall hypokinesis.  The chest pain was in the setting of
   urinary retention and hypertension, and was relieved with nitro and
   foley placement.  In addition, ekg changes resolved with resolution of
   chest pain.  At the time patient thought to either have demand ischemia
   vs. acute coronary syndrome.  However, his cardiac enzymes are
   consistent with active ischemia (CK1868/CKMB143/Trops 3.88).  Likely
   c/w LCX or PAD.  Continued on heparin drip, aspirin, plavix,
   metoprolol.  Now s/p thrombectomy with DES to LCX at cath lab.
   -aspirin 325mg indefinitely
   -plavix 75 mg for at least 1 year
   -now off integrilin (d/c
d early secondary to blood per rectum)

   episodes
   .
   # Acute blood loss: had frank blood in foley yesterday as well as
   continued clots per rectum.  Discussed with GI today, agreed to do
   sigmoidoscopy tomorrow. Bleeding improved overnight, foley removed,
   intermittent episodes of blood-tinted urine.
   -received 1U O/N, 30.4 o/n, now 29.6.
   -re-check Hct at 3PM and transfuse as necessary
   -bleeding in foley likely [**2-13**] h/o prostrate cancer, improved, continue
