 .H/O ASPERGILLUS INFECTION, NON- OR SEMI-INVASIVE
 HEMOPTYSIS
   This is a 47 yo female with hx of treated aspergillosis [**2158**] who
   presents now with hemoptysis.
   .
   # Hemoptysis: Source almost certainly pulmonary based on CT findings.
   Pt w/ hx of aspergillosis with unknown risk factors. Cavitary lesion on
   CT scan may be consistent with recurrence of aspergillosis, also w/
   bronchiectasis. DDX of cavitary lung lesion also includes: TB, other
   fungal infxn, malignancy, autoimmune (Wegener's), or bacterial
   infection. She denies systemic symptoms including fever, weight loss
   and has had no clear TB exposures.  She has no renal dysfunction and no
   other manifestations of vasculitis on exam and by history so seems
   unlikely pulmonary-renal syndrome.  Given her h/o bronchiectasis on
   imaging and frequent pulm infections throughout life, late presentation
   of CF possible, however she denies GI sx, infertility.  Does have 15
   packyear history so malignancy must be considered.  Bacterial infection
   less likely given lack of fever or leukocytosis.  Cell differential
   largely unremarkable (only very mild neutrophilia and no e/o peripheral
   eosinophilia). Her prior work-up was all at outside hospitals. HIV
   negative per her report when checked 4 years ago and she denies risk
   factors since.
   - Sputum cxs, including AFB; should be adequate for aspergillosis as
   well
   - check beta-glucan, galactomannan
   - Bronchoscopy to eval for endobronchial lesion
   - Serial HCT - q6hr (though appears actual blood loss is minimal and
   can likely back off checks if stable)
   - Obtain OSH records, consider repeating HIV test
   - PPD placed in ED, read in 48-72 hrs
   - TB precautions pending sputum for AFB
   - will start azithromycin and ceftriaxone given bronchiectasis and risk
   of bacterial infection however low suspicion that this is driving her
   hemoptysis
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Very mildly elevated INR to 1.3.  No history of easy
   bleeding/bruising.  No known h/o liver dz and no LFTs in our system.  ?
   nutritional.  Seems unlikely to be contributing significantly to above
   bleeding.
   - continue to monitor coags in settting of hemoptysis
   - checking LFTs
   - will give oral vitamin K
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of treated aspergillosis who presents with hemoptysis. The source of hemoptysis is likely pulmonary based on CT findings, and there may be a recurrence of aspergillosis along with bronchiectasis. The differential diagnosis for cavitary lung lesions includes tuberculosis, other fungal infections, malignancy, autoimmune conditions like Wegener's, or bacterial infection. 

The patient denies systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and has no clear TB exposures. She does not have renal dysfunction or manifestations of vasculitis on examination or by history, making pulmonary-renal syndrome unlikely. The possibility of late presentation of cystic fibrosis is also considered, although the patient denies gastrointestinal symptoms and infertility. Her smoking history is significant at 15 pack-years, so malignancy must be considered. Bacterial infection is less likely given the absence of fever or leukocytosis.

The patient's prior work-up was done at outside hospitals, and she reports being HIV negative when checked four years ago, with no new risk factors. 

The plan includes obtaining sputum cultures, including acid-fast bacilli, as well as checking beta-glucan and galactomannan levels. A bronchoscopy will be performed to evaluate for an endobronchial lesion. Serial hematocrit checks will be done every six hours, although the actual blood loss appears minimal and can"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of treated aspergillosis presenting with hemoptysis. She has cavitary lesions on her CT scan, which may indicate a recurrence of aspergillosis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/90 mmHg to 109/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent episode of hemoptysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspergillosis recurrence: The patient's history of aspergillosis and the presence of cavitary lesions on her CT scan suggest a potential recurrence of the infection. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and increased risk of complications such as bronchospasm, pulmonary embolism, or dissemination to other organs.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient's recent episode of hemoptysis may indicate ongoing pulmonary involvement. Continued or recurrent hemoptysis can lead to significant blood loss, hypotension, and shock.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a mildly elevated INR of 1.3 without any history of easy bleeding or known liver disease. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the coagulopathy and monitor for any bleeding"

   Reviewed outside films with radiologist.  Had CT chest from [**2160-6-2**] to
   compare to recent scan.  The left sided bronchiectasis is chronic,
   stable except now has mucus impaction, nodular infiltrate unchanged
   from earlier film.  In further discussions with the patient it became
   evident that she had provided three sputum samples to [**Company 2278**]
   in [**Location (un) 2279**], NH on [**10-30**], and [**11-30**]. Called and had results faxed.
   Culture showing heavy growth of S. Aureusm MSSA.  Also on [**11-30**] AFB was
   negative.  Now has two negative AFBs.  Induced for third sputum today
   which is pending.  Have changed antibiotics to nafcillin.  Continue
   codeine overnight, consider stopping in next 24-48 hours.  Given that
   this is more consistent with underlying bronchietasis with superimposed
   staph infection may be able to treat with abx, follow clinically to be
   sure hemoptysis resolves and even consider bronchoscopy as an
   outpatient.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing hemoptysis (coughing up blood) and has a history of atypical mycobacterium infection, possibly aspergillus. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 138/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's lab results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 13.5 g/dL and elevated white blood cell count of 356 K/uL. The blood glucose level is normal at 77 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels are within normal range. 

The patient's chest X-ray shows chronic left-sided bronchiectasis with mucus impaction and a nodular infiltrate that has remained unchanged from previous films. Sputum cultures have revealed heavy growth of MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) and negative AFB (acid-fast bacilli), indicating no tuberculosis infection. 

The patient's condition appears to be stable, and they are currently being maintained on maintenance fluids while remaining NPO (nothing by mouth) for an anticipated bronchoscopy. The pulmonary consult team is evaluating the patient for bronchoscopic evaluation given the suspicion of aspergillus infection or colonization. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, further hemoptysis,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of treated aspergillosis who presents with hemoptysis. She has a previous job that involved exposure to various chemicals, which may be relevant to her current condition. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving treatment for MSSA infection with nafcillin. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 127/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's lab results show normal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but there is a slight elevation in the INR to 1.3. Imaging studies reveal a cavitary lesion on the CT scan, which may indicate a recurrence of aspergillosis. The patient is awaiting further test results, including sputum cultures for AFB and beta-glucan, galactomannan, and PPD testing. The patient's coagulopathy is being monitored due to the hemoptysis, and she is also being treated for GERD with pantoprazole. The patient's nutritional needs are being met, and her glycemic control is well-managed. The patient has a code status of full code and is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.
