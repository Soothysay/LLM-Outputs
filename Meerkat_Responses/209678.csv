","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male who presented while intoxicated and was found to have pneumonia, an ETOH level of 388, and a radial head fracture. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently withdrawing from alcohol, experiencing diaphoresis, and feels ""shaky."" He admits to previous episodes of DTs and hallucinations, which may be true DTs or alcoholic hallucinosis. The patient's past attempts to quit drinking have been unsuccessful.

Medical Conditions:
1. Alcohol abuse/withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of alcohol withdrawal, including diaphoresis and feeling ""shaky."" He has been prescribed diazepam to manage his symptoms and will undergo detoxification.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, as evidenced by his cough and abnormal chest X-ray showing consolidation in the right middle lobe. He has been started on levofloxacin for treatment.
3. Radial head fracture: The patient sustained a radial head fracture from a fall. Further evaluation is needed to assess for any vascular complications.
4. Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient has an enlarged liver and elevated liver enzymes, indicating possible alcoholic hepatitis. Fatty liver is noted on ultrasound, but no ascites or cirrhotic changes were observed.
5. Melena: The patient reports having melena, but his hemoglobin level is normal. Trending his hematocrit and performing a guaiac stool test are"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 48-year-old male patient with a history of intoxication, fall, radial head fracture, pneumonia, and high ETOH level.
- The patient has shown improvement in symptoms such as abdominal pain and cough.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with some fluctuations in blood pressure.
- The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood glucose levels.
- There are abnormalities in liver function tests and electrolyte levels.
- The patient is currently on multiple medications including levofloxacin, pantoprazole, heparin, and diazepam.
- The patient's pain is being managed with non-opioid analgesics.
- The patient is scheduled for an addiction consult and outpatient endoscopy.
- The patient is expected to continue with weaning off valium and receive thiamine and folate supplementation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of black stool and melena, which may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation with additional guiac stool tests and possibly an outpatient EGD is recommended to rule out any underlying conditions such as ulcers or gastritis.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, indicated by symptoms like cough and wheezing, as well as findings on the chest X-ray. The current treatment plan includes continuing levofloxacin and nebs with antibiotics. Close monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese male admitted to the ICU with complaints of EtOH withdrawal and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 35.9Â°C (96.7Â°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 152/92 to 106/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's ABG results are not provided in the note. The physical examination reveals poor dentition, no endotracheal or NG tubes, crackles in the basilar regions of the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, and absent pulses in both lower extremities. The patient is alert, attentive, and oriented with no objective findings of withdrawal. Laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes, except for a slightly low potassium level. Other lab results are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient is experiencing symptoms of EtOH withdrawal, including shaking and coughing. Close monitoring for signs of withdrawal and administration of appropriate medication (e.g., diazepam) will be necessary to prevent complications such as seizures or delirium tremens.
2. Pneumonia: The patient presents with crackles in the basilar regions of the chest, which may indicate pneumonia"
