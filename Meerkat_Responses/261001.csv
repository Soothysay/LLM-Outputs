   Assessment and Plan
   46 y/o F with PMH of DM c/b gastroparesis and HTN who presents with
   coffee-ground emesis and hypertensive urgency, now with mild DKA.
   # DKA: FS poorly controlled with initiation of insulin gtt and
   overnight. New leukocytosis with low grade temperature.  Etiology of AG
   may be [**1-14**] medication non-compliance (history of no DM medications 24
   hours prior to admission), infection (now with low grade fever and
   leukocytosis).
   - continue insulin gtt, start SQ insulin once FS <250
   - q1 hour FS
   - continuous IVFs
   - repeat labs q4 hours and replete lytes prn
   - f/u culture data
   - f/u CXR
   - monitor fever curve
   #. Coffee ground emesis:
   Differential includes [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, gastritis, PUD, AVM,
   malignancy, varices (much less likely given no h/o liver disease).
   Given epigastric pain concern for either gastritis vs. PUD.  Vomiting
   likely in setting of her known gastroparesis vs. possible viral
   gastroenteritis.  LFTs and lipase wnl.  Had witnessed emesis here that
   was gastrocult positive.  Hct currently stable since admission, however
   unknown baseline.  Patient refused NGL in ED.  GI consulted and plan
   for possible EGD.  No NSAID use by history.
   - appreciate GI recs; consider EGD today
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - Transfuse if bleeding or < 21, T+S, PIV x2
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Anti-emetics prn
   #. Hypertensive urgency: BP elevated and was on labetalol gtt that has
   since been weaned off.  Likely in setting of medication non-compliance
   (takes meds ""intermittantly"" per ED staff) and vomiting and well as
   pain.
   - continue amlodipine 10 mg and lisinopril 20, titrate medications for
   BP control
   # Gastroparesis
   - standing reglan
   - low dose IV morphine as needed, unclear if her narcotic regimen
   history is accurate
 will need to get OSH records today
   #  Low-grade fevers: Unclear source. CXR negative as well as UA.  LFTs
   normal.  [**Month (only) 51**] be in setting of exacerbation of gastroparesis. Consider
   d/c of CVL and placing PICC as possible source
   - hold on antibiotics given no clear source
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx
   - monitor fever curve
   - d/c femoral line, order PICC
   - culture CVL tip

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 46-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) complicated by gastroparesis and hypertension (HTN). She presented with coffee-ground emesis and epigastric pain. The patient was weaned off the labetalol drip, initiated on Reglan, and started on an insulin drip due to poorly controlled sugars. Her white blood cell count (WBC) increased to 15 AM labs. A chest X-ray was ordered, and she vomited once, producing a beige-colored substance. She continues to complain of abdominal pain and prefers dilaudid over morphine.

The patient has no known drug allergies. Her current medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and regular insulin at 3 units per hour. She also takes lisinopril 20 mg and amlodipine 10 mg.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the new symptoms mentioned above. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature range of 37.9-37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 110-95 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 160/93 to 145/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 6,204 mL with 549 mL in the last 24 hours. The patient's output includes 240 mL of urine, 700 mL of stool, 50 mL of nasogastric drainage, and 2,000 mL of blood product transfusion. The total output is 3,950 mL. Her height is 65 inches.

The patient requires respiratory support with supplemental oxygen delivery, but no other respiratory support is needed. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) values are not provided in the note.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is pleasant and sleepy, with no cyanosis or clubbing. Her head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT) examination shows no abnormalities. Her chest examination is clear, and her cardiovascular (CV) examination indicates tachycardia without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. The abdominal (ABD) examination is difficult due to her condition, but it reveals a soft abdomen with decreased bowel sounds. The neurologic examination is normal, and there are no rashes or signs of infection on the skin.

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count of 15.1 thousand cells per microliter, hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.6 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) ranging from 33.7% to 34.9%, platelet count (Plt) of 333 thousand cells per microliter, blood glucose (Glucose) levels of 243 mg/dL and 333 mg/dL, sodium (Na) level of 139 mEq/L, potassium (K) level of 4."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) complicated by gastroparesis and hypertension. She presented with coffee-ground emesis and epigastric pain. The patient was weaned off labetalol drip and initiated on reglan. Her hematocrit (Hct) remained stable without any bleeding, and a gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy (EGD) was deferred due to her hypertension. The patient's blood glucose levels were poorly controlled overnight, leading to the development of mild diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She was started on an insulin drip and half-normal saline (1/2 NS) to address the DKA. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) increased to 15, and a chest X-ray was ordered. The patient vomited once, producing a beige-colored substance, and continues to complain of abdominal pain. She prefers dilaudid over morphine for pain relief.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's blood glucose levels were poorly controlled overnight, resulting in the development of mild DKA. It is crucial to continue monitoring her blood glucose levels closely and adjust the insulin therapy as necessary to prevent further progression of DKA.
2. Coffee-ground emesis: The patient's coffee-ground emesis could indicate upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Although the Hct remained stable without any bleeding, it is important to monitor her"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) complicated by gastroparesis and hypertension. She presented with coffee-ground emesis and epigastric pain. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in vital signs, including tachycardia and hypertension. There have been concerns regarding potential medical complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hypertensive urgency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has poorly controlled sugars and is on an insulin drip. DKA is a possibility due to the high glucose levels and the presence of ketones.

2. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and a low-grade fever, indicating a potential infection. Cultures have been ordered to identify the source.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Coffee-ground emesis could suggest gastrointestinal bleeding. An upper endoscopy (EGD) has been recommended by the GI team.

4. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, and she experienced hypertensive urgency. Medications for blood pressure control need to be adjusted.

5. Gastroparesis: The patient has a history of gastroparesis, which is causing vomiting. Medication for gastroparesis needs to be continued.

6. Low-Grade Fevers: The patient has had low-grade fevers with"

   Assessment and Plan
   46 y/o F with PMH of DM c/b gastroparesis and HTN who presents with
   coffee-ground emesis and hypertensive urgency, now with anion gap.
   .
   # Anion gap (15): FS poorly controlled with initiation of insulin gtt
   and
 NS overnight. New leukocytosis with low grade temperature.
   - continue insulin gtt, start SQ insulin once FS <250
   - continuous IVFs
   - repeat labs q4 hours
   - f/u culture data
   - f/u CXR
   .
   #. Coffee ground emesis:
   Differential includes [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, gastritis, PUD, AVM,
   malignancy, varices (much less likely given no h/o liver disease).
   Given epigastric pain concern for either gastritis vs. PUD.  Vomiting
   likely in setting of her known gastroparesis vs. possible viral
   gastroenteritis.  LFTs and lipase wnl.  Had witnessed emesis here that
   was gastrocult positive.  Hct currently stable, however unknown
   baseline.  Patient refused NGL in ED.  GI consulted and plan for
   possible EGD.  No NSAID use by history.
   -  GI holding on EGD given HTN
   - Serial Hct, q8hr
   - Transfuse if bleeding or < 21, T+S, PIV x2
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) complicated by gastroparesis and hypertension. She presents with coffee-ground emesis and epigastric pain. The patient's condition has been managed with various interventions, including the initiation of an insulin drip, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. The patient's lab results indicate an anion gap, leukocytosis, and elevated glucose levels. The assessment and plan include continuing the insulin drip, starting subcutaneous insulin once fasting blood sugar (FS) is below 250, repeating labs every four hours, following up on culture data, and reviewing a chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient exhibits leukocytosis, low-grade temperature, and an elevated white blood cell count. These findings suggest a possible infection. Further investigation is required through blood cultures and a follow-up on culture data.

2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The presence of an elevated anion gap, along with poorly controlled sugars and the initiation of an insulin drip, raises concern for DKA. Continuous monitoring of glucose levels and acid-base balance is essential.

3. Hypertensive Urgency/Emergency: The patient's blood pressure readings in the emergency department were significantly high, indicating hypertensive urgency. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate antihypert"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed, complicated by hypertension urgency in the emergency department. She is now experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with an unclear precipitant. The patient has been diagnosed with DKA and is currently receiving insulin via a continuous infusion. Once the gap closes, long-acting agents (NPH for now) will be added. There is no clear source for DKA, but ruling out infection is possible due to a mildly increased white blood cell (WBC) count. Possible underdosing of insulin is also considered.

Assessment and Plan:
1. DKA: The patient is being treated with insulin to close the gap. Long-acting agents (NPH for now) will be added once the gap closes. No clear source for DKA has been identified, and we are ruling out infection. Possible underdosing of insulin is also considered. NPH 25 units have been administered, and the evening dose will be recalculated based on serum sodium levels. D5NS at 75 cc/hr will be given when blood sugar is below 250. Electrolytes will be followed and repleted, and a consultation with a doctor will be sought for long-term management. Reglan will be continued, and a hemoglobin A1C test will be done.

2. UGI Bleed: A broad differential will be followed, and Hct and serial exams will be monitored"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed in the setting of diabetic gastroparesis, complicated by hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions. The patient received various treatments and interventions, including medication for UGI bleed, hypertension, diabetes, and pain control. She also underwent laboratory tests and imaging studies. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 160/93 to 145/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination showed no acute distress, and her neurological status was within normal limits. The patient's laboratory results revealed abnormalities in hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose levels, and other electrolyte levels. The assessment and plan included ongoing monitoring, further evaluation of the UGI bleed, management of hypertension, diabetes, and pain control. The patient was planned to be transferred to the floor once stable.

Potential medical complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of UGI bleed, which can lead to significant blood loss and potential complications such as hypotension, shock, and organ dysfunction.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure was elevated, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. If left untreated, it can increase the risk of cardiovascular events, stroke, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented to the ICU with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and gastroparesis. Upon admission, the patient was found to have stage II hypertension, which was managed with the initiation of HCTZ. The patient's blood glucose levels were elevated, and insulin therapy was started as per the consultation from Dr. [Last Name (un) 303]. The patient's white blood cell count improved from 15 to 14, and the anion gap closed. A PICC line was placed, and the femoral line was removed. Medical records were obtained, revealing a history of chronic pain syndrome and the use of MS contin for pain management. The patient's potassium level was low at 2.9 meq/L, and potassium supplementation was ordered. Various medications were infused, including dextrose, metoprolol, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, indicating ongoing hypertension. It is crucial to monitor and manage this condition appropriately to prevent further complications.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are still elevated, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. Continuous monitoring and management of blood glucose levels are necessary to prevent complications associated with hyperglycemia.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the anion gap has closed, the patient's initial presentation was"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 46-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, gastroparesis, and hypertension. She presented with coffee-ground emesis, hypertensive urgency, and mild diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's blood pressure continues to be stage II hypertension, and her anion gap has closed to 10. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 171/98 mmHg to 142/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

On physical examination, the patient appears tired and has a regular tachycardic rhythm. Her lungs are clear bilaterally, and her abdomen is soft with tenderness below the umbilicus. She has no edema or calf pain, and her neurologic examination is normal. 

Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, slightly low potassium, and normal kidney function. The patient's white blood cell count has improved from 15 to 14.

Assessment and Plan:
1. DKA: The patient's anion gap has closed to 10. Insulin drip should be stopped, and NPH insulin and sliding scale insulin should be started. D5NS at 75cc/hr should be administered as blood glucose approaches 250. Anion gap should be rechecked at regular intervals.
2. Coffee-ground emesis: The patient may require a gastrointestinal plan including an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which may be done on an outpatient basis. Daily hematocrit, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and anti-emetics as needed should be given.
3. Hypertensive urgency: Lisinopril 20mg daily and nifedipine 10mg daily have helped control the patient's blood pressure.
4. Gastroparesis: Morphine should be given as needed, and the patient should continue taking reglan while maintaining a clear diet.
5. Low-grade fevers: Cultures should be obtained, the femoral line should be discontinued, and a PICC line should be placed if feasible. Tip culture of the central venous line should also be done.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, indicating ongoing hypertension. This can lead to complications such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage if not properly managed.
2. DKA: Although the patient's anion gap has closed, there is still a risk of DKA recurrence if insulin therapy is not continued appropriately.
3. Gastroparesis: The patient's symptoms of gastroparesis may persist, leading to complications like dehydration and malnutrition if not managed appropriately.
4. Infection: The presence of low-grade fevers suggests a potential infection. If left untreated, it could lead to severe infections and sepsis.

Please note that this is a summary of the progress note, and a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition should be obtained by reviewing the complete medical record."

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of unclear upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed, complicated by hypertension urgency in the emergency department (ED). She is now experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), with an unclear precipitant. The patient has been diagnosed with DKA and is currently receiving insulin through a gtt. Once the metabolic acidosis resolves, long-acting agents (NPH for now) will be added. The underlying cause of DKA is suspected to be under dosing of insulin.

The patient's medical history includes diabetic gastroparesis and hypertension. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being managed for DKA, UGI bleed, and hypertension urgency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DKA: The patient is already being treated for DKA with insulin therapy. However, there is a risk of complications associated with DKA, such as cerebral edema, hypokalemia, and cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring of the patient's electrolytes, blood glucose levels, and acid-base balance is essential to prevent further complications.

2. UGI Bleed: The patient has a history of UGI bleed, which may recur. Close monitoring of the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels will help assess if there is ongoing blood loss. Serial exams will be performed to evaluate the source of bleeding.

3. Hypertension Urgency: The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension urgency."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of unclear upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed in the setting of diabetic gastroparesis, complicated by hypertension urgency in the emergency department (ED). She is now experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), with an unclear precipitant. The patient has been diagnosed with DKA and is currently receiving insulin through a continuous infusion. Once the gap closes, long-acting agents (NPH for now) will be added. There is no clear source for DKA, and it is likely due to underdosing of insulin.

The patient's UGI bleed is being monitored, with plans to follow up with a hematocrit (Hct) and serial examinations. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has been deferred for now, with a possible procedure tomorrow. The patient's hypertension urgency is being managed by continuing home PO medications as tolerated and increasing them as tolerated.

For pain control, morphine 2-4 mg IV is being administered every 6 hours. The patient's low-grade fevers are being monitored, with a trend of decreasing white blood cell count (WBC). No empirical antibiotics have been given, and the patient will be followed up with culture results.

Additional issues per ICU resident include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), communication, code status, and disposition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - DKA is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body starts breaking down fat at an excessive rate, leading to the production of ketones. If left untreated, it can lead to coma and even death.
2. Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed - UGI bleeds can be caused by various factors such as peptic ulcers, gastritis, or esophageal varices. If the bleeding continues, it can result in significant blood loss, shock, and potentially death.
3. Hypertensive urgency - Hypertensive urgency refers to severely elevated blood pressure without signs of end-organ damage. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to complications like stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.
4. Infection - The presence of low-grade fevers and elevated WBC count suggests a possible infection. If not appropriately treated, it can progress and lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition.
5. VAP - Ventilator-associated pneumonia is a type of lung infection that occurs in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. If not promptly diagnosed and treated, it can worsen and lead to respiratory failure."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 46-year-old female with a history of unknown upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed in the setting of diabetic gastroparesis, complicated by hypertension urgency in the emergency department (ED).
- The patient is now complicated by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with an unclear precipitant.
- The patient has been diagnosed with DKA and is currently being treated with insulin infusion. Once the blood glucose level stabilizes, long-acting agents (NPH for now) will be added.
- The source of DKA is still unclear, and there is a possibility of underdosing of insulin.
- NPH 25 units have been administered, and the evening dose will be adjusted based on serum sodium levels.
- Electrolytes will be followed and repleted as needed.
- A consult for long-term management has been requested for the patient's condition.
- The patient's UGI bleed is also being monitored, with a broad differential diagnosis and serial hemoglobin (Hct) examinations planned.
- An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has been deferred for now due to the patient's stable Hct levels.
- The patient's hypertension urgency will be managed by continuing home medications as tolerated. If these medications fail, alternative options will be considered.
- Pain control will be provided using morphine 2-4 mg IV every six hours.
- Due to low-grade fevers and a rising white blood cell"
