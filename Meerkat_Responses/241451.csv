","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and being treated for multifocal pneumonia. The note highlights several important points:

1. The patient's ABG results show a trend towards respiratory acidosis, with progressively increasing values for PaCO2 and decreasing values for pH.

2. The patient has been placed on BiPAP with supplemental oxygen due to low oxygen saturation levels.

3. The patient has been prescribed multiple antibiotics, including cefepime, azithromycin, linezolid, and ciprofloxacin, to cover for various bacterial infections.

4. The patient's vital signs indicate stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature within normal limits.

5. The patient's blood work reveals an elevated white blood cell count (23.4 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin level (10.4 g/dL), normal platelet count (416 K/uL), and abnormal liver function tests (elevated AST and ALT levels).

6. The patient's chest X-ray shows an increase in retrocardiac density, left pleural effusion, patchy density in the left upper lung fields, and signs of pneumonia.

7. The patient has a history of mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a small left ventricular cavity. There is a mid-cavitary gradient identified, but no aortic valve stenosis. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen, and the right ventricular chamber size and"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection admitted on [**8-7**] post-PEG placement now with acute shortness
   of breath in the setting of hypertensive urgency and worsening
   multifocal PNA.
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:  Most likley secondary to pneumonia as evident on
   CXR showing worsening infiltrates.  Also occurred initially in the
   setting of hypertensive urgency making flash pulmonary edema a possible
   contributor to her dyspnea and hypoxia, although less convincing by
   CXR.  Also in the differential includes worsening pneumonia, PE, MI
   (although EKG unchanged).  CXR appeared to show worsening infiltrates.
   Hypoxia improved somewhat after lasix and blood pressure control;
   however she continues to be dyspneic and is beginning to tire.
   - serially measuring ABGs; consider placing an a line
   - Continue cefepime, cipro, linezolid and azithromycin for possible
   PNA.  (day 1: [**2132-8-11**])
   - follow cultures
   - Control of hypertension as below.
   - Will check a TTE to evaluate her heart function as she has no TTE in
   OMR.  Will also check BNP
   - If she continues hypoxic and dyspneic will consider CTA to rule out
   PE.  Will check b/l lower extremity dopplers to look for evidence of
   DVT.
   - Supplemental oxygen prn
   - Albuterol nebs prn
   # Hypertension:  The patient's SBP had decreased to the 140's by the
   time she arrived to the floor.  Her acei had been stopped earlier in
   the hospitalization due to ARF.
   - optimize BP management
   - Will continue home nadaolol at 100 mg po daily.  Will increase
   hydralazine to 50 mg po tid.
   - Will continue holding her acei for now.
   - Will monitor SBP closely and if she becomes hypertensive again can
   give prn hydralazine.
   # Leukocytosis:  Patient found to have a multifocal PNA yesterday and
   was started on cefepime.  CXR this am showed worsening PNA, so her
   luekocytosis is likely secondary to this.  Her lactate was normal this
   morning.
   - Check a differential.
   - Per patient has been having slight diarrhea so will check for C.diff.
   - F/u pending blood cultures.
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection: Continue linezolid and
   azithromycin per outpatient regimen.
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement: NPO for now while still dyspenic as
   she may require intubation.
   - F/u GI recs.

   Images:  CXR ([**8-10**]): Compared to the prior study, there is definite
   increase in retrocardiac density and new left pleural effusion.
   Furthermore, there is patchy density in the left upper lung fields and
   I am concerned about the possibility of multifocal pneumonia. This
   could be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema and therefore followup is
   recommended.
   The heart size is not enlarged, although there is some coarsening of
   right- sided interstitial markings. Again noted is the appearance of an
   S-shaped scoliosis of the spine with accompanying diffuse degenerative
   changes.
   .
   CXR ([**8-12**]):  Appears stable.
   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection admitted on [**8-7**] post-PEG placement now with acute shortness
   of breath in the setting of hypertensive urgency and worsening
   multifocal PNA.
   # Dyspnea/hypoxia:  Most likely secondary to pneumonia vs.
   mycobacterial infection as evident on CXR showing worsening
   infiltrates.  Also occurred initially in the setting of hypertensive
   urgency making flash pulmonary edema a possible contributor to her
   dyspnea and hypoxia, although less convincing by CXR.  Less likely in
   the differential are PE, MI (although EKG unchanged).  Patient
   continues to tolerate non-invasive ventilation (on bipap 10/4 with 8L
   O2) but will monitor for secretions.
   - continue bipap; will consider weaning O2 as tolerated.  [**Month (only) 51**] consider
   trials without mask to watch oxygenation.
   - serially measuring ABGs; consider placing an a line?
   - treat underlying pneumonia with cefepime, cipro, linezolid and
   azithromycin for possible PNA.  (day 1: [**2132-8-11**])
   - follow cultures
   - Control of hypertension as below.
   - TTE reported small left ventricular volume; patient may have aspects
   of diastolic heart failure, making her more susceptible to flash
   pulmonary edema -> will need to be cautious about hydration and BP
   management
   - Albuterol nebs prn
   .
   # Hypertension:  The patient's SBP had decreased to the 140's by the
   time she arrived to the floor.  Her acei had been stopped earlier in
   the hospitalization due to ARF.
   - optimize BP management
   - Will continue home nadaolol at 100 mg po daily.  Will increase
   hydralazine to 50 mg po tid.
   - Will continue holding her acei for now.
   - Will monitor SBP closely and if she becomes hypertensive again can
   give prn hydralazine.
   # Leukocytosis:  Patient found to have a multifocal PNA yesterday and
   was started on cefepime.  CXR this am showed worsening PNA, so her
   luekocytosis is likely secondary to this.  Her lactate was normal this
   morning.
   - Check a differential.
   - Per patient has been having slight diarrhea so will check for C.diff.
   - F/u pending blood cultures.
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection: Continue linezolid and
   azithromycin per outpatient regimen.
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement: NPO for now while still dyspenic as
   she may require intubation.
   - F/u GI recs.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted on [**8-7**] after undergoing a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient presented with acute shortness of breath, hypertensive urgency, and worsening multifocal pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea/Hypoxia: The patient's shortness of breath could be secondary to pneumonia, mycobacterial infection, hypertensive urgency leading to flash pulmonary edema, or pulmonary embolism (PE). Monitoring for secretions while on non-invasive ventilation is important.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be controlled, especially since she has stopped taking her ACE inhibitor due to acute renal failure (ARF). Close monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended, and adjustments in medication may be necessary.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count is likely due to multifocal pneumonia. Follow-up with blood cultures and checking for C.difficile infection is necessary.
4. Mycobacterial Abscessus Infection: The patient should continue linezolid and azithromycin as per the outpatient regimen.
5. Anorexia post G-tube placement: The patient is currently NPO and may require intubation. Follow-up with gastrointestinal recommendations is required.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with h/o atypical mycobacterial infection now with
   admission to ICU with dyspna, hypoxia, pneumonia in the setting of
   recent PEG tube placment.  She has had resonable response to
   non-invasive ventilatory support through to today.
   1)Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure-This would appear to be secondary to
   evolution of pneumonia with acute worsening perhaps in the setting of
   acute changes in LVEDP with tachycardia, hypertension and acute
   pulmonary edema.  She has had good tolerance of non-invasive
   ventilation which may be a reasonable support during this course of
   treatment as long as secretions remain limited and mental status
   remains good.
   For Pneumonia
   -Cefepime/Azithro/Cipro/Linezolid
   For Pulmonary Edema
   -Have normalized BP and HR
   -Echo consistent with LVH and risk for adverse response to tachycardia
   For Support
   -Will maintain [**Hospital1 **]-level support right now with 10/4 and 8 lpm O2
   -The concern is that pulmonary secretions will need to be managed with
   nasal-tracheal suctioning and should the volume become difficult to
   manage will have to consider intubation rather than non-invasive
   ventilation.

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: This could be secondary to the evolution of pneumonia with acute worsening, possibly in the setting of acute changes in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) with tachycardia, hypertension, and acute pulmonary edema.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is already receiving treatment for pneumonia with a combination of antibiotics (Cefepime, Azithromycin, Cipro, and Linezolid).
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient has had normalization of blood pressure and heart rate, but there is a risk for adverse response to tachycardia due to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
4. Secretion management: There is a concern about managing pulmonary secretions, and if they become difficult to manage, the patient may need to be considered for intubation rather than non-invasive ventilation.
5. Nutritional support: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and will need to establish adequate nutritional support through a G-tube (gastrostomy tube).
6. Glycemic control: The patient's blood"

 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2132-8-13**] 05:45 AM
   - BiPAP d/c'd, patient lasted only half hour then complained of SOB,
   was put on BiPAP again. Was taken off BiPAP and put on face shovel,
   lasted a few minutes, and was complaining of a lot of SOB, and
   complained that she couldn't breathe, so put back on BiPAP.
   - GI recs: can start to use PEG tube
   - SBP in the 180s at 8pm, lungs sound crackly, given 10mg IV lasix
   - Patient lost all [**Name8 (MD) 5258**], RN tried to put new PIV in, no success. IV
   nurse came, no success. We tried to put EJ line in but the vein was too
   small to put a line in.
   - In the process of getting another access with ultrasound assistance,
   patient de-satted to 87-90% on high ventilatory support on BiPAP, and
   was complaining that she couldn't breathe. She was almost ""begging"" to
   make her breathing better.
   - Despite ok'ish ABG and sats on higher O2 support, because she was
   asking for help, and because it looked that she was going downhill from
   the respiratory stand point, and didn't want to wait to intubate
   emergently, so decided to intubate.
   - prior to intubation, no access. so an emergent R femoral CVL was
   placed
   - patient was intubated without complication
   - gasping on propofol 70ug, so switched to versed and fentanyl.
   linezolid and fentanyl --can lead to serotonin syndrome, so need to
   watch for hypotension, hyperpyrexia, sedation. Bad SS can cause death.
   - A line was placed to monitor BP as pt was getting hypotensive into
   70s
   - PICC line was ordered

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection admitted on [**8-7**] post-PEG placement now with acute shortness
   of breath in the setting of hypertensive urgency and worsening
   multifocal PNA.
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation. Most likely secondary to
   pneumonia on top of her pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection
   as evident on CXR showing worsening infiltrates.  Also occurred
   initially in the setting of hypertensive urgency making flash pulmonary
   edema a possible contributor to her dyspnea and hypoxia, although less
   convincing by CXR.  Less likely in the differential are PE, MI
   (although EKG unchanged).
   - continue AC, increase RR from 18 to 20 and recheck ABG
   - treat underlying pneumonia with cefepime, cipro, linezolid and
   azithromycin for possible PNA  (day 1: [**2132-8-11**])
   - follow cultures
   - Albuterol inhalers
   - follow daily CXRs
   - get CT chest today to better assess the LUL
   consolidation/collapse/infiltrate
   .
   # Hypotension:  The patient had a history of hypertension, and her ACEI
   had been stopped earlier in the hospitalization due to ARF. Was
   hypotensive overnight after intubation, most likely [**12-24**] propofol. S/P
   change to fentanyl and versed, BP improved.
   - Consider putting a neck CVL in today for CVP measurement and for
   fluid blouses
   - IVF boluses today, 1L NS this AM and re-assess fluid status
   - Will hod off on nadaolol and hydralazine for now until BP is more
   stable.
   - Will continue holding her acei for now.
   - Will monitor SBP closely and if she becomes hypertensive again can
   give prn hydralazine.
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Given all three lines are
   down, could be due to linezolid, however, pt has been on linezolid
   chronically so unlikely to give acute Hct drop as what happened today
   (Hct from 31.7 to 26.1)
   - check Fe studies, B12, folate and hemolysis labs
   - guaiac all stools
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC trending down.  Most likely secondary to
   pneumonia. The down-trending could be from pneumonia being treated,
   effect of linezolid and dilutional.
   - F/u pending cultures
   - treat underlying pneumonia with cefepime, cipro, linezolid and
   azithromycin for possible PNA  (day 1: [**2132-8-11**])
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen.
   - pt not followed by ID currently, will talk to ID today and see if
   they will come to see her
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement:
   - start TF through G-tube today
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,
   hyperpyrexia, neuro exams,  CK levels

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted on [8-7] after a PEG tube placement and presented with acute shortness of breath, hypertensive urgency, and worsening multifocal pneumonia.

The patient's respiratory failure is most likely secondary to pneumonia on top of her pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection, as evident on the chest X-ray showing worsening infiltrates. Other possible contributors to her dyspnea and hypoxia include flash pulmonary edema, although less convincing by the chest X-ray. Less likely in the differential are pulmonary embolism and myocardial infarction.

The patient's hypotension is likely due to the history of hypertension, and her ACE inhibitor had been stopped earlier in the hospitalization due to acute renal failure. She was hypotensive overnight after intubation, most likely due to propofol. The patient's blood pressure improved after changing to fentanyl and versed.

The patient's anemia could be due to linezolid or other causes such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hemolysis. Further investigation is needed, including checking iron studies, B12, folate, and hemolysis labs. The patient's leukocytosis is most likely secondary to pneumonia and is trending down, possibly from pneumonia being treated, the effect of linezolid, and dilutional.

The patient has a mycobacterial abscess"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted on [date] post-PEG placement and presented with acute shortness of breath in the setting of hypertensive urgency and worsening multifocal pneumonia. The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, leading to intubation due to respiratory failure. She required multiple interventions to stabilize her vital signs, including the placement of an arterial line and emergent R femoral CVL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required non-invasive ventilation, which progressed to invasive mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and ABG values is essential to assess the effectiveness of ventilatory support.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension, particularly after intubation. Close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary, and appropriate fluid management should be implemented. If hypertension recurs, prn hydralazine may be considered.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient exhibited leukocytosis, likely secondary to pneumonia. It is important to follow up with pending cultures and continue treatment for the underlying pneumonia with the prescribed antibiotics (cefepime, cipro, linezolid, and azithromycin).

4. Mycobacterial abscessus infection: The patient has an existing mycobacterial abscessus infection, which requires ongoing management with linezolid and azith"

   Imaging: CXR-Multifocal Pneumonia persists--mild clearing in right LL
   opacities--she has remarkable persistence of LUL opacity with
   consolidation, she has evolution of significnat right LL opacity which
   likely represents effusion and infiltrate.
   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with history of atypical mycobacterial infection (M.
   Abscessus) now admit to the ICU with multi-focal pneumonia now with
   failure of tolerance of non-invasive ventilatory support in the setting
   of prolonged course with infection.  Intubation last evening was
   without difficulty but did have extensive attempts to maintain IV
   access with ultimately patient with CVL and A-line placed.  This likely
   represents continued presence of active multi-focal pneumonia with
   inability to maintain adequate support outside of invasive ventilatory
   support.  The pathogen remains to be defined clearly and although
   patient may have had some component of hydrostatic edema around the
   time of initial presentation this would most likely represent evolution
   of multifocal infectious pneumonia
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Cefepime/Linezolid/Cipro/Azithro
   -Will pursue CT scan to better define infiltrates
   -Will follow up sputum cultures
   -Will maintain A/C support and provide increase in RR to move PCO2 to
   50-55
expect minimum 24-48 hours given prolonged respiratory distress
   prior to intubation
   -Do not see clear role for pulmonary edema at this time
   -Maintain bronchodilators
   2)Hypotension
This was seen post intubation and may represent
   medication effects, decrease in sympathetic drive and have seen
   improvement with change in medications for sedation.
   -Follow BP
   -Will maintain reasonable rate control
   -IVF as needed
1 liter IVF given
will continue with fluild bolus as
   needed today
   -Will need to move to central line to allow better invasive monitoring
   to optimize hemodynamics
   -Pressors as needed to maintain MAP=60-65 given chronic hypertension

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of atypical mycobacterial infection (M. Abscessus) admitted to the ICU with multi-focal pneumonia. The patient experienced failure of tolerance of non-invasive ventilatory support and required intubation due to respiratory distress. The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

- Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure likely due to continued presence of active multi-focal pneumonia. The pathogen is still unknown, and the patient is currently on invasive ventilatory support.
- Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension post-intubation, which may be related to medication effects, decreased sympathetic drive, and improvement with changes in sedation medication.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of the bed, performing mouth care, and monitoring respiratory system infection parameters will be implemented to prevent VAP.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic subcutaneous heparin will be administered to reduce the risk of DVT.

3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged bed rest. Prophylactic treatment"

   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection admitted on [**8-7**] post-PEG placement now with acute shortness
   of breath in the setting of hypertensive urgency and worsening
   multifocal PNA
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation. Most likely secondary to
   worsening multifocal pneumonia on top of her pre-existing atypical
   mycobacterial infection as evident on CXR showing worsening
   infiltrates.  CT chest showed bilateral pleural effusions and dilated
   left atrium consistent with CHF.  Also occurred initially in the
   setting of hypertensive urgency making flash pulmonary edema a possible
   contributor to her dyspnea and hypoxia, although less convincing by
   CXR.
   - on AC, RR increased to 20.  Wean FiO2 as tolerated, and consider
   decreasing support.  Recheck ABG.
   - treat underlying pneumonia (gram negative rods growing in sputum)
   with day 4 of:  cefepime, cipro, linezolid and azithromycin for
   possible PNA  (day 1: [**2132-8-11**])
   - changed cipro to q24hours.
   - follow cultures; urinary legionella ordered; f/u GN
   spec/sensitivities
   - Albuterol inhalers
   - get CT chest yesterday that showed multifocal pneumonia
   - given lasix 10mg X 1 given wet imaging and aggressive hydration;
   pressures remained stable

   # Hypotension:  The patient had a history of hypertension.  Remained
   hypotensive overnight with low diastolic pressures
   - LIJ placed yesterday for CVP measurement and for fluid blouses.  CVP
   and urine output were low throughout the night.
   - given 4L LR and  1L LR this AM and re-assess fluid status
   - favor pressors > IVF
   - Will hold off on nadaolol and hydralazine for now until BP is more
   stable.
   - Will continue holding her acei for now.
   - Will monitor SBP closely and if she becomes hypertensive again can
   give prn hydralazine.
   - in regards to low urinary output, bladder scan was nl, foley flushed,
   urine lytes with FENA: 0.01%, implying prerenal etiology.  IVF as
   necessary
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   - has not stooled yet, but will test for guiac positive
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC trending down.  Most likely secondary to
   pneumonia. The down-trending could be from pneumonia being treated,
   effect of linezolid and dilutional.
   - F/u pending cultures
   - treat underlying pneumonia with cefepime, cipro, linezolid and
   azithromycin for possible PNA  (day 1: [**2132-8-11**])

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and atypical mycobacterial infection admitted for post-PEG placement. She presented with acute shortness of breath, hypertensive urgency, and worsening multifocal pneumonia. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Her condition worsened, leading to respiratory failure. Imaging showed bilateral pleural effusions and dilated left atrium consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). She also experienced hypotension, which required placement of a LiJ (likely a central venous catheter) and aggressive hydration. Her anemia and leukocytosis are likely secondary to pneumonia. She has a mycobacterial abscessus infection and is currently on linezolid and azithromycin. She has anorexia post G-tube placement and will start tube feeds. She is at risk for serotonin syndrome due to the medications she is taking.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening multifocal pneumonia and pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection could lead to respiratory failure, especially considering her bronchiectasis.
2. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The presence of bilateral pleural effusions and dilated left atrium suggests the possibility of CHF, which can be exacerbated by pneumonia and other factors.
3. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypertension and low diastolic pressures indicate the possibility of hypotension"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted on August 7th after experiencing acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. She underwent a procedure called percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Upon admission, she was found to have worsening multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure, which required intubation. She also had hypotension, anemia, leukocytosis, and a mycobacterial abscessus infection. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics for pneumonia, linezolid, and azithromycin for her atypical mycobacterial infection. She has also been started on tube feeds through a gastrostomy tube and is being monitored for signs of serotonin syndrome due to the use of linezolid and fentanyl.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to multifocal pneumonia on top of her pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection. Flash pulmonary edema is a possible contributor, although less likely. Monitoring and providing appropriate respiratory support, such as continuing assisted ventilation, treating underlying pneumonia, and rechecking arterial blood gases, are crucial.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to her history of hypertension. She remained hypotensive overnight with low diastolic pressures. Close monitoring of blood pressure and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of atypical mycobacterial infection who is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. She has been placed on mechanical ventilation support with A/C and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for the pneumonia. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97%), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 102/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She has edema in both lower extremities and her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose, and lactic acid levels. Imaging studies reveal extensive multi-lobar pneumonia, and microbiological cultures are pending for Legionella and gram-negative rods.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure if not appropriately managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may progress if the underlying cause of the pneumonia is not effectively treated.
3. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's urine output is low, which may indicate acute kidney injury or urinary tract obstruction.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is below the normal range, indicating inadequate oxygenation.
5. Malignant Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated, potentially indicating"

   2. New moderate bilateral nonhemorrhagic layering pleural effusions and
   increased left atrial enlargement compatible with congestive heart
   failure.
   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection admitted on [**8-7**] post-PEG placement now with acute shortness
   of breath in the setting of hypertensive urgency and worsening
   multifocal PNA
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation. Most likely secondary to
   worsening multifocal pneumonia on top of her pre-existing atypical
   mycobacterial infection as evident on CXR showing worsening
   infiltrates.  CT chest showed bilateral pleural effusions and dilated
   left atrium consistent with CHF.  Also occurred initially in the
   setting of hypertensive urgency making flash pulmonary edema a possible
   contributor to her dyspnea and hypoxia, although less convincing by
   CXR.
   - on AC, RR increased to 20.  Wean FiO2 as tolerated, and consider
   decreasing support.  Recheck ABG.
   - treat underlying pneumonia (gram negative rods growing in sputum)
   with day 4 of:  cefepime, cipro, linezolid and azithromycin for
   possible PNA  (day 1: [**2132-8-11**])
   - changed cipro to q24hours.
   - follow cultures; urinary legionella ordered; f/u GN
   spec/sensitivities
   - Albuterol inhalers
   - get CT chest yesterday that showed multifocal pneumonia
   - given lasix 10mg X 1 given wet imaging and aggressive hydration;
   pressures remained stable
   .
   # Hypotension:  The patient had a history of hypertension.  Remained
   hypotensive overnight with low diastolic pressures
   - LIJ placed yesterday for CVP measurement and for fluid blouses.  CVP
   and urine output were low throughout the night.
   - Pressures stable; was able to give 10mg IV lasix with good response
   - favor pressors > IVF
   - Will hold off on nadaolol and hydralazine for now until BP is more
   stable.
   - Will continue holding her acei for now.
   - Will monitor SBP closely and if she becomes hypertensive again can
   give prn hydralazine.
   - in regards to low urinary output, bladder scan was nl, foley flushed,
   urine lytes with FENA: 0.01%, implying prerenal etiology.  IVF as
   necessary
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   - has not stooled yet, but will test for guiac positive
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC trending down.  Most likely secondary to
   pneumonia. The down-trending could be from pneumonia being treated,
   effect of linezolid and dilutional.
   - F/u pending cultures
   - treat underlying pneumonia with cefepime, cipro, linezolid and
   azithromycin for possible PNA  (day 1: [**2132-8-11**])
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen.
   - pt not followed by ID currently, will talk to ID today and see if
   they will come to see her
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement:
   - start TF through G-tube today
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,
   hyperpyrexia, neuro exams,  CK levels

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to worsening multifocal pneumonia. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if the underlying infection does not improve or if there is a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has increased left atrial enlargement and moderate bilateral nonhemorrhagic layering pleural effusions, which are compatible with CHF. If the patient's cardiac function does not improve, this could lead to worsening heart failure symptoms.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and experienced hypertensive urgency. If not properly managed, there is a risk of recurrent hypertension and potential complications such as end-organ damage.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Although the urine culture did not show any growth, it is important to monitor for signs of UTI due to the presence of urinary catheters.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of anemia and provide appropriate treatment.

6. Mycobacterial abscessus infection: The patient has a known atypical mycobacterial infection, and there is a possibility of abscessus infection. Monitoring for worsening symptoms and continuing the appropriate antibiotic regimen is essential.

7. Risk of serotonin syndrome: The patient is"

   CXR: improved multifocal pneumonia on the right lung field.  Left lung
   field stable.
   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection admitted on [**8-7**] post-PEG placement now with acute shortness
   of breath in the setting of hypertensive urgency and worsening
   multifocal PNA
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on
   top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.  CT chest showed
   bilateral pleural effusions and dilated left atrium consistent with
   CHF.  Also occurred initially in the setting of hypertensive urgency
   making flash pulmonary edema a possible contributor to her dyspnea and
   hypoxia, although less convincing by CXR.
   - successfully weaned FiO2 overnight.  Attempted to switch to PS this
   AM, however SBP spiked to >200 and copious secretions suctioned.
   Placed back on AC at that time.   Recheck ABG.  Later this PM, consider
   reattempt transition to PS with better blood pressure control.  Look
   for stabilization of fever and decrease in secretion production
   - treat underlying pneumonia (pseudomonas) with day 5 of:  cefepime,
   cipro, linezolid and azithromycin for possible PNA  (day 1: [**2132-8-11**])
   - changed cipro to q24hours.
   - follow cultures; urinary legionella ordered; f/u GN
   spec/sensitivities
   - Albuterol inhalers
   - get CT chest yesterday that showed multifocal pneumonia
   - given lasix 10mg X 1 given wet imaging and aggressive hydration;
   pressures remained stable
   .
   # Hypotension:  The patient had a history of hypertension.  Remained
   hypotensive overnight with low diastolic pressures
   - LIJ placed yesterday for CVP measurement and for fluid blouses.  CVP
   and urine output were low throughout the night.
   - as hypotension has resolved, can consider d/cing CVL and obtain PICC
   placement
   - will add hydralazine given SBP spike to > 200.  Monitor for
   hypotension
   - keep I/O
s even
   - favor fluid boluses
   - in regards to low urinary output, bladder scan was nl, foley flushed,
   urine lytes with FENA: 0.01%, implying prerenal etiology.  IVF as
   necessary
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   - has not stooled yet, but will test for guiac positive
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC trending down.  Most likely secondary to
   pneumonia. The down-trending could be from pneumonia being treated,
   effect of linezolid and dilutional.
   - F/u pending cultures
   - treat underlying pneumonia with cefepime, cipro, linezolid and
   azithromycin for possible PNA  (day 1: [**2132-8-11**])
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen.
   - pt not followed by ID currently, will talk to ID today and see if
   they will come to see her
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement:
   - continue TF through G-tube
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,
   hyperpyrexia, neuro exams,  CK levels

","The patient's progress note indicates that they have been admitted to the ICU with a history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. They presented with acute shortness of breath in the setting of hypertensive urgency and worsening multifocal pneumonia. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure caused by multifocal pneumonia on top of the pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.

The note also mentions that a CT chest showed bilateral pleural effusions and dilated left atrium consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). Initially, flash pulmonary edema was considered as a possible contributor to the patient's dyspnea and hypoxia, although less convincing by CXR.

The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, with spikes to over 200 mmHg. The note mentions that the attempt to switch to pressure support (PS) mode of ventilation was unsuccessful due to the high blood pressure and copious secretions. Therefore, the patient was placed back on assist-control (AC) mode.

There are plans to treat the underlying pneumonia with cefepime, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, and azithromycin starting from day 5. The patient's cultures will be followed, and urinary legionella will be ordered. The goal is to stabilize the patient's condition, decrease fever, and improve secretion production before attempting another transition to PS mode.

Regarding the patient's hypotension, it is mentioned that they had a history of hypertension"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with multifocal pneumonia, respiratory failure, and a history of Mycobacterium abscessus infection. She has been in the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 weaning. The patient has shown sparse growth of Pseudomonas in her sputum and has received various antibiotics including cefepime, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, and linezolid. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/40 to 152/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's temperature is within normal range. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,340 mL and output of 1,280 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's abdominal exam is soft and non-tender with present bowel sounds. Imaging shows good positioning of endotracheal tube and central venous line, but persistence of bilateral pneumonia with improved aeration in the right lung. The patient has oliguria/anuria, hypoxemia, hypertension (malignant), and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may worsen if there is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation support.

   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on
   top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.   Also occurred
   initially in the setting of hypertensive urgency making flash pulmonary
   edema a possible contributor to her dyspnea and hypoxia, although less
   convincing by CXR.  The barriers to extubation include severe
   multifocal pneumonia and baseline poor lung function [**12-24**] atypical
   mycobacterial infection and altered mental status.
   - On AC currently.  Attempt to switch to PS this AM, and  recheck ABG.
   - will try to decrease dead space by decreasing the tube length
   - continue to wean down sedation
   - continue regular suction
   - treat underlying pseudomonas pneumonia with double abx  (cefepime and
   cipro) (day 1: [**2132-8-11**])
   - continue linezolid and azithromycin for atypical mycobacterial
   infection

   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen.

   # Leukocytosis:  WBC stable.  Most likely secondary to pneumonia. Pt is
   on linezolid which could potentially lead to decreased WBC.
   - treat underlying pneumonia with cefepime, cipro, linezolid and
   azithromycin for pseudomonas pneumonia and atypical mycobacterial
   infection as above

   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   .
   # Hypertension:  The patient had a history of hypertension.
   - continue hydralazine 25mg [**Hospital1 7**] (added on [**8-15**]).  Her home dose is 50mg
   [**Hospital1 7**], so if BP continues to run high today, can increase to 50mg [**Hospital1 7**]

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for a planned percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement but was transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. Upon evaluation, she was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia on top of her pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection. The patient required intubation due to respiratory failure caused by severe multifocal pneumonia and baseline poor lung function. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 300 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. She is also being treated for a mycobacterial abscess infection with linezolid and azithromycin. Other issues include leukocytosis likely secondary to pneumonia, anemia, hypertension, and the risk of serotonin syndrome due to the combination of linezolid and fentanyl. The patient's current plan includes weaning down sedation, regular suctioning, and treating underlying infections with appropriate antibiotics. The patient's code status is full code, and she is expected to remain in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe multifocal pneumonia and baseline poor lung function pose a significant risk of continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection admitted on [**8-7**] post-PEG placement now with acute shortness
   of breath in the setting of hypertensive urgency and worsening
   multifocal PNA
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on
   top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.  CT chest showed
   bilateral pleural effusions and dilated left atrium consistent with
   CHF.  Also occurred initially in the setting of hypertensive urgency
   making flash pulmonary edema a possible contributor to her dyspnea and
   hypoxia, although less convincing by CXR.
   - successfully weaned FiO2 overnight.  Attempted to switch to PS this
   AM, however SBP spiked to >200 and copious secretions suctioned.
   Placed back on AC at that time.   Recheck ABG.  Later this PM, consider
   reattempt transition to PS with better blood pressure control.  Look
   for stabilization of fever and decrease in secretion production
   - treat underlying pneumonia (pseudomonas) with day 5 of:  cefepime,
   cipro, linezolid and azithromycin for possible PNA  (day 1: [**2132-8-11**])
   - changed cipro to q24hours.
   - follow cultures; urinary legionella ordered; f/u GN
   spec/sensitivities
   - Albuterol inhalers
   - get CT chest yesterday that showed multifocal pneumonia
   - given lasix 10mg X 1 given wet imaging and aggressive hydration;
   pressures remained stable
   .
   # Hypotension:  The patient had a history of hypertension.  Remained
   hypotensive overnight with low diastolic pressures
   - LIJ placed yesterday for CVP measurement and for fluid blouses.  CVP
   and urine output were low throughout the night.
   - as hypotension has resolved, can consider d/cing CVL and obtain PICC
   placement
   - will add hydralazine given SBP spike to > 200.  Monitor for
   hypotension
   - keep I/O
s even
   - favor fluid boluses
   - in regards to low urinary output, bladder scan was nl, foley flushed,
   urine lytes with FENA: 0.01%, implying prerenal etiology.  IVF as
   necessary
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   - has not stooled yet, but will test for guiac positive
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC trending down.  Most likely secondary to
   pneumonia. The down-trending could be from pneumonia being treated,
   effect of linezolid and dilutional.
   - F/u pending cultures
   - treat underlying pneumonia with cefepime, cipro, linezolid and
   azithromycin for possible PNA  (day 1: [**2132-8-11**])
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen.
   - pt not followed by ID currently, will talk to ID today and see if
   they will come to see her
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement:
   - continue TF through G-tube
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,
   hyperpyrexia, neuro exams,  CK levels

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted on 08-07 after undergoing a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient presented with acute shortness of breath in the setting of hypertensive urgency and worsening multifocal pneumonia.

Respiratory failure: The patient required intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection. A CT chest showed bilateral pleural effusions and a dilated left atrium consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). Flash pulmonary edema is also a possible contributor to her dyspnea and hypoxia, although less convincing by chest X-ray.

The patient successfully weaned FiO2 overnight but attempted to switch to pressure support (PS) in the morning, however, her systolic blood pressure spiked to over 200 and copious secretions were suctioned. She was placed back on assist-control (AC) ventilation at that time. A repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) is planned later this afternoon, and a reattempt transition to PS with better blood pressure control will be considered. Fever stabilization and decreased secretion production are also goals.

Treatment for underlying pneumonia (pseudomonas) will be initiated on day 5 with cefepime, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, and azithromycin. Urinary legionella has been ordered"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted on [**8-7**] after undergoing a PEG placement and presented with acute shortness of breath, hypertensive urgency, and worsening multifocal pneumonia. She has been intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has signs of congestive heart failure (CHF) and flash pulmonary edema, as indicated by bilateral pleural effusions and a dilated left atrium on CT chest. She has been treated with antibiotics for pseudomonas infection and is currently receiving cefepime, ciprofloxacin, linezolid, and azithromycin. The patient's leukocytosis is likely secondary to pneumonia, and her anemia may be related to chronic disease or iron deficiency. She is at risk for serotonin syndrome due to the combination of linezolid and fentanyl. The patient's condition requires close monitoring for any signs of serotonin syndrome, including hypotension, hyperpyrexia, neuro exams, and CK levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by multifocal pneumonia and CHF.
2. Hypotension: The patient had a history of hypertension and experienced hypotension overnight, which required the administration of hydralazine and close monitoring of blood pressure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with chronic M.abscessus lung disease admitted for PEG tube placement complicated by post-procedure acute respiratory failure from multifocal Pseudomonas pneumonia. The patient remains intubated and is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) while being weaned off the ventilator as tolerated. The medical team is limiting their ability to extubate the patient.

The patient is also diagnosed with pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is currently being treated with cefepime and ciprofloxacin for a duration of two weeks due to underlying structural lung disease and Pseudomonas infection. Additionally, the patient is on linezolid and azithromycin for M.abscessus.

The patient's blood pressure is being controlled with hydralazine, and adjustments will be made as needed. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has not changed.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/42 to 168/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection originally admitted on [**8-7**] for PEG placement  was
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency, and was found to have multifocal pseudomonas
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on
   top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.   Also occurred
   initially in the setting of hypertensive urgency making flash pulmonary
   edema a possible contributor to her dyspnea and hypoxia, although less
   convincing by CXR.  The barriers to extubation include severe
   multifocal pneumonia and baseline poor lung function [**12-24**] atypical
   mycobacterial infection and altered mental status.
   - On AC currently.  Attempt to switch to PS this AM, and  recheck ABG.
   - will try to decrease dead space by decreasing the tube length
   - continue to wean down sedation
   - continue regular suction
   - treat underlying pseudomonas pneumonia with double abx  (today is day
   7 of 14 day course of cefepime and cipro) (day 1: [**2132-8-11**])
   - continue linezolid and azithromycin for atypical mycobacterial
   infection
   - continue Albuterol inhalers
   .
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC stable.  Most likely secondary to pneumonia. Pt is
   on linezolid which could potentially lead to decreased WBC.
   - treat underlying pneumonia with cefepime, cipro, linezolid and
   azithromycin for pseudomonas pneumonia and atypical mycobacterial
   infection as above
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   .
   # Hypertension:  The patient had a history of hypertension.
   - continue hydralazine 25mg [**Hospital1 7**] (added on [**8-15**]).  Her home dose is 50mg
   [**Hospital1 7**], so if BP continues to run high today, can increase to 50mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - keep I/O
s even today
   .
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement:
   - continue TF through G-tube
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,
   hyperpyrexia, worsening neuro exams,  high CK levels

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath in the setting of hypertensive urgency. She was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia.

She underwent intubation due to respiratory failure caused by severe multifocal pneumonia and poor lung function. The barriers to extubation include severe multifocal pneumonia, baseline poor lung function, and altered mental status.

The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH 7.47, pCO2 46, and pO2 107.

The patient is being treated for pseudomonas pneumonia with cefepime and ciprofloxacin, as well as for atypical mycobacterial infection with linezolid and azithromycin. She is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 13.4 K/uL, which is likely secondary to pneumonia. Her hemoglobin (Hct) level is stable and there is"

   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on
   top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.   Also occurred
   initially in the setting of hypertensive urgency making flash pulmonary
   edema a possible contributor to her dyspnea and hypoxia, although less
   convincing by CXR.  The barriers to extubation include severe
   multifocal pneumonia and baseline poor lung function [**12-24**] atypical
   mycobacterial infection and altered mental status.
   - On AC currently.  Recheck ABG.
   - will try to decrease dead space by decreasing the tube length

   sputum, blood).  given failure to improve on cefepime/cipro, and the
   low genetic barrier to fluoroquinolone resistance, switched to
   meropenem and inhaled tobramycin.  Sent mini-bal for gram stain and
   culture as well as galactomannan.  Checked serum galactomannin and
   beta-d-glucan.  Will follow up test results
   - continue linezolid and azithromycin for atypical mycobacterial
   infection
   - continue Albuterol inhalers

   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC stable.  Most likely secondary to pneumonia. Pt is
   on linezolid which could potentially lead to decreased WBC.
   - treat underlying pneumonia with [**Last Name (un) 614**], tobramycin, linezolid and
   azithromycin for pseudomonas pneumonia and atypical mycobacterial
   infection as above

   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal

   # Hypertension:  The patient had a history of hypertension.
   - continue hydralazine 25mg [**Hospital1 7**] (added on [**8-15**]).  Her home dose is 50mg
   [**Hospital1 7**], so if BP continues to run high today, can increase to 50mg [**Hospital1 7**]

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for a PEG placement but was transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath in the setting of hypertensive urgency. She was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to severe multifocal pneumonia and baseline poor lung function. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure if the pneumonia does not improve.
2. Infection: The patient has an ongoing infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa. There is a risk of progression or development of resistance to the current antibiotics being used.
3. Mycobacterial abscessus infection: The patient also has an atypical mycobacterial infection, which requires ongoing treatment with linezolid and azithromycin.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently being treated with hydralazine. If the blood pressure continues to run high, the dose may need to be increased.
5. Anorexia: The patient is experiencing anorexia since the G-tube placement. It is important to continue feeding through the G-tube to meet the patient's nutritional needs.
6. Risk of serotonin syndrome: The patient is on linezolid and fentanyl, which can potentially lead to serotonin syndrome. Monitoring for signs of serotonin syndrome"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with chronic M.abscessus lung disease admitted for PEG tube placement. The patient developed acute respiratory failure from multifocal Pseudomonas pneumonia and is currently intubated. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV). However, the attending physician's ability to extubate the patient is being limited. There is a plan to wean the ventilator as tolerated.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by bacterial infection, specifically Pseudomonas. The patient is being treated with cefepime and ciprofloxacin for this infection, with a planned two-week course due to underlying structural lung disease and Pseudomonas infection.

3. M.abscessus Infection: The patient is also being treated with linezolid and azithromycin for Mycobacterium abscessus infection.

4. Hypertension: The patient has malignant hypertension, which is being controlled with hydralazine. The blood pressure needs to be adjusted as needed.

5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have not changed significantly.

6. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving nutritional support through Fibersource HN (Full) at 45 mL/hour.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection originally admitted on [**8-7**] for PEG placement  was
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency, and was found to have multifocal pseudomonas
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on
   top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.   Also occurred
   initially in the setting of hypertensive urgency making flash pulmonary

- She was admitted for PEG placement but developed acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency.
- On admission, she was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia.
- She required intubation due to respiratory failure caused by severe multifocal pneumonia and baseline poor lung function.
- The patient also has an atypical mycobacterial infection and altered mental status, making extubation challenging.
- She is currently on AC (assisted care) and will be rechecked for ABG (arterial blood gas).
- The patient's line was lost and unsuccessful attempts were made to replace it.
- She received IV Lasix to address fluid balance.
- The patient has been switched to meropenem and inhaled tobramycin due to failure to improve on cefepime/cipro.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for a PEG placement but was transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. She was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia. The patient underwent intubation and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The barriers to extubation include severe multifocal pneumonia, baseline poor lung function, atypical mycobacterial infection, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe multifocal pneumonia and baseline poor lung function pose a significant risk for ongoing respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has a rising bicarbonate level, indicating metabolic alkalosis. This could be due to diuresis or other underlying conditions. Careful monitoring of electrolytes and acid-base balance is required.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on hydralazine. If her blood pressure remains high, the dose may be increased. However, careful monitoring of blood pressure is essential to avoid hypotension.
4. Mycobacterial Abscessus Infection: The patient has an ongoing infection with Mycobacterium abscessus. It is important to continue treatment with linezolid and azithromycin as prescribed.

   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection originally admitted on [**8-7**] for PEG placement  was
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency, and was found to have multifocal pseudomonas
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on
   top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.   Also occurred
   initially in the setting of hypertensive urgency making flash pulmonary
   edema a possible contributor in addition to possible PNA to her dyspnea
   and hypoxia, although less convincing by CXR.  The barriers to
   extubation include severe multifocal pneumonia and baseline poor lung
   function [**12-24**] atypical mycobacterial infection and altered mental
   status.  Appears to be third-spacing and has net volume increase.
   - On AC currently.  Recheck ABG.
   - Consider decreasing level of sedation to monitor improvement
   - will try to decrease dead space by decreasing the tube length
   - continue regular suction
   - Cont meropenem and inhaled tobramycin as per ID.  Sent mini-bal for
   gram stain and culture as well as galactomannan.  F/U serum
   galactomannin and beta-d-glucan.  Will follow up test results
   - continue linezolid and azithromycin for atypical mycobacterial
   infection
   - continue Albuterol inhalers
   - trial of diuresis with lasix; net fluid goal -1L for today
   - start diamox (500mg TID) to try to keep bicarb from increasing
   further and prevent further metabolic alkalosis, titrating to bicarb?
   of 28
   - consider following VBGs rather than ABGs if her pressures remain
   stable
   .
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC stable.  Most likely secondary to pneumonia. Pt is
   on linezolid which could potentially lead to decreased WBC.
   - treat underlying pneumonia with [**Last Name (un) 614**], tobramycin, linezolid and
   azithromycin for pseudomonas pneumonia and atypical mycobacterial
   infection as above
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   .
   # Hypertension:  The patient had a history of hypertension.
   - continue hydralazine 25mg [**Hospital1 7**] (added on [**8-15**]).  Her home dose is 50mg
   [**Hospital1 7**], so if BP continues to run high today, can increase to 50mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - keep I/O

   .
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement:
   - continue TF through G-tube
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,
   hyperpyrexia, worsening neuro exams,  high CK levels

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for a PEG placement but was transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia on top of her pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Tcurrent: 36.4°C, HR: 88 bpm, BP: 146/43 mmHg, RR: 20 breaths/min, SpO2: 94%
- Respiratory support: On mechanical ventilation (PRVC/AC mode), FiO2: 40%, PEEP: 8 cmH2O
- Laboratory results: WBC count increased, Hct stable, elevated creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels
- Imaging: Chest X-Ray shows improvement in right upper lobe, stable LLL and RLL consolidations
- Microbiology: Urine culture negative, blood culture pending, sputum cultures show pan-sensitive pseudomonas aeruginosa and rare growth of Aspergillus

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe multifocal pneumonia and baseline poor lung function make her at high risk for respiratory failure.
2. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's history of hypertension and the recent hypert"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and atypical mycobacterial infection.
- She was admitted for PEG placement but was later transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath in the setting of hypertensive urgency.
- The patient has multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia and is currently intubated.
- She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, severe multifocal pneumonia, baseline poor lung function, altered mental status, and third-spacing.
- The patient is being treated with diuretics, acetazolamide, diamox, and sedation reduction.
- She is also receiving antibiotics for pseudomonas pneumonia and atypical mycobacterial infection.
- The patient has leukocytosis, anemia, and hypertension.
- She is at risk for serotonin syndrome due to the use of linezolid and fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a serious concern as she is currently intubated and has severe multifocal pneumonia. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension, along with the recent hypertensive urgency, indicates that there is a risk of recurrent or uncontrolled hypertension. This could lead to complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection originally admitted on [**8-7**] for PEG placement  was
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency, and was found to have multifocal pseudomonas
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on
   top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.   Also occurred
   initially in the setting of hypertensive urgency.  The barriers to
   extubation include multifocal pneumonia with secretions,  baseline poor
   lung function [**12-24**] atypical mycobacterial infection and altered mental
   status.  Is third-spacing and has net volume increase.
   -fluid status with goal of net even today to help with secretions
   - D/C diamox  to protect kidneys
   - On AC currently, will try to wean sedation and change to propofol
   with prn zyprexa to see how she does and do a trial of PS
   - continue regular suction
   - Cont meropenem and inhaled tobramycin as per ID.  Sent mini-bal for
   gram stain and culture as well as galactomannan.  F/U serum
   galactomannin and beta-d-glucan.
   - continue linezolid and azithromycin for atypical mycobacterial
   infection
   - continue Albuterol inhalers
   - CT to rule out necrotizing PNA per ID is still under discussion as
   patient is improving
will d/w ID further because it is currently
   unclear how this will change management  since she is being treated for
   pseudomonas and MRSA with linezolid and meropenem/tobra and she
   continues to clinically improve
   .
   .
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC stable.
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   .
   # Hypertension:  Patient with episode of hypotension this morning,
   responded to 1L of NS and then became hypertensive with decreased
   sedation.
   - discontinue hydralazine 25mg [**Hospital1 7**] for now, given change in sedation to
   propofol
   - keep patient even today
   .
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement:
   - continue TF through G-tube
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,
   hyperpyrexia, worsening neuro exams,  high CK levels

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for PEG placement but was transferred to the ICU for acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. Upon evaluation, she was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory failure: She underwent intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection. The barriers to extubation include multifocal pneumonia with secretions, baseline poor lung function, atypical mycobacterial infection, and altered mental status.
- Fluid status: The goal is to achieve a net even fluid balance today to help with secretions.
- D/C diamox to protect kidneys.
- On AC currently, will try to wean sedation and change to propofol with prn zyprexa to see how she does and do a trial of PS.
- Continue regular suction.
- Continue meropenem and inhaled tobramycin as per ID. Sent mini-bal for gram stain and culture as well as galactomannan. F/U serum galactomannin and beta-d-glucan.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for a PEG placement but was transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. The patient was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia on top of her pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to severe multifocal pneumonia and baseline poor lung function. There are also concerns about flash pulmonary edema as a possible contributor to her dyspnea and hypoxia. The patient is intubated and sedated, with a tracheostomy tube in place.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, likely secondary to pneumonia, anemia with no evidence of active bleeding, and hypertension. The patient is being treated with meropenem and inhaled tobramycin for pseudomonas pneumonia, as well as linezolid and azithromycin for atypical mycobacterial infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and at risk for developing VAP due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Nosocomial infection: Given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU, there is a risk of developing nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or central line"

   =================================
   Patient has good oxygenation on present settings; would decrease PEEP
   today; look for AutoPEEP. Would keep fluids even today; CXR suggests
   ongoing volume overload but BP has been marginal; has been requiring
   intermittent fluid boluses. Would stop acetazolamide - hypercapnia will
   facilitate getting her off ventilator. Antihyptensives stopped.
   Continues on antibiotics for pseudmonas and atypical mycobacteria.
   Repeat blood cultures with drop in BP. WBC down again today.
   Hct stable. No evidence of bleeding. Not at transfusion threshold.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, such as increased oxygen requirements or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia, which is a bacterial infection affecting the lungs. There is a risk of worsening infection or development of antibiotic resistance.

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level suggests possible heart failure. There is a risk of further cardiac decompensation and fluid overload.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This may be due to sepsis secondary to the pneumonia or heart failure. There is a risk of organ hypoperfusion and shock.

5. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient is producing low urine output, which could indicate renal dysfunction. This can be caused by hypotension, sepsis, or medications. There is a risk of acute kidney injury.

6. Hypoxemia: The patient has low oxygen levels in the blood despite being on supplemental oxygen. This indicates inadequate oxygenation. There is a risk of tissue hypoxia and organ damage.

7. Malignant Hypertension:"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection originally admitted on [**8-7**] for PEG placement  was
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency, and was found to have multifocal pseudomonas
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on
   top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.   Also occurred
   initially in the setting of hypertensive urgency.  The barriers to
   extubation include multifocal pneumonia with secretions,  baseline poor
   lung function [**12-24**] atypical mycobacterial infection and altered mental
   status.  Is third-spacing and has net volume increase.
   - spontaneous breathing trial off propofol this AM.  If tolerates well,
   will move towards extubation today
   - goal of net even volume today to help with secretions
   - On pressure support currently tolerating well
   - Was on propofol + fentanyl wean for sedation given some agitation
   when fentanyl stopped.  Fentanyl stopped this AM and tolerated well
   without agitation.  Off propofol now for SBT.  Will continue with
   propofol and fentanyl as needed for sedation
   - continue regular suction
   - Cont meropenem and inhaled tobramycin.  Will discuss with ID if 14
   day course is sufficient
   - Sent mini-bal for gram stain and culture as well as galactomannan.
   F/U serum galactomannin and beta-d-glucan.
   - continue linezolid and azithromycin for atypical mycobacterial
   infection
   - continue Albuterol inhalers
   - CT to rule out necrotizing PNA per ID is still under discussion as
   patient is improving
will d/w ID further because it is currently
   unclear how this will change management  since she is being treated for
   pseudomonas and MRSA with linezolid and meropenem/tobra and she
   continues to clinically improve
   .
   .
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC trending down slightly
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   .
   # Hypertension:  Patient with episode of hypotension yesterday,
   responded to 1L of NS and then became hypertensive with decreased
   sedation.
   - discontinue hydralazine 25mg [**Hospital1 7**] for now, given change in sedation to
   propofol
   - keep patient even today
   - monitor BPs and consider restarting hydralazine if hypertensive once
   stable from a respiratory/sedation perspective
   .
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement:
   - continue TF through G-tube
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,
   hyperpyrexia, worsening neuro exams,  high CK levels

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for PEG placement but was transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath in the setting of hypertensive urgency. Upon evaluation, she was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory failure: She underwent intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on top of a pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection. She also experienced initial respiratory failure in the setting of hypertensive urgency. The barriers to extubation include multifocal pneumonia with secretions, baseline poor lung function, atypical mycobacterial infection, and altered mental status.
- Spontaneous breathing trial: The patient is currently off propofol and tolerating it well. If she continues to tolerate it, she will be moved towards extubation today.
- Secretions: The goal is to help with secretions by achieving a net even volume today.
- Pressure support: The patient is currently on pressure support and tolerating it well.
- Sedation: She was previously on propofol + fentanyl wean for sedation because of some agitation when fentanyl stopped. Fentanyl was stopped this morning and she tolerated it well without agitation. She is now off propofol for a spontaneous breathing trial and will continue with propofol and fentanyl as needed for sedation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for PEG placement but developed acute shortness of breath and was transferred to the ICU for hypertensive urgency. Upon arrival, she was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and has multiple barriers to extubation, including multifocal pneumonia, poor lung function, and altered mental status. Her fluid status is being managed to address secretions, and she is receiving multiple antibiotics for her infections. There are concerns about potential complications such as serotonin syndrome, hypertensive crisis, and anorexia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The barriers to extubation include multifocal pneumonia, baseline poor lung function, and altered mental status. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and ongoing weaning trials will be necessary to prevent prolonged mechanical ventilation or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertensive urgency and is currently hypertensive. Monitoring blood pressure closely and adjusting antihypertensive medications as needed will be important to prevent complications associated with uncontrolled hypertension, such as hypertensive encephalopathy or aortic dissection.
3. Infection: The patient has multiple infections, including pseudomonas pneumonia and atypical mycobacterial infection. Close"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection originally admitted on [**8-7**] for PEG placement  was
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency, and was found to have multifocal pseudomonas
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on
   top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.   Also occurred
   initially in the setting of hypertensive urgency.  The barriers to
   extubation include multifocal pneumonia with secretions,  baseline poor
   lung function [**12-24**] atypical mycobacterial infection and altered mental
   status.  Is third-spacing and has net volume increase.
   -fluid status with goal of net even today to help with secretions
   - On pressure support currently tolerating well
   - On propofol with fentanyl wean for sedation given some agitation when
   fentanyl stopped.  Will continue to wean fentanyl 25% per day
   - continue regular suction
   - Cont meropenem and inhaled tobramycin as per ID.
   - Sent mini-bal for gram stain and culture as well as galactomannan.
   F/U serum galactomannin and beta-d-glucan.
   - continue linezolid and azithromycin for atypical mycobacterial
   infection
   - continue Albuterol inhalers
   - CT to rule out necrotizing PNA per ID is still under discussion as
   patient is improving
will d/w ID further because it is currently
   unclear how this will change management  since she is being treated for
   pseudomonas and MRSA with linezolid and meropenem/tobra and she
   continues to clinically improve
   .
   .
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC trending down slightly
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   .
   # Hypertension:  Patient with episode of hypotension yesterday,
   responded to 1L of NS and then became hypertensive with decreased
   sedation.
   - discontinue hydralazine 25mg [**Hospital1 7**] for now, given change in sedation to
   propofol
   - keep patient even today
   .
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement:
   - continue TF through G-tube
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,
   hyperpyrexia, worsening neuro exams,  high CK levels

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection originally admitted on [**8-7**] for PEG placement  was
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency, and was found to have multifocal pseudomonas
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on
   top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.   Also occurred
   initially in the setting of hypertensive urgency.  The barriers to
   extubation include multifocal pneumonia with secretions,  baseline poor
   lung function [**12-24**] atypical mycobacterial infection and altered mental
   status.  Is third-spacing and has net volume increase.
   - Wean sedation by stopping midazolam and continuing fentanyl prn and
   propofol.  If tolerates well, will move towards extubation tomorrow
   - goal of net even volume today to help with secretions
   - On pressure support currently tolerating well
   - continue regular suction
   - Cont meropenem and inhaled tobramycin.  Will discuss with ID if 14
   day course is sufficient
   - Sent mini-bal for gram stain and culture as well as galactomannan.
   Galactomannan is 0.7, above normal of 0.5. Unsure of cross-reactivity
   or real value. Will consult ID today for decision whether to treat or
   not.
   - continue linezolid and azithromycin for atypical mycobacterial
   infection
   - continue Albuterol inhalers
   - CT to rule out necrotizing PNA per ID is still under discussion as
   patient is improving
will d/w ID further because it is currently
   unclear how this will change management  since she is being treated for
   pseudomonas and MRSA with linezolid and meropenem/tobra and she
   continues to clinically improve
   .
   .
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC trending down slightly
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Hold hydralazine 25mg [**Hospital1 7**] for now, given change in sedation to
   propofol and will re-institute on a prn basis for sbp > 160
   - keep patient even today
   - monitor BPs and consider restarting hydralazine if hypertensive once
   stable from a respiratory/sedation perspective
   .
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement:
   - continue TF through G-tube
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,
   hyperpyrexia, worsening neuro exams,  high CK levels

   Disposition:  ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for PEG placement but was transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. She was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated for pseudomonas pneumonia, as well as MRSA with linezolid and meropenem/tobramycin. She is also being treated for atypical mycobacterial infection with azithromycin and linezolid.

The potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, weaning from sedation, extubation, third-spacing, and hypertensive urgency. The patient's barriers to extubation include multifocal pneumonia with secretions, baseline poor lung function, atypical mycobacterial infection, and altered mental status.

The patient's current plan includes weaning sedation by stopping midazolam and continuing fentanyl prn and propofol. The goal is to move towards extubation tomorrow if she tolerates well. The patient is also on pressure support currently tolerating well, regular suctioning, and meropenem and inhaled tobramycin. A mini-bal for gram stain and culture has been sent, along with galactomannan. The galactomannan result is 0.7, above the normal range of"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection originally admitted on [**8-7**] for PEG placement  was
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency, and was found to have multifocal pseudomonas
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on
   top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.   Also occurred
   initially in the setting of hypertensive urgency.  The barriers to
   extubation include multifocal pneumonia with secretions,  baseline poor
   lung function [**12-24**] atypical mycobacterial infection and altered mental
   status.  Is third-spacing and has net volume increase.
   - Wean sedation by stopping midazolam and continuing fentanyl prn and
   propofol.  If tolerates well, will move towards extubation tomorrow
   - goal of net even volume today to help with secretions
   - On pressure support currently tolerating well
   - continue regular suction
   - Cont meropenem and inhaled tobramycin.  Will discuss with ID if 14
   day course is sufficient
   - Sent mini-bal for gram stain and culture as well as galactomannan.
   F/U serum galactomannin and beta-d-glucan.
   - continue linezolid and azithromycin for atypical mycobacterial
   infection
   - continue Albuterol inhalers
   - CT to rule out necrotizing PNA per ID is still under discussion as
   patient is improving
will d/w ID further because it is currently
   unclear how this will change management  since she is being treated for
   pseudomonas and MRSA with linezolid and meropenem/tobra and she
   continues to clinically improve
   .
   .
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC trending down slightly
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   .
   # Hypertension:  Patient with episode of hypotension yesterday,
   responded to 1L of NS and then became hypertensive with decreased
   sedation.
   - discontinue hydralazine 25mg [**Hospital1 7**] for now, given change in sedation to
   propofol
   - keep patient even today
   - monitor BPs and consider restarting hydralazine if hypertensive once
   stable from a respiratory/sedation perspective
   .
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement:
   - continue TF through G-tube
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,
   hyperpyrexia, worsening neuro exams,  high CK levels

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for a PEG placement but was transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. Upon evaluation, she was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support (PS) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows hypoxemia with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 123. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/42 to 191/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's physical examination reveals sedation, pink conjunctivae, reactive pupils, diffuse pops and squeaks in the lungs, a 2/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border, no hepatomegaly, and 4+ pitting edema throughout the body. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, normal liver function tests, and no significant electrolyte imbalances.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection originally admitted on [**8-7**] for PEG placement  was
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency, and was found to have multifocal pseudomonas
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on
   top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.   Also occurred
   initially in the setting of hypertensive urgency.  The barriers to
   extubation include multifocal pneumonia with secretions,  baseline poor
   lung function [**12-24**] atypical mycobacterial infection and altered mental
   status.  Is third-spacing and has net volume increase.
   - spontaneous breathing trial off propofol this AM.  If tolerates well,
   will move towards extubation today
   - goal of net even volume today to help with secretions
   - On pressure support currently tolerating well
   - Was on propofol + fentanyl wean for sedation given some agitation
   when fentanyl stopped.  Fentanyl stopped this AM and tolerated well
   without agitation.  Will continue with propofol and fentanyl as needed
   for sedation
   - continue regular suction
   - Cont meropenem and inhaled tobramycin.  Will discuss with ID if 14
   day course is sufficient
   - Sent mini-bal for gram stain and culture as well as galactomannan.
   F/U serum galactomannin and beta-d-glucan.
   - continue linezolid and azithromycin for atypical mycobacterial
   infection
   - continue Albuterol inhalers
   - CT to rule out necrotizing PNA per ID is still under discussion as
   patient is improving
will d/w ID further because it is currently
   unclear how this will change management  since she is being treated for
   pseudomonas and MRSA with linezolid and meropenem/tobra and she
   continues to clinically improve
   .
   .
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC trending down slightly
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   .
   # Hypertension:  Patient with episode of hypotension yesterday,
   responded to 1L of NS and then became hypertensive with decreased
   sedation.
   - discontinue hydralazine 25mg [**Hospital1 7**] for now, given change in sedation to
   propofol
   - keep patient even today
   - monitor BPs and consider restarting hydralazine if hypertensive once
   stable from a respiratory/sedation perspective
   .
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement:
   - continue TF through G-tube
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,
   hyperpyrexia, worsening neuro exams,  high CK levels

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was originally admitted for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement but was transferred to the ICU for acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. Upon evaluation, she was found to have multifocal Pseudomonas pneumonia.

The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure caused by multifocal pneumonia on top of a pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection. Other factors that contribute to the barriers to extubation include poor lung function, baseline poor lung function, and altered mental status. The patient has been third-spacing fluids, resulting in a net volume increase.

During the morning, a spontaneous breathing trial was attempted while off propofol. If the patient tolerates well, she will be moved towards extubation today. The goal is to achieve a net even volume today to help with secretions. The patient is currently on pressure support and tolerating it well. She was previously on propofol and fentanyl wean for sedation due to some agitation when fentanyl was stopped. However, fentanyl was restarted this morning and the patient tolerated it well without agitation. Propofol and fentanyl will continue to be used as needed for sedation. Regular suctioning will be continued.

The patient's antibiotics have been adjusted, with the discontinuation of piperacillin-tazobactam and the"

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient in the ICU is experiencing respiratory failure, pneumonia, and anemia. They have a high respiratory rate and sedation is being weaned off. The patient has an elevated galactomannan level, indicating a possible fungal infection. Secretions are slowly improving, and the patient's hemoglobin concentration is stable. There is no evidence of bleeding, and the patient is not at the transfusion threshold.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The ICU team is implementing measures such as elevating the head of bed, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls to prevent VAP.

2. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, including fungal infections. The elevated galactomannan level suggests a possible Aspergillus infection. Anti-fungal treatment may be necessary.

3. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and consideration for transfusion may be needed.

4. Fluid balance: The patient has a negative fluid balance, as indicated by the negative 24-hour urine output. This can be concerning and requires monitoring.

5. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to sedation or delirium. Monitoring for signs of delirium"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection originally admitted on [**8-7**] for PEG placement  was
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency, and was found to have multifocal pseudomonas
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation due to multifocal pneumonia on
   top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.   Also occurred
   initially in the setting of hypertensive urgency.  The barriers to
   extubation include multifocal pneumonia with secretions,  baseline poor
   lung function [**12-24**] atypical mycobacterial infection and altered mental
   status.  Is third-spacing and has net volume increase.
   - If tolerates well, extubation trial today at 1030. Husband will be
   here
   - goal of net even volume today to help with secretions
   - On pressure support currently tolerating well
   - continue regular suction
   - Cont meropenem and inhaled tobramycin for full three week course: Day
   1: [**8-17**]
   - Sent mini-bal for gram stain and culture.  Galactomannan is 0.7,
   above normal of 0.5. Unsure of cross-reactivity or real value. Will
   consult ID today for decision whether to treat or not. Page [**Numeric Identifier 10446**]
   - continue Albuterol inhalers
   - CT to rule out necrotizing PNA per ID is still under discussion as
   patient is improving
will d/w ID further because it is currently
   unclear how this will change management  since she is being treated for
   pseudomonas and MRSA with linezolid and meropenem/tobra and she
   continues to clinically improve
   .
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC trending down slightly
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Hold hydralazine 25mg [**Hospital1 7**] for now, given change in sedation to
   propofol and will re-institute on a prn basis for sbp > 160
   - keep patient even today
   - monitor BPs and consider restarting hydralazine if hypertensive once
   stable from a respiratory/sedation perspective
   .
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement:
   - continue TF through G-tube
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,
   hyperpyrexia, worsening neuro exams,  high CK levels

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for a PEG placement but was transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. She has been diagnosed with multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia and is currently intubated. The barriers to extubation include multifocal pneumonia with secretions, baseline poor lung function, atypical mycobacterial infection, and altered mental status. She is receiving meropenem and inhaled tobramycin for a full three-week course of treatment. The patient's leukocytosis is trending down slightly, and she has stable hemoglobin levels. Her hypertension is being managed with prn hydralazine. She has an anorexia s/p G-tube placement and is receiving tube feeds through the G-tube. There is a risk of serotonin syndrome due to her medication regimen. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/42-155/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has a respiratory culture positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and yeast, but her respiratory support is currently well-tolerated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure is a major concern"

   continues to clinically improve
   - Re-assess secretions throughout weekend, patient will likely need
   trach Monday. Will touch base with husband.

   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen

   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal

   # Hypertension:
   - Hold hydralazine 25mg [**Hospital1 7**] for now, given change in sedation to
   propofol and will re-institute on a prn basis for sbp > 160
   - keep patient even today
   - monitor BPs and consider restarting hydralazine if hypertensive once
   stable from a respiratory/sedation perspective
   .
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement:
   - continue TF through G-tube
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,
   hyperpyrexia, worsening neuro exams,  high CK levels

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted on [**8-7**] for PEG placement and later transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. She was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia.

The patient is currently intubated (Day 10) due to respiratory failure caused by multifocal pneumonia on top of a pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection. Barriers to extubation include multifocal pneumonia with secretions, baseline poor lung function, atypical mycobacterial infection, and the inability to wean off sedation without patient agitation. The patient also has third-spacing and a net volume increase.

Current goals include increasing the frequency of fentanyl and attempting to decrease propofol if the patient can tolerate it. The patient's triglyceride levels will be checked today since she has been on propofol for at least 72 hours. The goal is to achieve a net even volume today to help with secretions. The patient is currently on pressure support and tolerating it well, so an attempt will be made to decrease PEEP from 12 to 8. Regular suctioning will continue.

Medications include continuing meropenem and inhaled tobramycin for a full three-week course. A mini-bal for gram stain and culture was sent, and the Galactomannan is 0.7, above the normal value of 0.5. It is unclear about the cross-reactivity or real value. An ID consult will be made today for the decision to treat or not. The ID also discussed the possibility of a CT scan to rule out necrotizing PNA, but it is still under discussion as the patient is improving.

The patient's leukocytosis is trending down slightly, and she has anemia with a stable hematocrit level from yesterday. There is no evidence of active bleeding, and iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, and reticulocyte count are all normal.

Regarding hypertension, hydralazine was held on [**Hospital1 7**] due to a change in sedation to propofol, and it will be re-instituted on a prn basis for systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 160. The patient will be monitored closely, and if she becomes hypertensive once stable from a respiratory/sedation perspective, hydralazine may be restarted.

The patient has anorexia since the G-tube placement, so continuous TF through the G-tube will be continued.

There is a potential risk of serotonin syndrome since the patient is on linezolid and fentanyl, which could potentially lead to serotonin syndrome. Monitoring for signs of serotonin syndrome, including hypotension, hyperpyrexia, worsening neuro exams, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and anemia. The patient remains sedated and intubated, unable to provide their own medical history. They are currently on propofol for sedation, fentanyl for pain management, and PSV with FiO2=0.4 with good O2 sats. The patient experienced an episode of hypotension this morning, which responded to fluid bolus. They have large amounts of tracheal secretions and require suctioning every 4 hours. Oxygenation remains good, and the patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics. There is a discussion about the possibility of tracheostomy if the patient does not improve by Monday. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is low, indicating anemia. Vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension, with stable respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. Fluid balance indicates intake and output, with a slight negative balance. The patient's WBC count is elevated, suggesting an infection or inflammation. Other lab results show low platelet count, normal electrolytes, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range. The assessment includes respiratory failure, altered mental status, hypotension, bacterial pneumonia, oliguria/anuria, hypoxemia, and malignant hypertension. The plan is to continue antibiotics, monitor for decision on tracheostomy, reduce PSV, and manage hypotension."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Barriers to extubation: increased secretions and difficulty weaning
   sedation.
   - Attempted to wean propofol and increase fentanyl, but patient became
   agitated and tried pulling out her tube. Increased propofol. OK to keep
   sedation on over weekend as patient will likely need a trach on Monday.
   - Daughter, [**Name (NI) 1387**], is going to think about a trach for her mother. She
   isn't sure if that is in her mother's wishes. She will let us know.

   - TG 135
   - Increased secretions: did CXR at 1400. Official read possible
   increased opacity in left perihilum.
   - Per ID, resend galactomannan as prior test may likely be a false
   positive. High liklihood of cross reactivity with zosyn she received

   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection originally admitted on [**8-7**] for PEG placement  was
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency, and was found to have multifocal pseudomonas
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation ( Day 1 of Intubation: [**8-12**];
   today is day 10) due to multifocal pneumonia on top of pre-existing
   atypical mycobacterial infection.   The barriers to extubation include
   multifocal pneumonia with secretions,  baseline poor lung function [**12-24**]
   atypical mycobacterial infection and unable to wean off of sedation
   without patient getting agitated.  Third-spacing and has net volume
   increase.
   - CXR pending
   - Increase frequency of fentanyl and attempt to decrease propofol if
   patient can tolerate.
   - Check TG today since patient has been on propofol for at least 72
   hours
   - goal of net even volume today to help with secretions
   - On pressure support currently tolerating well; attempt to decrease
   PEEP today from 12 to 8.
   - continue regular suction
   - Cont meropenem and inhaled tobramycin for full three week course: Day
   1: [**8-17**]
   - Sent mini-bal for gram stain and culture.  Galactomannan is 0.7,
   above normal of 0.5. Unsure of cross-reactivity or real value. -  -
   Will consult ID today for decision whether to treat or not. Page [**Numeric Identifier 10446**]
   - continue Albuterol inhalers
   - CT to rule out necrotizing PNA per ID is still under discussion as
   patient is improving
will d/w ID further because it is currently
   unclear how this will change management  since she is being treated for
   pseudomonas and MRSA with linezolid and meropenem/tobra and she
   continues to clinically improve
   - Re-assess secretions throughout weekend, patient will likely need
   trach Monday. Will touch base with husband.
   - Cultures pending
   .
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC trending down slightly
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - Hold hydralazine 25mg [**Hospital1 7**] for now, given change in sedation to
   propofol and will re-institute on a prn basis for sbp > 160
   - keep patient even today
   - monitor BPs and consider restarting hydralazine if hypertensive once
   stable from a respiratory/sedation perspective
   .
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement:
   - continue TF through G-tube
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for a PEG placement but was transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath in the setting of hypertensive urgency. She was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated on day 10 and has been struggling with weaning off sedation. The barriers to extubation include multifocal pneumonia with secretions, baseline poor lung function, and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She is receiving meropenem and inhaled tobramycin for a full three-week course, and her cultures are pending. The plan is to attempt to decrease propofol and fentanyl if the patient can tolerate, check TG today since she has been on propofol for at least 72 hours, and continue regular suction. The patient will likely need a tracheostomy on Monday, and the family is considering this option. She has leukocytosis, anemia, and hypertension. Her nutrition is being provided through a G-tube, and she is at risk for serotonin syndrome due to her medications. The patient's code status remains full code, and she will continue to receive ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia on top of her pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Barriers to extubation: increased secretions and difficulty weaning
   sedation.
   - Attempted to wean propofol and increase fentanyl, but patient became
   agitated and tried pulling out her tube. Increased propofol. OK to keep
   sedation on over weekend as patient will likely need a trach on Monday.
   - Daughter, [**Name (NI) 1387**], is going to think about a trach for her mother. She
   isn't sure if that is in her mother's wishes. She will let us know.
   ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10472**])
   - TG 135
   - Increased secretions: did CXR at 1400. Official read possible
   increased opacity in left perihilum.
   - Per ID, resend galactomannan as prior test may likely be a false
   positive. High liklihood of cross reactivity with zosyn she received
   earlier. Do not treat yet.
   - Goal I/O even
   - ASA d/c'd for potential trach on Monday

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement but was transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. She was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia on top of her pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection. The patient has been intubated since day 1 (August 12th) and today is day 11. She has been experiencing increased secretions, difficulty weaning sedation, and poor lung function. The barriers to extubation include multifocal pneumonia with secretions, baseline poor lung function, atypical mycobacterial infection, and difficulty weaning sedation without the patient getting agitated. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated but trending down slightly. She has anemia but no evidence of active bleeding. Her blood pressure is labile and she is currently being monitored for any signs of hypotension. The patient is at risk for serotonin syndrome due to the medications she is taking. She is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The daughter is unsure about the patient's wishes regarding a tracheostomy, and the husband does not want to make the decision.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with significant pneumonia and a history of chronic M. Abscessus infection. She has been on assisted ventilation support but is expected to transition to weaning ventilatory support today. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial insult leading to respiratory failure was significant multi-focal pneumonia. It is crucial to monitor her respiratory status closely during the weaning process.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on assisted ventilation support for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Proper infection control measures and regular monitoring of her lung condition are necessary to prevent this complication.

3. Nosocomial Infections: Given the prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures, there is a risk of acquiring nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is essential to detect any potential infections early.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Prolonged immobility and ICU stay increase the risk of developing DVT, which can potentially lead to a life-threatening PE. Prophylactic measures, such as low molecular weight heparin, should be continued.

5. Delirium or Cognitive Impairment: Older patients, especially those with severe illness and prolonged ICU stay, are at increased risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection originally admitted on [**8-7**] for PEG placement  was
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency, and was found to have multifocal pseudomonas
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation ( Day 1 of Intubation: [**8-12**];
   today is day 13) due to multifocal pneumonia on top of pre-existing
   atypical mycobacterial infection.   The largest barriers to extubation
   is her thick secretions; she did have  baseline poor lung function [**12-24**]
   atypical mycobacterial infection.  Pt weaned off sedation this AM doing
   well, but started becoming agitated in early afternoon, so propofol
   restarted. Third-spacing and has net volume increase.  RSBI 74 this
   AM.  WBCs trending down.
   - Possible trach this week, pending Daughter
s decision on Tuesday
   - Today will wean sedation again, try  SBT, repeat ABG to gather more
   data about a possible trial of extubation prior to trach
   - goal of net even volume today to help with secretions
   - continue frequent suction
   - Cont meropenem and inhaled tobramycin (Day#8 today) for full three
   week course: Day 1: [**8-17**]
   - f/u mini-bal for gram stain and culture.
   - f/u repeat Galactomannan (first galactomannan 0.7, likely
   cross-reaction from zosyn)
   - continue Albuterol inhalers
   - continue to Re-assess secretions
   - Cultures pending
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  increased Na to 147 this AM from 145 yesterday.
   - free water boluses into PEG tube
   .
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   .
   # Hypertension:  BP
s currently labile, increased with agitation
   - turned sedation back on because overly agitated early this afternoon
   with elevated BPs
   - will continue to monitor

   # Anorexia, s/p G-tube placement:
   - continue TF through G-tube
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for PEG placement but was transferred to the ICU for acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. She was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia.

The patient has been intubated since day 1 of admission (August 12) and is currently on day 13. The largest barriers to extubation are her thick secretions and pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection. The patient had baseline poor lung function.

The patient's respiratory status has been improving gradually. She was weaned off sedation in the afternoon but became agitated, so propofol was restarted. Her RSBI (Respiratory Systemic Compliance Index) is 74, indicating some improvement but still not ready for extubation. WBCs (White Blood Cells) are trending down, which is a positive sign.

The plan is to try sedation weaning again and perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) to assess her readiness for extubation. An ABG (Arterial Blood Gas) will be repeated to gather more data. The goal is to achieve net even volume today to help with secretions. Frequent suctioning will continue, and meropenem and inhaled tobramycin will be continued for a full three-week course.

   24 Hour Events:
   -continues to have thick secretions which will likely make extubation
   difficult
   -weaned sedation in the afternoon, patient became much more
   awake/alert, was following commands, maintained on PS during day and
   evening
   - pt had increased work of breathing on [**8-25**] Pressure Support, so PS
   increased to [**10-25**]
   - RSBI 74 with sedation this AM
   -daughter unsure about whether patient would want trach, but will come
   in for discussion tuesday

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection originally admitted on [**8-7**] for PEG placement  was
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency, and was found to have multifocal pseudomonas
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation ( Day 1 of Intubation: [**8-12**];
   today is day 11) due to multifocal pneumonia on top of pre-existing
   atypical mycobacterial infection.   The barriers to extubation include
   multifocal pneumonia with secretions,  baseline poor lung function [**12-24**]
   atypical mycobacterial infection, difficulty weaning sedation without
   patient getting agitated but inability to do a good SBT trial with
   continued sedation.  Third-spacing and has net volume increase.
   - Today will wean sedation, do a RSBI, SBT, repeat ABG to gather more
   data about a possible trial of extubation prior to trach
   - goal of net even volume today to help with secretions
   - continue regular suction
   - Cont meropenem and inhaled tobramycin for full three week course: Day
   1: [**8-17**]
   - Sent mini-bal for gram stain and culture.  Galactomannan is 0.7,
   above normal of 0.5, per ID, f/u w rechecked level, no treatment at
   this time
   - continue Albuterol inhalers
   - Re-assess secretions throughout weekend, patient will likely need
   trach Monday, daughter currently unsure if her mom would want a trach,
   and husband does not want to make the decision
   - Cultures pending
   .
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  WBC trending down slightly
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - BP
s currently labile, will continue to monitor, periods of
   hypotension have been fluid responsive
   .
   # Anorexia s/p G-tube placement:
   - continue TF through G-tube
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,
   hyperpyrexia, worsening neuro exams,  high CK levels

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for PEG placement but developed acute shortness of breath and was transferred to the ICU. She has multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia on top of her pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection. The patient is currently intubated for respiratory failure and is on day 11 of intubation. The barriers to extubation include multifocal pneumonia with thick secretions, baseline poor lung function, atypical mycobacterial infection, and difficulty weaning sedation without agitation. The patient has leukocytosis, anemia, and hypertension. She also has a mycobacterial abscessus infection and is on linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen. The patient's daughter is unsure about whether the patient would want a tracheostomy, and the husband does not want to make the decision. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and is being weaned off sedation. The goal is to gather more data about a possible trial of extubation prior to tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by multifocal pneumonia. If extubation fails, the patient may require prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
2. Pseudomonas Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pseud"

   83 yo female with history of M. Abscessus and now admitted with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure with multilobar pneumonia.  She has had
   trend towards improved respiratory status with now patient able to
   tolerate pressure support ventilation.
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])-
   -Linezolid/Tobra inhalation/Meropenem to continue
   -Do have large volume secretions and will need to have decrease prior
   to attempt at extubation
   -If unable to complete extubation will have to consider tracheostomy
   and this will have to be considered carefully with patient
   longstanding physicians
   -Will move to RSBi and SBT in am to consider chances of successful
   extubation
   2)Hypernatremia-
   -Will continue to replace free water deficit

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of M. Abscessus and admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multilobar pneumonia. She has shown a trend towards improved respiratory status, now able to tolerate pressure support ventilation. The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not managed properly. This is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high levels of sodium in her blood, which can lead to dehydration, altered mental status, and other complications if not treated promptly.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing changes in her mental state, possibly due to the infection or other factors. This requires close monitoring for potential deterioration.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating poor perfusion and potential organ damage. It is essential to maintain adequate blood pressure to ensure organ function.

5. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia, which can worsen if not adequately treated. Antibiotics are being administered to control the infection.

6. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's urine output is reduced or absent, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. This requires prompt evaluation and management to prevent further complications.

7. Hypoxemia: The patient has low levels of oxygen in her blood, indicating inadequate oxygenation."

   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation ( Day 1 of Intubation: [**8-12**];
   today is day 13) due to multifocal pneumonia on top of pre-existing
   atypical mycobacterial infection.   The largest barriers to extubation
   is her thick secretions; she did have  baseline poor lung function [**12-24**]
   atypical mycobacterial infection.  Pt weaned off most of her sedation
   this AM doing well. Third-spacing and has net volume increase.  RSBI 78
   this AM.  WBCs trending down.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for PEG placement but was later transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. The patient has been intubated for 13 days due to multifocal pneumonia on top of her pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection.

The main concerns in the progress note are respiratory failure, hypernatremia, mycobacterial abscessus infection, anemia, and hypertension. The patient's thick secretions are the largest barriers to extubation. She has been weaned off most of her sedation and her respiratory system is improving.

The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is trending down, indicating a possible improvement in the infection. The respiratory system infection culture shows sensitivity to several antibiotics, including meropenem, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's sodium levels have been decreased from 147 to 144, and she is receiving increased free water boluses into her PEG tube to address hypernatremia.

The patient is also being treated for a mycobacterial abscessus infection with linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen. She has mild anemia, and it is planned to transfuse one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since she is close to the transfusion"

   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection originally admitted on [**8-7**] for PEG placement  was
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency, and was found to have multifocal pseudomonas
   pneumonia.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation ( Day 1 of Intubation: [**8-12**];
   today is day 13) due to multifocal pneumonia on top of pre-existing
   atypical mycobacterial infection.   The largest barriers to extubation
   is her thick secretions; she did have  baseline poor lung function [**12-24**]
   atypical mycobacterial infection.  Pt weaned off sedation this AM doing
   well, but started becoming agitated in early afternoon, so propofol
   restarted. Third-spacing and has net volume increase.  RSBI 78 this
   AM.  WBCs trending down.
   - Possible trach this week, pending Daughter
s decision on Tuesday
   - Today will wean sedation again, try  SBT, repeat ABG to gather more
   data about a possible trial of extubation prior to trach
   - goal of net even volume today to help with secretions
   - continue frequent suction
   - Cont meropenem and inhaled tobramycin (Day#8 today) for full three
   week course: Day 1: [**8-17**]
   - f/u mini-bal for gram stain and culture.
   - f/u repeat Galactomannan (first galactomannan 0.7, likely
   cross-reaction from zosyn)
   - continue Albuterol inhalers
   - continue to Re-assess secretions
   - Cultures pending
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  increased Na to 147 this AM from 145 yesterday.
   - free water boluses into PEG tube
   .
   # Mycobacterial abscessus infection:
   - Continue linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen
   .
   # Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding.  Hct stable from yesterday.
   - iron, B12, folate, hemolysis, retic count all normal
   .
   # Hypertension:  BP
s currently labile, increased with agitation
   - turned sedation back on because overly agitated early this afternoon
   with elevated BPs
   - will continue to monitor

   # Anorexia, s/p G-tube placement:
   - continue TF through G-tube
   # Risk of serotonin syndrome: pt on linezolid and fentanyl which could
   potentially lead to serotonin syndrome.
   - monitor for signs of serotonin syndrome including hypotension,

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and later transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. She was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia on top of her pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection. The patient has been intubated for 13 days and is experiencing respiratory failure. She has thick secretions, which are making extubation difficult. Her sedation was weaned off in the afternoon, but she became agitated and propofol was restarted. The patient's respiratory support mode is CPAP/PSV+ApnVol with a PS of 12 cmH2O, RR of 18, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, RSBI of 78, and PIP of 17 cmH2O. Her ABG results are as follows: ///35/ with a Ve of 5.7 L/min. The patient's physical examination shows that she is sedated, appears comfortable, and can follow commands. She has conjunctiva pink, pupils reactive symmetrically bilaterally, and a soft systolic murmur noted at RUSB. Her abdomen is soft, nontender, non-distended, and no hepatomegaly is noted. She"

   SBT. Will repeat today. Patient's daugher arriving tomorrow to
   participate in discussion re: trach. Sputum per suctioning is moderate.
   Continues on antibiotics. Repeat sputum culture growing pseudomonas
   sensitive to present antibiotics.
   CXR today suggests mild volume overload. Would try to achieve negative
   fluid balance today.
   Hct down slightly and now at transfusion threshold. Would transfuse
   today in anticipation of possible extubation tomorrow.

","The patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. Based on the provided progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has altered mental status and is sedated, making it difficult to assess for any pressure ulcers or skin breakdown.

2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV+ApnVol mode, indicating respiratory distress. The presence of thick secretions from the endotracheal tube suggests ongoing respiratory compromise.

3. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. The neurological examination shows attentive behavior, purposeful movements, and responds to verbal stimuli, but orientation is not assessed.

4. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure is consistently below normal limits, indicating low blood pressure.

5. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient has a history of pneumonia, and the sputum culture is growing pseudomonas sensitive to present antibiotics.

6. Oliguria/anuria: The patient has decreased urine output, indicating possible kidney dysfunction.

7. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation level is 98% on supplemental oxygen, which is below the normal range, suggesting inadequate oxygenation.

8. Hypertension, malignant (hypertensive crisis/hypertensive emergency): The patient's blood pressure readings are significantly elevated, indicating"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo female with pmh of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial
   infection originally admitted on [**8-7**] for PEG placement  was
   transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency, and was found to have multifocal pseudomonas
   pneumonia.

   # Respiratory failure:  s/p intubation ( Day 1 of Intubation: [**8-12**]) due
   to multifocal pneumonia on top of pre-existing atypical mycobacterial
   infection.   Secretions improved.  Very good urine output to lasix last
   night. repeat sputum cx shows pan sensitive pseudomonas
   - Give another 40 IV lasix
   - try extubation after speaking w family this afternoon and ask family
   what they
d like to do if extubation doesn
t work
   - Cont meropenem and inhaled tobramycin (Day#8 today) for full three
   week course: Day 1: [**8-17**]
   - f/u repeat Galactomannan (first galactomannan 0.7, likely
   cross-reaction from zosyn)
   - continue Albuterol inhalers
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  decreased Na to 140 this AM from 144 yesterday.
   - hold PEG tube feedings b/c of likely extubation today and risk of
   aspiration

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted on [**8-7**] for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for acute shortness of breath in the setting of hypertensive urgency. Upon evaluation, she was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia. The patient underwent intubation on Day 1 due to respiratory failure caused by multifocal pneumonia on top of her pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection. Secretions have improved, and the patient had a good urine output after receiving lasix last night. A repeat sputum culture shows that the organism is sensitive to pan. 

The plan includes giving another 40 IV lasix, attempting extubation after discussing with the family, and continuing meropenem and inhaled tobramycin for a full three-week course starting from Day 1 on [**8-17**]. It is also recommended to follow up with a repeat Galactomannan (first galactomannan 0.7, likely cross-reaction from zosyn) and continue Albuterol inhalers.

The patient has hypernatremia, with a sodium level decreased to 140 this morning from 144 yesterday. PEG tube feedings are to be held due to the likely extubation today and the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement but was transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. Upon arrival, she was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia.

The patient has been intubated since August 12th and is currently on day 13 of mechanical ventilation. The main barriers to extubation are thick secretions and poor lung function. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, indicating improvement.

The plan is to attempt a full rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) test this afternoon and continue frequent suctioning. The goal is to achieve a net negative fluid balance prior to possible extubation tomorrow. The patient will continue to receive meropenem and inhaled tobramycin for a full three-week course. Repeat sputum cultures show pan-sensitive pseudomonas, and a follow-up Galactomannan will be done.

The patient also has hypernatremia, which has been corrected by giving free water boluses through the PEG tube. The plan is to continue this treatment. The patient is being treated for mycobacterial abscessus infection with linezolid and azithromycin, as per the outpatient regimen.

There is no evidence of active bleeding, so the patient"

   Patient looks much better this AM after diuresis yesterday and D/C of
   sedation. Awaiting arrival of daughter to make clear what the plan will
   be if the patient fails extubation (i.e., will she be reintubated);
   however, she does appear ready to extubate today. Would give additional
   lasix now in anticipation of extubation. Be prepared for mask
   ventilation post extubation if need as bridge to fully sustained
   spontaneous breathing. Tube feedings being held.
   Continue antibiotics. Secretions diminished.
   Hct improved post transfusion. Not at transfusion threshold now.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on assist control ventilation and later switched to pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) in the high 80s. This indicates ongoing respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation support.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which may be due to bacterial infection. Antibiotics have been administered, but there is a risk of worsening infection or development of antibiotic resistance.

3. Bronchiectasis: The patient's history of bronchiectasis increases the risk of recurrent respiratory infections and can contribute to respiratory failure.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity is impaired, which may be due to prolonged immobility, poor nutrition, or pressure ulcers. This increases the risk of skin infections and potential complications.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, possibly due to sedation, hypoxia, or the underlying medical condition. Delirium or cognitive impairment should be closely monitored.

6. Hypotension and Hypertension: The patient has experienced hypotension and malignant hypertension (hypertensive crisis). These conditions require careful monitoring and management to prevent further complications.

7. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient is experiencing decreased urine output (oliguria)"

The patient has recently been extubated after 14 days of intubation for multifocal pneumonia on top of her pre-existing atypical mycobacterial infection. Her secretions have improved, and she was given another dose of 40mg IV lasix prior to extubation.

The plan includes continuing meropenem and inhaled tobramycin for a full three-week course, starting from [**8-17**]. The patient should be followed up with a repeat Galactomannan (first galactomannan 0.7, likely cross-reaction from zosyn). She should also continue using Albuterol inhalers.

The patient has hypernatremia with a stable sodium level of 140. It is planned to give one more day of free water boluses through the PEG tube before she goes home.

The patient has a mycobacterial abscessus infection and should continue with linezolid and azithromycin per outpatient regimen.

The patient has anemia but no evidence of active bleeding. The cause of anemia is"

","The patient is an 83-year-old female with a medical history of bronchiectasis and an atypical mycobacterial infection. She was admitted for PEG placement but was transferred to the ICU due to acute shortness of breath and hypertensive urgency. Upon evaluation, she was found to have multifocal pseudomonas pneumonia.

The patient has been intubated for 14 days and is now successfully extubated. She is experiencing some secretions but is otherwise stable. Her respiratory function is being supported with albuterol inhalers.

The patient's sodium levels are stable at 140, indicating no immediate concerns for hypernatremia. However, her hypertension remains labile and requires ongoing management. She has been switched to lisinopril from captopril and will continue on home hydralazine.

There are no signs of active bleeding, so the anemia is not considered significant. The patient's mycobacterial abscess infection will be managed with continued linezolid and azithromycin therapy as per the outpatient regimen.

The patient's nutrition plan includes continuing total feeding through the G-tube and allowing her to eat orally as she wishes.

The patient has multiple lines in place, including a PICC line inserted on [**2132-8-15**] at 01:23 PM. Prophylactic treatments include subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and protonix for stress ulcer prophylaxis"
