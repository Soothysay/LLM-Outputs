   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) who underwent bilateral below-knee amputation (BKA). He presented with chest pain and showed a less than 1mm ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in septal leads. Further evaluation revealed an occluded saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which was stented with bare-metal stents (BMS) x 5.

The patient experienced persistent chest pain during and after the procedure, and upon reaching the floor. The plan included the following:
- Administration of aspirin (ASA) 325mg x 30 days, then 81mg daily, and Plavix 75mg daily x 3 months.
- Resumption of coumadin pending INR.
- Increase beta-blocker dosage to 50mg, add captopril 6.25mg TID, titrate as needed.
- Continue statin therapy.

Other notable findings from the progress note include:
- The patient had a fever of 101.4 yesterday evening with rigors, but broke with acetaminophen (APAP). No infiltrate was observed on chest X-ray (CXR). Post cath check was okay, with warm lower extremities (LES) and dopplerable pulses.

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of three-vessel coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), presenting with chest pain and a STEMI in septal leads. The patient had an occluded saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery (SVG-LAD), which was treated with the placement of five bare-metal stents (BMS). The patient continues to experience persistent chest pain during and after the procedure.

Assessment and plan:
1. STEMI: Continue dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for 12 hours, followed by aspirin 325mg for 30 days and then 81mg daily, as well as Plavix 75mg daily for three months. Resume coumadin tonight if the patient's INR is subtherapeutic, provided hemodynamic stability. Titrate beta-blockers to a heart rate of 55-65, hold ACE inhibitors for now. Continue statin therapy, trend CK/CK-MB, perform post-procedure platelet check, and obtain an EKG in the morning.
2. PUMP: The patient had a pre-CABG transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showing a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25-35% with moderately dilated right ventricular cavity. There was also mild aortic insufficiency (AI), mild mitral regurgitation ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous CABG surgery. He presents with chest pain and a STEMI in the septal leads, which was found to be caused by an occluded saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient underwent stenting with bare metal stents (BMS) in the LAD. He has a history of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and bilateral below-knee amputations. He is currently on multiple medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, captopril, simvastatin, and others.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent myocardial infarction or unstable angina due to ongoing or new coronary artery disease.
2. Heart failure exacerbation due to systolic dysfunction and possible aneurysm formation in the apex.
3. Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias due to ischemic changes in the heart.
4. Thrombosis of the stented coronary artery.
5. Restenosis or in-stent narrowing.
6. Complications related to diabetes such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
7. Renal dysfunction due to contrast-induced nephropathy or pre-existing chronic kidney disease.
8. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and bilateral below-knee amputation (BKA). He presented with chest pain and was found to have occluded saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery (LAD), which was stented with bare metal stent (BMS). 

The patient has several medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is currently on multiple medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, atorvastatin, furosemide, and others. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 115/61 mmHg to 129/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. His temperature is slightly elevated at 37.8 degrees Celsius.

The patient's echocardiogram shows moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 35%. There is also mild dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta, but no significant valvular abnormalities.
