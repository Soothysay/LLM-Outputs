","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous surgery for rectal cancer. He was admitted to the MICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of fever. The patient's current chief complaints include fever, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Overnight, the patient developed delirium and was given ativan for hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea with pain, which is well controlled. His physical examination reveals trace right and left lower extremity edema, no cyanosis or clubbing, warm skin, and no bowel sounds present with distention and tenderness. Neurologic examination is not assessable.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.5 K/uL, elevated creatine kinase (CK) / CKMB / Troponin-T levels, as well as elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has been diagnosed with fever, leukocytosis, cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the colon, atrial fibrillation, and pain control. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.4 C (101.1 F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/47 mmHg to 171/84 mmHg,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and rectal cancer who underwent pelvic resection. He was admitted to the ICU for rapid atrial fibrillation in the setting of post-operative fever. The patient's current condition includes recurrent fever, agitation, delirium, and aphasia. His vital signs show sinus tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving amiodarone infusion for atrial fibrillation, and his pain is being managed with morphine PCA. He is also on prophylactic heparin, Plavix, ASA, and other ICU medications. The patient's neurologic exam is non-focal, and a head CT as well as a neurology consult have been ordered due to his delirium and aphasia. The patient's labs indicate leukocytosis, elevated glucose levels, and normal kidney function. The assessment and plan include delirium/confusion, fever, leukocytosis, cancer, atrial fibrillation, and pain control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's recurrent fever and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. This could lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Delirium: The patient's delirium may be due to several factors, including medication-induced,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post left anterior descending (LAD) stent, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and rectal cancer surgery. He was admitted to the MICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of fever. On admission, he had an elevated temperature of 102.5°F, altered mental status, and leukocytosis. His pain has been poorly controlled, and there are concerns for delirium, infection, or complications related to his underlying conditions such as a possible cerebrovascular accident (CVA) due to atrial fibrillation. The patient has been started on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, and his pain control has been improved with morphine IV prn.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status and fever may be indicative of delirium or confusion. This could be due to various factors such as medication side effects (e.g., ativan), infection, pain, or underlying neurological conditions.
2. Infection/Fever: The patient's elevated temperature and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection. It is essential to treat the fever and monitor for any signs of worsening infection.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient's history of AFib and the current episode of AFib with rapid vent"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of malignancy, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's main complaints include fever and confusion. He was initially experiencing aphasia and difficulty following commands, which improved after receiving 0.5 mg of Ativan overnight.

The patient underwent a CT scan of the head, which showed no acute intracranial abnormalities but revealed aerosolized secretions in the left maxillary sinus and mucosal thickening in the bilateral ethmoid sinuses. As a result, the patient was ordered for an MRI of the head.

The patient's cardiac status was unstable, with episodes of atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone was stopped, and the patient was started on Lopressor 25 mg. However, the patient's blood pressure dropped to the 80s, so the Lopressor dose was reduced by half to 12.5 mg and changed to Q8H. It is noted that the patient should be on metoprolol, but the reason for not being on it needs to be discussed with the outpatient cardiologist.

The patient's pain control has been a concern, with both acute and chronic pain reported. He was initially using PCA (Patient-Controlled Analgesia) but was switched to morphine IV PRN due to technical issues with the PCA pump.

The patient's temperature spiked to 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit, leading to the empirical start of Unasyn"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation (AFib), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post left anterior descending artery stent placement, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and rectal cancer surgery. He is currently admitted to the ICU for AFib with rapid ventricular response. The patient presented with fever, altered mental status, and leukocytosis. Imaging studies, including a CT scan and MRI of the head, showed no acute intracranial abnormalities but revealed aerosolized secretions in the left maxillary sinus and mucosal thickening in the bilateral ethmoid sinuses. The patient was started on antibiotics empirically for suspected infection and pain control. He is also being treated for hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and acute/chronic pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is somnolent and has altered mental status, which could be due to morphine use, infection, fever, pain, or medication side effects.
2. Fever (Hypothermia, Pyrexia, Not Fever of Unknown Origin): The patient has a persistent fever, which needs to be evaluated and treated appropriately.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection or inflammatory response.
4. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm), Colorectal (Colon Cancer): The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recent rectal cancer surgery. He is currently admitted to the ICU for management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and fever. The patient's medical history includes a previous left anterior descending artery stent placement, and he is on multiple medications including aspirin, Plavix, statin, and ACE inhibitors.

24-hour events:
- The patient developed fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea with poorly controlled pain. Morphine was given for pain control, but it caused somnolence and potential delirium.
- A head CT showed no acute intracranial abnormality but revealed aerosolized secretions in the left maxillary sinus and mucosal thickening in the bilateral ethmoid sinuses.
- An MRI of the head is ordered to further evaluate the findings.
- The patient's blood pressure dropped to the 80s, and lopressor was started at a dose of 25mg. However, the dose was later reduced to 12.5mg due to hypotension, and it is now given every 8 hours.
- The patient was switched from PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) to morphine IV prn (as needed).
- Due to the fever, Unasyn was started empirically, along with pan-culture.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He underwent a pelvic resection for newly diagnosed rectal cancer at a hospital and was then transferred to another hospital unit for rapid atrial fibrillation in the setting of post-operative fever. The patient has been on amiodarone infusion with conversion to sinus rhythm shortly after arrival at the hospital unit.

The patient presented with a fever of 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit on 1/19/2177 at 12:00 PM, and blood cultures were sent. He was empirically started on Unasyn antibiotics. The patient also received 2 mg IV morphine at 8 am, which resulted in somnolence and arousability only to voice during the examination.

The patient has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were metronidazole on 1/18/2177 at 8:30 PM and Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn) on 1/20/2177 at 5:32 AM. The patient is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis, morphine sulfate infusion, and other ICU medications.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue. He is NPO (nothing by mouth) and has a Foley catheter in place. The patient appears comfortable without any pain.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 81-156 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F), and he remains in sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis indicate a possible infection. Blood and urine cultures were obtained to identify the causative agent. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values is necessary to detect any worsening infection.

2. Arrhythmias: Atrial fibrillation is present, and rate control measures are in place. Amiodarone is being used to maintain sinus rhythm. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and adjust medication dosages as needed to prevent arrhythmia complications.

3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which can be a common complication in the ICU setting. It is essential to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and colorectal cancer. He was admitted to the MICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the setting of fever. His current conditions include delirium/confusion, fever, leukocytosis, cancer (colon cancer), and pain control. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 C (100.9 F), blood pressure ranging from 81/50 mmHg to 156/89 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient has undergone several interventions, including being placed on amiodarone, metoprolol, and morphine. He has also received statin therapy and has had blood and urine cultures taken. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and troponin T levels, while his magnesium and potassium levels are low. The patient's imaging results, including a CT scan of the head and chest X-ray, are unremarkable.

Plan:
The patient's plan includes continuing amiodarone and metoprolol for rate control, advancing to a cardiac diet, holding ACE inhibitors due to recent hypotension, continuing statin therapy, and providing pain control with morph"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and colorectal cancer. He was admitted to the MICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of fever. The patient's current condition includes delirium/confusion, fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin), leukocytosis, cancer (malignant neoplasm), and pain control (acute pain, chronic pain).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response needs to be managed to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.
2. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection. It is important to identify the source of infection and provide appropriate treatment to prevent sepsis.
3. Cancer: The patient has a history of colorectal cancer. Regular follow-up and monitoring for disease progression or recurrence is necessary.
4. Pain management: The patient requires effective pain management to prevent complications associated with acute and chronic pain.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and rectal cancer. He was admitted to the MICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of fever. The patient's current medications include amiodarone, diltiazem, furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium, aspirin, and Plavix. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib and is currently being treated with amiodarone and diltiazem. The goal is to control the heart rate and prevent further episodes of AFib.

2. Delirium/confusion: The patient has experienced episodes of delirium or confusion, which could be secondary to medications such as ativan and morphine. It is important to monitor his mental status closely and adjust medications accordingly.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of leukocytosis.

4. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), colorectal (colon cancer): The patient has a history of rectal cancer. It is essential to continue follow-up recommendations and provide appropriate pain control.

5. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain): The patient requires pain management due to acute"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and colorectal cancer. He is currently admitted to the ICU for AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He has had multiple medical issues, including fever, leukocytosis, altered mental status, hypertension, acute renal failure (ARF), and pain control. The patient's current medications include amiodarone, metoprolol, aspirin, Plavix, and morphine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's AFib with RVR needs to be managed carefully as it can lead to complications such as heart rate instability, blood pressure fluctuations, and potential cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Delirium/confusion: The patient has experienced episodes of delirium or confusion, which may be due to medications or other underlying causes. Close monitoring and adjustment of medications are necessary to prevent further confusion.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which can be a sign of infection or inflammation. It is important to monitor the patient's temperature, white blood cell count, and other signs of infection to prevent or manage any potential infections.
4. Colorectal cancer: The patient has a history of colorectal cancer, and his pain control and nutritional needs should be addressed to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/ RVR). The patient is currently on amiodarone for rate control. The patient experienced orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia after increasing the dose of diltiazem, leading to the administration of IV and PO diltiazem. The patient's rate was better controlled after this intervention. The patient also received Unasyn due to oozing from the rectum and increased leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AFib w/ RVR: The patient's initial presentation of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response indicates a potential complication related to abnormal heart rhythm. This can lead to decreased cardiac output, hemodynamic instability, and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.

2. Orthostatic Hypotension: The patient experienced a significant drop in blood pressure upon standing, indicating orthostatic hypotension. This condition can cause dizziness, fainting, and falls, increasing the risk of injuries.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate increased significantly after the administration of diltiazem, indicating possible tachycardia. Tachycardia can compromise cardiac output and lead to ischemia and myocardial infarction.

4. Increased Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and colorectal cancer. He was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/ RVR) in the setting of fever to 102. The patient has been managed with diltiazem, amiodarone, lasix, and unasyn. His condition has been stable with near adequate rate control, but he continues to experience bouts of RVR temporarily controlled by diltiazem. The patient is suspected to be underreporting his pain, and tachycardia may be related to hypovolemia or deconditioning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AFib w/ RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response needs to be closely monitored and managed to maintain rate control and prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.
2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient previously experienced altered mental status, which has since resolved. It is important to monitor for any signs of delirium or confusion, especially considering the patient's age and multiple medications.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient had an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection or inflammation. Further evaluation and monitoring are necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and colorectal cancer. He was admitted to the MICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of fever to 102. The patient has had several medical complications during his stay, including pain control, delirium/confusion, leukocytosis, and orthostasis.

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/ RVR): The patient's rate control has been temporarily managed with diltiazem. It is suspected that the tachycardia may be related to hypovolemia, although the patient is likely volume overloaded since admission. Orthostasis is more likely secondary to deconditioning and age rather than dehydration. The patient will continue on amiodarone and diltiazem, and lasix will be restarted at a low dose.

2. Fever/leukocytosis: The patient's low-grade fevers and leukocytosis have resolved. This was likely due to atelectasis, as confirmed by the chest X-ray without signs of infection. Urine analysis is negative, and all cultures are pending.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status has resolved, likely secondary to medications (Ativan and morphine). Imaging studies (CT head and MRI"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and colorectal cancer (colon cancer). He was admitted to the ICU for AFib with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient's initial management included amiodarone and diltiazem. He experienced episodes of RVR temporarily controlled by diltiazem. Orthostatic hypotension and fever were also noted, which could be related to infection or hypovolemia. The patient's leukocytosis resolved, and his fever curve improved.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. AFib with RVR: The patient's AFib with RVR is a significant concern as it can lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, and hemodynamic instability. Rate control measures need to be continued to prevent these complications.

2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient had episodes of delirium or confusion, which could be secondary to medications like ativan and morphine. It is important to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust medications accordingly.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient initially presented with leukocytosis, which has since resolved. However, ongoing monitoring is necessary to detect any signs of infection or other causes of elevated white blood cell count.

   Imaging: CXR AP [**2177-1-23**]:
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal
   increase in density at the right lung base, potentially suggesting
   increased
   atelectasis, notably in the light of minimal overall decrease of lung
   volumes. Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged. No pulmonary edema. No
   evidence of infection. Moderate cardiomegaly. No evidence of pleural
   effusions.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and colorectal cancer. He presented to the ICU with fever and leukocytosis, which have since resolved. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/ RVR) and has been managed with diltiazem. He also has altered mental status, which has resolved, likely due to medication side effects. The patient's blood cultures, urine cultures, and wound culture are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. AFib w/ RVR: The patient's rapid ventricular response may lead to hemodynamic instability, hypotension, or arrhythmias if not adequately controlled.

2. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count could indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation in the body.

3. Cancer (Malignant Neoplasm), Colorectal (Colon Cancer): The patient's colorectal cancer may recur or progress, leading to complications such as obstruction, bleeding, or metastasis.

4. Pain Control (Acute Pain, Chronic Pain): The patient may experience acute or chronic pain related to his surgical procedure, underlying medical conditions, or cancer. Inadequate pain control can lead to discomfort, impaired mobility, and increased risk of complications.

5. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status"
