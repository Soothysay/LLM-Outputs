","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions including a chronic infarct in the left frontal region of the brain, small pleural effusions, bibasilar atelectasis, calcification of the aorta, and a strophic pancreas. The patient's ABGs show improvement in oxygenation when placed on CPAP, but was later taken off CPAP and put back on NRB with an O2 sat of 97%. The patient has been agitated several times during the night, requiring sedation with Haldol. There have been no changes in the CXR, except for a potentially small trachea. The patient's vital signs have been fluctuating, with episodes of hypertension and tachycardia. The patient is also experiencing pain in the back and has been given morphine for pain relief. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the presence of small pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility and risk factors such as a strophic pancreas.
3. Infection or sepsis due to the presence of a strophic pancreas, which can increase the risk of infection.
4. Acute kidney injury (AK"

   70-yo man w/ HTN, HL, LBP s/p L4-S1 decompression / fusion, w/ post-op
   course c/b delirium as well as an event of hypotension, tachycardia,
   and hypoxia. Hypotension and tachycardia resolved, hypoxia is
   persistent.
   .
   #. Hypoxia - Concern for PE given timing w/ significant HD compromise
   including hypotension and tachycardia, both of which have now resolved.
   Lungs clear on exam and CXR clear. ABG c/w hypoxia as well. Also, pt
   may have aspirated in setting of altered mental status.
   - check CTA to r/o PE
   - consider TTE to look for e/o R-heart strain
   - consider bubble study on TTE to look for e/o left-to-right shunt
   - control agitation as below
   - consider intubation w/ bronchoscopy to eval for secretions given
   upper airway sounds
   - albuterol / ipratropium PRN
   - monitor serial ABGs
   .
   #. Delirium - Post-op delirium, likely [**2-27**] EtOH withdrawal, also
   consider paradoxical effect to benzodiazepines in the elderly.
   Infection unlikely given lack of fever or elevated WBC. Hypoxia may be
   contributing. Also consider post-op pain as pt has not yet received any
   pain meds.
   - hold ativan CIWA now
   - use Haldol for delirium
   - cont pain control as below for surgery, wound avoid narcotics
   - f/u Head CT results
   - cont eval and treatment for hypoxia as above
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 4602**] - Pt w/ LBP s/p lumbar decompression / fusion.
   - f/u Neuro-surgery recs, appreciate involvement
   - f/u Abdominal CT to eval for abdominal / RP bleeding
   - pain control, would avoid narcotics given mental status and avoid
   NSAIDs given recent surgery, consider Tylenol vs. low-dose narcotics
   .
   #. HTN - cont home Atenolol
   .
   #. HL - cont home statin
   .
   #. FEN - NPO, IVF overnight, consider NGT w/ TFs, electrolyte repletion
   .
   #. Access - PIVs
   .
   #. PPx - SQ Heparin, pneumoboots, home PPI, bowel regimen, restraints,
   maintain HOB <30 degrees at all times with bedrest
   .

   #. Dispo - MICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, left below-knee amputation, and post-operative delirium. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to an event of hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia. His recent surgeries include L4-S1 decompression and fusion.

The patient's vital signs have been fluctuating throughout the day, with episodes of agitation and tachycardia. His oxygen saturation has been in the high 90s on NRB (nasal rapid flow) and CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure). The patient's respiratory support includes NRB and CPAP.

The patient's CT head shows a left frontal hypoattenuation consistent with chronic infarct, with no acute bleed or infarct. The CT chest reveals no large pulmonary embolism (PE), but smaller segmental/subsegmental PEs cannot be assessed due to the timing of contrast. There are also bilateral small pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. The CT abdomen shows stenotic pancreas and calcification of the aorta.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate levels. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range. Other lab values such as hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creat"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and lumbar back pain post laminectomy/fusion. He was admitted with acute hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia, which have since resolved. The patient remains hypoxic despite being on CPAP and has a persistent low-grade fever. He is agitated and delirious, but responsive to commands. His physical examination reveals inspiratory wheezes, tachypnea, and poor air flow, although good airflow is noted through bilateral lung fields. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 165/70 mmHg, heart rate of 106 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94-97% on NRB. His labs show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, but elevated creatinine and lactate levels. The patient's medical history includes a stenotic aorta with calcification, chronic left frontal infarct, and bibasilar atelectasis. He has allergies to penicillins and has not had any pain medications in the past 24 hours. The patient is currently on multiple medications including senna, docusate, PPI, atenolol, heparin, vitamin D, rosuvastatin, albuterol nebs Q4hours, and Tylenol PRN.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's persistent hypoxia requires further evaluation and management. Possible causes include pulmonary embolism (PE), aspiration pneumonia, or underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary syndrome (COPD). Further diagnostic tests such as a repeat CT chest or a ventilation-perfusion scan may be necessary to rule out PE. If the patient is suspected to have aspirated, broad-spectrum antibiotics may be considered.

2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and agitation suggest delirium. The cause could be multifactorial, including pain, possible alcohol withdrawal, benzodiazepine paradoxical effect, or infection. Holding the patient's benzodiazepines and providing adequate pain control may help improve his mental status. Close monitoring and frequent re-evaluation are essential.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite being on atenolol. Adjustments to his antihypertensive therapy may be necessary, and close monitoring of blood pressure is required.

4. Back pain: The patient complains of back pain, which could be related to his recent lumbar decompression/fusion surgery. Adequate pain control is crucial for his comfort and overall condition.

5. Infection: Although the patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, his elevated lactate level suggests possible infection or sepsis. Cultures should be monitored, and appropriate antibiotics should be considered if there are signs of infection.

6. Fluid balance: The patient has had a negative fluid balance"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and low back pain post lumbar decompression/fusion. He has been experiencing delirium, hypoxia, and agitation.
- The patient's vital signs have been unstable with episodes of hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia. However, these episodes have now resolved.
- The patient's ABGs indicate hypoxia, and the CT chest shows no large pulmonary embolism but cannot rule out small subsegmental PEs. There are also bilateral small pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis, as well as calcification of the aorta.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Other lab values such as creatinine, troponin T, glucose, electrolytes, and liver function tests are within normal range.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of hypertension, heart disease, and low back pain who underwent lumbar decompression and fusion surgery.
- Postoperatively, the patient experienced delirium, hypotension, tachycardia, and persistent hypoxia.
- The patient's hypoxia is a concern for possible pulmonary embolism (PE), but CT scan ruled out major PEs, although small subsegmental PEs cannot be completely ruled out.
- The patient's lungs are clear on examination, and chest X-ray is unremarkable.
- There is a possibility of aspiration due to altered mental status, but the patient seems to be oxygenating well on room air.
- A sleep consult suggests that the patient may have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which could contribute to his hypoxia, especially during delirium.
- The patient's delirium is likely postoperative in nature, and the use of benzodiazepines may have paradoxically worsened his delirium. Holding benzodiazepines and administering haloperidol has led to improvement.
- The patient complains of back pain, for which morphine was given, resulting in improved symptoms.
- The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, with a normal platelet count.
- The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for slightly low potassium levels.
- The patient's kidney function"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and lumbar back pain who underwent L4-S1 decompression and fusion surgery. He presented to the ICU with delirium, hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia. His symptoms resolved except for persistent hypoxia. The patient has a positive urine culture for >100,000 GNR and is allergic to penicillins. He was started on IV Bactrim due to the allergy and because ciprofloxacin can lower the seizure threshold. His vital signs are stable, but he continues to experience hypoxia despite clear lung sounds on examination. The ABG shows hypoxia as well. The patient may have aspirated in the setting of altered mental status, although the chest X-ray remains unchanged. A sleep consult suggests that he may have obstructive sleep apnea, but it is difficult to ascertain whether it is contributing to his hypoxia. The patient's delirium is attributed to post-operative factors and possibly benzodiazepine paradoxical effect, rather than alcohol withdrawal. The patient's pain has improved with morphine, and he has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The plan includes treating the urinary tract infection with Bactrim, evaluating for alcohol withdrawal, considering haloperidol for agitation, continuing evaluation and treatment for hypoxia, following up with neurosurgery recommendations, providing"
