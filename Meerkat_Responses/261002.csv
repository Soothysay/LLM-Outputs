   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, ulcerative colitis, and recent colectomy with ileostomy. The patient experienced an episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). The VT is suspected to be caused by old myocardial infarction (MI) scar, low magnesium levels, or an acute ischemic event.

The patient is currently on several medications including amiodarone drip, serial EKGs, cycling enzymes, telemetry, beta-blockers to achieve a target heart rate of 60-74 beats per minute, atorvastatin, aspirin, and close monitoring of electrolytes, particularly magnesium and potassium.

The patient is also diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), as indicated by elevated cardiac enzymes and wall motion abnormalities on imaging. The patient is receiving medical management for NSTEMI, which includes continuing enzyme cycling to peak levels, administration of atorvastatin, aspirin, and beta-blockers.

Additionally, the patient has respiratory acidosis, likely due to decreased respiratory drive from narcotics and mild sleep apnea. There is also a concomitant metabolic alkalosis. The patient's narcotics and sedatives have been withheld, and they will be monitored closely.

The patient is experiencing mild abdominal pain following the colectomy and ileostomy, for which Dil"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and ulcerative colitis who underwent colectomy and ileostomy. He experienced an episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). The patient is currently in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has a history of CAD and presented with NSTEMI, indicating possible ongoing myocardial ischemia. This increases the risk of progression to a full-blown myocardial infarction (MI).
2. Arrhythmias: VT is already present, and there is a concern for other arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, especially in the setting of electrolyte imbalances or ongoing myocardial ischemia.
3. Stroke: The combination of CAD, NSTEMI, and VT increases the risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke.
4. Kidney Injury: The patient has low urine output (388 mL in 24 hours), which may indicate acute kidney injury (AKI). This could be due to hypoperfusion, dehydration, or the use of nephrotoxic medications.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections, particularly in the postoperative setting with invasive lines and potential immunosuppression.
6. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient is at increased risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), ulcerative colitis, and recent surgery (colectomy + ileostomy). He was admitted to the ICU for ventricular tachycardia (VT) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's current medications include insulin, metoprolol, heparin, and amiodarone. He is experiencing persistent right-sided shoulder and chest pain that worsens with inspiration, as well as sharp lower bilateral abdominal pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient had an episode of VT in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), and possible etiologies include an old MI scar, low magnesium levels, or an acute ischemic event. Continuous monitoring of the EKG and telemetry should be maintained.
2. Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's peak CK level is 1225, and Troponin-T is elevated at 2.68, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. The patient should continue to be medically optimized with beta-blockers to achieve a target heart rate of 60-74 bpm. Consideration should be given to adding Plavix to prevent further clot formation.
3. Respiratory Acidosis: The patient had an episode of respiratory acidosis likely due to excess sedation from pain"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), ulcerative colitis, who recently underwent colectomy and ileostomy. He experienced an episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). The patient's peak creatine kinase (CK) level was 1225, troponin T level was 2.68, indicating a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The cause of VT is unclear, whether it was due to demand ischemia post-VT or NSTEMI. Cardiology consulted and recommended increasing heparin drips to achieve a goal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 60-80 and taking the patient for cardiac catheterization.

The patient continues to be medically optimized with intravenous metoprolol titrating up as blood pressure allows. He is also prescribed atorvastatin, aspirin, and beta-blockers. Serial electrocardiograms (EKGs) and telemetry are being monitored. Monitoring of electrolytes, particularly magnesium and potassium, is closely done.

The patient has resolved respiratory acidosis/hypercarbia and is being monitored for pulmonary embolism (PE) with a low threshold for evaluation using right-sided catheter or computed tomography angiography (CTA), especially if refractory hypoxia persists. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.           Hypercarbic Resp Failure: post op with narcotics

   Now waking up and improving mental status
 monitored closely through
   evening as pain control  managed with PCA- ABG now within normal limits
   3.       NSTEMI: etiology that is most concerning is ischemia with
   rising trop and CK- Cardiology planning to take West for
             cardiac catheterization. Cycle enzymes, bblocker, ASA,
   statin.  Concern also raised for PE as this chest pain is
   pleuritic, different from prior MI, and he was having resp acidosis
   with this- this should be eval either in cath lab via PA gram or by
   CTA. Is anti coag at present.
   4.       V Tach: Amio gtts, anti coag.
   5.       POD#0 s/p colectomy: NPO, LR at 125/hr, monitor UOP, serial
   abd exams
          6.       Lytes: keep Mg above 2 and K above 4

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a post-operative patient who experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which can lead to carbon dioxide retention and respiratory acidosis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and has an arterial line inserted.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate ranging from 93 to 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/57 mmHg to 138/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), and troponin-T. The patient's blood glucose levels are also elevated.

Assessment and plan:
1. The patient is being monitored closely for hypercarbic respiratory failure, particularly as they wake up and improve their mental status.
2. The patient is diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), likely due to ischemia with an old myocardial infarction scar. The patient is receiving heparin drips, amiodarone, beta"
