   to MICU for close observation, mental status monitoring.
   Respiratory
   - hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure
   - evidence of chronic resp failure (inc bicarb) underlying acute
   decompensation.
   - Bipap noted to improve CO2, pt becomes agitated but no improvement in
   mental status.
   Delerium/altered mental status
   - waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] course c/w delerium
   - holding sedating meds
   - If further decompensation overnight or is not clearly improving by
   morning, will require intubation / mech ventilation.

   Total time spent:
","The patient is an elderly individual with diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure, admitted from a nursing home with altered mental status. The patient's respiratory status is concerning for hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly due to chronic respiratory failure with an acute decompensation. The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and there are concerns about delirium.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate between 67-88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 85-132/58-84 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on BiPAP for respiratory support.

The physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. However, peripheral pulses are not assessed, and neurologic examination is incomplete due to the patient being sedated and not attentive or responsive.

Laboratory results show elevated TCO2 levels and lactic acid within normal limits. The assessment indicates potential respiratory failure, delirium, arthritis, chronic kidney disease, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and access issues.

The plan involves close observation and monitoring of mental status. Sedating medications will be held, and intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required if there is further decompensation or lack of improvement by morning. Additional tests"

   Assessment and Plan
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
 ACIDOSIS, RESPIRATORY
   A/P: [**Age over 90 **] YO F with atrial thrombus coumadin, HTN, CKD, presents with
   altered mental status after a fall with acute decompensation on the
   floor, transferred to the MICU for further care.
   .
   .
   Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial to unclude medications
   (Tramadol recently started), hypercarbia, age, toxic-metabolic, and
   underlying dementia.  No evidence to suggest bleed as CT head negative,
   CT chest also neg.  Non-focal exam rules against stroke.  CXR
   unremarkable for change.  Does not use drugs.  Likely has poor
   compensatory capacity.  Per neuron, near baseline on previous
   assessment
   - Hold psychoactive medications, do not give haldol, zyprexa etc
   patient  sundowns and needs re-direction only, no meds
   - Hold tramadol, gabapentin
   - NGTD on cx
   - CXR unremarkable
   - CT head negative
   - Monitor hypercarbia -> BiPAP if needed
   - TSH normal, f/u B12 and folate
   - Appreciate neuro consult: , LP, ammonia, LFTs, tox -> tox negative,
   EEG ordered, LFTs added, ? need for LP and ammonia
   - cancel EEG given drastic improvement in mental status with
   withholding sedating medications including tramadol, neurontin, haldol,
   zyprexa
   .
   Hypercarbia: Appears to be chronic retainer given elevated bicarb.
   ABGs in [**2136**] with C02 in the 50s.  This is above her baseline, making
   it acute on chronic.  Medications likely to blame (i.e. tramadol) vs
   mechanical (has elevated L hemidiaphram which may be impeding
   respiration).  Also found to have apneic episodes at night raising
   concern for apnea
   - Serial ABGs
   - BiPAP if C02 worsens
   - Cont to follow
   - CT chest with atelectasis
   - Standing nebulizers
   - Outpt sleep study
   .
   CKD: Baseline 1.4-1.6.  Currently stable.  Cont to follow
   .
   Atrial Thrombus: Not evident on previous echo.  NO signs of cardiac
   obstruction.  INR 2.7
   - will discuss with PCP as far as continuing on warfarin given risk of
   falls and TTE with no thrombus on last imaging
   .
   Cardiomyopathy: Cont ACE-I, BB, and lasix
   .
   HTN: Stable.  Cont losartan, metoprolol, nifedipine
   .
   Diabetes: Hold oral hypoglyemics for now.
   - HISS and monitor
   .
   Spinal Stenosis: No obvious neuro deficits currently
   - Cont to follow
   - Tylenol standing
   .
   Lipids: Cont statin
   .
   Hypothyoridism:
   - Cont levoxyl at current dose
   - TSH normal
   .
   Glaucoma: Cont drops
   .
   Arthritis: Hold tramadol.  Cont Tylenol standing
   .
   FEN:.  Monitor electroltyes, cont vit D
   - Swallow study

   A/P: [**Age over 90 **] YO F with atrial thrombus coumadin, HTN, CKD, presents with
   altered mental status after a fall with acute decompensation on the
   floor, transferred to the MICU for further care.
   .
   .
   Altered Mental Status: Likely multifactorial to unclude medications
   (Tramadol recently started), hypercarbia, age, toxic-metabolic, and
   underlying dementia.  No evidence to suggest bleed as CT head negative,
   CT chest also neg.  Non-focal exam rules against stroke.  CXR
   unremarkable for change.  Does not use drugs.  Likely has poor
   compensatory capacity.  Per neuron, near baseline on previous
   assessment
   - Hold psychoactive medications
   - Hold tramadol, gabapentin
   - f/u micro
   - CXR unremarkable
   - CT head negative
   - Monitor hypercarbia -> BiPAP if needed
   - TSH normal, f/u B12 and folate
   - Appreciate neuron consult: EEG, LP, ammonia, LFTs, tox -> tox
   negative, EEG ordered, LFTs added, ? need for LP and ammonia
   .
   Hypercarbia: Appears to be chronic retainer given elevated bicarb.
   ABGs in [**2136**] with C02 in the 50s.  This is above her baseline, making
   it acute on chronic.  Medications likely to blame (i.e. tramadol) vs
   mechanical (has elevated L hemidiaphram which may be impeding
   respiration).  Also found to have apneic episodes at night raising
   concern for apnea
   - Serial ABGs
   - BiPAP if C02 worsens

   Atrial Thrombus: Not evident on previous echo.  NO signs of cardiac
   obstruction.  INR 2.7
   - restart warfarin
   - Trend INR and restart once therapeutic

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial thrombus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and other comorbidities. She presents with altered mental status after a fall and acute decompensation on the floor. The patient is currently in the ICU for further care.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 129/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on a nasal cannula for oxygen support.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, with normal head and neck examination, clear breath sounds, and symmetric chest expansion. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. The patient has absent peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities, indicating potential peripheral vascular disease or other underlying conditions. Neurologically, she is sedated, not attentive, does not follow simple commands, and her tone and movement are not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (265 K/uL), slightly elevated hemoglobin (12.2 g/dL), normal sodium (119 mg/dL), slightly low potassium (1.3 mg/dL), slightly elevated chloride (33 mEq/L), normal bicarbonate (101 mEq/L), and slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen ("

   Respiratory
   - hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure
   - evidence of chronic resp failure (inc bicarb) underlying acute
   decompensation.

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for close observation and mental status monitoring due to altered mental status. The patient has a history of delirium and is currently holding sedating medications. She is interactive and responsive to verbal stimuli, but her movement and tone cannot be assessed.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/96 to 194/145 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is being delivered supplemental oxygen.

The patient's lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 8.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.2 g/dL, platelet count of 265 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 119 mg/dL, and potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L. Other lab values such as sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and liver enzymes are within normal ranges.

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via a non-invasive mask, and she is on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) which improves her carbon dioxide levels but does not improve her mental status. The patient becomes ag"
