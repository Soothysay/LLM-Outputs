","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

1. The patient was intubated due to an inability to protect their airway and remains on ventilatory support.
2. The patient experienced a significant drop in hematocrit and had copious black liquid stools, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The NG lavage was negative yesterday.
3. The patient has altered mental status, showing signs of encephalopathy and decerebrate posturing with downward eye gaze.
4. The patient has liver function abnormalities, with elevated ALT and AST levels, suggesting acute liver failure.
5. The patient has hypophosphatemia (low phosphate) and electrolyte/fluid disorders.
6. The patient has respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and requires continuous oxygen delivery through an endotracheal tube.
7. The patient has a history of depression.
8. The patient has liver function abnormalities due to acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose, as indicated by Tylenol levels and lab results.
9. The patient has upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with melena.
10. The patient has altered mental status but is not in delirium.

Considering these complications, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, electrolyte imbalances, and potential infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or deep vein thromb"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Altered Mental Status: Very confusing picture. Patient decompensates
   into herniation-like physical exam, but three stat head CTs show mild
   edema, no change. Received Mannitol twice, and temporal association of
   improvement in neuro exam after in both cases. Nsurg unenthused about
   placing a bolt or further Mannitol. Of note patient takes unknown large
   amounts of Valium at b/l, while her Tylenol level is clearing and her
   liver function steadily improving.
   -          24-hour EEG
   -          Keppra loaded
   -          MRI of head
   -          Reassess with neurology, neurosurg input
   -          Holding Mannitol
   -          Osmoles pending if do choose to restart Mannitol
   # Hepatitis: Tylenol-induced most likely given Tylenol levels, labs.
   Has been treated with NAC infusion, NAC now d/c
   -          Trend PM LFTs
   -          F/u liver team recs
   # Intubation: Remains on vent for now [**12-23**] inability to protect airway.
   # Hematocrit drop & copious black liquid stools, black NG succus: C/w
   GIB. NG lavage negative yesterday negative. GI / liver team following.
   Transfused o/n.

   # Substance Abuse: Patient
s s/o denies EtOH use but endorses frequent
   benzodiazepine and PO narcotic use. Patient at risk for withdrawal from
   benzos, which will be difficult to detect given all the other reasons
   (cerebral edema, fulminant hepatitis, unknown coingestions) she may
   have changes in her vitals and neuro exam.

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to an inability to protect his airway. He has been experiencing decerebrate posturing, downward eye gaze, and myoclonic twitching. The patient has a history of substance abuse, including frequent benzodiazepine and PO narcotic use.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of improvement and deterioration. Three stat head CTs have shown mild cerebral edema with no significant changes. Mannitol administration has been associated with temporary improvements in neurologic exams.
2. Hepatitis: The patient's liver function tests indicate possible hepatitis, likely caused by excessive Tylenol intake. He has been treated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) infusion but is now off NAC.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has experienced copious black liquid stools and a drop in hematocrit, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding. NG lavage was negative, but the GI/liver team is following up with further investigations and recommendations.
4. Hematocrit drop: The patient's hematocrit levels have been dropping, indicating possible ongoing bleeding or fluid loss.
5. Intubation: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation due to his inability to protect his airway.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of liver failure, acute kidney injury, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's neurological status has fluctuated throughout the day, with decerebrate posturing and downward eye gaze observed at one point. The patient received mannitol for increased intracranial pressure and lorazepam for agitation. There was also a concern for possible acetaminophen overdose. The patient's vital signs were relatively stable, with a heart rate ranging from 80 to 115 beats per minute and blood pressure between 130/80 to 150/90 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation remained at 100% on supplemental oxygen. Fluid balance showed a positive net fluid intake of 7,891 mL and output of 3,780 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 4,111 mL. The patient's respiratory support included a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%, and respiratory system compliance of 75 cmH2O/mL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values were within normal limits. Laboratory results indicated an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 216 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of acetaminophen overdose and altered mental status, currently clearing slowly. The patient's head imaging is generally unrevealing, with possible hepatic encephalopathy or lingering effects of acetaminophen overdose. 

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, although possibly plateauing. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been continued per liver and toxicology recommendations.

The patient was extubated this morning and is doing well. There have been melenotic stools, but no active gastrointestinal bleeding has been identified on NG lavage. The patient has been transfused overnight, and no urgent need for scope at this time is recommended by the liver team.

A presumptive identification of E. coli on urine culture has been noted, and ceftriaxone has been initiated for empiric coverage. The patient's possible substance abuse history includes frequent benzodiazepine and PO narcotic use, putting her at risk for withdrawal, although no current signs other than improving mental status have been observed.

Hypophosphatemia needs to be replete as needed. The patient is NPO except for medications, with consideration for speech and swallow trial post-extubation. Prophylactic measures include PBoots and pantoprazole.

Communication regarding the patient's care should involve the boyfriend and caretaker, [**Name (NI)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female admitted to the ICU with an acetaminophen overdose, persistent altered mental status, and multiple medical complications. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuating vital signs and neurological exam. She has received treatment for acetaminophen overdose, including N-acetylcysteine (NAC) infusion, but her liver function tests indicate ongoing hepatitis. The patient remains intubated due to an inability to protect her airway. She also has a hematocrit drop and copious black liquid stools suggestive of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). A presumptive identification of E. Coli in the urine culture indicates a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has a history of substance abuse and is at risk for benzodiazepine withdrawal. She also has hypophosphatemia and requires further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatitis: The patient's liver function tests indicate ongoing hepatitis, likely secondary to acetaminophen overdose. Close monitoring and treatment are necessary.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient's hematocrit drop and copious black liquid stools suggest ongoing GIB. Further evaluation and management, including possible transfusion, are required.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The presence of E. Coli in the urine culture indicates a UTI. Antibiotic treatment may be necessary.
4. Benzodiazepine withdrawal: Given the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation but later extubated. The patient's brother, who is a registered nurse, has agreed to act as the healthcare proxy. The patient continues to exhibit agitation and attempts to go home. Toxicology reports indicate ongoing N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration for suspected acetaminophen overdose. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) with an AST/ALT ratio indicative of acetaminophen toxicity. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 89 mg/dL to 155 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate electrolyte imbalances, including low potassium, low phosphate, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/79 mmHg to 143/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation above 98%. Fluid balance shows a positive fluid intake of 1,976 mL and output of 3,992 mL. The patient has received various medications, including ceftriaxone, pantoprazole, and ICU medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for respiratory issues."

She was admitted to the ICU due to an acetaminophen overdose and is currently extubated with improved mental status. The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Acetaminophen overdose: The patient was admitted for an acetaminophen overdose, and her liver function tests (LFTs) are improving. It is recommended to continue N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status has improved, suggesting a possible hepatic encephalopathy. She is being treated with lactulose and supportive measures.

3. Upper gastrointestinal bleed (melena, GI bleed, GIB): The patient is experiencing melanotic stools, indicating a possible upper GI bleed. Further evaluation and management are necessary.

4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has an imbalance of electrolytes and fluids, which needs to be corrected.

5. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient initially required mechanical ventilation but is now extubated. Continuous monitoring and respiratory support may still be needed.

6. Depression: The patient has poor insight into her situation and denies any suicidal ideation, but psychiatric evaluation and monitoring are recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with an altered mental status and a history of acetaminophen overdose. She has shown improvement in her mental status and is now extubated. However, she is agitated and wants to go home. The patient has a history of polysubstance abuse, including benzodiazepines, and there is concern for potential withdrawal. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by pan-sensitive E. coli and is being treated with ceftriaxone and now macrobid. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, but there is still a recommendation for N-acetylcysteine (NAC). She has melanotic stools, which may be causing a drop in hemoglobin. She is being treated with lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient is currently receiving nutrition through the gastrointestinal tract, but will be weaned off the nasogastric tube if she tolerates oral intake well. Her blood glucose levels are within normal range. She has multiple central lines and is receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention. There is no mention of any immediate medical complications or concerns."
