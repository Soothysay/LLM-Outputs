   Code status: Presumed full
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of unclear psychiatric history and reported hypothyroidism. She presented to the emergency department with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient was found to have left lung collapse, which is likely secondary to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative pneumonia. No obstructive lesion was noted on bronchoscopy.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing respiratory issues indicate a risk of continued respiratory failure due to the extensive pneumonia and potential aspiration.
2. Sepsis: The presence of hypotension, elevated lactate levels, and a high white blood cell count suggest a possible sepsis, particularly in the setting of pneumonia.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's reported history of hypothyroidism needs further evaluation, as it may contribute to her lethargy and other symptoms.
4. Pericardial effusion: The moderate-sized pericardial effusion found on CT chest needs further evaluation with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess its impact on cardiac function.
5. Seizure disorder: The unclear psychiatric history and the presence of certain medications raise the possibility of an underlying seizure disorder, which should be reassessed as sedation is weaned.
6. Insomnia: The patient's use of zolpid"

","The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who presented to the emergency department with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have left lung collapse. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative pneumonia, possibly community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric coverage of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure in the 80s with a heart rate of 80 bpm, indicating hypotension. The respiratory rate is within normal limits, and the oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 360 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The plateau pressure is 16 cmH2O, and the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is set at 10 cmH2O.

The patient has a white blood cell count of 11.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, sodium of 122 mg/dL, potassium of 3.6 mEq/L, glucose of 122 mg/dL, and a lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L. The arterial blood gas analysis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, thyroid disorder, and ethanol neuropathy. She presented to the emergency department with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have left lung collapse. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative pneumonia. She has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for coverage of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia.

The patient also has hypotension, which may be due to sepsis secondary to pneumonia. Her elevated lactate levels indicate possible hypoperfusion. She is being maintained with IV fluid hydration to achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and urine output above 30 cc/h.

Additionally, the patient has a moderate-sized pericardial effusion on CT chest, but no pulsus paradoxus on exam. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed to evaluate further.

There are also concerns about the patient's possible hypothyroidism, unclear psychiatric history, increased lethargy, insomnia, and potential seizure disorder. These will need to be reassessed as the patient's sedation is weaned.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's left lung collapse could lead to further respiratory compromise if not addressed properly.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has extensive consolidative pneumonia,"

   suctioned). In light of presenting sx of lethargy, aspiration event in
   possible with concern for anaerobes; baseline status unknown and unable

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of unclear psychiatric history and reported hypothyroidism who presented to the emergency department with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have left lung collapse. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, left lung atelectasis/collapse, leukocytosis, and copious secretions suggestive of pneumonia complicated by mucus plugging causing lung collapse. There is also concern for aspiration event given the presenting symptoms of lethargy, possible tracheal obstruction, and subsequent post-obstructive pneumonia. 

The patient has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics covering hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia. Sputum and blood cultures have been ordered, along with a urine legionella test. 

The patient's elevated lactate levels indicate possible hypoperfusion, and the anion gap is elevated at 13. The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) is being maintained above 60, and IV fluid hydration is being provided. 

A moderate-sized pericardial effusion has been detected on CT chest, but no pulsus paradoxus is present on examination. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) has been ordered to further evaluate the effusion. 

The patient's history of hypothyroidism needs to be clarified, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test has been ordered. 

There are also concerns about"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and recent admission to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to an acute asthma exacerbation. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. 

During the course of her stay in the ICU, the patient underwent a trans-thoracic echo which revealed a small pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade. She was restarted on her outpatient psychiatric medications. The patient's allergy history includes a last dose of vancomycin on 06/10/2167 at 08:26 PM, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 06/11/2167 at 03:23 AM, and levofloxacin on 06/11/2167 at 04:25 AM.

The patient is currently receiving propofol at a rate of 20 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications such as famotidine (Pepcid) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). She has a history of review of systems unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 92 bpm (80-100), blood pressure ranging from 95/65 mmHg to 86/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute (10-15), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is still unable to follow commands when propofol is weaned off.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 4,879 mL of fluids since 12"

   43 yo female with h/o unclear psych history and reported hypothyroidism
   who presented to OSH with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory
   failure requiring intubation and found to have left lung collapse.
   Respiratory failure: Left lung white-out on chest imaging c/w left lung
   atelectasis/collapse. Likely secondary to mucous plugging from
   extensive consolidative pneumonia. No obstructive lesion on bronch.
   Likely CAP v. aspiration although unknown whether pt with risk factors
   for HAP.  Favor broad antibiotic coverage at this time pending further
   micro and clinical history data.  Significant improvement in imaging
   overnight after bronchoscopy now with partial reexpansion of left lung.
   - Vancomycin, zosyn for empiric coverage of HAP and aspiration pna;
   Levofloxacin for empiric coverage of atypical pathogens
   - F/u sputum and blood cultures, urine legionella
   - sputum sample contaminated, will resend (unclear whether the sputum
   sample listed is from bronchoscopy or an endotrachial sample)
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily RSBI/SBT
   - pressure support trial today
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   - Obtain medical history from PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 7180**]: Concern for sepsis in setting of pneumonia. Also may be
   related to propofol used for sedation.  U/A unremarkable.  Sputum
   sample contaminated.  Unable to place aterial line overnight.  Received
   a total of 2.5 liters.  Did not required pressors overnight.
   - will hold on central line and aterial line as pressures seem to be
   stable this morning
   - consider switching to fentanyl/versed if persistent hypotension
   - antibiotics as above for pneumonia
   Elevated lactate: Anion gap 13. Likely elevated lactate in setting of
   hypoperfusion.  Pressures borderline currently in 90s with low urine
   output.
   - Trend lactate
   - IV fluid hydration
   - Goal MAP >60, UOP >30 cc/h
   - Abx as above
   Pericardial effusion: Moderate sized on CT chest. No pulsus paradoxicus
   on exam (8).
   - TTE in AM to evaluate
   ?Hypothyroidism: Per OSH report, unclear history and no levothyroxine
   in med bag
   - Check TSH
   - Clarify with PCP in AM
   Increased lethargy/altered mental status: Presenting complaint to OSH.
   Unclear psych history. Also question of seizure disorder given the meds
   with her. Given positive toxicology screen for opiates and methadone
   also concerning for overdose versus medication effect.
   - Reassess neuro status as wean sedation
   - will confirm medication list and restart home medications given
   concern for withdrawing acutely (topiramate, divalproex, seroquel,
   clonazepam, divalproex)
   Insomnia: On zolpidem prn as outpatient. Holding for now.

   [**2167-6-10**] CXR: An AP supine portable chest demonstrates marked interval
   improvement in the aeration of the left upper lobe compared to the
   previous radiograph. A left pleural effusion is probably unchanged.
   Dense left lower lobe consolidation likewise remains unchanged. An
   endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina in good position. A
   nasogastric tube courses beyond the edge of the film, likely in good
   position. The right lung is clear.
   [**2167-6-10**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect
   is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no
   ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of overt
   tamponade.
   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo female with h/o unclear psych history and reported hypothyroidism
   who presented to OSH with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory
   failure requiring intubation and found to have left lung collapse.
   Respiratory failure: Left lung white-out on chest imaging c/w left lung
   atelectasis/collapse. Likely secondary to mucous plugging from
   extensive consolidative pneumonia. No obstructive lesion on bronch.
   Likely CAP v. aspiration; less likely HAP.  Urine legionella Ag neg.
   Favor broad antibiotic coverage at this time pending further micro and
   clinical history data.  Partial reexpansion s/p bronch with persistent
   left mid-lung infiltrate. Increase in leukocytosis.
   - Cont vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin for broad empiric coverage
   - F/u sputum and blood cultures
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily RSBI/SBT

   Hypotension: Baseline unknown. Concern for sepsis in setting of
   infection; may have contribution from propofol used for sedation. Did
   not require pressors. Currently stable on maintenance fluids with
   improved UOP.
   - will hold on central line and aterial line as pressures remained
   stable overnight
   - consider switching to fentanyl/versed if persistent hypotension
   - antibiotics as above for pneumonia
   - goal MAP >60, UOP >30 cc/h
   Anion gap: Elevated at 15. Lactate elevated on admission but had
   trended down when rechecked. Tox screens positive only for methadone
   and benzos. [**Month (only) 11**] have ketosis from poor po intake.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of unclear psychiatric history and reported hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She was found to have left lung collapse, likely secondary to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative pneumonia. The patient is currently on broad antibiotic coverage for the pneumonia and is being weaned off sedation and ventilator support as tolerated. Other issues include leukocytosis, hypotension, anion gap, pericardial effusion, thyroid disorder, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included hypoxemic respiratory failure, which required intubation. The left lung collapse suggests the possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if the underlying cause (mucous plugging) is not adequately addressed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has extensive consolidative pneumonia, which increases the risk of worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and potential complications like lung abscess or pleural effusion.
3. Hypotension: The patient's baseline hypotension could be due to sepsis in the setting of infection or propofol use for sedation. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause and manage it appropriately.
4. Anion Gap: The elevated anion gap indicates the presence of metabolic acidosis. This condition may progress if not properly managed, leading to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient was found to have a left lung collapse, which is likely secondary to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative pneumonia. No obstructive lesion on bronchoscopy was observed, and urine Legionella Ag was negative. Broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated.

The patient's leukocytosis has increased, and she is being treated for pneumonia with broad antibiotics. A recheck urine analysis with urine culture is planned, as well as checking for Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's baseline hypotension is unknown but may be related to sepsis or propofol use. Sedation will be weaned as tolerated.

The patient's elevated anion gap and lactate levels have improved, but methadone and benzodiazepines were detected in the toxicology screen. Ketosis may be related to poor oral intake. Lactate levels will be monitored, and the bowel regimen will be increased.

A small pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade was observed on transthoracic echo. The patient's thyroid disorder, possibly hypothyroidism, needs further evaluation with free T4 measurement and starting levothyroxine IV.

Constipation has not been addressed since admission. The patient's increased leth"

   [**2167-6-10**] CXR: An AP supine portable chest demonstrates marked interval
   improvement in the aeration of the left upper lobe compared to the
   previous radiograph. A left pleural effusion is probably unchanged.
   Dense left lower lobe consolidation likewise remains unchanged. An
   endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the carina in good position. A
   nasogastric tube courses beyond the edge of the film, likely in good
   position. The right lung is clear.
   [**2167-6-10**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect
   is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is
   0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no
   ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of overt
   tamponade.
   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo female with h/o unclear psych history and reported hypothyroidism
   who presented to OSH with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory
   failure requiring intubation and found to have left lung collapse.
   Respiratory failure: Left lung white-out on chest imaging c/w left lung
   atelectasis/collapse. Likely secondary to mucous plugging from
   extensive consolidative pneumonia. No obstructive lesion on bronch.
   Likely CAP v. aspiration; less likely HAP.  Urine legionella Ag neg.
   Favor broad antibiotic coverage at this time pending further micro and
   clinical history data.  Partial reexpansion s/p bronch with persistent
   left mid-lung infiltrate. Increase in leukocytosis.
   - Cont vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin for broad empiric coverage
   - F/u sputum and blood cultures
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily RSBI/SBT
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   Leukocytosis: Increased today. Currently treating pneumonia with broad
   abx. U/A on admit inconclusive for infection. Not on steroids.
   - Add differential
   - Recheck U/A with Ucx; check C. diff
   - Cont above abx
   Hypotension: Baseline unknown. Concern for sepsis in setting of
   infection; may have contribution from propofol used for sedation. Did
   not require pressors. Currently stable on maintenance fluids with
   improved UOP.
   - will hold on central line and aterial line as pressures remained
   stable overnight
   - consider switching to fentanyl/versed if persistent hypotension
   - antibiotics as above for pneumonia
   - goal MAP >60, UOP >30 cc/h
   Anion gap: Elevated at 15. Lactate elevated on admission but had
   trended down when rechecked. Tox screens positive only for methadone
   and benzos. [**Month (only) 11**] have ketosis from poor po intake.
   - Check lactate with next ABG
   - Recheck U/A
   - Cont maintenance fluids and tube feeds
   Pericardial effusion: Small without evidence of tamponade on TTE.
   Thyroid disorder: Per OSH report, may have hypothyroidism; rx for
   armourthyroid last filled in [**12-12**]. Unclear if pt taking medications for
   this. TSH markedly elevated.
   - Check free T4
   Increased lethargy/altered mental status: Presenting complaint to OSH.
   Given positive toxicology screen for opiates and methadone also
   concerning for overdose versus medication effect. [**Month (only) 11**] also be related
   to known bipolar disorder, reportedly poorly controlled. No known
   seizure disorder.
   - Reassess neuro status as wean sedation
   - Restarted on home topiramate, divalproex, seroquel
   - Holding home clonazepam while on sedation

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of unclear psychiatric history and reported hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. Imaging revealed left lung collapse due to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative pneumonia. She was found to have a small pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for the pneumonia and is being weaned off sedation and ventilator support as tolerated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the pneumonia worsens or if there are complications during weaning off the ventilator.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has extensive consolidative pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction if not appropriately managed with antibiotics and supportive care.

3. Hypotension: The patient presented with baseline unknown hypotension, which may be due to sepsis secondary to the infection or the use of propofol for sedation. If the hypotension persists, further evaluation and management will be required.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which could indicate an ongoing infection. Monitoring and appropriate treatment are necessary to prevent the progression of the infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of overdose and profound hypothyroidism. On admission, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, indicating possible infection or sepsis. Imaging studies reveal a pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade. The patient's mental status remains obtunded, and they are currently being held on sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate further if they develop increased mucous plugging or an inadequate response to the current ventilatory support.
2. Possible sepsis: Elevated lactate levels and hypotension suggest a systemic inflammatory response. Close monitoring of hemodynamic stability and prompt intervention with appropriate antibiotics and fluid resuscitation are necessary.
3. Pericardial effusion: Although no evidence of tampon"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's condition remains stable, but there are concerns about possible sepsis, pericardial effusion, and obtundation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is inadequate oxygenation or if the pneumonia does not respond to antibiotics.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and hypotension suggest possible sepsis. If the infection spreads or the patient's immune response is inadequate, it could lead to further deterioration.
3. Pericardial effusion: Although the patient currently does not exhibit signs of tamponade, continued accumulation of fluid around the heart can potentially lead to cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition.
4. Obtundation: The patient's mental status may not improve if the underlying cause (polypharmacy, overdose, profound hypothyroidism) is not addressed appropriately. This could delay extubation and increase the risk of complications.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation. Daily wake-up trials, elevation of the head of bed, and regular mouth care should be implemented to reduce this risk.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism. She presented to the emergency department with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She was found to have left lung collapse, likely secondary to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative pneumonia. The sputum culture is growing S. aureus sensitive to oxacillin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of hypoxemic respiratory failure indicates a critical condition that required immediate intubation. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure if the pneumonia does not improve or if there is an obstruction in the airway.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has an extensive consolidative pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential sepsis if not treated appropriately.
3. S. aureus Infection: The growth of S. aureus in the sputum culture indicates a bacterial infection. If the infection is not effectively treated, it may result in worsening pneumonia and systemic infection.
4. Myxedema Coma: The patient has a history of poorly controlled hypothyroidism, and her presentation is consistent with myxedema coma. If left untreated, this condition can lead to severe complications and even death.
5. Adrenal Insufficiency: Given the patient's history of bipolar disorder and medication use, there is a concern for possible adrenal insufficiency. This condition"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of abusing thyroid medication for weight loss and stopping abruptly, presenting with altered mental status and pericardial effusion. She was weaned off sedation but remains unresponsive to stimuli, leading to the decision not to extubate her. The patient has a confirmed growth of moderate Staphylococcus aureus in her sputum culture. Her endocrine consult recommended treating her as if she were in myxedema coma due to the thickened skin, altered mental status, and pericardial effusion. She received a bolus of 300 mcg IV levothyroxine and will continue with 75 mcg IV daily. An AM cortisol check is also planned to assess her adrenal axis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating respiratory failure. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
2. Infection: The presence of Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum culture suggests a possible respiratory infection. Antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on the culture results and antibiotic sensitivities.
3. Adrenal crisis: Given the patient's history of thyroid abuse and abrupt cessation, there is a concern for an adrenal crisis. Monitoring cortisol levels and providing appropriate supplementation if needed is important.
4. Thromboembolic events: Immobility and critical illness increase the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. She has a history of abusing thyroid medication for weight loss and abruptly stopping it in the past, leading to a high TSH level of 150. Currently, her TSH is 54 with a low Free T4 level of <0.10. She is not responsive to noxious stimuli, but still requires ventilation support. There is growth of moderate Staphylococcus aureus in her sputum culture. She also has evidence of thyroid dysfunction, with symptoms such as thickened skin, altered mental status, and pericardial effusion. An endocrine consult has recommended treating her as if she were in myxedema coma, administering boluses of 300 mcg IV levothyroxine and 75 mcg IV daily. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/62 to 153/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is mildly cool with well-perfused extremities. The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 23.5 K/uL, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's condition is being managed with appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo female with h/o bipolar d/o, hypothyroidism who presented to OSH
   with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and found to have left lung collapse.
   Respiratory failure: Left lung white-out on chest imaging c/w left lung
   atelectasis/collapse. Likely secondary to mucous plugging from
   extensive consolidative pneumonia. No obstructive lesion on bronch.
   Likely CAP v. aspiration; less likely HAP.  Urine legionella Ag neg.
   Favor broad antibiotic coverage at this time pending further micro and
   clinical history data.  Partial re-expansion s/p bronch with persistent
   left mid-lung infiltrate. Increase in leukocytosis.
   - Cont vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin for broad empiric coverage
   - F/u sputum and blood cultures
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily RSBI/SBT
   - Wean sedation as tolerated
   Leukocytosis: Increased today. Currently treating pneumonia with broad
   abx. U/A on admit inconclusive for infection. Not on steroids.
   - Add differential
   - Recheck U/A with Ucx; check C. diff
   - Cont above abx
   Hypotension: Baseline unknown. Concern for sepsis in setting of
   infection; may have contribution from propofol used for sedation. Did
   not require pressors. Currently stable on maintenance fluids with
   improved UOP.
   - consider switching to fentanyl/versed if persistent hypotension
   - antibiotics as above for pneumonia
   - goal MAP >60, UOP >30 cc/h
   Anion gap: Elevated at 15. Lactate elevated on admission but had
   trended down when rechecked. Tox screens positive only for methadone
   and benzos. [**Month (only) 11**] have ketosis from poor po intake.
   - Check lactate with next ABG
   - Recheck U/A
   - Cont maintenance fluids and tube feeds
   Pericardial effusion: Small without evidence of tamponade on TTE.
   Thyroid disorder: Per OSH report, may have hypothyroidism; rx for
   armourthyroid last filled in [**12-12**]. Unclear if pt taking medications for
   this. TSH markedly elevated.
   - Check free T4
   - start levothyroxine IV
   Constipation: No BM since admit
   - increase bowel regimen
   Increased lethargy/altered mental status: Presenting complaint to OSH.
   Given positive toxicology screen for opiates and methadone also
   concerning for overdose versus medication effect. [**Month (only) 11**] also be related
   to known bipolar disorder, reportedly poorly controlled. No known
   seizure disorder.
   - likely hypothyroidism contributing
   - Reassess neuro status as wean sedation
   - Restarted on home topiramate, divalproex,
   - Hold seroquel for now
   - Holding home clonazepam while on sedation
   - Holding home zolpidem

","The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who presented to the emergency department with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was intubated and found to have left lung collapse. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, leukocytosis, hypotension, anion gap metabolic acidosis, pericardial effusion, thyroid disorder, constipation, and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's left lung collapse indicates a significant respiratory issue. If not properly managed, this can lead to further lung complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's increased white blood cell count suggests an infection. If left untreated or not appropriately managed, it can progress into a severe infection or sepsis.

3. Hypotension: The patient's baseline unknown hypotension, along with the possibility of sepsis, may require further investigation and intervention to maintain adequate blood pressure and prevent organ dysfunction.

4. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The elevated anion gap suggests an underlying metabolic disorder. If not addressed, it can lead to further acidosis and potential organ damage.

5. Pericardial effusion: Although currently without evidence of tamponade, a small pericardial effusion can become more significant and potentially lead to cardiac tampon"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have left lung collapse. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to left lung atelectasis/collapse, likely secondary to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative pneumonia. She has also been found to have a pericardial effusion, elevated anion gap, elevated lactate levels, and a positive toxicology screen for methadone and benzodiazepines. She is currently being treated for pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and her sedation is being weaned as tolerated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's left lung collapse may lead to ongoing respiratory failure if not adequately treated.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's extensive consolidative pneumonia requires ongoing monitoring and treatment to prevent worsening or development of complications such as sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's baseline unknown hypotension, possibly related to sepsis or propofol use, should be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
4. Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The elevated anion gap indicates a disturbance in acid-base balance, which needs further investigation and management.
5. Lactate Elevation: The elevated lactate levels suggest tissue hypoperfusion or poor oxygen utilization, requiring ongoing monitoring and"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who presented to the emergency department with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was intubated and found to have left lung collapse.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's left lung white-out on chest imaging indicates left lung atelectasis/collapse. This is likely secondary to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative pneumonia. No obstructive lesion on bronchoscopy was found, suggesting community-acquired pneumonia rather than aspiration or healthcare-associated pneumonia. Broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated pending further microbiological and clinical history data.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased today, which could indicate an ongoing infection. The current treatment for pneumonia with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued. A repeat differential count and urinalysis should be performed, along with a urine culture to check for Clostridium difficile infection.

3. Hypotension: The patient's baseline blood pressure is unknown, but she may have sepsis-related hypotension. Her current stable condition on maintenance fluids with improved urine output suggests that the hypotension is being managed appropriately. However, consideration should be given to switching sedation from propofol to fentanyl/versed if persistent hypotension is observed. The goal mean arterial pressure should be maintained above"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of depression and overdose, as well as profound hypothyroidism, which may be related to myxedema. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and has been started on IV levothyroxine for possible myxedema. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 75-86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient has diminished breath sounds on the left lateral side and trace bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal kidney and liver function. The patient's imaging shows ETT placed 5.1 cm above the carina with atelectasis in the left upper and lower lobes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's current mechanical ventilation and presence of atelectasis, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should closely monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider performing a bronchoscopy for secretion clearance before considering extubation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate level and"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo female with h/o bipolar d/o, hypothyroidism who presented to OSH
   with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and found to have left lung collapse.
   Respiratory failure: Left lung white-out on chest imaging c/w left lung
   atelectasis/collapse. Likely secondary to mucous plugging from
   extensive consolidative pneumonia with MSSA+ sputum cx. No obstructive
   lesion on bronch. Partial re-expansion s/p bronch x 2 with persistent
   left mid-lung infiltrate.
   - continue zosyn
   - d/c levofloxacin and vancomycin
   - f/u pending cx cultures
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily wake-up and SBT
   - will re bronch today to assess airway
   Leukocytosis: Pt febrile overnight although WBC now improving.
   Currently treating pneumonia with concern for complicated PNA or
   parapneumonic effusion. Repeat U/A unremarkable; Ucx pending. Not on
   steroids. Ddx includes seizure.
   - Cont to trend WBC and temp curve
   - Abx as above pending sputum, blood, and urine cx data
   - Consider EEG
   Altered mental status: Presenting complaint to OSH with limited
   response off sedation. CT head negative. Likely hypothyroidism
   contributing with possibility of myxedema coma; h/o poor control. Given
   positive toxicology screen for opiates and methadone, concern for
   overdose versus medication effect. [**Month (only) 11**] also be related to known bipolar
   disorder, reportedly poorly controlled. No known seizure disorder.
   - Appreciate endo recs; given loading dose of levothyroxine 300mcg and
   to cont on 75mcg daily
   - Cont home topiramate, divalproex; holding seroquel, clonazepam, and
   zolpidem for now
   - Consider EEG
   - Reassess neuro status daily off propofol
   Hypothyroidism: Poorly controlled with widely fluctuating TSH on review
   of past med records.
   - Cont levothyroxine 75mcg
   - F/u cortisol level to assess adrenal axis
   - F/u endo recs
   Bipolar disorder: Cont home topiramate, divalproex; holding seroquel
   and clonazepam for now
   Hypotension: Baseline unknown. Concern for sepsis in setting of
   infection but MAPs stably above goal off pressors with likely
   contribution from used for sedation.
   - antibiotics as above for pneumonia
   - goal MAP >60, UOP >30 cc/h
   Anion gap: Stable at 13 today. Lactate elevated on admission but had
   trended down when rechecked. Tox screens positive only for methadone
   and benzos. [**Month (only) 11**] have ketosis from poor po intake.
   - Cont maintenance fluids
   - holding tube feeds pending bronchoscopy but will restart afterwards
   Pericardial effusion: Small without evidence of tamponade on TTE.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who presented to the emergency department with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was intubated and found to have a left lung collapse. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative pneumonia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) positive sputum culture. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the extensive pneumonia with MSSA infection causing mucous plugging and left lung collapse. Continued treatment with antibiotics and bronchoscopic interventions may be necessary to manage this condition.

2. Complicated Pneumonia or Parapneumonic Effusion: The patient is currently being treated for pneumonia with concerns for complicated pneumonia or parapneumonic effusion. Repeat urinalysis is unremarkable, and urine culture is pending. The differential diagnosis includes seizure due to altered mental status.

3. Seizure: The patient's altered mental status could be related to a seizure. An EEG should be considered to assess the possibility of seizure activity. The patient is on multiple medications that may contribute to altered mental status or seizure risk, including topiramate and divalproex.

4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has poorly controlled hypothyroidism, which may contribute to her altered mental status. Levothy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, and poor control of her thyroid medication. She presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. Imaging revealed left lung collapse, likely due to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative pneumonia with MSSA-positive sputum culture. She has been treated with antibiotics for the pneumonia and is now showing signs of improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, which required intubation. The left lung collapse could lead to further respiratory compromise if not adequately managed.
2. Pneumonia complications: With extensive consolidative pneumonia, there is a risk of developing complications such as parapneumonic effusion or abscess. A CT torso has been ordered to assess for these complications.
3. Sepsis: Given the fever and elevated white blood cell count, there is a concern for sepsis secondary to the ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and continued aggressive management of the pneumonia are essential.
4. Myxedema coma: The patient's altered mental status could be related to poorly controlled hypothyroidism, raising concerns for myxedema coma. She has been started on levothyroxine, but close monitoring of her neurologic status and further evaluation for possible overdose are necessary.
5. Bipolar disorder exacerbation: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, who presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have left lung collapse. The patient has been diagnosed with extensive consolidative pneumonia and is now growing Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to oxacillin. Partial re-expansion occurred after bronchoscopy, but persistent left mid-lung infiltrate remains. The patient's leukocytosis is increasing, although she remains afebrile. There is a concern for complicated pneumonia versus parapneumonic effusion. She is being treated with antibiotics and will undergo further investigations to confirm the diagnosis.

The patient also has altered mental status, which may be related to hypothyroidism, medication effect, or possible overdose. An EEG is planned to assess for seizure activity. Her hypothyroidism is poorly controlled, and she has been started on levothyroxine. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is currently on topiramate and divalproex. Clonazepam and seroquel have been held.

Other concerns include hypotension, anion gap, pericardial effusion, and constipation. The patient's blood cultures and sputum cultures are pending. She will undergo bronchoscopy to assess the airway and restart tube feeds after the procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Complicated pneumonia: The patient's leukocytosis and persistent lung infiltrate raise concerns about complicated pneumonia. Further investigations, such as bronchoscopy and culture results, will help confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

2. Parapneumonic effusion: Given the presence of pneumonia, there is also a possibility of a parapneumonic effusion. This can lead to pleural effusion and potentially respiratory compromise if not managed appropriately.

3. Overdose: The positive toxicology screen for opiates and methadone raises concerns about possible overdose contributing to the altered mental status. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

4. Seizure: The altered mental status and history of bipolar disorder raise concerns about seizure activity. An EEG is planned to assess for seizure activity.

5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's poorly controlled hypothyroidism may contribute to the altered mental status and respiratory failure. Ongoing management with levothyroxine is important to improve her thyroid function.

6. Constipation: The patient has not had a bowel movement since admission, indicating the need for increased bowel regimen to prevent constipation.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information may be required to fully assess the patient's condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, who presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have left lung collapse. The patient's condition is likely secondary to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative pneumonia with MSSA+ sputum culture. She has been treated with antibiotics, bronchoscopy, and continues to receive ventilatory support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation. There is a possibility of continued respiratory failure due to the extensive consolidative pneumonia with MSSA+ sputum culture.
2. Pneumonia Complications: The patient's pneumonia could progress to complicated pneumonia or parapneumonic effusion. Monitoring for worsening symptoms such as increased fever, leukocytosis, and worsening lung infiltrates on imaging would be important.
3. Sepsis: Given the presence of infection, the patient is at risk for developing sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, particularly temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate, is crucial. Serial lactate levels should be checked to assess for tissue perfusion.
4. Myxedema Coma: The patient has a history of poorly controlled hypothyroidism, which can contribute to altered mental status. Considering her toxicology screen positive for opiates and methad"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The cause is likely to be community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), or aspiration with mucous plugging. The patient is currently stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but still has an equivocal cough and mental status that precludes extubation. Bronchoscopies have been performed, revealing significant plugging.
- Antibiotic coverage has been initiated with piperacillin-tazobactam (pip-tazo) due to the presence of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in the bronchial aspirate.
- The patient has developed fever and leukocytosis with abdominal pain today. Liver function tests (LFTs) and amylase/lipase levels are being trended, and a CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast is planned.
- A pericardial effusion was noted on the CT scan, but there is no evidence of pulsus paradoxus on examination. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) without evidence of tamponade has been performed.
- The patient is also showing signs of obtundation. Polypharmacy is noted on the patient's history obtained from the boyfriend, along with a history of overdose."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with respiratory failure due to left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F (38.8°C), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/59 mmHg to 120/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator.

The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, for which levothyroxine has been administered. There is also a concern for possible myxedema due to profound hypothyroidism, which may contribute to the obtundation observed in the patient.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with white blood cell count ranging from 11.3 to 23.5 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The microbiology report indicates methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in the bronchial aspirate obtained on [**6-10**], while the aspirate from [**6-12**] is pending.

The patient's imaging studies include an unchanged chest X-ray from the previous day and a kidney"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism.
- She presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation.
- Imaging showed left lung collapse, likely secondary to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative pneumonia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) positive sputum culture.
- She has been treated with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for MSSA pneumonia.
- The patient's leukocytosis is improving, and she is afebrile overnight.
- There are small pleural effusions bilaterally and a moderate pericardial effusion on CT scan.
- She has abdominal pain on exam and has not had a bowel movement since admission.
- Her altered mental status is likely due to hypothyroidism, but also consider medication effect or overdose, given positive toxicology screen for opiates and methadone.
- The patient has a history of poorly controlled bipolar disorder.
- Other issues include decreased bicarbonate levels (improved), hypotension (resolved), constipation (no bowel movement since admission), and pericardial effusion (without tamponade).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, which required intubation. She had left lung collapse due to"

","The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, who presented to the emergency department with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation. She was found to have left lung collapse. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative pneumonia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) positive sputum culture. 

The patient also has a large bowel obstruction/constipation, as evidenced by a CT scan showing significant stool in the cecum and dilated loops of large and small bowel. She has been given a bowel regimen that was unsuccessful, and a rectal exam and attempt at disimpaction are planned. 

Additionally, the patient has altered mental status, which may be related to hypothyroidism, bipolar disorder, or medication overdose. She has been started on levothyroxine supplementation and her thyroid function tests will be monitored biweekly. 

The patient has decreased serum bicarbonate levels, indicating acidosis. This may be due to starvation ketosis and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (NS). 

The patient has a moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade on echocardiogram. 

The patient's blood cultures have shown no growth to date. 

The patient is currently receiving aggressive bowel regimen, but without success. She vomited 200 cc yellow fluid and is on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, and previous presentation to the emergency department with lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have left lung collapse. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, pneumonia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), leukocytosis, altered mental status, hypothyroidism, and pericardial effusion. The patient's current condition includes decreased serum bicarbonate, decreased urine output, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if not adequately supported with mechanical ventilation and weaning efforts fail.
2. Pneumonia Complications: The patient's pneumonia could lead to complications such as abscess formation or a parapneumonic effusion if not appropriately managed with antibiotics.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate a worsening infection or could be due to the stress response to critical illness. Monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be related to hypothyroidism, medication effects, or potential overdose. Further evaluation, including repeat neurologic assessments and potentially an EEG, is needed.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's poorly controlled hypothyroidism needs to be addressed with appropriate medication"

   Altered mental status: Presenting complaint to OSH with limited
   response off sedation. CT head negative. Likely hypothyroidism
   contributing with possibility of myxedema coma; h/o poor control. Given
   positive toxicology screen for opiates and methadone, concern for
   overdose versus medication effect. [**Month (only) 11**] also be related to known bipolar

","The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who presented to the emergency department with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have left lung collapse. 

Respiratory failure: The patient has extensive consolidative pneumonia with MSSA+ sputum culture. She has partial re-expansion after bronchoscopic treatment but still has persistent left mid-lung infiltrate. The plan is to continue zosyn for MSSA, follow-up pending culture results, wean off the ventilator as tolerated with daily wake-up and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), and obtain a CT torso today to assess for abscess or effusion.

Leukocytosis: The patient was febrile overnight, although her white blood cell count is improving. She is being treated for pneumonia with concern for complicated pneumonia or parapneumonic effusion. Repeat urinalysis is unremarkable, and urine culture is pending. The differential diagnosis includes seizure. 

Abdominal pain: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain on examination today. She has a history of poorly controlled bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, and schizophrenia. There is no known seizure disorder.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism. She presented to the emergency department with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She was found to have left lung collapse, and the cause of her respiratory failure is still uncertain, with possibilities including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), or aspiration with mucous plugging. She is currently stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but has an equivocal cough and mental status that precludes extubation. A therapeutic bronchoscopy may be needed soon due to significant plugging. She is receiving antibiotic coverage with piperacillin/tazobactam for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Blood and bronchial cultures are pending.

The patient also has constipation/bowel obstruction, which has been refractory to an aggressive bowel regimen. Methylnaltrexone and disimpaction will be attempted today. If refractory, a gastroenterology evaluation may be sought. Nasogastric (NG) decompression has been initiated, and she is currently on nothing by mouth (npo). Her medications will be changed to intravenous (IV) form.

The patient is obtunded, likely due to polypharmacy noted on her history obtained from her boyfriend and a history of overdose. Additionally, her profound hypothyroidism, possibly exacerbated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have left lung collapse. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated for possible community-acquired pneumonia, healthcare-associated pneumonia, or aspiration with mucous plugging. Antibiotic coverage with piperacillin/tazobactam has been initiated for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Blood and bronchial samples have been sent for culture.

The patient is also experiencing constipation/bowel obstruction, which has been refractory to aggressive bowel regimens. Methyl naltrexone and disimpaction will be attempted today. If refractory, a gastrointestinal consult may be considered. Nasogastric decompression has been initiated. The patient's obtundation is attributed to polypharmacy and a history of overdose, as well as profound hypothyroidism, which may be exacerbated by myxedema. IV levothyroxine will be administered, and TSH levels will be monitored. Mood stabilizers will be held, and sedatives such as Seroquel, Ambien, and Klonopin will also be held.

The patient's imaging studies show dense left lower lobe (LLL) consolidation, right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrate, atelectasis,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The attending physician reviewed the patient's progress and agrees with the ICU resident's assessment and plan. The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics (levofloxacin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam), sedatives (propofol), anticoagulants (heparin), and others for conditions such as constipation, bowel obstruction, obtundation, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/73 to 88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight has increased from 55 kg on admission to 59.1 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,451 mL (1,425 mL IVF) and output of 3,305 mL (1,325 mL urine). The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation support with FiO2 at 40%.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit (Hct), while platelet count (Plt) is within normal range. Blood glucose levels have been well-controlled. Other lab values, including"

[**2167-6-14**] Abd xray: The NG tube tip is in the stomach. There is diffuse dilatation
 of the large bowel up to 6 cm, finding that appears to be grossly unchanged or
slightly worse than the prior CT torso and definitely more pronounced compared t

 with ileus although note is made that no small-bowel obstruction is present. Th

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo female with h/o bipolar d/o, hypothyroidism who presented to OSH
   with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and found to have left lung collapse.
   Respiratory failure: Left lung atelectasis/collapse likely secondary to
   mucous plugging from extensive consolidative MSSA pneumonia with some
   reexpansion s/p bronch x 2. No obstructive lesion on bronch.
   - continue zosyn for MSSA
   - f/u pending cultures
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily wake-up and SBT
   Large [**Last Name (un) 6584**] ileus/constipation: Given dose of methylnaltraxone and
   placed on bowel rest with OGT to wall suction yesterday with decreased
   output. Manual disimpaction attempted with no stool or mass palpated;
   has had some output of mucous. Large bowel appears less dilated on AM
   KUB.
   - cont OGT to suction
   - reattempt manual disimpaction today
   - cont to hold tube feeds and PO medications pending BM
   - given improvement in abd xray, will hold off on surgical c/s for now;
   repeat imaging in AM
   Altered mental status: Presenting complaint to OSH with limited
   response off sedation. CT head negative. Likely hypothyroidism
   contributing with possibility of myxedema coma; h/o poor control. Given
   positive toxicology screen for opiates and methadone, concern for
   overdose versus medication effect. [**Month (only) 11**] also be related to known bipolar
   disorder, reportedly poorly controlled. No known seizure disorder.

   - Topiramate on hold as no IV alternative
   - Cont valproic acid via IV
   - holding seroquel, clonazepam, and zolpidem for now
   - Consider EEG
   - Reassess neuro status daily off propofol
   Hypothyroidism: Poorly controlled with widely fluctuating TSH on review
   of past med records.
   - Cont levothyroxine 75mcg
   - biweekly thyroid function tests
   - F/u endo recs
   Bipolar disorder:  On valproic acid but holding topimax as no IV
   alternative. Holding seroquel and clonazepam for now given AMS.
   Decreased Bicarbonate: Persists. Likely both anion gap and non-anion
   gap acidosis with etiologies of starvation ketosis and NS
   (hyperchloremic).  Does not have large GI losses
   - Change maint fluids to LR today and recheck lytes in PM
   Pericardial Effusion:  Appears larger on chest CT, but recent
   echocardiogram without evidence of tamponade.  Low threshold for repeat
   echocardiogram if signs of tamponade including tachycardia, hypotension

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, and previous presentations to the hospital for increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and found to have left lung collapse.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure with left lung atelectasis/collapse likely secondary to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative MSSA pneumonia. There is no obstructive lesion on bronch. The patient is being treated with zosyn for MSSA, and cultures are pending. Weaning of the ventilator is planned as tolerated with daily wake-up and spontaneous breathing test (SBT).

The patient also has a large bowel ileus/constipation. A dose of methylnaltrexone was given, and the patient is on bowel rest with an orogastric tube to wall suction. Manual disimpaction was attempted but unsuccessful. The large bowel appears less dilated on the morning kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) x-ray. The plan is to continue OGT to suction, reattempt manual disimpaction today, and hold tube feeds and PO medications pending bowel movement (BM).

Additionally, the patient has altered mental status, which may be related to hypothyroidism contributing to the possibility of myxedema coma. The patient has a positive toxicology screen for opiates and methadone, raising concerns for overdose versus medication effect. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, presenting to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was intubated due to left lung collapse. The patient has been diagnosed with MSSA pneumonia, large bowel ileus/constipation, altered mental status, hypothyroidism, bipolar disorder, decreased bicarbonate levels, and pericardial effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative MSSA pneumonia. Continued weaning of the ventilator as tolerated with daily wake-up and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) should be considered.
2. Large bowel ileus/constipation: The patient has been given a dose of methylnaltrexone and placed on bowel rest with orogastric tube (OGT) to wall suction. Manual disimpaction will be attempted today. Holding tube feeds and PO medications pending bowel movement (BM) is recommended.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has limited response off sedation, and CT head is negative. Hypothyroidism might be contributing to the altered mental status, possibly leading to myxedema coma. Positive toxicology screen for opiates and methadone raises concerns for overdose versus medication effect. Bipolar disorder could also be related to known poor control. Endocrine recommendations should be appreciated, and a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, and MSSA pneumonia who presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have left lung collapse. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to left lung atelectasis/collapse secondary to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative MSSA pneumonia. She is currently on antibiotics for MSSA, and bronchoscopic evaluation has been planned. 

The patient also has large bowel ileus/constipation, for which she has been given methylnaltrexone and placed on bowel rest with ongoing tube to wall suction. Manual disimpaction was attempted without success, and enema has been planned. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to hypothyroidism contributing to myxedema coma, along with a positive toxicology screen for opiates and methadone. There is a concern for overdose versus medication effect, and bipolar disorder may also be related. The patient's thyroid function tests are being biweekly monitored, and levothyroxine has been started at a dose of 75mcg.

The patient has anion-gap and non-gap acidosis, with gradually rising sodium and chloride levels, dropping potassium, and bicarbonate. Hypotonic saline has been administered despite the rise in sodium levels. Anion-gap metabolic acidosis is suspected, and a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. The patient has a history of ileus, large bowel obstruction, and agitation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving propofol for sedation. The patient has a PICC line in place, and all medications are being administered through IV. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 111/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's recent labs show leukocytosis, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and elevated BUN and creatinine levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently low. The patient has been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, psychiatric disease, respiratory failure, pericardial effusion, and hypotension. The patient's abdominal pain appears to have improved, but the patient remains uncomfortable and agitated. The patient's respiratory status is stable on mechanical ventilation. The patient is NPO and receiving IV fluids and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation, there is a potential risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-associated lung injury.
2. Infection: The patient's leukoc"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have ileus on KUB without small bowel obstruction. The patient has been started on strict NPO and IV valproate due to evidence of ileus. A PICC line was placed on 06/14/2167 at 10:00 AM. The patient also received methylnaltrexone for large bowel obstruction and an OG tube was placed on suction. Manual disimpaction was attempted but no stool was present in the vault, and no obvious mass was felt. Propofol has been continued for agitation, and the patient remains intubated as they are not following commands. TSH and free T4 levels can be measured weekly per endocrine. The patient appeared to be in pain, so a small fentanyl bolus was given with good effect. The patient's KUB appears improved this morning. The patient has no known drug allergies. Last doses of antibiotics were given on 06/12/2167 and 06/15/2167. The patient is currently on several medications including propofol, famotidine, heparin sodium, and fentanyl. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory parameters is necessary to ensure adequate ventilation"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo female with h/o bipolar d/o, hypothyroidism who presented to OSH
   with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and found to have left lung collapse.
   Respiratory failure: Left lung white-out on chest imaging c/w left lung
   atelectasis/collapse. Likely secondary to mucous plugging from
   extensive consolidative pneumonia with MSSA+ sputum cx. No obstructive
   lesion on bronch. Partial re-expansion s/p bronch x 2 with persistent
   left mid-lung infiltrate. CT yesterday without large effusion and mild
   improvement in left sided infiltrate.
   - continue zosyn for MSSA
   - f/u pending cx cultures
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily wake-up and SBT
   Large Bowel Obstruction/Constipation:  CT torso yesterday with
   significant stool in the cecum.  Overnight bowel regimen unsuccessful.
   Per nursing overnight unusual mass in the rectal vault, didn
t feel
   like stool.  KUB this morning significantly worse with dilated loops of
   large and small bowel.  Will need rectal exam today and attempt at
   disimpaction.
   - no effect of bowel regimen
   - will try methylnaltrexone
   - rectal exam and attempt at disimpaction
   - NGT to suction
   - no PO medications
   - hold tube feeds
   - will consider surgical consult if ineffective at the above
   Altered mental status: Presenting complaint to OSH with limited
   response off sedation. CT head negative. Likely hypothyroidism
   contributing with possibility of myxedema coma; h/o poor control. Given
   positive toxicology screen for opiates and methadone, concern for
   overdose versus medication effect. [**Month (only) 11**] also be related to known bipolar
   disorder, reportedly poorly controlled. No known seizure disorder.
   - Appreciate endo recs; given loading dose of levothyroxine 300mcg
   [**2167-6-11**] and to cont on 75mcg daily
   - Currently home topiramate and divalproex are on hold, will discuss
   with pharmacy if there are IV alternatives
   - holding seroquel, clonazepam, and zolpidem for now
   - Consider EEG
   - Reassess neuro status daily off propofol
   Hypothyroidism: Poorly controlled with widely fluctuating TSH on review
   of past med records.
   - Cont levothyroxine 75mcg
   - biweekly thyroid function tests
   - F/u endo recs
   Bipolar disorder:  All meds on hold for now given large bowel
   obstruction.  Will discuss with pharmacy whether IV alternatives are
   available.  Holding seroquel and clonazepam for now.
   Decreased Bicarbonate:  Improved.  Likely both anion gap and non-anion
   gap acidosis. Likely etiologies are starvation ketosis and NS.
   - VBG
   - D5
 NS for today
   Pericardial Effusion:  Appears larger on chest CT, but recent
   echocardiogram without evidence of tamponade.  Low threshold for repeat
   echocardiogram if signs of tamponade including tachycardia, hypotension
   and elevated pulsus.
   - monitor for now
   Hypotension: Baseline unknown. Now resolved, never required pressors.
   Pericardial effusion: Moderate on repeat CT.  Without evidence of
   tamponade on TTE.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's presentation with hypoxemic respiratory failure and left lung collapse indicates a risk of further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening lung collapse.
2. Large Bowel Obstruction/Constipation: The presence of significant stool in the cecum, dilated loops of large and small bowel, and an unusual mass in the rectal vault suggest a potential for worsening constipation and bowel obstruction.
3. Hypothyroidism: Poorly controlled hypothyroidism"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have a left lung collapse. The patient's condition is likely due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), or aspiration with mucous plugging. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is expected to be extubated within the next 24 hours, pending improvement in her gastrointestinal issues.

The patient's other medical conditions include constipation/bowel obstruction, obtundation, and metabolic acidosis (both gap and nongap). Her obtundation is attributed to polypharmacy, a history of overdose, profound hypothyroidism, and possible myxedema. Treatment for her constipation/bowel obstruction involves aggressive bowel regimen, enema, and suppositories. She will also receive IV levothyroxine and have her TSH monitored.

The patient's metabolic acidosis is being managed by repeating a venous blood gas (VBG) today and continuing fluid repletion with D5 1/2 NS.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/80 mmHg to 145/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28"

   Hypoxemic respiratory failure: likely CAP vs HAP vs aspiration with
   mucous plugging.
   -transitioned to PSV and stable; plan for extubation in next 24h. would
   like GI issues to trend to improvement first
   -plan on bronch today to clear
   -mental status much clearer
   -ABX coverage w/  pip-tazo given MSSA, full course
   -f/u blood and bronch sample cx
   Constipation/bowel obstruction: slowly improving
   -cont aggressive bowel regimen, enema and suppositories today
   -NG decompression from above, npo for now, change meds to IV
   Obtundation: polypharmacy noted on history obtained from boyfriend and
   history of overdose, also w/ profound hypothyroidism, poss myxedema?,
   exacerbated by constipation. improved today
   -IV levothyroxine and monitor TSH as per Endocrine svce
   -on mood stabilizers; will hold Seroquel and other possible sedatives
   (Ambien and Klonopin)
   -daily wakeup
   Met acidosis (gap and nongap)-
   -repeat VBG today

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, who presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have left lung collapse.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's condition is likely due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), or aspiration with mucous plugging. The respiratory support and ABG analysis should be closely monitored to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Constipation/Bowel obstruction: The patient is experiencing constipation, which has led to bowel obstruction. Aggressive bowel regimens, enema, and suppositories will be used to alleviate the issue. NG decompression and NPO status will be implemented as well.

3. Obtundation: The patient exhibits obtundation, which can be attributed to polypharmacy, history of overdose, profound hypothyroidism (myxedema), and constipation. IV levothyroxine will be administered, and mood stabilizers will be reviewed and adjusted accordingly.

4. Met acidosis: The patient has both gap and nongap metabolic acidosis. Repeat VBG today will help monitor the acid-base balance, and D5 1/2 NS will be given for fluid repletion.

5. Infection control: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo female with h/o bipolar d/o, hypothyroidism who presented to OSH
   with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and found to have left lung collapse.
   Respiratory failure: Left lung atelectasis/collapse likely secondary to
   mucous plugging from extensive consolidative MSSA pneumonia with some
   reexpansion s/p bronch x 3; no obstructive lesion seen.
   - continue zosyn for MSSA
   - f/u pending cultures
   - possible extubation today pending management of ileus
   Large bowel ileus/constipation: Persistent ileus despite
   methylnaltrexone, aggressive bowel regimen including multiple enemas
   and Mg citrate, and multiple attempts at manual disimpaction. No
   gastric output from OGT to wall suction.
   - cont OGT to suction
   - trial of IV erythromycin
   - reattempt manual disimpaction
   - cont to hold tube feeds and PO medications pending BM
   - AM portable abd X-ray
   Altered mental status: Presenting complaint to OSH with limited
   response off sedation. CT head negative. Likely hypothyroidism
   contributing with possibility of myxedema coma; h/o poor control. Given
   positive toxicology screen for opiates and methadone, concern for

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have left lung collapse. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative MSSA pneumonia. She is currently on zosyn for MSSA and awaiting culture results. The patient also has a large bowel ileus/constipation, which has not improved despite aggressive bowel regimen and attempts at manual disimpaction. Her altered mental status is likely due to hypothyroidism contributing to myxedema coma, but there is also concern for overdose or polypharmacy effect. Neuro status is improving on daily wake-ups. The patient has anion-gap and non-gap acidosis, which is being managed with D5NS with 40 mEq K at 100/hr. She also has hypothyroidism, bipolar disorder, and a pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition via IVF, holding tube feeds, and monitoring for signs of tamponade.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's left lung collapse and extensive consolidative MSSA pneumonia pose a risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. Large Bowel Ileus/Constipation: The patient's persistent ileus despite aggressive bowel regimen and attempts at manual dis"

The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, who presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation. She was found to have left lung collapse due to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative MSSA pneumonia. The patient also has large bowel ileus/constipation, altered mental status, anion-gap and non-gap acidosis, hypothyroidism, bipolar disorder, and a pericardial effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's left lung collapse could lead to further respiratory distress and failure if not properly managed.
2. MSSA pneumonia: The patient has an extensive consolidative MSSA pneumonia, which can worsen and cause sepsis if not treated effectively.
3. Large bowel ileus/constipation: The patient's bowel ileus/constipation may progress to complete bowel obstruction, leading to complications such as bowel necrosis or perforation.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be a result of various factors including hypothyroidism, medication effects, or possible overdose. Monitoring and addressing the underlying cause is crucial to prevent further deterioration.
5. Anion-gap and non-gap acidosis: The patient's acidosis needs to be managed carefully to avoid complications associated with imbalances in electrolytes and pH levels.

   43 yo female with h/o bipolar d/o, hypothyroidism who presented to OSH
   with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and found to have left lung collapse.
   Respiratory failure: Left lung atelectasis/collapse likely secondary to
   mucous plugging from extensive consolidative MSSA pneumonia with some
   reexpansion s/p bronch x 2. No obstructive lesion on bronch.
   - continue zosyn for MSSA
   - f/u pending cultures
   - Wean vent as tolerated with daily wake-up and SBT
   - re-bronch today
   Large bowel ileus/constipation: Given dose of methylnaltraxone and
   placed on bowel rest with OGT to wall suction yesterday with decreased
   output. Manual disimpaction attempted with no stool or mass palpated;
   has had some output of mucous. Large bowel appears less dilated on AM
   KUB.
   - cont OGT to suction
   - enema today
   - cont to hold tube feeds and PO medications pending BM
   - given improvement in abd xray, will hold off on surgical c/s for now;
   repeat imaging in AM
   - Am portable abd X-ray
   Altered mental status: Presenting complaint to OSH with limited
   response off sedation. CT head negative. Likely hypothyroidism
   contributing with possibility of myxedema coma; h/o poor control. Given
   positive toxicology screen for opiates and methadone, concern for
   overdose versus medication effect. [**Month (only) 11**] also be related to known bipolar
   disorder, reportedly poorly controlled. No known seizure disorder.
   - Appreciate endo recs; given loading dose of levothyroxine 300mcg
   [**2167-6-11**] and to cont on 75mcg daily
   - Topiramate on hold as no IV alternative
   - Cont valproic acid via IV
   - holding seroquel, clonazepam, and zolpidem for now
   - Consider EEG
   - Reassess neuro status daily off propofol
   Anion-gap and non-gap acidosis: Patinet has had Na and Cl gradually
   trending up over the past several days.   Also has dropped her
   potassium and bicarb She has been getting hypotonic saline despite this
   rise.
   - Check VBG
   - continue D5
 NS at 100/hr
   - psyche meds may contribute with IV Valproate
   - replete lytes as needed
   Hypothyroidism: Poorly controlled with widely fluctuating TSH on review
   of past med records.
   - Cont levothyroxine 75mcg
   - biweekly thyroid function tests
   - F/u endo recs
   Bipolar disorder:  On valproic acid but holding topimax as no IV
   alternative. Holding seroquel and clonazepam for now given AMS.
   Pericardial Effusion:  Appears larger on chest CT, but recent
   echocardiogram without evidence of tamponade.  Low threshold for repeat
   echocardiogram if signs of tamponade including tachycardia, hypotension
   and elevated pulsus.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She was found to have left lung collapse, likely due to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative MSSA pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. 

The patient's large bowel is experiencing ileus/constipation, and manual disimpaction was attempted without success. She is being kept on bowel rest with aggressive bowel regimen and enemas. 

The patient also has altered mental status, which may be related to hypothyroidism, medication overdose, or bipolar disorder. She is being treated with levothyroxine and valproic acid. 

The patient has anion-gap and non-gap acidosis, with gradually rising sodium and chloride levels. Her potassium and bicarbonate levels are low. She is receiving hypotonic saline despite this rise. 

The patient has a history of poorly controlled hypothyroidism and bipolar disorder. She is currently on levothyroxine and valproic acid, but some medications have been held due to altered mental status. 

The patient has a pericardial effusion, which appears larger on chest CT, but recent echocardiogram shows no evidence of tamponade. 

The patient is receiving IV fluids, holding tube feeds, and is on prophylactic heparin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She was intubated and found to have left lung collapse. The patient has been diagnosed with MSSA pneumonia and is being treated with zosyn. She also has a large bowel ileus/constipation, altered mental status, anion-gap and non-gap acidosis, hypothyroidism, and a pericardial effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of hypoxemic respiratory failure and left lung collapse may indicate ongoing respiratory complications. Monitoring and managing her respiratory status, including weaning off the ventilator and ensuring adequate oxygenation, will be crucial.
2. Infection: MSSA pneumonia has been identified, and the patient is currently being treated with antibiotics. It is important to monitor her response to the treatment and watch for any signs of worsening infection or development of antibiotic resistance.
3. Ileus: The patient's large bowel ileus/constipation has persisted despite aggressive bowel regimens. It is essential to continue monitoring her bowel movements and managing her ileus to prevent further complications such as bowel perforation or necrosis.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be related to hypothyroidism, medication effects, or a combination of factors. Close monitoring of her neurological status,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She was found to have a left lung collapse and is suspected to have community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), or aspiration with mucous plugging. The patient has been intubated for 7 days and is currently transitioning to pressure support ventilation (PSV). The plan is to extubate her once her gastrointestinal issues resolve.

The patient also has constipation/ileus that has been refractory to repeated attempts at bowel movements, enemas, and manual disempaction. Aggressive bowel regimen, including enema and suppositories, will be continued today. The NG suction will be decreased, and the patient will be started on a per oral bowel regimen.

The patient is obtunded, possibly due to polypharmacy, history of overdose, profound hypothyroidism, and potential myxedema. This has been exacerbated by constipation. The patient is slowly improving. IV levothyroxine will be administered, and TSH/T4 levels will be monitored by the endocrine service. Mood stabilizers will be continued, but Seroquel and other possible sedatives will be held. Daily wake-up calls will be implemented.

The patient has developed metabolic acidosis (nongap) and will continue fluid repletion with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, who presented to the emergency department with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have left lung collapse. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been intubated for 7 days. She is on mechanical ventilation in CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 of 40%. Her respiratory support is stable, and there are plans for extubation once gastrointestinal issues are resolved. Antibiotic coverage with piperacillin/tazobactam was started due to suspected methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infection. Blood and bronchial samples are pending culture results. The patient has been experiencing constipation/ileus despite aggressive bowel regimens, enemas, and manual disimpaction. She also has obtundation, which may be due to polypharmacy, history of overdose, profound hypothyroidism, or myxedema. IV levothyroxine has been initiated, and mood stabilizers will be held. The patient's acidosis is being managed with fluid repletion using D5 1/2 NS. She has two central lines, a PICC line, and a 20-gauge line. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous UF heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), an H2 blocker"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 yo female with h/o bipolar d/o, hypothyroidism who presented to OSH
   with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and found to have left lung collapse.
   Respiratory failure: Left lung atelectasis/collapse likely secondary to
   mucous plugging from extensive consolidative MSSA CAP with some
   reexpansion s/p bronch x 3; no obstructive lesion seen.  Now s/p
   extubation [**6-16**].
   - continue zosyn for MSSA for 14 day course
   - f/u pending cultures
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   Large bowel ileus/constipation: Thought [**1-5**] polypharmacy. Now having
   large amount of loose stools after several days of aggressive bowel
   regimen.
   - d/c IV erythromycin, IV reglan for now
   - continue standing colace and prn senna and bisacodyl
   Altered mental status: Presenting complaint to OSH with limited
   improvement s/p extubation and off sedation. CT head negative. Likely
   hypothyroidism contributing with possibility of myxedema coma although
   picture complicated by polypharmacy (tox screen positive for opiates
   and methadone) and poorly controlled bipolar disorder. No known seizure
   disorder. Treating pneumonia.
   - Appreciate endo recs; given loading dose of levothyroxine 300mcg
   [**2167-6-11**] and to cont on 75mcg daily
   - Transition back to po valproic acid and topiramate once NG tube
   placed
   - Holding seroquel, clonazepam, and zolpidem for now
   - Cont tx for pneumonia
   Anion-gap and non-gap acidosis: Persistent increased in Cl although
   bicarb cont to improve.
   - Psych meds may contribute with IV Valproate
   - Continue D5
 NS with 40 mEq K at 100/hr for now
   - Restart tube feeds
   - Recheck PM lytes
   Hypothyroidism: Poorly controlled with widely fluctuating TSH on review
   of past med records. TFTs now improving on synthroid.
   - Cont levothyroxine 75mcg
   - Biweekly thyroid function tests (following T4)
   - F/u endo recs
   Bipolar disorder:  Restart po valproic acid and topiramate once NG tube
   placed. Holding seroquel and clonazepam for now given AMS.
   Pericardial Effusion:  [**Month (only) 11**] be related to hypothyroidism. Appears larger

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, and respiratory failure requiring intubation. She presented to the emergency department with lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure, leading to left lung collapse. She was diagnosed with MSSA pneumonia and reexpansion after bronchoscopic treatment. She underwent extubation on 06/16. 

The patient experienced a large bowel ileus/constipation, which improved with an aggressive bowel regimen. She also has altered mental status, likely related to hypothyroidism, poorly controlled bipolar disorder, and polypharmacy. A CT head was negative, and she received a loading dose of levothyroxine and will continue on 75mcg daily. 

The patient has persistent anion-gap and non-gap acidosis, and her electrolytes are being closely monitored. She has a history of hypothyroidism and is currently being treated with levothyroxine. 

There are concerns about her bipolar disorder and the need to restart valproic acid and topiramate once the nasogastric tube is placed. Seroquel and clonazepam are being held due to altered mental status. 

Additionally, the patient has a pericardial effusion, which appears larger on chest CT but without evidence of tamponade on recent echocardiogram. A low threshold for repeat echocardiogram is advised if signs of tam"

","The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She was found to have left lung collapse.

The patient has been diagnosed with extensive consolidative methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). She underwent bronchoscopy three times, and there was no obstructive lesion seen. She has now been successfully extubated.

The patient also has large bowel ileus/constipation, which improved after an aggressive bowel regimen. She is still on a bowel regimen as per the plan.

The patient's altered mental status has shown limited improvement since extubation and off sedation. A CT scan of the head was negative. The patient is being treated for pneumonia and her medications are being adjusted to address her condition.

The patient also has persistent anion-gap and non-gap acidosis. Psychiatric medications may contribute to this condition, and the patient will continue to receive D5 NS with 40 mEq K at 100/hr for now.

The patient has hypothyroidism, which is poorly controlled with widely fluctuating TSH levels. Her thyroid function tests are now improving on synthroid. The patient will continue with levothyroxine 75mcg and biweekly thyroid function tests.

   intubation and found to have left lung collapse.
   Respiratory failure: Left lung atelectasis/collapse likely secondary to
   mucous plugging from extensive consolidative MSSA pneumonia with some
   reexpansion s/p bronch x 3; no obstructive lesion seen.
   - continue zosyn for MSSA for 8 day course
   - f/u pending cultures
   - RSBI 47, minimal secretions, intermittently following commands
   - will hold on extubation until improvement in ileus
   Large bowel ileus/constipation: Persistent ileus despite
   methylnaltrexone, aggressive bowel regimen including multiple enemas
   and Mg citrate, and multiple attempts at manual disimpaction. No
   gastric output from OGT to wall suction.
   - cont OGT to suction
   - trial of IV erythromycin and IV reglan
   - continue lactulose and miralax from above
   - cont to hold tube feeds and PO medications pending BM
   - daily KUB until bowel movement
   Altered mental status: Presenting complaint to OSH with limited
   response off sedation. CT head negative. Likely hypothyroidism
   contributing with possibility of myxedema coma; h/o poor control. Given
   positive toxicology screen for opiates and methadone, concern for
   overdose versus polypharmacy effect. [**Month (only) 11**] also be related to known
   bipolar disorder, reportedly poorly controlled. No known seizure
   disorder. Neuro status improving on daily wake-ups
   - Appreciate endo recs; given loading dose of levothyroxine 300mcg
   [**2167-6-11**] and to cont on 75mcg daily
   - Cont valproic acid via IV
   - Topiramate on hold as no IV alternative
   - Holding seroquel, clonazepam, and zolpidem for now
   Anion-gap and non-gap acidosis: Improved.
   - Continue D5
 NS with 40 mEq K at 100/hr
   - Recheck PM lytes
   - Psych meds may contribute with IV Valproate
   Hypothyroidism: Poorly controlled with widely fluctuating TSH on review
   of past med records. TFTs now improving on synthroid.
   - Cont levothyroxine 75mcg
   - Biweekly thyroid function tests (following T4)
   - F/u endo recs
   Bipolar disorder:  On valproic acid but holding topimax as no IV
   alternative. Holding seroquel and clonazepam for now given AMS.
   Pericardial Effusion:  Appears larger on chest CT, but recent
   echocardiogram without evidence of tamponade.  Low threshold for repeat
   echocardiogram if signs of tamponade including tachycardia, hypotension
   and elevated pulsus.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, presenting to the OSH with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation. She has been diagnosed with left lung collapse due to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative MSSA pneumonia. She also has a large bowel ileus/constipation, altered mental status, anion-gap and non-gap acidosis, hypothyroidism, and bipolar disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to the left lung collapse and potential complications associated with pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has an extensive consolidative MSSA pneumonia. If not appropriately treated, there is a risk of worsening pneumonia and possible sepsis.
3. Large Bowel Ileus/Constipation: The patient's persistent ileus despite aggressive bowel regimen may lead to further complications such as bowel ischemia, perforation, or necrosis.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status can be attributed to various factors including hypothyroidism, polypharmacy, or potential overdose. If not addressed, it may result in worsening confusion, decreased level of consciousness, or even coma.
5. Hypothyroidism: Poorly controlled hypothyroidism can lead to life-threatening complications such as myxedema"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She was found to have left lung collapse. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to mucous plugging from extensive consolidative methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). She has undergone bronchoscopy and reexpansion of the collapsed lung. She was successfully extubated on 06/16.

The patient also has large bowel ileus/constipation, which has improved after an aggressive bowel regimen. She has an altered mental status, likely due to hypothyroidism and polypharmacy. There is a possibility of myxedema coma, although the picture is complicated by bipolar disorder. No known seizure disorder. Possible anoxic brain injury from being found down. She is being treated for pneumonia.

The patient also has persistent anion-gap and non-gap metabolic acidosis. Psychiatric medications may contribute to this condition. She is receiving D5NS with 40 mEq K at 100/hr. Her hypothyroidism is being managed with levothyroxine. Her bipolar disorder will be treated with restarted oral valproic acid and topiramate once the nasogastric tube is placed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She was found to have a left lung collapse. The patient was treated for suspected pneumonia and extubated yesterday. However, she failed the swallow evaluation this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, which required intubation. There is a possibility of recurrence if her lung condition worsens or if she develops any complications related to extubation.

2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the failed swallow evaluation, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia. The patient should be closely monitored for signs of infection and respiratory distress.

3. Constipation/ileus: The patient has a history of constipation/ileus, which is currently resolving. It is important to continue aggressive bowel regimen, enema, and suppositories to prevent further complications.

4. Obtundation: The patient's prolonged obtundation raises concerns about an underlying neurological or psychiatric insult. Further evaluation, such as a brain MRI, may be necessary if the patient does not awaken.

5. Myxedema coma: The patient is being treated for myxedema, a severe form of hypothyroidism. Close monitoring of vital signs and hormone levels is crucial to manage this condition effectively.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have a left lung collapse. The patient has been in the ICU for 7 days, intubated, and was extubated yesterday. She is currently experiencing altered mental status and failed a swallow evaluation. She has multiple comorbidities including constipation/ileus, obtundation, and hypothyroidism. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and psychiatric medications. She is also being given IV fluids and has a nasogastric tube placed for tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient was intubated for 7 days and is now extubated. She may be at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving subcutaneous unfractionated heparin for DVT prophylaxis. This indicates that there is a concern for the development of blood clots in her veins.
3. Stress ulcers: Although stress ulcer prophylaxis is not indicated for this patient, it is important to monitor for the development of stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's critical condition and prolonged bed rest.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder, hypothyroidism, and MSSA pneumonia. She presented to the hospital with lethargy and respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, large bowel ileus/constipation, hypothyroidism, bipolar disorder, anion-gap and non-gap acidosis, and pericardial effusion.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypothyroidism: The patient's poorly controlled hypothyroidism can lead to myxedema coma if not properly managed. Close monitoring of thyroid function tests and continuation of levothyroxine therapy are essential.

2. Bipolar disorder: Poorly controlled bipolar disorder can result in mood swings and cognitive impairment. Continuation of valproic acid, topiramate, lower dose provigil, and seroquel, along with follow-up psychiatric recommendations, is necessary.

3. MSSA pneumonia: The patient has extensive consolidative MSSA community-acquired pneumonia. It is important to complete the 14-day course of Zosyn for MSSA and follow up with pending cultures.

4. Large bowel ileus/constipation: The patient's polypharmacy and positive toxic screen for opiates may contribute to her large bowel ileus/constipation. Aggressive bowel regimen, including IV erythromycin and reglan,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She was found to have left lung collapse due to mucous plugging from MSSA pneumonia. The patient is now extubated and breathing comfortably on room air. She also has a large bowel ileus/constipation, possibly related to polypharmacy and positive opiate screen. The patient's mental status is altered, with limited improvement post-extubation. A CT head was negative, but hypothyroidism may be contributing to her condition, along with poorly controlled bipolar disorder. Other issues include bipolar disorder, poorly controlled hypothyroidism, anion-gap and non-gap acidosis (improving), and pericardial effusion (larger on chest CT but without evidence of tamponade on recent echocardiogram). The patient's care in the ICU includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures. Her code status is full code, and she is being considered for transfer to the floor. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient had MSSA pneumonia, which has been treated with Zosyn. However, there is a risk of antibiotic resistance or recurrence of infection.
2. Bowel Ileus/Constipation: The patient's bowel movements have been affected by polypharmacy and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has a history of psychiatric disease, including schizophrenia, as well as abdominal pain, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and alteration in nutrition. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 133/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving various medications, including famotidine, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications.

The lab results indicate low levels of free T4, but this is within an acceptable range as per the endocrinologist. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 9.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level is low at 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count is within normal range at 292 K/uL. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes are within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,467 mL since 12 AM, with a total output of 4,720 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,253 mL. The patient's respiratory support is not currently required, as they have an oxygen saturation of 99% without any supplemental oxygen.

   43 yo female with h/o bipolar d/o, hypothyroidism who presented to OSH
   with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation and found to have left lung collapse.
   Respiratory failure: Left lung atelectasis/collapse likely secondary to
   mucous plugging from extensive consolidative MSSA CAP with some
   reexpansion s/p bronch x 3; no obstructive lesion seen.  Now s/p
   extubation [**6-16**].
   - continue zosyn for MSSA for 14 day course

   Large bowel ileus/constipation: [**Month (only) 11**] have been [**1-5**] polypharmacy given
   tox screen positive for opiates and methadone on arrival. Now having
   large amount of loose stools after several days of aggressive bowel
   regimen.
   - IV erythromycin and reglan discontinued
   - continue standing colace and prn senna and bisacodyl for now bowel
   regimen
   - avoid narcotics
   - failed S&S so will need NG tube
   Altered mental status: Presenting complaint to OSH with limited
   improvement s/p extubation and off [**Month/Day (2) **]. CT head negative. Likely
   hypothyroidism contributing with possibility of myxedema coma although
   picture complicated by polypharmacy and poorly controlled bipolar
   disorder. No known seizure disorder. Possible anoxic brain injury from
   being found down.  Treating pneumonia.
   - appreciate endo recs; given loading dose of levothyroxine 300mcg
   [**2167-6-11**] and to cont on 75mcg daily
   - transition back to po valproic acid,  topiramate, and lower dose
   provigil and seroquel once NG tube placed

   - cont tx for pneumonia
   Anion-gap and non-gap acidosis: Persistent increased in Cl although
   bicarb cont to improve.
   - [**Month/Day/Year **] meds may contribute with IV Valproate
   - Continue D5
 NS with 40 mEq K at 100/hr for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who presented to the emergency department with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have a left lung collapse. The patient has been treated for MSSA pneumonia and is currently extubated. She also has large bowel ileus/constipation, altered mental status likely due to hypothyroidism and polypharmacy, anion-gap and non-gap acidosis, hypothyroidism, bipolar disorder, and pericardial effusion. The patient's current medications include levothyroxine, valproic acid, topiramate, provigil, seroquel, famotidine, heparin, and zosyn. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6 C (99.7 F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 133/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is alert and oriented but not following commands consistently. Physical examination reveals bronchial breath sounds bilaterally, regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, well-perfused extremities, and movement of extremities spontaneously but inconsistently following commands.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism who presented to the hospital with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was found to have left lung collapse. The initial assessment suggested possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), or aspiration with mucous plugging. The patient was extubated on [**6-15**] and received antibiotic coverage with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) due to MSSA. Blood and bronchial samples are being followed up for culture results. The patient's psychosis is being managed with lower doses of Seroquel and Provigil, and a psych consult has been requested. Due to a failed swallow evaluation, a nasogastric tube (NGT) has been placed for tube feeds. The rest of the plan is noted in the housestaff note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's history of hypoxemic respiratory failure and subsequent intubation puts her at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and bed rest increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin is being administered.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and prolonged bed rest can lead to stress ulcers."

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder and hypothyroidism. She presented to the emergency department with increased lethargy and hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. The patient was found to have left lung collapse and was diagnosed with possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), or aspiration with mucous plugging. She was extubated on [**6-15**]. Antibiotic coverage with piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infection, and blood and bronchial samples were sent for culture. The patient also resumed her home regimen with lower doses of Seroquel and Provigil for psychosis and had a psychiatric consultation. She failed a swallow evaluation, leading to the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT) and initiation of tube feeds. The rest of the plan is per the housestaff note. In the ICU, the patient received nutrition through tube feeds and had well-controlled blood sugar levels. She had a PICC line placed on [**2167-6-14**] and received prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. Her head of bed was elevated to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The need for restraints was reviewed, and her code status was maintained as full code. The patient"
