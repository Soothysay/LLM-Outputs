   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from
   Wegener's, presumed pulmonary [**Hospital **] transferred to the ICU for urgent
   dialysis planning. At the time of transfer he is fairly comfortable on
   2L nasal cannula.
   .
   1. Hypoxia: The patient is currently hypoxic with some dyspnea.  His
   multiple etiologies include fluid overload from renal failure,
   pulmonary mycobacterial infection and hemoptysis status post bronch.
   He is doing well on 2L nasal cannula at this time.  Concern for
   underlying tamponade physiology not likely given stat Echo today
   revealing a resolved pericardial effusion.
   - Plan for each underlying problem as below
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time
   - ABG today
   - F/U Final CXR read
   .
   2. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. New EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia versus
   rate related change.  No acute failure on Echo.
   - Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure tolerance.
   .
   3. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from
   worsening Wegener's.  Given his fluid overload causing hypoxia, the
   plan is for HD/CVVH today.
   - Correct coagulopathy
   - Obtain HD line access
   - Begin CVVH to remove large volumes.
   - Renal recs
   .
   4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is 4.0, likely from recent warfarin
   and multiple antibiotic administration given new diagnosis of TB. No
   reason to suspect worsening liver function at this time, although
   multiple meds may cause this in the future.
   - FFP to correct to 1.5 for procedures (such as lines abovE)
   - Vit K 2mg
   .
   5. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
   .
   6. Pulmonary TB: The patient has evidence of Pulmonary Mycobacterial
   infection, presumed to be TB until proven otherwise.  Cultures
   outstanding.
   - F/u further TB testing
   - Continue Rifampin, INH, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol
   - Continue B6 for liver protection.
   - respiratory isolation
   .
   7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and a supratherpeutic INR giving him multiple reasons to
   have hemoptysis.
   - Continue to monitor, correct coagulopathy.
   .
   8. Diabetes Mellitus: Continue SSI
   .
   FEN: No IVF, CVVH, NPO until line placed, then renal diet
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots while supratherapeutic

   84 year-old man with newly diagnosed Wegener
s granulomatosis, AFB on
   BAL (TB vs [**Doctor First Name **]), and bronchiectasis.  He is transferred to the ICU for
   suspicion of tamponade based on the finding of pulsus paradoxus;
   echocardiogram did not reveal pericardial effusion.  He also requires
   CVVH for worsening renal failure and Anasarca in setting of
   hypotension.
   1.       Hypoxemic resp failure. Currently 100% SpO2 on 4L NC. Expect
   to improve with CVVH but some component of hypoventilation with rapid
   shallow breathing as well as v/q mm from atelectasis. Incentive

   3.       Renal failure- CKD in addition to WG. Metabolic acidosis.
   Started CVVH this morning.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 84-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including Wegener's granulomatosis, pulmonary mycobacteria, being treated as MTB, renal failure, acidosis, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, bronchiectasis, prostate cancer, and malignant melanoma. He was transferred to the ICU for urgent dialysis and developed a pericardial effusion during his hospitalization. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, renal failure, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, Wegener's granulomatosis treatment, tuberculosis treatment, hemoptysis, and other issues mentioned in Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11683**]'s note.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with 100% SpO2 on 4L NC and has been started on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) for worsening renal failure. He also requires incentive spirometry to improve ventilation-perfusion mismatch from atelectasis.

The patient has a history of allergies to simvastatin and pravastatin, hepatic toxicity, and is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, immunosuppressants, and other medications for his various conditions.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, further deterioration of renal function, coagulopathy, infection"

   multiple etiologies include fluid overload from renal failure,
   pulmonary mycobacterial infection and hemoptysis status post bronch.

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   An 84 year old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from
   Wegener's, presumed pulmonary [**Hospital **] transferred to the ICU for urgent
   dialysis planning. At the time of transfer he is fairly comfortable on
   2L nasal cannula.
   1. Hypoxia: Pt was admitted hypoxic and dyspneic, thought to be
   multifactorial including renal failure induced volume overload,
   pulmonary TB infxn, and hemoptysis s/p bronch. Tamponade physiology was
   not [**Location (un) **] out by echo, which showed a resolving pericardial effusion.
   This morning the pt was in no distress, satting 97% on NC, and
   subjectively feeling very well.
   - Will continue CVVH per renal team to remove the gross fluid overload
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time
   - Consider daily CXR
s to assess pulmonary fluid status
   2. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from
   worsening Wegener's.  He was admitted to MICU with fluid overload
   causing hypoxia. He is on CVVH currently and renal is on board.
   - f/u Renal recs: will remove fluids as bp tolerates
   3. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. Had new EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia
   versus rate related change, and no acute failure on Echo.
   - Continue Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure
   tolerance; do not give if patient HR <100
   4. Need for anticoagulation with h/o Sick Sinus Syndrome, intermittent
   AFib and bradycardia. Was on Coumadin on admission but not currently
   on. His INR today is 1.4, down from a peak of 4.0. He will need to be
   anticoagulated given high CHADS2 score.
   - Restart Heparin gtt. Unsure whether pt will need further procedures,
   so hesitant to restart longer acting Coumadin
   - Continue to monitor coags panels.
   5. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Will need to closely watch WBC count given Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
   6. Pulmonary TB: The patient has evidence of Pulmonary Mycobacterial
   infection, presumed to be TB until proven otherwise.  Cultures
   outstanding. Per ID, if not MTB, [**Doctor First Name **] likely.
   - F/u with ID, who have been in touch with the state lab for Dx testing
   - Continue Rifampin, INH, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol
   - Continue B6 for liver protection.
   - respiratory isolation
   7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, a recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and had a supratherpeutic INR, giving him multiple reasons
   to have hemoptysis.  He has not had any since his admission to MICU.
   - Watch for hemoptysis
   - Watch coag panels as above
   8. Anemia: probably multifactorial.  Lost blood during HD placement.
   Received 2 u PRBC yesterday
   - check afternoon Hct
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   9. Diabetes Mellitus: Continue SSI
   - recalculate insulin need based on blood glucoses this afternoon
   FEN: No IVF, CVVH, renal diet and boost for adequate PO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots and will start systemic heparin gtt
   Access: Peripheral and R sided HD line. Art line
   Code:  Full (confirmed with patient)
   Communication: Patient and wife [**Name (NI) 6046**] [**Name (NI) 11687**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11688**]
   Disposition: MICU pending CVVH/HD
","The patient is an 84-year-old male with worsening renal failure and acidosis due to Wegener's granulomatosis. He was transferred to the ICU for urgent dialysis planning. The patient has a history of pulmonary TB infection, bronchiectasis, and hemoptysis. He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) to remove fluid overload.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 113/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert and awake, with clear lungs and good air movement. His abdomen is benign, and he has gross anasarca in his legs and arms.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 190 K/uL, creatinine of 5.0 mg/dL, blood glucose of 186 mg/dL, sodium of 137 K/uL, potassium of 4.6 mEq/L, chloride of 108 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 15 mEq/L, calcium of 8.1 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.3 mg/dL, phosphorus of 3.5 mg/dL, and albumin of 2.7 g/dL.

The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to Wegener's granulomatosis. He is currently undergoing CVVH to remove fluid overload. The patient also has acute respiratory failure, which is not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has a history of pulmonary TB infection, presumed to be the cause of his hypoxia. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and he has an irregular and tachycardic heart rate. His INR is currently 1.4, down from a peak of 4.0.

The patient's Wegener's granulomatosis is being managed with prednisone and cyclophosphamide. He also has evidence of pulmonary TB infection, for which he is receiving treatment with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and vitamin B6 for liver protection. The patient has bronchiectasis and has had hemoptysis in the past. He is being closely monitored for any signs of recurrent hemoptysis.

The patient's anemia is likely multifactorial, including blood loss during hemodialysis placement and ongoing bleeding due to his elevated INR. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells yesterday and will be monitored closely for further blood loss.

The patient's diabetes mellitus is being managed with subcutaneous insulin. He will have his blood glucose levels rechecked this afternoon, and his insulin dosage will be adjusted accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure, respiratory failure, further episodes of hemoptysis, and complications related to his Wegener's granulomatosis and pulmonary TB infection. The patient's anticoagulation status will need to be closely monitored due to his history of sick sinus syndrome, intermittent atrial fibrillation, and previous use of Coumadin."

   - Incentive spirometer at bedside
   - Consider repeat CXR tomorrow
   2. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. New EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia versus
   rate related change.  No acute failure on Echo.
   - Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure tolerance; do
   not give if patient HR <100
   3. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from

   plan is for HD/CVVH today.
   - continue to monitor and correct coagulopathy
   - Begin CVVH to remove large volumes.
   - f/u Renal recs: will remove fluids as bp tolerates
   4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is 1.4 which has trended down from
   peak of 4.0, likely from recent warfarin and multiple antibiotic
   administration given new diagnosis of TB. No reason to suspect
   worsening liver function at this time, although multiple meds may cause
   this in the future.
   - monitor INR this afternoon
   - Got Vitamin K yesterday, will hold off for today unless INR acutely
   rises again

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   An 84 year old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from
   Wegener's, presumed pulmonary [**Hospital **] transferred to the ICU for urgent
   dialysis planning.
   His active issues are:
   1. Hypoxia when he was admitted: Pt was admitted hypoxic and dyspneic,
   thought to be multifactorial including renal failure induced volume
   overload, pulmonary TB infxn, and hemoptysis s/p bronch. Tamponade
   physiology was not [**Location (un) **] out by echo, which showed a resolving
   pericardial effusion.
   This is no longer an acute issue, the pt is satting well on RA and is
   not subjectively dyspneic
   - Will continue CVVH per renal team to remove the gross fluid overload
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time
   - Consider daily CXR
s to assess pulmonary fluid status
   2. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from
   worsening Wegener's.  He was admitted to MICU with fluid overload
   causing hypoxia. He is on CVVH currently and renal is on board.
   - Will touch base with Renal today about whether we can transition to
   IHD. His bp looks like it would tolerate it. He has been getting a lot
   of fluid off by CVVH but still needs quite a bit taken off as he is
   still grossly anasarcatous. If he can go to IHD, he can likely be
   called out to floor.
   3. Dropping platelets: Could be related to drugs or autoimmune related
   with known Dx of Wegener's, possibly due to heparin exposure/HIT, CVVH,
   etc. Differential is broad but plts are not at dangerously low level,
   would just keep an eye on it.
   - Drug list review for thrombocytopenia
   - Send smear
   - If it keeps going lower, would get Heme on board.
   4. Need for anticoagulation with h/o Sick Sinus Syndrome, intermittent
   AFib and bradycardia. Was on Coumadin on admission but not currently
   on. His INR today is 1.4, down from a peak of 4.0. He will need to be
   anticoagulated given high CHADS2 score.
   - Has had several >150 PTT
s with decreases in his rate of heparin
   infusion. Have been decreasing by 100U/hr for each time it
s been
   supraTx, now currently at 1100U/hr but have told nurse to drop the rate
   by 350U/hr if he is supraTx again.
   - Unsure whether pt will need further procedures, so hesitant to
   restart longer acting Coumadin
   - Continue to monitor coags panels
   5. Pulmonary TB: Had positive acid-fast smear, but state lab has now
   confirmed Gen-probe of MTB is negative. AF culture still pending. ID is
   on board. Per ID, if not MTB, [**Doctor First Name **] likely.
   - F/u with ID, who have been in touch with the state lab for Dx testing
   - Continue Rifampin, INH, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol
   - Continue B6 for liver protection.
   - renal recs: Goal 1-2 liters negative or more if tolerated. Ended up
   5L negative!-  respiratory isolation
   Other non-active issues:
   5. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. Had new EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia
   versus rate related change, and no acute failure on Echo.
   - Continue Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure
   tolerance; do not give if patient HR <100
   - Current HR in the 70-80
   5. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Will need to closely watch WBC count given Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
    7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, a recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and had a supratherpeutic INR, giving him multiple reasons
   to have hemoptysis.  He has not had any since his admission to MICU.
   - Watch for hemoptysis
   - Watch coag panels as above
   8. Anemia: probably multifactorial.  Lost blood during HD placement.
   Received 2 u PRBC yesterday
   - check afternoon Hct
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   9. Diabetes Mellitus: Continue SSI
   - recalculate insulin need based on blood glucoses this afternoon
   FEN: No IVF, CVVH, renal diet and boost for adequate PO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots and will start systemic heparin gtt
   Access: Peripheral and R sided HD line. Art line

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from Wegener's Granulomatosis. The patient's active issues include hypoxia, renal failure, drooping platelets, need for anticoagulation, pulmonary TB, and hemoptysis. The patient also has a history of sick sinus syndrome, intermittent atrial fibrillation, and bradycardia.

The patient's vital signs show a stable temperature, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with calcium gluconate and potassium chloride infusions. The patient is also receiving pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other medications as per the treatment plan.

The patient's lab results indicate stable white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. However, the creatinine level is elevated, and the potassium level is low. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal limits, and the liver function tests are normal.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of renal failure, respiratory failure, potential pulmonary TB, and Wegener's Granulomatosis. The patient is currently undergoing CVVH for fluid overload and will be evaluated for transition to intermittent hemodialysis (IHD). The patient's platelet count is being monitored, and heparin infusion rate is being adjusted based on PTT levels"

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   An 84 year old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from
   Wegener's, presumed pulmonary [**Hospital **] transferred to the ICU for urgent
   dialysis planning.
   His active issues are:
   1. Hypoxia when he was admitted: Pt was admitted hypoxic and dyspneic,
   thought to be multifactorial including renal failure induced volume
   overload, pulmonary TB infxn, and hemoptysis s/p bronch. Tamponade
   physiology was not [**Location (un) **] out by echo, which showed a resolving
   pericardial effusion.
   This is no longer an acute issue, the pt is satting well on RA and is
   not subjectively dyspneic
   - Will continue CVVH per renal team to remove the gross fluid overload
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time
   - Consider daily CXR
s to assess pulmonary fluid status
   2. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from
   worsening Wegener's.  He was admitted to MICU with fluid overload
   causing hypoxia. He is on CVVH currently and renal is on board.
   - Will touch base with Renal today about whether we can transition to
   IHD. His bp looks like it would tolerate it. He has been getting a lot
   of fluid off by CVVH but still needs quite a bit taken off as he is
   still grossly anasarcatous. If he can go to IHD, he can likely be
   called out to floor.
   3. Dropping platelets: Could be related to drugs or autoimmune related
   with known Dx of Wegener's, possibly due to heparin exposure/HIT, CVVH,
   etc. Differential is broad but plts are not at dangerously low level,
   would just keep an eye on it.
   - Drug list review for thrombocytopenia
   - Send smear
   - If it keeps going lower, would get Heme on board.
   4. Need for anticoagulation with h/o Sick Sinus Syndrome, intermittent
   AFib and bradycardia. Was on Coumadin on admission but not currently
   on. His INR today is 1.4, down from a peak of 4.0. He will need to be
   anticoagulated given high CHADS2 score.
   - Has had several >150 PTT
s with decreases in his rate of heparin
   infusion. Have been decreasing by 100U/hr for each time it
s been
   supraTx, now currently at 1100U/hr but have told nurse to drop the rate
   by 350U/hr if he is supraTx again.
   - Unsure whether pt will need further procedures, so hesitant to
   restart longer acting Coumadin
   - Continue to monitor coags panels
   5. Pulmonary TB: Had positive acid-fast smear, but state lab has now
   confirmed Gen-probe of MTB is negative. AF culture still pending. ID is
   on board. Per ID, if not MTB, [**Doctor First Name **] likely.
   - F/u with ID, who have been in touch with the state lab for Dx testing
   - Continue Rifampin, INH, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol
   - Continue B6 for liver protection.
   - renal recs: Goal 1-2 liters negative or more if tolerated. Ended up
   5L negative!-  respiratory isolation
   Other non-active issues:
   5. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. Had new EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia
   versus rate related change, and no acute failure on Echo.
   - Continue Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure
   tolerance; do not give if patient HR <100
   - Current HR in the 70-80
   5. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Will need to closely watch WBC count given Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
    7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, a recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and had a supratherpeutic INR, giving him multiple reasons
   to have hemoptysis.  He has not had any since his admission to MICU.
   - Watch for hemoptysis
   - Watch coag panels as above
   8. Anemia: probably multifactorial.  Lost blood during HD placement.
   Received 2 u PRBC yesterday
   - check afternoon Hct
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   9. Diabetes Mellitus: Continue SSI
   - recalculate insulin need based on blood glucoses this afternoon

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with worsening renal failure and acidosis due to Wegener's granulomatosis. He was admitted with hypoxia, dyspnea, and gross fluid overload. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) to remove fluid overload. His active issues include hypoxia, renal failure, dropping platelets, need for anticoagulation, pulmonary TB, and hemoptysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient was admitted hypoxic and dyspneic, which could be multifactorial including renal failure-induced volume overload, pulmonary TB infection, and hemoptysis. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and respiratory status is necessary to prevent further hypoxia.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure from worsening Wegener's granulomatosis. Continuous CVVH is being performed to remove fluid overload, and the renal team is considering transitioning to intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) once the patient's fluid status improves.

3. Dropping Platelets: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which could be related to drugs or autoimmune-related with known diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis. Monitoring platelet levels and conducting a drug review for thrombocytopenia are important. If the platelet count continues to drop, consulting hematology may be necessary.

   pulmonary TB infxn, and hemoptysis s/p bronch. Tamponade physiology was
   not [**Location (un) **] out by echo, which showed a resolving pericardial effusion.
   This morning the pt was in no distress, satting 97% on NC, and
   subjectively feeling very well.
   - Will continue CVVH per renal team to remove the gross fluid overload
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time

   anticoagulated given high CHADS2 score.
   - Restart Heparin gtt. Unsure whether pt will need further procedures,
   so hesitant to restart longer acting Coumadin
   - Continue to monitor coags panels.
   3. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. Had new EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia
   versus rate related change, and no acute failure on Echo.
   - Continue Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from Wegener's Granulomatosis. He was admitted hypoxic and dyspneic, with multiple factors contributing to his condition including renal failure-induced volume overload, pulmonary TB infection, and hemoptysis. The patient is currently comfortable on 2L nasal cannula and is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for fluid overload. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are as follows:
1. Hypoxia: The patient was admitted hypoxic and dyspneic, and while currently stable on NC, ongoing monitoring is required.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from worsening Wegener's. CVVH is being continued to remove gross fluid overload, and renal recommendations include fluid removal as tolerated by blood pressure.
3. Dropping platelets: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which could be drug-related or autoimmune-related with known diagnosis of Wegener's. Drug list review for thrombocytopenia and smear testing should be done.
4. Need for anticoagulation: The patient has a history of Sick Sinus Syndrome, intermittent atrial fibrillation, and bradycardia. Restarting heparin gtt is recommended due to high CHADS2 score, and further procedures may be needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with renal Wegener's, bronchiectasis, and active renal failure on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, KCl, heparin, calcium gluconate, and others. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but they show some fluctuations. The patient's respiratory support is not required as the SpO2 is maintained at 99%. The patient's cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds, but there is no assessment of peripheral pulses. Crackles are heard in the left base of the chest during the respiratory examination. The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema. The abdominal examination is unremarkable, and the musculoskeletal examination shows that the patient is unable to stand. The neurologic examination is not fully assessed due to the patient's inability to follow commands and assess movement, tone, and other parameters. The patient's labs indicate elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate, while other parameters are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient already has active renal failure, and there is a plan to convert to hemodialysis (HD) based on the assessment of CVVH.
2. AFB in Sputum: The patient has AFB in the sputum, indicating a possible infection. Gene probe testing for"

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   An 84 year old gentleman with worsening renal failure and acidosis from
   Wegener's, presumed pulmonary [**Hospital **] transferred to the ICU for urgent
   dialysis planning.
   Active issues at this point:
   1. Hypoxia: Pt was admitted hypoxic and dyspneic, thought to be
   multifactorial including renal failure induced volume overload,
   pulmonary TB infxn, and hemoptysis s/p bronch. Tamponade physiology was
   not [**Location (un) **] out by echo, which showed a resolving pericardial effusion.
   Pt is now satting well on RA and not subjectively dyspneic.
   - Has now had 6L removed by CVVH and will stop per renal recs as below
   - OK to intubate if needed, no need at this time
   2. Renal failure:  The patient has acute on chronic renal failure from
   worsening Wegener's.  He was admitted to MICU with fluid overload
   causing hypoxia. He is on CVVH currently and renal is on board.
   - Spoke with renal attndg this am who recommends stopping CVVH as he
   felt too much was taken off yesterday (6L). He wanted to stop [**Hospital 11753**]
   transfer to floor, and if more HD was needed, could do IHD. Continue to
   watch BUN/Cr and UOP.
   - Will stop CVVH
   3. Need for anticoagulation with h/o Sick Sinus Syndrome, intermittent
   AFib and bradycardia. Was on Coumadin on admission but not currently
   on. His INR today is 1.4, down from a peak of 4.0. He will need to be
   anticoagulated given high CHADS2 score.
   - Continue on Heparin gtt but will decrease by 350U/hr if PTT
   continue to be elevated, instead of the 100U/hr that the rate had been
   being decreased
   - Unsure whether pt will need further procedures, so hesitant to
   restart longer acting Coumadin
   - Continue to monitor coags panels.
   4. ID: State labs Gen-probe negative for TB, and per ID MAC would be
   most likely if TB negative.
   - F/u with ID today. They had recommended that if state results are
   negative, would stop RIPE and just continue INH for latent TB (?).
   - will wait to see ID recs specifically before stopping these meds.
   - Per ID, no need to change ABx on CVVH
   - Continue respiratory precautions until then
   Other less active/stable issues:
   5. Tachycardia: The patient is intermittently tachycardic, likely sick
   sinus syndrome. Had new EKG changes as above concerning for ischemia
   versus rate related change, and no acute failure on Echo.
   - Continue Diltiazem for rate goal ~ 100, pending blood pressure
   tolerance; do not give if patient HR <100
   6. Wegener's Granulomatosis: The patient has biopsy evidence of renal
   Wegener's with unknown pulmonary status.
   - Continue Prednisone & Cyclophosphamide
   - Will need to closely watch WBC count given Cyclophosphamide
   - Continue Bactrim Ppx
   7. Hemoptysis: The patient has bronchiectasis, a recent bronchoscopy,
   pulmonary TB and had a supratherpeutic INR, giving him multiple reasons
   to have hemoptysis.  He has not had any since his admission to MICU.
   - Watch for hemoptysis
   - Watch coag panels as above
   8. Anemia: probably multifactorial.  Lost blood during HD placement.
   Received 2 u PRBC yesterday
   - check afternoon Hct
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   9. Diabetes Mellitus: Continue SSI
   FEN: No IVF, CVVH, renal diet and boost for adequate PO
   Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots and will start systemic heparin gtt
   Access: Peripheral and R sided HD line. Art line
   Code:  Full (confirmed with patient)
   Communication: Patient and wife [**Name (NI) 6046**] [**Name (NI) 11687**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11688**]
   Disposition: Stop CVVH and call out to floor
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with worsening renal failure and acidosis due to Wegener's Granulomatosis. He was admitted to the ICU for urgent dialysis planning. 

The active issues currently include hypoxia, which has improved with the use of RA (likely referring to respiratory assistance), and renal failure. The patient has undergone CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and will stop per renal recommendations. 

The patient also has respiratory failure, not ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and has been treated for pulmonary TB infection. There was a concern for tamponade physiology, but this has been resolved.

Other less active/stable issues include tachycardia, possibly due to sick sinus syndrome, and the need for anticoagulation due to a high CHADS2 score. The patient's INR is currently low, and he is being monitored closely.

The patient has Wegener's Granulomatosis with biopsy evidence of renal involvement, and he is being treated with Prednisone and Cyclophosphamide. He also has bronchiectasis and a history of hemoptysis, for which he is being closely monitored.

Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus, anemia, and a history of sick sinus syndrome with intermittent atrial fibrillation. 

The patient's labs show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and BUN, with low levels of calcium and magnesium"
