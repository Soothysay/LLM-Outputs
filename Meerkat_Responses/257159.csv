","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male who underwent elective spinal surgery on [3-14] and is currently in the ICU for ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal. He is requiring large doses of diazepam to manage his withdrawal symptoms, including tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypertension. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but he remains tachycardic and tachypneic. His blood work shows elevated liver enzymes and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's current condition and recent events indicate potential medical complications related to EtOH withdrawal, such as seizures or delirium tremens. Additionally, the patient's upcoming spinal surgery may be affected by his withdrawal state. The patient's medical history includes hepatitis C and previous administration of Ativan and Haldol for sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: EtOH withdrawal can cause seizures, which can be potentially life-threatening if not managed promptly.
2. Delirium tremens: This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can occur within 48-72 hours after the last drink. It is characterized by altered mental status, fever, tachycardia, and tremors.
3. Infection: Prolonged use of IV lines and mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
4. Deep vein thrombosis"

 BACK PAIN
   This is a 47-year-old gentleman with hepatitis C, chronic low back
   pain, migraines, GERD, who was admitted for elective spinal surgery for
   chronic low back pain, had his first procedure on [**3-14**] (anterior
   approach) and is supposed to go back to surgery tomorrow for the
   posterior approach. On admission, patient admitted to drinking [**6-15**]
   vodka drinks per day. He was put on a CIWA scale and started to become
   confused and aggitated on [**3-15**] (presumably approx 24-48 hours after his
   last drink). He was given 1mg IV ativan x 3 on [**3-15**] and progressively
   became worse today. Was given 6 IV ativan between 6 am and 2pm, then
   2mg IV haldol at 2PM and 4PM and 10mg PO diazepam at 17:00. His CIWA
   has been between 10 an 16.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of chronic low back pain, hepatitis C, migraines, and GERD. He was admitted for elective spinal surgery but developed confusion and agitation on [3-15], approximately 24-48 hours after his last drink. He was given IV ativan but progressively worsened. He received additional doses of IV ativan, followed by IV haldol and PO diazepam. His CIWA score has been between 10 and 16.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient's history of heavy alcohol consumption and subsequent confusion and agitation indicate alcohol withdrawal. He has been given various medications to manage his symptoms, but his condition has worsened. Close monitoring and appropriate treatment for alcohol withdrawal are necessary to prevent complications such as seizures, delirium tremens, and potential cardiac arrhythmias.

2. Seizures: The patient's recent fall and the need for frequent diazepam administration suggest that seizures may be a concern. Seizures can occur during alcohol withdrawal and can increase the risk of injury and other complications. Continuous monitoring and seizure prophylaxis should be considered.

3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) suggests a potential infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory results is essential to identify any signs of infection early on.

4. Hepatitis C: The patient's history of hepatitis C should"

 BACK PAIN
   This is a 47-year-old gentleman with hepatitis C, chronic low back
   pain, migraines, GERD, who was admitted for elective spinal surgery for
   chronic low back pain, had his first procedure on [**3-14**] (anterior
   approach) and is supposed to go back to surgery tomorrow for the
   posterior approach. On admission, patient admitted to drinking [**6-15**]
   vodka drinks per day. He was put on a CIWA scale and started to become
   confused and aggitated on [**3-15**] (presumably approx 24-48 hours after his
   last drink). He was given 1mg IV ativan x 3 on [**3-15**] and progressively
   became worse today. Was given 6 IV ativan between 6 am and 2pm, then
   2mg IV haldol at 2PM and 4PM and 10mg PO diazepam at 17:00. His CIWA
   has been between 10 an 16.

   receive the sort of benzo dose his withdrawal will require
   -          Bolus 2 L IV NS
   # Spinal surgery: If patient intubated for his withdrawal state,
   surgery could go forward as soon as tomorrow, depending. Attending
   aware patient fell out of bed. Given unstable nature of only having
   anterior half of surgery done, this is another argument for
   sedating/intubating patient to complete the surgery quickly.
   # Hyponatremia: Na+ 129.
   -          Bolus 2 L IV NS.
   -          Monitor PM lytes

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male who underwent elective spinal surgery on March 14th and is now in the ICU due to ethanol withdrawal. He requires large doses of diazepam, and his vital signs indicate tachycardia and tachypnea. The patient's lab results show hyponatremia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated levels of CK, CKMB, Troponin-T, ALT, AST, and bilirubin. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen, and there is a concern for potential endotracheal intubation. There are also concerns regarding the patient's upcoming spinal surgery, hepatitis C, and possible pulmonary embolism. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient is experiencing severe symptoms of ethanol withdrawal, which can include agitation, tachycardia, tachypnea, and seizures. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to complications such as delirium tremens or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and agitated state may progress to respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and abnormal liver function tests could indicate an underlying infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis or other infections is important.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, which can lead to"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted for elective spinal stenosis surgery. The patient experienced delirium tremens (DTs) and required intubation. The patient underwent a second surgery this morning. The patient's condition is currently stable, with vital signs within normal limits. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube with a ventilator mode set to standby. Oxygen delivery is being provided at 30% FiO2, with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and pressures ranging from 17 to 14 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results indicate normal oxygenation and ventilation. The patient's physical examination shows clear lungs, a regular heart rhythm, and no edema in the abdomen. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal kidney function. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium. Other lab values, including liver enzymes and blood glucose, are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes alcohol withdrawal, hypertension, and ICU care. The plan includes providing nutrition through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), controlling blood pressure with Lopressor, and managing the patient's care in the ICU. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with compression boots and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient is also at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia"

","The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens (DTS), seizures, and back pain. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except as noted above. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), current temperature of 36.1°C (96.9°F), heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 100/63 to 169/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with ventilator support. 

The patient has been invasively ventilated since March 17th at 1:40 PM. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 17 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 14 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 30%, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 577, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 43, hemoglobin saturation (HbSat) of 97%, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 7.9 L/min. 

The patient has received several medications including propofol, pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, hydralazine, diazepam (Valium), haloperidol (Haldol), metoprolol, and others. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,785 mL since 88 AM, with 968 mL given as total intravenous fluids (IVF), 2,651 mL as IVF, and 968 mL as total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The total output includes 1,605 mL as urine output, 250 mL as blood product output, and 1,180 mL as other output. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 16.1 thousand/mm3, red blood cell (RBC) count of 11.6 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 38.5%, platelet (Plt) count of 194 thousand/mm3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 26 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.7 mg/dL, glucose of 119 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges. 

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care for alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens (DTS), back pain, and other conditions. The patient is being closely monitored and managed for potential complications associated with alcohol withdrawal, such as seizures and delirium tremens. The patient's pain is being managed, and appropriate medications are being administered."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and inadequate withdrawal management despite high levels of benzodiazepines. The patient was intubated due to inadequate response to treatment and post-intubation gas exchange is essentially normal except for a PO2 in the 170s, which was reduced to FiO2 30%. An OG tube was inserted and tube feeds started, but stopped at midnight. Tox screen was negative for everything besides benzodiazepines. The patient's EKG showed no prolonged QTc interval, allowing for the use of haloperidol instead of diazepam post-extubation. Surgical intervention is planned for tomorrow. The patient received IVF bolus overnight for decreased urine output. Allergies include ciprofloxacin and unknown. 

Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that could arise include:
1. Delirium tremens (DTs) due to alcohol withdrawal.
2. Seizures due to alcohol withdrawal or other underlying conditions.
3. Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization and prolonged bed rest.
5. Stress ulcers due to critical illness and potential use of corticosteroids.
6. Glycemic control issues due to the stress response from critical illness and potential use of insulin or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male who underwent elective spinal surgery and is currently in the ICU. He is experiencing significant ethanol withdrawal symptoms, requiring large doses of diazepam. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 100/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance with a total input of 2,785 mL and output of 1,605 mL. He is receiving various medications including propofol, pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, hydralazine, diazepam, haloperidol, and metoprolol. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range. Imaging shows no complications from the spinal surgery. The patient's assessment includes ongoing ethanol withdrawal, potential need for intubation for respiratory protection, consideration for completing spinal surgery, hyponatremia, tachypnea, and hepatitis C. The plan includes administering diazepam, possibly intubating the patient for surgery, correcting hyponatremia, monitoring for pulmonary embolism, and checking liver function tests.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and inadequate withdrawal treatment despite high levels of benzodiazepines. The patient required intubation for respiratory distress and was placed on invasive ventilation. An OG tube was inserted, and tube feeds were started. The patient's EKG showed no prolonged QTc interval, allowing for the use of haloperidol instead of diazepam post-extubation. Orthopedic planning is underway for surgical intervention tomorrow. The patient received IVF boluses overnight for decreased urine output.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male who underwent elective spinal surgery and was intubated for altered mental status and inadequate response to treatment despite high levels of benzodiazepines. He has a history of ethanol withdrawal, hepatitis C, and hyponatremia, which have been addressed. The patient is currently sedated and receiving propofol infusions. His vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and normal oxygen saturation. He is receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube and has undergone two surgeries. His laboratory results indicate abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and liver function tests. The plan is to wean off propofol, restart diazepam for ethanol withdrawal, and transition to oral benzodiazepines for withdrawal management. The patient's current issues include agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, inadequate sedation, and the need for further follow-up for hepatitis C. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient's history of ethanol withdrawal and current sedation may increase the risk of complications related to withdrawal symptoms.
2. Inadequate sedation: The patient's agitation and tachycardia suggest that the current level of sedation may not be sufficient, potentially leading to increased stress and complications.
3. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressure may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as stroke or heart attack.
4. Hepatitis C: The patient's history of hepatitis C requires ongoing monitoring and management to prevent further complications related to liver disease.
5. Surgical site infection: The patient's surgery increases the risk of developing surgical site infections.
6. Venous thromboembolism: Immobility and surgery can increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status needs to be closely monitored, as inadequate nutrition can lead to delayed wound healing and increased infection risk.
8. Medication interactions: The patient's multiple medications require careful consideration to avoid drug-drug interactions and optimize treatment outcomes."

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male who underwent elective spinal surgery and subsequently experienced significant alcohol withdrawal. He was intubated and sedated due to severe withdrawal symptoms, but now that the surgery is complete, the sedation and paralytics are being weaned down. The patient has a history of poor outpatient follow-up for hepatitis C, hyponatremia, and FEN (likely referring to a feeding tube or nutritional support). He also has a history of back pain. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is at risk for continued withdrawal symptoms as the sedatives and paralytics are being weaned down. Delirium tremens (DTs) and seizures are potential complications.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is intubated and at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Prophylactic measures such as pneumoboots should be implemented.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility due to intubation increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins.
4. Pressure Ulcers: Immobility and prolonged bed rest can lead to pressure ulcers, especially over bony prominences.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to alcohol abuse and potential malnutrition puts him at higher risk for infections.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Alcohol abuse and prolonged use of stress ulcer prophylaxis medications can"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 47-year-old male who underwent elective spinal surgery and is currently intubated for altered mental status and inadequate withdrawal treatment despite high levels of benzodiazepines. The patient has a history of ethanol withdrawal and was previously on diazepam, but it was discontinued prior to intubation in favor of propofol. The patient becomes agitated, tachycardic, and hypertensive as propofol is weaned. It seems that the patient is undertreated with benzodiazepines.

The plan is to restart diazepam via nasogastric tube at 40 mg NG every 2 hours. Propofol will be weaned by 5 mcg/kg/hr and monitored for withdrawal symptoms. If symptoms occur, the diazepam dosing will be increased. The goal is to transition the patient to oral benzodiazepines for withdrawal management. Beta-blockers will be discontinued so as not to mask withdrawal symptoms.

The patient completed the second stage of surgery yesterday. Follow-up surgery recommendations include asking Dr. [Last Name] when to start Lovenox or subcutaneous heparin and providing weight-bearing orders per surgery preferences.

The patient's hyponatremia has resolved. He has a history of hepatitis C and will be following liver function tests. The patient requires repleting of electrolytes, IV"

The patient is a 47-year-old male who underwent elective spinal surgery. He is currently intubated and sedated due to altered mental status and inadequate withdrawal treatment despite high levels of benzodiazepines. The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal, hepatitis C, constipation, and hyponatremia. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/84 mmHg to 120/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 4474 mL and output of 1605 mL, with urine output of 1380 mL. He is receiving propofol at 35 mcg/kg/min and various other medications. The patient's lab results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels, but elevated troponin-T levels. The patient's pain management plan includes standing oxycodone and Tylenol, morphine for breakthrough pain, and diazepam via nasogastric tube. The plan is to wean propofol and monitor for withdrawal symptoms, potentially increasing diazepam dosing. The patient's current medical issues include tachycardia, delirium/confusion, alteration in nutrition, alcohol withdrawal, back pain,"

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 47M admitted for elective spinal surgery
   complicated by etoh withdrawal. Remains intubated on PSV. Received
   valium 20 PO and 50 IV this am.
   AF  100  150/104  24  95%  PS 5/5 30%
   intubated, diaphoretic

   RR tachy
   + BS, soft, NT
   no edema
   WBC 12.5K, HCT 27.3, K+  3.4, Cr  0.5
   CXR--small lung volumes
   Tachycardic/diaphoretic and hypetensive likely from etoh wd and
   possibly post-op pain as well as possible narcotic withdrawal. Agree
   with plan to continue valium per modified ciwa, clonidine,
   thiamine/folate/mvi, continuing oxycodone and standing tylenol for pain
   control.  As pt likely has high narcotic tolerance in setting of
   chronic pain, will add prn dilaudid.  We continue vent support, now on
   PS 5/5 with MS, somnolence, and sedation needs current barriers to
   extubation.  Trend hct given slow decline and keep type and cross.
   Ortho per post-op care. ICU: boots, PPI (on at home), PIVs, TFs, full
   code. Increase bowel reg. Remainder of plan as outlined in resident
   note.  Family updated during am rounds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for agitation and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and hepatitis C. Upon admission, the patient was agitated and intubated. Vital signs showed tachycardia and hypertension. The patient received various medications including heparin, diazepam, haloperidol, and hydromorphone. 

The patient's labs revealed leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytosis. Liver function tests showed elevated ALT and AST levels. The patient also had elevated troponin-T levels, indicating possible cardiac injury. The patient's renal function was within normal limits.

The patient's imaging results showed a chest x-ray consistent with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's physical examination revealed a rapid heart rate and normal lung sounds bilaterally.

Assessment and plan:
1. Agitation: The patient's agitation is now attributed to benzodiazepine intoxication and sequelae of ethanol withdrawal management. Psychiatric services have been consulted, recommending the use of haloperidol for behavior issues. Diazepam dosage has been reduced.
2. Respiratory status: The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Treatment includes the initiation of vancomycin and cefepime.
3. Spinal surgery: The patient underwent surgical intervention for spinal stenosis. Incisions were found to be clean"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of spinal stenosis who was admitted to the ICU for surgical intervention. He has been experiencing agitation, altered mental status, and respiratory distress. The patient's sputum culture showed the presence of pneumonia, which is suspected to be ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has also been diagnosed with alcohol withdrawal, back pain related to spinal stenosis post-surgery, and constipation. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, and his laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and decreased hemoglobin levels. He is currently on multiple medications, including pain medication, antipsychotics, antibiotics, and prophylactic treatments for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's disposition is still in the ICU pending further improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's symptoms of respiratory distress and the presence of pneumonia on sputum culture suggest a possible case of VAP. This is a common complication in patients who have been mechanically ventilated for an extended period.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male who underwent elective spinal surgery and is currently intubated for altered mental status and inadequate weaning treatment despite high levels of benzodiazepines. He remains agitated and altered, with a history of ethanol withdrawal management. The patient's respiratory status has worsened, and a chest X-ray and bronchoalveolar lavage indicate ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His pain management has been adjusted, and he is receiving fentanyl patch and Dilaudid for breakthrough pain. He is being treated for constipation, hepatitis C, and spinal stenosis. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, and his laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient is at risk for aspiration, altered airway clearance, and cough due to an inability to protect his airway. Potential complications include pneumonia, bacterial infection, delirium/confusion, alteration in nutrition, alcohol withdrawal, and back pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is a bacterial infection of the lungs acquired while on mechanical ventilation. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and even multi-organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status and agitation suggest delirium or confusion. This can be due to various"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and spinal stenosis who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. His vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and hypoxemia. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated. The physical examination reveals bilateral crackles in the lungs and mild lower extremity edema. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and renal impairment. The patient's mental status is altered, and he is at risk for aspiration. He also has a history of back pain due to spinal stenosis post-surgical intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at high risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and agitation indicate delirium, which can increase the risk of complications such as falls, self-extubation, and medication errors.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male who underwent elective spinal surgery and is currently intubated due to altered mental status and inadequate withdrawal treatment despite high levels of benzodiazepines. The patient has been experiencing agitation, which was initially thought to be due to benzodiazepine intoxication and sequelae of ethanol withdrawal management. However, it has now been recognized as a result of benzo intoxication and EtOH withdrawal management. The patient's respiratory status is concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and he has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's pain is being managed with a fentanyl patch and Dilaudid for breakthrough pain. He has been weaned off Oxycodone and will continue taking Tylenol. The patient's spinal stenosis is post-surgical intervention, and his incisions appear clean, dry, and intact. He is being restarted on low-dose heparin SQ per surgery recommendations, and weight-bearing orders have been given. The patient's constipation has resolved, and he is being monitored for hepatic encephalopathy. He has a history of hepatitis C, and his liver function tests are being followed. The patient's electrolytes are being repleted, and he is receiving tube feeds. He has two peripheral IV lines, and his discharge medications include pneumoboots and protonix. The patient is at risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, airway clearance, and cough due to"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 47-year-old male who underwent elective spinal surgery and was intubated for altered mental status and inadequate withdrawal treatment despite high levels of benzodiazepines.
- The patient's agitation is suspected to be due to benzodiazepine intoxication and sequelae of ethanol withdrawal management. Psychiatric services have been consulted, recommending the use of Haloperidol for behavior issues.
- The patient's pain management plan includes a fentanyl patch and dilaudid for breakthrough pain. Oxycodone has been discontinued, and standing Tylenol will continue.
- The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime.
- Spinal stenosis post surgical intervention has been noted, with clean, dry, and intact incisions. Surgery recommendations include restarting low-dose heparin subcutaneously and weight-bearing orders per surgery preferences.
- The patient has not had a bowel movement since admission and is on Colace and lactulose. If no bowel movement is observed this afternoon, methylnaltrexone will be given.
- The patient has a history of hepatitis C and will be followed up with liver function tests (LFTs). Poor outpatient follow-up in the past has been noted.
- The patient's fluid balance shows a total in of 1"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male who is currently intubated in the ICU. He has a history of spinal stenosis and underwent elective spinal surgery. The patient is experiencing agitation, which was initially thought to be due to alcohol withdrawal, but is now believed to be benzodiazepine intoxication. The patient's respiratory status has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes. The patient is also dealing with constipation, hepatitis C, and back pain related to his spinal stenosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation. This condition requires prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics to prevent further complications.
2. Delirium or confusion: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which can be a result of various factors such as benzodiazepine intoxication, alcohol withdrawal, or hepatic encephalopathy. It is crucial to monitor the patient closely and provide adequate pain control and sedation.
3. Alcohol withdrawal: Although initially suspected, the patient's agitation is now attributed to benzodiazepine intoxication. However, alcohol withdrawal could still be a concern and should be closely monitored.
4. Hepatitis C: The patient has a history of hepatitis C, and his liver enzymes are elevated. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is essential to assess the progression of"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male who underwent elective spinal surgery and is now in the ICU. The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal, and is extubated one day ago. The patient's main concerns include agitation/altered mental status, pain control, tachycardia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), leukocytosis, spinal surgery, constipation, hepatitis C, electrolyte imbalance (FEN), and access issues.

From the note, it can be inferred that the patient is experiencing several potential medical complications. These include:
1. Agitation/Altered Mental Status: The patient is described as having an altered mental state and showing signs of agitation. This could be related to alcohol withdrawal or other factors.
2. Pain Control: The patient is in need of aggressive pain management, as indicated by the use of multiple analgesics including Fentanyl, Tylenol, and Dilaudid. The patient was not receiving his Tylenol (or Clonidine) for the past day.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has a history of tachycardia, which in the past has been associated with pain.
4. VAP: The patient has ventilator-associated pneumonia, as evidenced by the presence of 1+ GNRs in the sputum culture. Antibiotics have been changed from cefepime to meropenem due to rising white blood cell count.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is rising despite antibiotic treatment. This could indicate an ongoing infection or inadequate treatment.
6. Spinal Surgery: The patient underwent spinal surgery for stenosis and incisions appear clean, dry, and intact.
7. Constipation: The patient previously had constipation but has now resolved with the use of laxatives.
8. Hepatitis C: The patient has a history of hepatitis C and poor outpatient follow-up.
9. Electrolyte Imbalance (FEN): The patient requires repletion of electrolytes and tube feeds.
10. Access Issues: The patient has multiple lines in place, including PIV x2 and PICC line.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

   is subtherapeutic on pain medicine and needs even more Dilaudid (say 2
   mg q 2 hours prn) or this is a manifestation of infection, along with

","The patient is a 47-year-old male who underwent elective spinal surgery and is now in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing agitation, altered mental status, known ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and a climbing white blood cell count. The patient was extubated one day ago and continues to have altered mental status. 

The patient's pain is not being adequately managed with current analgesia, as evidenced by ongoing tachycardia and agitation. The patient's pain management plan includes increasing the dose of Fentanyl patch, converting Clonidine to a patch, and increasing the dosing of Dilaudid every 2 hours as needed. 

The patient's tachycardia has been persistent and is now not responding to pain treatment or benzodiazepine therapy. Infection should be closely monitored, and the patient should be given a bolus of normal saline. 

The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia, as shown by the presence of 1+ GNRs in the bronchoalveolar lavage. Cefepime was stopped, and Meropenem was started due to the rising white blood cell count. 

The patient also has leukocytosis that is not responding to antibiotics. Large bilateral mucous plugs were observed yesterday, and Clostridium difficile should be ruled out. If the patient's condition does not improve soon, a CT scan should be considered to evaluate for any complications related to the spinal surgery."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male who underwent elective spinal surgery and was intubated for altered mental status and inadequate withdrawal treatment despite high levels of benzodiazepines. The patient's chief complaint is related to invasive ventilation, and there have been ongoing efforts to manage his agitation, respiratory status, spinal surgery recovery, constipation, hepatitis C, and nutritional support.

The patient's medical history includes spinal stenosis with previous surgical intervention, alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and hepatitis C. The patient's physical examination shows no significant findings in peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic assessments.

The patient's vital signs indicate a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 126 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 153/83 mmHg to 114/74 mmHg. The respiratory rate is within normal limits at 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation remains at 96%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.1°C (98.7°F).

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count peaking at 19.7 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and slightly altered liver function tests. The patient's glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include several potential medical complications such as pneumonia, bacterial infection acquired through mechanical ventilation (ventilator-associated pneumonia or VAP), inability to protect the airway"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a history of encephalopathy, making it difficult for him to provide a detailed medical history. Allergies include ciprofloxacin and an unknown allergy. The patient has been on invasive ventilation since [**2186-3-25**] 01:37 PM.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.1°C (98.7°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate (HR) of 129 bpm with a range of 91-135 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 110/74 mmHg to 166/100 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 15 breaths per minute with a range of 8-25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94%, and sinus tachycardia (ST) as the heart rhythm.

The patient has received various medications including meropenem, vancomycin, heparin sodium, haloperidol, hydromorphone, and others. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for noted changes.

Flowsheet data indicates that the patient has been receiving intravenous fluids with a total input of 1,040 mL and output of 1,405 mL. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen delivery, standby ventilator mode, and is spontaneously breathing with a tidal volume (Vt) of 665 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 10 cmH2O, and a spontaneous respiratory rate (RR) of 7 breaths per minute. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are unavailable. The patient's venous excess (Ve) is 5.5 L/min.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, with normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat; normal cardiovascular system; symmetric chest expansion; clear breath sounds; soft, non-tender abdomen; warm skin; and purposeful movement with intermittently attentive neurologic status.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.2 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) ranging from 10.0 to 19.7 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 150,000 to 18,600/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.5 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 32 mmHg, glucose levels ranging from 78 to 182 mg/dL, and other laboratory values within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia, bacterial, ventilator-acquired (VAP) - continued antibiotics, able to extubated yesterday afternoon after successful spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), white blood cell count rise - antibiotics adjusted yesterday - meropenem started.
2. Tachycardia, other - likely due to medication or underlying condition, hold sedating medications as able.
3. Delirium/confusion - awake, alert intermittently but generally confused/delirious, likely medical-related - hold sedating medications as able.
4. Alcohol withdrawal (including delirium tremens, DTS, seizures) - should be beyond withdrawal window, slowly clearing medications.
5. Back pain - spinal stenosis status post surgical intervention - two-part anterior/posterior approach, if continuous leukocytosis, might"

   Total time spent:
","The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pneumonia, bacterial, ventilator acquired (VAP). The patient's chief complaint is VAP. The patient's mental status has improved, and he is awake, alert, and much less confused today. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted improvement in mental status.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/84 to 150/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is well-nourished and thin, with normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat. His cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and his peripheral vascular examination is unremarkable. His respiratory/chest examination shows symmetric expansion and clear breath sounds. The abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. There is no lower extremity edema noted. The patient's neurologic examination indicates that he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, oriented to person, year, and president, and has purposeful movement with warm skin.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 10.6 to 19.7 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin ranging from 27.1 to 32.4%, platelet count ranging from 273 to 372 thousand/mm³, creatinine ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 mg/dL, total CO2 ranging from 32 to 34 mEq/L, blood glucose ranging from 78 to 182 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.

Assessment and plan:
1. PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP): The patient has pneumonia acquired during mechanical ventilation. Antibiotic therapy will be continued, and the patient is extubated successfully.
2. TACHYCARDIA, OTHER: The patient has persistent tachycardia that is not related to ethanol withdrawal.
3. DELIRIUM / CONFUSION: The patient's mental status has improved, likely due to medication-related causes. Sedating medications will be held as able.
4. ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES): The patient should be beyond the withdrawal window, and medications will be slowly cleared.
5. BACK PAIN: The patient has spinal stenosis post-surgical intervention. If leukocytosis continues, further evaluation may be necessary, but for now, it is deferred.
6. Remainder of plan per resident note.

   Assessment and Plan
   47M s/p elective spinal surgery (anterior and posterior LIFs) c/b
   alcohol withdrawal, extubated one day ago, with continued altered MS,
   known VAP, and climbing white count.
   # Agitation / Altered MS: Improving.
   - aggressive pain management
   - Clonidine for withdrawal sx
   # Pain control: Not POing for past 2 days, so not receiving his
   Tylenol.
   - PR Tylenol for now
   - Low threshold for increasing his Dilaudid dosing
   # Tachycardia: Episodes to the 120s common, sinus tach. Dehydration vs
   infection vs pain vs propylene glycol toxicity s/p Diazepam loading
   last week
   - monitor for infection
   - bolus with NS
   # VAP: BAL [**3-25**] shows 1+ GNRs, c/w VAP. WBC dropping with [**Last Name (un) 350**].
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 350**]
   - f/u sputum cxs
   # Spinal surgery: Spinal stenosis s/p surgical intervention. Incisions

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male who underwent elective spinal surgery and is currently in the ICU. The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including hypertension, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, tachycardia, delirium/confusion, alteration in nutrition, and alcohol withdrawal.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 106/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range, but other lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (leukocytosis), slightly low hemoglobin (anemia), and normal platelet count.

The patient's medical history includes spinal stenosis, which required surgical intervention. The surgical incisions are described as clean, dry, and intact. Additionally, the patient has hepatitis C, as indicated by a viral load of 2.1 million.

The patient's current treatment plan includes aggressive pain management, administration of clonidine for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and monitoring for infection. The patient is also being treated for potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), with a sputum culture showing growth of 1+ GNRs (Gram-negative rods). The patient's nutritional needs are being addressed through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and a nutrition"
