","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and acute renal failure. He was admitted with uremia and concerns of acute drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) and potential gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has been responsive to blood product transfusions.

The assessment and plan include several medical complications:

1. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient's blood pressure is low, which can be attributed to his ESLD and potential blood loss.

2. ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING): The patient's low Hct indicates acute anemia, likely due to GI bleeding.

3. LOCAL SKIN INFECTION NOS: There is no further information provided regarding this condition.

4. HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY: The patient has cirrhosis and ethanol use, which contributes to hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment includes lactulose and monitoring liver function tests.

5. RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): The patient has acute renal failure, initially suspected as hepatorenal syndrome. However, it improved with albumin challenge, suggesting prerenal causes such as GI bleed or diuretic use.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and acute renal failure. He was admitted with uremia and acute renal failure, and then transferred to the MICU due to acute drop in hemoglobin concentration and concern for gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

The patient's current medical complications include hypotension, anemia secondary to blood loss, hepatic encephalopathy, acute renal failure, lower GI bleed, gastric varices, and portal hypertensive gastropathy.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Acute Anemia: The patient is suspected to have a GI source of bleeding, given his history of grade II varices on recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). He may have had a bleed prior to admission, which could explain pre-renal acute renal failure. The patient responded to blood products.

","The patient's chief complaint is anemia and renal failure. The patient received two boluses of 500cc of saline due to borderline hypotension. The patient also experienced vomiting of non-bloody emesis twice.

The patient has no known drug allergies, and the last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin on [**2145-8-12**] at 10:27 PM.

The patient is currently receiving several medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix) at 8 mg/hour, ferrous sulfate, rifaximin, lactulose, clotrimazole, and ondansetron (Zofran) for nausea.

The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events above.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 76 bpm with a range of 65-82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/46 mmHg to 77/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute with inspiration, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's height is 70 inches, and fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,635 mL and 1,865 mL since midnight. Output includes 120 mL of PO, 304 mL of IVF, 1,211 mL of blood products, and 880 mL of urine. The calculated fluid balance is 755 mL and 806 mL.

The patient requires respiratory support but is not on supplemental oxygen. ABG results are pending. Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress, with normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace lower extremity edema, muscle wasting, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination.

Lab results show a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, leukocyte count of 64 K/uL, platelet count of 124 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL, glucose level of 124 mg/dL, and potassium levels of 16 mEq/L and 4.2 mEq/L. Other lab values include AST/ALT levels of 25/43, bilirubin levels of 66/7.7, albumin level of 3.3 g/dL, LDH level of 163 IU/L, calcium level of 8.9 mg/dL, magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 3.1 mg/dL.

Microbiology cultures are pending. The patient's assessment and plan include hypotension (not in shock) with anemia and coagulopathy due to liver disease. A CT scan of the abdomen will be performed to assess for intraperitoneal versus retroperitoneal bleed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and acute renal failure. He was admitted with uremia and acute renal failure, and later transferred to the MICU due to a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (hct) and concern for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient has a history of grade II varices on recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). He responded well to blood products and showed stability in hct overnight. However, he remains at risk for further GI bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss from GI bleeding. His hct has been stable overnight, but there is still a high concern for ongoing GI bleeding.
2. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which resolved after administration of blood products. There is a possibility of hypovolemia due to bleed, volume depletion, or infection.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient continues to have acute renal failure, which may be related to prerenal azotemia from GI bleeding or overdiuresis. His creatinine level improved significantly with fluid and blood resuscitation.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy due to liver disease, evidenced by an elevated international normalized ratio (INR). His coagulation parameters are being closely monitored.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with a chief complaint of GI bleed. The patient's hemodynamic status has remained stable, and the source of bleeding is still unclear. The patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with banding three times, which did not reveal any clear signs of recent bleeding. The patient's hematocrit (hct) levels have been stable, so further imaging was not pursued.

The patient has a history of allergies to no known drugs. They have been receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion at 8 mg/hour, as well as other medications including ferrous sulfate, rifaximin, lactulose, clotrimazole, and ciprofloxacin.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the GI bleed. The patient's vital signs have been relatively stable, with a temperature range of 36.5-37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 68-81 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 114/80 to 123/80 mmHg, respiratory rate between 12-18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2639 mL, including 188 mL of IV fluids, 120 mL of PO intake, and 188 mL of TF intake. Output includes 2290 mL of urine, 637 mL of blood products, and 352 mL of NG output. The overall balance is"

","Summary:
The patient presented with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient has a history of anemia, acute secondary to blood loss, hypotension, hepatic encephalopathy, and acute renal failure. The patient underwent endoscopic banding three times but showed no clear stigmata of recent bleeding. The patient's hematocrit (hct) levels have been stable. The patient also has a history of variceal bleed versus other sources of bleeding, with no significant hematemesis or melena. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient had a variceal bleed, which is a known risk factor for re-bleeding. Continuous monitoring and further management, such as repeated endoscopic banding or other interventions, may be necessary to prevent re-bleeding.

2. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics (rifaximin) and receiving lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy. Infections can still occur despite these measures, and close monitoring for signs of infection is important.

3. Renal function deterioration: The patient has a history of acute renal failure. Monitoring renal function and adjusting fluid and medication management accordingly is crucial to prevent further deterioration.

4. Hepatic encephalopathy exacerbation: The patient is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy. Close monitoring of mental status"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) on the transplant list admitted for uremia and acute renal failure. He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to an acute drop in hematocrit (Hct) and concern for gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including hypotension, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, local skin infection, hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, and lower GI bleed. The patient's condition requires careful management and monitoring.

The patient's hypotension has resolved, and his blood pressure is in the normal range. However, there is still a question about the cause of hypotension, which could be due to volume depletion from GI bleed, infection, or other factors.

The patient's acute anemia is secondary to blood loss from the GI bleed. The patient has a history of grade II varices, and evidence of recent variceal bleed was found during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient's Hct has slightly decreased to 25, and he may have had a bleed prior to admission, which could explain pre-renal acute renal failure. Stool has been guaiac negative, indicating no bleeding in the lower gastrointestinal tract.

The patient is currently receiving carafate orally and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was admitted with uremia and acute renal failure. He has been transferred to the MICU due to an acute drop in hemoglobin concentration and concern for gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has a history of grade II varices, which were recently evaluated by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). During the EGD, four cords of grade 2 varices were identified and banded.

The patient's current assessment includes hypotension, anemia, acute renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, local skin infection, and respiratory support. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 91/74 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula, and temperature of 36.7°C.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, leukocyte count of 4.7 K/uL, platelet count of 57 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 133 mg/dL, sodium level of 133 mg/dL, potassium level of 5.8 mEq/L, and liver function tests including aspartate aminotransferase (AST),"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and renal failure. The patient was found to be anemic and had varices on endoscopy, which were subsequently banded. The patient is currently stable.

The patient has a history of urinary tract infection (UTI) and renal failure. Allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, and other medications are noted. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for sedation, which the patient is unable to obtain.

Flowsheet data shows vital signs within normal range, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's weight remains relatively stable. Fluid balance indicates an input of 1,657 mL and output of 1,325 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 332 mL.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds bilaterally, soft distended abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds, and no lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination shows the patient attentive, following simple commands, oriented to person/place/time, and responding to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results include hemoglobin (Hb) at 8.7 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) within normal range, platelet count (Plt) slightly low, creatinine (Cr) improved from previous values, and other labs within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   - likely near baseline, will try to avoid boluses of fluid
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
   - s/p banding of varices
   - continue PPI, soft diet, nadolol
   - on cipro x 5 days for SBP prophylaxis, day [**2-4**]
   - for repeat banding in
 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
   - on rifaximin/lactulose, will titrate lactulose to at least [**2-3**] BM/day
   - no encephalopathy today
   - on transplant list
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   - continues to improve, likely pre-renal
   - trend to baseline, consider restarting diuretics today or tomorrow
