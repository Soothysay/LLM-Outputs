","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of stage IV lung cancer metastasized to the liver, experiencing worsening shortness of breath and confirmed pulmonary embolism on CT. The patient has multiple allergies, including delirium and confusion with morphine, oxycontin, and codeine. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they show signs of respiratory distress. The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for worsening shortness of breath. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, high creatinine level, and elevated troponin T level. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's physical examination reveals no distress, and respiratory support is provided with an aerosol-cool face tent, maintaining oxygen saturation at 99%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory distress due to pulmonary embolism and underlying COPD.
2. Possible sepsis or infection indicated by elevated white blood cell count and elevated troponin T level.
3. Potential hepatic dysfunction or liver failure due to metastasis of lung cancer to the liver.
4. Risk of further thrombotic events or deep vein thrombosis due to the presence of pulmonary embolism.
5. Nutritional deficiencies and glycemic control issues due to NPO status and ICU care."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of worsening shortness of breath. He has a history of stage IV lung cancer that has metastasized to the liver. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) with intravenous heparin. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9Â°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/62 mmHg to 139/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for worsening shortness of breath.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is already being treated for acute PE with heparin. If left untreated or if there is a recurrence, it can lead to further respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and potentially fatal complications.
2. Worsening respiratory status: The patient's worsening shortness of breath and wheezing on physical examination suggest possible exacerbation of underlying COPD or complications related to lung cancer. This could lead to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Infection: The patient's leukopenia may indicate an increased risk of infection. Infections can be particularly concerning in the ICU setting and can lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Liver dysfunction:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of stage 4 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and multiple pulmonary emboli (PEs). She is currently admitted to the ICU due to hypotension and low blood pressure in the 80s, for which metoprolol was held.

The patient has several medical allergies, including morphine, Oxycontin, penicillins, and prednisone. She also has an unknown allergy to codeine.

The patient is receiving infusions of enoxaparin (Lovenox) and other medications in the ICU. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98Â°F), heart rate of 77 bpm (normal range: 74-90 bpm), blood pressure of 90/46 mmHg (with a range of 69-147/29-113 mmHg), respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (normal range: 15-24 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's flow sheet data shows that she has received a total of 1,837 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with 840 mL given orally, 877 mL given intravenously, and a total output of 825 mL through urine and blood products.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 79-year-old female admitted with bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and stage 4 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with metastasis to the liver. She has a history of intermittent atrial tachycardia and is currently on atenolol 100mg per day at home.

The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure in the 80s, with a current reading of 90/46 mmHg. Her heart rate is stable at 77 bpm, respiratory rate is within normal range at 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is at 97% on a nasal cannula. Body temperature is slightly below normal at 36.7Â°C (98Â°F).

The patient has been given 250cc of normal saline due to hypotension, and metoprolol was held. She did not call out because of the hypotension, and her oncologist and pulmonologist were updated via email on her admission.

The patient has allergies to morphine, Oxycontin, penicillins, and prednisone. She is currently on multiple ICU medications, including enoxaparin (Lovenox) started at 12:00 AM, and other medications that were not specified.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted events. The patient's flow sheet data shows normal temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of stage 4 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who was admitted from [Location 250] with bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs). The patient has a baseline hemoglobin level of mid-to-high 30s and is currently at Hct 27. There are no signs of bleeding or active anemia. The patient's oncologist has recommended continuing with avastin therapy despite the presence of bilateral PE.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C (98Â°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/46 mmHg to 147/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received enoxaparin (lovenox) infusion since 12 AM, and her fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,837 mL and output of 825 mL, with a negative balance of -70 mL. The patient is breathing comfortably on a nasal cannula, and her lungs are clear anteriorly with mild wheezing.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 2.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, platelet count of 111 K/uL, creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.31 ng/mL, and blood glucose of 122 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies reveal multiple bilateral PEs, and a bedside echo shows mild right ventricular dysfunction. The patient's cancer has metastasized to the liver.

The assessment and plan include continuing lovenox for pulmonary embolism prophylaxis, following oncology recommendations regarding the continuation of avastin therapy, initiating open and spiriva for wheezing, addressing anemia with a Hct of 27, managing stage 4 NSCLC with metastasis to the liver, and monitoring for hypotension. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition will be transferred to the oncology floor if she is not hypotensive today and her hemoglobin level is stable."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis secondary to pneumonia. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is at high risk for complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal dysfunction: The patient has acute kidney injury, which can lead to further deterioration of renal function and may require dialysis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may progress, leading to worsening respiratory function and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Sepsis: The patient is currently septic, and there is a risk of ongoing infection and septic shock.
4. Cardiovascular issues: The patient's hypertension and the stress of critical illness may increase the risk of cardiac events, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
5. Thromboembolic events: Due to immobilization and underlying hypercoagulability, the patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Stress ulcers can develop in critically ill patients, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
8. Multisystem organ failure: The patient's multiple organ dysfunction"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of stage 4 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and intermittent atrial tachycardia. She was admitted from Location 250 with bilateral pulmonary emboli (PE's). The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/39 to 141/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient's laboratory results show hyponatremia (sodium level of 103 K/uL), anemia (hematocrit of 27.8%), leukopenia (white blood cell count of 2.0 K/uL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 111 K/uL), elevated troponin-T (0.31 ng/mL), and elevated creatinine (0.9 mg/dL). The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, with the exception of a slightly low potassium level (24 mEq/L) and magnesium level (1.8 mg/dL).

The patient has multiple medical complications, including pulmonary emboli, anemia, hyponatremia, hypotension, and intermittent atrial tachycardia. She is currently receiving enoxaparin (L"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female admitted with a pulmonary embolism. She has shown reasonable improvement in oxygenation with supportive treatment. The patient has a history of allergies to morphine, Oxycontin, penicillins, and prednisone. She also has allergies to codeine, Advair Diskus, and nausea/vomiting. The patient is currently on various medications including enoxaparin (Lovenox), other ICU medications, and has a medical history of lung cancer. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, some potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is currently receiving systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to prevent further clot formation. However, there is a risk of developing DVT due to immobility and underlying risk factors.
2. Bleeding: Due to the anticoagulation therapy, there is a risk of bleeding complications such as hematuria, hematemesis, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but there is a possibility of developing hypotension if the anticoagulant therapy causes a significant drop in blood pressure.
4. Respiratory distress: Although the patient's oxygen saturation is currently at 98%, there is a risk of respiratory distress if the pulmonary embolism worsens or if there are complications"
