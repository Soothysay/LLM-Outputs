 DYSPHAGIA
   75 year old woman with h/o dementia and CHF who presented with hypoxia,
   dyspnea, and septic shock.
   # Septic Shock: Patient presented with hypotension requiring pressors.
   Met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis > 12K, RR>20.  Most likely a
   pulmonary source given history of pneumonia in the past, LLL infiltrate
   on CXR, and presentation of hypoxia and dyspnea.  Less likely urinary
   source given relatively clean UA (although this was after Abx).  Was
   given Levaquin/Vancomycin/Imipenem in the [**Hospital1 1294**] ED.  Currently on
   dopamine for pressure support.
   - cautious volume resuscitation given that she is clinically in heart
   failure and is DNR/DNI
   - change dopamine to levophed
   - Will monitor urine output, CVP, mental status, pressor requirement to
   assess fluid resuscitation goals
   - Repeat blood cultures
   - FU blood cultures drawn prior to antibiotics
   - FU urine culture
   - Maintain MAP>65
   - Will broadly cover with Vancomycin/Meropenem (Not giving cefepime or
   Zosyn due to PCN and cephalosporin allergy)/Levaquin for likely
   bacterial pathogens to cause pneumonia
   - unclear why patient was given hydrocortisone at [**Last Name (LF) 1294**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not
   continue for now
   - consider RBCs rather than saline for volume resuscitation given that
   Hct is < 30; however, need to be careful with fluids as above
   - check SvO2
   # Congestive Heart Failure:  Evidence of volume overload on exam and
   chest xray.  Unclear if systolic, diastolic, or mixed.
   - obtain TTE to evaluate EF
   - monitor respiratory status closely with fluid resuscitation
   - diurese once pressure will tolerate
   # Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: Originally presented with hypoxia and
   dyspnea, likely related to pneumonia.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Does not wish to be intubated
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   # Weakness on neurologic exam:
   Likely that RLE weakness may be due to h/o right hip fracture.  Per
   collateral information from family, she has not been able to walk since
   her hip fracture.
   # Anemia: Has hematocrit of 25 and was given 2 units PRBCs.  Unclear
   how chronic this process is.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct in 6 hours
   - active type and screen
   # History of SIADH: Serum Na currently within normal limits.
   - Monitor serum Na
   # Elevated INR:
   Suspect this may be nutritional as she has no known history of liver
   disease.
   - vitamin K PO, then recheck coags
   - add on LFTs
   # Subcutaneous nodule on abdominal exam, acholic stools:
   Suspect patient may have intraabdominal process, including a possible
   malignancy.
   - check LFTs as above
   - abdominal ultrasound
   # COPD:  continue albuterol
   # Dementia:  patient is at high risk for delirium in house
   - monitor
   #. FEN: NPO for now pending respiratory/hemodynamic improvement
   #. PPX:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   -Bowel regimen with docusate/senna
   ACCESS:  Right IJ; will need arterial line placed
   CODE STATUS:  Per discussion with HCP, will keep her FULL CODE pending
   discussions with court

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of dementia and congestive heart failure who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and septic shock. The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by an infection in the bloodstream. It is crucial to continue monitoring her vital signs, urine output, and mental status closely.

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's history of CHF is evident from the evidence of volume overload on exam and chest X-ray. Further evaluation with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is recommended to assess the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Monitoring her respiratory status closely with fluid resuscitation is also important.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's presentation of hypoxia and dyspnea suggests a possible pulmonary source of infection. Broad coverage with antibiotics, such as Vancomycin/Meropenem and Levaquin, should be continued.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit of 25 indicates anemia. It is unclear how chronic this process is. Repeating Hct in 6 hours, guaiac all stools, and conducting an active type and screen are necessary.

5. History of SIADH: Although the patient's serum Na is currently within normal limits"

   75 year old woman with h/o dementia and CHF who presented with hypoxia,

   # Septic Shock: Patient presented with hypotension requiring pressors.
   Met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis > 12K, RR>20.  Most likely a
   pulmonary source given history of pneumonia in the past, LLL infiltrate
   on CXR, and presentation of hypoxia and dyspnea.  Less likely urinary
   source given relatively clean UA (although this was after Abx).  Was
   given Levaquin/Vancomycin/Imipenem in the [**Hospital1 1294**] ED.  Currently on
   dopamine for pressure support.
   - cautious volume resuscitation given that she is clinically in heart
   failure and is DNR/DNI
   - change dopamine to levophed
   - Will monitor urine output, CVP, mental status, pressor requirement to
   assess fluid resuscitation goals
   - Repeat blood cultures
   - FU blood cultures drawn prior to antibiotics
   - FU urine culture
   - Maintain MAP>65
   - Will broadly cover with Vancomycin/Meropenem (Not giving cefepime or
   Zosyn due to PCN and cephalosporin allergy)/Levaquin for likely
   bacterial pathogens to cause pneumonia
   - unclear why patient was given hydrocortisone at [**Last Name (LF) 1294**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not
   continue for now
   - consider RBCs rather than saline for volume resuscitation given that
   Hct is < 30; however, need to be careful with fluids as above
   - check SvO2
   # Congestive Heart Failure:  Evidence of volume overload on exam and
   chest xray.  Unclear if systolic, diastolic, or mixed.
   - obtain TTE to evaluate EF
   - monitor respiratory status closely with fluid resuscitation
   - diurese once pressure will tolerate
   # Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: Originally presented with hypoxia and
   dyspnea, likely related to pneumonia.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Does not wish to be intubated
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   # Weakness on neurologic exam:
   Likely that RLE weakness may be due to h/o right hip fracture.  Per
   collateral information from family, she has not been able to walk since
   her hip fracture.
   # Anemia: Has hematocrit of 25 and was given 2 units PRBCs.  Unclear
   how chronic this process is.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct in 6 hours
   - active type and screen
   # History of SIADH: Serum Na currently within normal limits.
   - Monitor serum Na
   # Elevated INR:
   Suspect this may be nutritional as she has no known history of liver
   disease.
   - vitamin K PO, then recheck coags
   - add on LFTs
   # Subcutaneous nodule on abdominal exam, acholic stools:
   Suspect patient may have intraabdominal process, including a possible

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of dementia, congestive heart failure (CHF), and pneumonia. She presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, congestive heart failure, hypoxia, respiratory distress, weakness on neurologic exam, anemia, elevated INR, history of SIADH, subcutaneous nodules on abdominal exam, acholic stools, COPD, and dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypoxia, dyspnea, and septic shock indicates a potential infection causing systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
2. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and the findings on physical examination and chest X-ray suggest volume overload, which may indicate worsening CHF.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's difficulty breathing could be due to pneumonia or exacerbation of COPD.
4. Neurologic Complications: Weakness on neurologic exam could be related to the patient's history of dementia or a possible stroke.
5. Anemia: The low hematocrit level and recent blood transfusion suggest the need for further investigation into the cause of anemia.
6. Elevated INR: The prolonged clotting time may indicate a bleeding risk or be related to nutritional deficiencies or liver dysfunction.
7. Abdominal Issues: The presence of subcutaneous"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of dementia, congestive heart failure (CHF), and pneumonia. She presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and septic shock. She is currently on dopamine for pressure support and has been diagnosed with septic shock, CHF, hypoxia, respiratory distress, weakness, anemia, elevated INR, and possible intraabdominal process.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypoxia, dyspnea, and septic shock suggests an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has evidence of volume overload on examination and chest X-ray. Monitoring respiratory status closely with fluid resuscitation and diuresis when tolerated is important to manage CHF symptoms.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's history of pneumonia and current symptoms of hypoxia and respiratory distress indicate a possible recurrence of pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and oxygen supplementation should be provided as needed.
4. Anemia: The patient has a hematocrit of 25, indicating anemia. Repeating Hct in 6 hours, guaiac-ing stools, and conducting further investigations are necessary to determine the cause and manage the anemia appropriately.

   75 year old woman with h/o dementia and CHF who presented with hypoxia,
   dyspnea, and septic shock.
   # Septic Shock: Patient presented with hypotension requiring pressors.
   Met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis > 12K, RR>20.  Most likely a
   pulmonary source given history of pneumonia in the past, LLL infiltrate
   on CXR, and presentation of hypoxia and dyspnea.  Less likely urinary
   source given relatively clean UA (although this was after Abx).  Was
   given Levaquin/Vancomycin/Imipenem in the [**Hospital1 1294**] ED.  Currently on
   dopamine for pressure support.
   - volume cautiously as though she is full code, may be revered to
   dnr/dni this pm
   - cont levophed goal MAP >65
   - Will monitor urine output, CVP, mental status, pressor requirement to
   assess fluid resuscitation goals
   - f/u ctxs
   - continue  Vancomycin/Meropenem /Levaquin for likely bacterial
   pathogens to cause pneumonia, now day 2
   - unclear why patient was given hydrocortisone at [**Last Name (LF) 1294**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] not
   continue for now
   # Congestive Heart Failure:  Evidence of volume overload on exam and
   chest xray.  TTE shows EF60-70%.
   - monitor respiratory status closely with fluid resuscitation
   - lasix IV X1 now (1530) since patient dropped sats
   # Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: Originally presented with hypoxia and
   dyspnea, likely related to pneumonia.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
    # increased LFTS: appears to be metastatic disease given elevated
   CA125 and findings on u/s
   -CT torso when able
   -will help with determining prognosis and goals of care
   # Weakness on neurologic exam:
   Likely that RLE weakness may be due to h/o right hip fracture.  Per
   collateral information from family, she has not been able to walk since
   her hip fracture.
   # Anemia: Has hematocrit of 30 and stable after 2 units PRBCs.  Unclear
   how chronic this process is.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - daily Hct
   - active type and screen
   # History of SIADH: Serum Na currently within normal limits.
   - Monitor serum Na daily
   # Elevated INR:
   Suspect this may be nutritional as she has no known history of liver
   disease.
   # COPD:  continue albuterol
   # Dementia:  patient is at high risk for delirium in house
   - monitor

","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of dementia, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia. She presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and septic shock. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics and is currently on dopamine for pressure support.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise based on her current condition and medical history. These include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of hypotension requiring pressors and meeting SIRS criteria suggests sepsis. It is important to monitor her vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature.

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has evidence of volume overload on exam and chest X-ray. A TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) shows an ejection fraction of 60-70%. It is necessary to monitor her respiratory status closely with fluid resuscitation and consider administering lasix IV to manage fluid overload.

3. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with hypoxia and dyspnea, likely related to pneumonia. Antibiotics have been given, and the patient's oxygen levels should be closely monitored.

4. Increased Liver Function Tests (LFTs): Elevated CA125 and findings on ultrasound suggest metastatic disease. A CT torso when able will help determine prognosis and goals of care.

5. Weakness on Neurologic Exam: The patient's right lower extremity"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with sepsis and pneumonia. The patient also has extensive findings on an abdominal exam concerning for a mass lesion, which was confirmed by an abdominal ultrasound showing extensive malignancy. The primary lesion is unknown, but tumor markers suggest a possible secondary malignancy from ovarian cancer.

The patient's prognosis is poor due to the extensive metastases. The patient has a history of dementia and is currently alert and interactive. She appeared overwhelmed upon learning about the metastatic malignancy.

The patient's current medical complications include hypotension, hypoxemia, anemia, dysphagia, and pneumonia. The pneumonia is considered to be aspiration pneumonia.

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support with speech and swallow therapy, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is currently full code, but there is a discussion underway regarding the possibility of changing it to DNR/DNI, consistent with the patient's wishes.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and potential medical complications may arise due to the extensive metastases, sepsis, and pneumonia. Close monitoring and aggressive management will be necessary to address these complications and provide appropriate care for the patient."

   Met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis > 12K, RR>20.  Most likely a
   pulmonary source given history of pneumonia in the past, LLL infiltrate
   on CXR, and presentation of hypoxia and dyspnea.  Less likely urinary
   source given relatively clean UA (although this was after Abx).  Was
   given Levaquin/Vancomycin/Imipenem in the [**Hospital1 1294**] ED.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of dementia and congestive heart failure who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and septic shock. She has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including septic shock, congestive heart failure, hypoxia, respiratory distress, increased liver function tests, weakness on neurologic exam, anemia, history of SIADH, elevated INR, and COPD.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of hypotension, fever, and leukocytosis suggests sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and crackles in the lungs indicate possible respiratory distress or failure. This can result in inadequate oxygenation of tissues and subsequent organ damage.

3. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient's history of congestive heart failure and evidence of volume overload on exam and chest X-ray suggest an exacerbation of heart failure. This can lead to fluid accumulation, pulmonary edema, and reduced cardiac output.

4. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of hypoxia, dyspnea, and history of pneumonia raise concerns for a possible new or worsening pneumonia. If left untreated, this can progress to respiratory failure.

5. Metastatic disease: The elevated CA125 levels and findings on ultrasound suggest possible metast"

   [**2176-11-22**]:
   CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:
   The thyroid gland is normal. No axillary lymphadenopathy present.
   Within the
   mediastinum, there are two enlarged enhancing lymph nodes, specifically
   pretracheal node measuring 15 mm and a prevascular node measuring 12
   mm. There
   is also right and left anterior descending coronary artery
   calcification,
   pericardial fat, and a left hilar mass with probable left lymphangitic
   spread
   into the left upper lobe. This most likely represents the primary lung
   malignancy.  There is also a left greater than right pleural effusions
   with some
   atelectasis of the bilateral lower lobes. Right jugular catheter ending
   in
   right atrium.
   CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:
   The liver is diffusely enlarged with a large necrotic 46 x 46 mm mass
   in
   segment VI. There are numerous hypodense lesions, with enhancing rim
   representing metastases within the liver. The left adrenal, both
   kidneys,
   pancreas, gallbladder, and spleen are unremarkable. Within the right
   adrenal,
   there is a 21 x 12 mm mass suspicious for adrenal metastases. Also a 13
   x 20
   mm hepatic portal lymph node. Multiple similar nodes are seen
   throughout the
   abdomen. There is diffuse ascites throughout the abdomen. The
   visualized
   small and large bowel appears unremarkable, although there is diffuse
   mesenteric stranding and fluid throughout the abdomen.   Within the
   soft tissues of the abdomen,
    there is a 14 x 0.5 x 21 mm enhancing nodule anteriorly to the left
   (3:64). This is probably the most
   accessible site for biopsy.
   CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:
   The rectum is dilated with stool. The sigmoid colon and bladder are
   unremarkable. There is pelvic free fluid present. The patient is status
   post
   hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. No pelvic lymph nodes are
   present.
   There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy present either.
   OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is a right femoral prosthesis. Otherwise,
   several
   benign-looking sclerotic lesions are seen within the lumbar spine and
   sacral
   ala. No osseous metastases are present.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Left hilar mass with upper lobe lymphangitic spread concerning for a
   primary lung malignancy.
   2. Left greater than right pleural effusions.
   3. Numerous diffuse metastases within the liver and right adrenal
   gland.

   [**2176-11-22**]:
   CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:
   The thyroid gland is normal. No axillary lymphadenopathy present.
   Within the
   mediastinum, there are two enlarged enhancing lymph nodes, specifically
   pretracheal node measuring 15 mm and a prevascular node measuring 12
   mm. There
   is also right and left anterior descending coronary artery
   calcification,
   pericardial fat, and a left hilar mass with probable left lymphangitic
   spread
   into the left upper lobe. This most likely represents the primary lung
   malignancy.  There is also a left greater than right pleural effusions
   with some
   atelectasis of the bilateral lower lobes. Right jugular catheter ending
   in
   right atrium.
   CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:
   The liver is diffusely enlarged with a large necrotic 46 x 46 mm mass
   in
   segment VI. There are numerous hypodense lesions, with enhancing rim
   representing metastases within the liver. The left adrenal, both
   kidneys,
   pancreas, gallbladder, and spleen are unremarkable. Within the right
   adrenal,
   there is a 21 x 12 mm mass suspicious for adrenal metastases. Also a 13
   x 20
   mm hepatic portal lymph node. Multiple similar nodes are seen
   throughout the
   abdomen. There is diffuse ascites throughout the abdomen. The
   visualized
   small and large bowel appears unremarkable, although there is diffuse
   mesenteric stranding and fluid throughout the abdomen.   Within the
   soft tissues of the abdomen,
    there is a 14 x 0.5 x 21 mm enhancing nodule anteriorly to the left
   (3:64). This is probably the most
   accessible site for biopsy.
   CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:
   The rectum is dilated with stool. The sigmoid colon and bladder are
   unremarkable. There is pelvic free fluid present. The patient is status
   post
   hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. No pelvic lymph nodes are
   present.
   There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy present either.
   OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is a right femoral prosthesis. Otherwise,
   several
   benign-looking sclerotic lesions are seen within the lumbar spine and
   sacral
   ala. No osseous metastases are present.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Left hilar mass with upper lobe lymphangitic spread concerning for a
   primary lung malignancy.
   2. Left greater than right pleural effusions.
   3. Numerous diffuse metastases within the liver and right adrenal
   gland.
   4. Left anterior abdominal wall subcutaneous metastasis
   Assessment and Plan
   75 year old woman with h/o dementia and CHF who presented with hypoxia,
   dyspnea, and septic shock.
   # Septic Shock: Patient presented with hypotension requiring pressors.
   Met SIRS criteria with leukocytosis > 12K, RR>20.  Most likely a
   pulmonary source given history of pneumonia in the past, LLL infiltrate
   on CXR, and presentation of hypoxia and dyspnea.  Less likely urinary
   source given relatively clean UA (although this was after Abx

   # Congestive Heart Failure:  Evidence of volume overload on exam and
   chest xray.  TTE shows EF60-70%.
   - monitor respiratory status closely with fluid resuscitation
   - lasix IV as needed for volume overload, worsening dyspnea, hypoxia
    # Increased LFTS: appears to be metastatic disease given elevated

","The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of dementia and congestive heart failure. She presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and septic shock. The patient has multiple medical complications including septic shock, congestive heart failure, increased liver function tests, anemia, history of SIADH, elevated INR, COPD, and dementia.

From the progress note, it can be summarized that the patient was admitted to the ICU with hypotension requiring pressors and presented with signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). She has a history of pneumonia, left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, and hypoxia. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with periods of improvement and deterioration.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of congestive heart failure due to fluid overload, further deterioration of liver function tests, development of delirium or worsening of cognitive status, and the need for ongoing respiratory support. Additionally, there is a concern for potential infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) given the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions. Prompt intervention and adjustments in treatment plans may be necessary to address any potential complications that may arise."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of dementia and congestive heart failure who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and septic shock. She has extensive metastatic disease with an unknown primary, and there are concerns about primary lung malignancy and possible primary ovarian malignancy. The patient's current condition includes sepsis, pneumonia, dementia, hypoxia, congestive heart failure, anemia, history of SIADH, elevated INR, and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing persistent hypotension requiring pressors, and she meets the criteria for sepsis. There is a risk of further deterioration and organ failure if the infection is not effectively managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a likely pulmonary source of infection given her history of pneumonia, LLL infiltrate on CXR, and presentation of hypoxia and dyspnea. Aspiration is a concern, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory status and potential spread of the infection.
3. Metastatic Disease: The extensive metastatic disease increases the risk of further organ involvement and potential complications such as liver failure, renal failure, or neurological complications.
4. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient shows evidence of volume overload on exam and chest x-ray. Close monitoring of respiratory status and fluid resuscitation is necessary to manage this condition effectively.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57.5 kg (admission) and 81.4 kg (current) female with a chief complaint of metastatic cancer diagnosis. She has a history of dementia, pneumonia, aspiration, hypotension, hypoxemia, anemia, dysphagia, and hepatomegaly with multiple liver masses. The patient's condition remains unstable, and she is currently receiving ICU care. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/50 to 112/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is on mechanical ventilation and has been unable to wean off Levophed. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission. The patient has been receiving various medications, including diuretics, antacids, and prophylactic heparin. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal kidney function. She also has elevated liver enzymes and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications. These include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to wean off Levophed suggests ongoing respiratory distress and the potential for respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of dementia and congestive heart failure who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and septic shock. She has extensive metastatic disease with an unknown primary, and there are concerns about primary lung malignancy, as well as metastases to the liver, adrenals, and abdominal wall. CA125 levels are elevated, suggesting a possible primary ovarian malignancy. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications, including pneumonia, aspiration, anemia, congestive heart failure, and SIADH. She is on various medications, including diuretics, antibiotics, and pressors. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metastatic Cancer: The patient has extensive metastatic disease, which can lead to further complications and deterioration of her overall health.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's history of pneumonia and current symptoms suggest that she may develop or have an ongoing infection in her lungs. This can worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of septic shock.
3. Aspiration: Given the patient's dementia and recent findings, she is at high risk for aspiration, which can lead to further respiratory complications and pneumonia.
4. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's history of CHF and evidence of volume overload on exam and chest X-ray indicate that her heart failure may worsen, leading to fluid accumulation and compromised cardiac function.
5. Anemia: The patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of dementia, congestive heart failure (CHF), and septic shock. She presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and septic shock, and was found to have extensive metastatic disease with an unknown primary. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are as follows:

1. Metastatic Disease: The patient has extensive metastatic disease, including metastasis to the liver, adrenals, and abdominal wall. This indicates a advanced stage of cancer which may lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction or failure.

2. Septic Shock: The patient presented with hypotension requiring pressors, leukocytosis (>12K), and RR (>20). These findings suggest septic shock, which can be life-threatening and require immediate medical intervention. Complications may include organ dysfunction, multiple organ failure, and sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a new finding of aspiration, making aspiration pneumonia a likely cause of her current symptoms. Aspiration can lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia, lung abscess, or respiratory failure.

4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has evidence of volume overload on examination and chest x-ray. CHF can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema, acute decompensated heart failure, and cardiogenic shock."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of dementia and congestive heart failure who presented with hypoxia, dyspnea, and septic shock. The patient has extensive metastatic disease with an unknown primary and is currently experiencing agonal breathing, persistent hypotension despite pressors, and unresponsiveness.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is showing signs of respiratory failure with agonal breathing, hypoxemia, and hypercarbia. Immediate intervention will be necessary to manage the patient's airway and breathing.

2. Metastatic Disease: The patient has a LUL mass concerning for primary lung malignancy and extensive metastatic disease to the liver, adrenals, and abdominal wall. This advanced stage of cancer may contribute to the patient's current unstable condition.

3. Sepsis: The patient remains hypotensive despite pressor support, indicating persistent sepsis. Continued management with appropriate antibiotics and hemodynamic support will be essential to prevent further deterioration.

4. Aspiration: The patient is at risk of aspiration due to altered mental status and inability to protect their airway. Proper positioning and measures to prevent aspiration should be implemented.

5. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but close monitoring of blood sugars should be maintained to avoid both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Sepsis: The patient has persistent hypotension requiring pressors and meets the SIRS criteria with leukocytosis (>12K) and RR (>20). This suggests a possible infection leading to sepsis.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's history of pneumonia in the past, along with LLL infiltrate on CXR, hypoxia, and dyspnea, indicates a high likelihood of pneumonia.

3. Metastatic disease: The CT scan shows a LUL mass concerning for primary lung malignancy and extensive metastatic disease. This suggests that the cancer has spread to other organs.

4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): Evidence of volume overload on exam and chest x-ray, along with a TTE showing EF60-70%, indicates CHF.

5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is stable, but further evaluation is needed as the patient is experiencing hypoxia.

6. Dementia: The patient is confused at baseline and at high risk for delirium in the ICU.

7. Elevated coagulation: The patient's coagulation parameters are abnormal, which could be due to nutritional deficiencies, decreased synthetic function of the liver, or tumor lysis syndrome.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 year old woman with h/o dementia and CHF who presented with hypoxia,
   dyspnea, and septic shock, found to have extensive metastatic disease
   with unknown primary.
   # Metastatic Disease: CT shows LUL mass concerning for primary lung
   malignancy and extensive metastatic disease including mets to liver,
   adrenals and abdominal wall.
   -will need goals of care discussion on Monday pending HCP decision with
   court next week
   # Sepsis: Patient with persistent hypotension requiring pressors.  Met
   SIRS criteria with leukocytosis > 12K, RR>20.  Most likely a pulmonary
   source given history of pneumonia in the past, LLL infiltrate on CXR,
   and presentation of hypoxia and dyspnea.  Less likely urinary source
   given relatively clean UA (although this was after Abx.  Patient also
   with new finding of aspiration, making aspiration most likely cause of
   pneumonia
   - volume cautiously as she is dnr/dni
   - cont levophed goal MAP >65, wean as tolerated
   - Will monitor urine output, CVP, mental status, pressor requirement to
   assess fluid resuscitation goals
   - f/u pending cultures
   - continue  Vancomycin/Levaquin for likely bacterial pathogens to cause
   pneumonia, now day 4 of 8; will d/c meropenem today
   - NPO as pt grossly aspirating
   .
   # Elevated coags: Suspect this may be nutritional and decreased
   synthetic function of liver, also possibly DIC or tumor lysis
   - Add on DIC labs
   - Check LFTs daily
   .
   # Dementia:  Pt confused at baseline and is at high risk for delirium
   in house; will monitor closely.
   - treat with low-dose antipsychotics as needed
   .
   # Hypoxia: Most likely secondary to lymphangitic spread of malignancy,
   as seen on Chest CT, with possible contributions from pulm edema and
   aspiration .
   -Will wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   # Congestive Heart Failure:  Evidence of volume overload on exam and
   chest xray.  TTE shows EF60-70%.
   - monitor respiratory status closely with fluid resuscitation
   - lasix IV as needed for volume overload, worsening dyspnea, hypoxia
   # Anemia: Hematocrit stable
   - Guaiac all stools
   - daily Hct
   - active type and screen
   # History of SIADH: Serum Na now improved at 138.
   - Monitor serum Na daily
   # COPD:  Continue albuterol
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now given gross aspiration

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Sepsis: The patient has persistent hypotension requiring pressors and meets SIRS criteria with leukocytosis (>12K) and increased RR (>20). This suggests a possible septic shock due to a pulmonary source, likely pneumonia. The patient's history of previous pneumonia, LLL infiltrate on CXR, and presentation of hypoxia and dyspnea support this diagnosis. Monitoring urine output, CVP, mental status, and pressor requirements will be important to assess fluid resuscitation goals.

2. Metastatic Disease: The CT scan shows extensive metastatic disease, including a primary lung malignancy and metastases to the liver, adrenals, and abdominal wall. This indicates advanced stage cancer, which may contribute to the patient's overall decline in health.

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has evidence of volume overload on exam and chest x-ray. A TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) shows an ejection fraction of 60-70%, suggesting preserved left ventricular function. Monitoring respiratory status closely with fluid resuscitation and administering IV lasix as needed will help manage CHF symptoms.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is stable, so active intervention for anemia is not currently indicated. However, it is important to monitor the Hct and consider transfusion"
