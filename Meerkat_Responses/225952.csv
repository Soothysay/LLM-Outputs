   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 1161**] is a 69F with MMP including chronic ventilator dependence s/p
   trachostomy [**4-/2139**], highly resistant pseudomonal PNA's, COPD on home
   oxygen, obstructive sleep apnea, diastolic HF, and Type II diabetes
   mellitus.  She presented to the ED today after she was found to be
   hypotensive and febrile at [**Hospital1 82**].
   .
   #. Hypotension: Likely sepsis in the setting of fevers, leukocytosis,
   elevated lactate, and a positive UA.  Possible sources include urine
   vs. her recently infected PICC line.  Low suspicion for PNA given clear
   CXR.  She is currently stable after 4L of NS and levophed, with a CVP
   of [**8-20**] and MAPs in the 70s, and lactates trending down.  Looking at
   past culture data, she has had many infections with highly resistant
   organisms, including MRSA and highly resistant pseudomonas.  Last micro
   from urine [**4-/2139**] with pseudomonas resistant to cipro, otherwise
   sensitive.
   -Empiric coverage with vancomycin and cefepime for now to cover for
   line and urosepsis, can peel off vanco if blood cultures negative.
   Dosing vanco by levels
   -Urine and blood cultures pending
   -IVF boluses with goal CVP >12
   -Levophed to keep MAP >65
   -Obtain a mixed venous 02 sat
   -Monitor UOP
   .
   #. ?Distended Abdomen: Some concern for ischemic bowel in the setting
   of elevated lactate and hypotension.  Passing stool and flatus in the
   ED with guaiac negative stools.  Surgery has already evaluated the
   patient, and has low suspicion.
   -Serial abdominal exams
   -Trend lactate
   -F/u surgery recs
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8, 3.4 on
   admission, and has trended down to 2.5 with fluid resuscitation.  Urine
   output has not picked up despite adequate volume resuscitation and CVP
   at goal.  THis raises suspicion for ATN
   -Will send urine lytes and sediment
   .
   #. Metabolic acidosis: Initially an anion gap lactic acidosis, now a
   non-gap acidosis likely secondary to normal saline
   -Switch to LR for volume
   .
   #. Chronic vent dependence: Seems to have happened during her last
   admission, where she required a long period of intubation for
   respiratory failure in the setting of PNA.  Currently dysynchronous
   with the ventilator.  Recent ABG 7.29/39/117 on pressure support [**1-18**],
   with spontanous tidal volumes 525.  PIPs and plateaus under 30
   -Monitor serial ABGs and adjust prn
   -Watch PIPs closely as the patient is tachypnic to monitor for auto
   PEEP
   .
   #. COPD
   -continue home albuterol and ipratropim nebs, continue current steroid
   taper
   .
   #. Diabetes Mellitus
   -ISS
   .
   #. Chronic diastolic heart failure: does not appear volume overloaded
   on exam.
   -Holding home beta blocker and lasix in the setting of hypotension
   .
   #. Hypertension
   -Hold home diltiazem, hydralazine, beta blocker
   .
   #. Seizure disorder
   -continue home oxacarbazine

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including chronic ventilator dependence, highly resistant pseudomonal pneumonia, COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, diastolic heart failure, and Type II diabetes mellitus. She presented to the emergency department with hypotension and fever and is currently in the ICU.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension could be due to sepsis in the setting of fevers, leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and a positive urine analysis. Possible sources include urinary tract infection or a recently infected peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line.

2. Distended Abdomen: There is some concern for ischemic bowel in the setting of elevated lactate and hypotension. The patient has passed stool and flatus in the emergency department, and surgery has already evaluated the patient with low suspicion.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels were 1.5-1.8, but on admission, it was 3.4. With fluid resuscitation, the creatinine has trended down to 2.5, but urine output has not improved despite adequate volume resuscitation and CVP at goal. This raises suspicion for acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

4. Metabolic Acidosis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, and recent hospitalization with a rectal sheath hematoma and pneumonia with highly resistant Pseudomonas. The patient presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and sepsis.

The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, arterial line, multi-lumen catheter, and pre-sep catheter. The patient's blood pressure has been managed with Levophed, and a right internal jugular (RIJ) placed along with a line in the external drain (ED). The patient's urine output has slightly increased, and central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range.

The patient's allergies include Captopril, Neurontin (Gabapentin), shellfish, NSAIDs, Promethazine, and abnormal movements. The patient is also on various medications such as Norepinephrine, antibiotics, and other ICU medications.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/50 mmHg to 149/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator.

The patient's physical examination reveals an overweight/obese appearance, normal pupils, tracheostomy site, wheezing breath sounds, distended abdomen, warm skin, and no peripheral pulses. Neurological examination shows the patient to be sedated, not attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, purposeful movement, and no muscle tone assessed.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine level, decreased total CO2 level, elevated glucose level, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low potassium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. Fluid analysis shows a decreased gap, low systemic vascular oxygen saturation (svO2), and increased lactate levels.

Imaging and microbiology results are pending. The patient's assessment includes hypotension/urosepsis, acute renal failure, distended abdomen, and other medical conditions. The plan involves fluid resuscitation, weaning of pressors, and monitoring of various parameters such as CVP, SVO2, lactate trends, and serial exams.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of renal function, worsening of sepsis, development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and recent prolonged hospitalization with rectal sheath hematoma, pneumonia with highly resistant Pseudomonas, status post (s/p) tracheostomy. She presents with hypotension, acute kidney injury (AKI), and sepsis, likely from urosepsis. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 127/50-149/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 7-10 mmHg.

The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, arterial line, multi-lumen catheter, and pre-sep catheter. She has received fluid resuscitation and weaning of pressors with levophed at 0.03 mcg/kg/min. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL, and lactic acid levels of 3.2 mmol/L. Imaging studies are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is critically ill with hypotension, ARF, and sepsis likely from urosepsis. She has been fluid-resuscitated with CVB > 10, weaning of pressors MAP > 60, and SvO2 > 70%. Lactate trends are being monitored, and coverage with vancomycin, cefepime, and amikacin has been initiated. 

The patient has distended abdomen with low suspicion of ischemic gut, non-tender exam, heme negative rectal, and surgery following. Serial exams, trend lactates, and weaning of pressors are planned.

Acute respiratory failure is present with oxygenating well on clear chest X-ray. The patient is over-breathing on assist-control ventilation (ACV) but more comfortable on pressure support (PS) with excellent volumes. ABG follow-up is planned, and if trending down, a change to ACV with increased sedation will be considered.

Other assessments include COPD with wheezy, steroid taper continuation, diastolic dysfunction with dry appearance, hold lasix, and hypotensive. Seizure disorder is being continued on trileptal.

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and communication. The patient is on full code status and currently in the ICU."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 1161**] is a 69F with MMP including chronic ventilator dependence s/p
   trachostomy [**4-/2139**], highly resistant pseudomonal PNA's, COPD on home
   oxygen, obstructive sleep apnea, diastolic HF, and Type II diabetes
   mellitus.  She presented to the ED today after she was found to be
   hypotensive and febrile at [**Hospital1 82**].
    .
   #. Hypotension: Likely sepsis in the setting of fevers, leukocytosis,
   elevated lactate, and a positive UA.  Possible sources include urine
   vs. her recently infected PICC line.  Low suspicion for PNA given clear
   CXR.  She is currently stable after 4L of NS and levophed, with a CVP
   of [**8-20**] and MAPs in the 70s, and lactates trending down.  Looking at
   past culture data, she has had many infections with highly resistant
   organisms, including MRSA and highly resistant pseudomonas.  Last micro
   from urine [**4-/2139**] with pseudomonas resistant to cipro, otherwise
   sensitive.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including chronic ventilator dependence, highly resistant pseudomonal PNA's, COPD, obstructive sleep apnea, diastolic HF, and Type II diabetes mellitus. She was found hypotensive and febrile at the hospital and is currently in the ICU for sepsis. She has been experiencing hypotension, elevated lactate levels, and a positive urine analysis indicating possible sources of infection such as urine or a recently infected PICC line. Her recent history includes multiple infections with highly resistant organisms, including MRSA and highly resistant pseudomonas.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to sepsis, which is supported by her fevers, leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and positive urine analysis. It is important to closely monitor her blood pressure and cardiovascular status.
2. Distended Abdomen: The patient's distended abdomen raises concerns for ischemic bowel, especially considering her elevated lactate levels and hypotension. However, initial evaluation by surgery has low suspicion for this condition.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels have been elevated, and her recent creatinine level is 3.2. Despite adequate volume resuscitation, her urine output remains low, which raises suspicion for acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Further evaluation of urine"

   mellitus.  She presented to the ED today after she was found to be
   hypotensive and febrile at [**Hospital1 82**].

   #. Hypotension: Likely sepsis in the setting of fevers, leukocytosis,
   elevated lactate, and a positive UA.  Possible sources include urine
   vs. her recently infected PICC line.  Low suspicion for PNA given clear
   CXR.  She is currently stable after 4L of NS and levophed, with a CVP
   of [**8-20**] and MAPs in the 70s, and lactates trending down.  Looking at
   past culture data, she has had many infections with highly resistant
   organisms, including MRSA and highly resistant pseudomonas.  Last micro

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 1161**] is a 69F with MMP including chronic ventilator dependence s/p
   trachostomy [**4-/2139**], highly resistant pseudomonal PNA's, COPD on home
   oxygen, obstructive sleep apnea, diastolic HF, and Type II diabetes
   mellitus.  She presented to the ED today after she was found to be
   hypotensive and febrile at [**Hospital1 82**].
    .
   #. Hypotension: Likely sepsis in the setting of fevers, leukocytosis,
   elevated lactate, and a positive UA.  Possible sources include urine
   vs. her recently infected PICC line.  Low suspicion for PNA given clear
   CXR.  She is currently stable after 4L of NS and levophed, with a CVP
   of [**8-20**] and MAPs in the 70s, and lactates trending down.  Looking at
   past culture data, she has had many infections with highly resistant
   organisms, including MRSA and highly resistant pseudomonas.  Last micro
   from urine [**4-/2139**] with pseudomonas resistant to cipro, otherwise
   sensitive.
   -Empiric coverage with vancomycin and cefepime for now to cover for
   line and urosepsis, can peel off vanco if blood cultures negative.
   Dosing vanco by levels
   -Urine and blood cultures pending
   -IVF boluses with goal CVP >12
   -Levophed to keep MAP >65
   -Obtain a mixed venous 02 sat
   -Monitor UOP
   .
   #. ?Distended Abdomen: Some concern for ischemic bowel in the setting
   of elevated lactate and hypotension.  Passing stool and flatus in the
   ED with guaiac negative stools.  Surgery has already evaluated the
   patient, and has low suspicion.
   -Serial abdominal exams
   -lactate now normal
   -F/u surgery recs
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-1.8, 3.4 on
   admission, and has trended down to 2.5 with fluid resuscitation but now
   back up to 3.2.  Urine output has not picked up despite adequate volume
   resuscitation and CVP at goal.  THis raises suspicion for ATN although
   urine lytes were more consistent with pre-Renal.
   -Will repeat urine lytes and sediment
   - continue to follow, and volume recusucitate
   .
   #. Metabolic acidosis: Initially an anion gap lactic acidosis, now a
   non-gap acidosis likely secondary to normal saline
   -Switch to LR for volume
   - trend
   .
   #. Chronic vent dependence: Seems to have happened during her last
   admission, where she required a long period of intubation for
   respiratory failure in the setting of PNA.  Currently dysynchronous
   with the ventilator.  Recent ABG 7.29/39/117 on pressure support [**1-18**],
   with spontanous tidal volumes 525.  PIPs and plateaus under 30
   -Monitor serial ABGs and adjust prn
   -Watch PIPs closely as the patient is tachypnic to monitor for auto
   PEEP

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including chronic ventilator dependence, highly resistant pseudomonal PNA's, COPD on home oxygen, obstructive sleep apnea, diastolic HF, and Type II diabetes mellitus. She presented to the ED with hypotension and fever, and was found to have leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and a positive urine analysis (UA). The patient is currently stable after receiving 4 liters of normal saline (NS) and levophed, with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-20 and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 70s, and lactates trending down.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension could be due to sepsis, considering the presence of fever, leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and a positive UA. Possible sources of infection include the urine or the recently infected peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. However, there is low suspicion for pneumonia (PNA) given the clear chest X-ray (CXR).

2. Distended Abdomen: There is some concern for ischemic bowel in the setting of elevated lactate and hypotension. The patient passed stool and flatus in the emergency department, and her guaiac negative stools indicate no active bleeding. Surgery has already evaluated the"

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient is currently in the ICU due to fevers, hypotension, and acute renal failure. 

The patient has a history of recent prolonged hospitalization with a rectal sheath hematoma and pneumonia with highly resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She also has a tracheostomy.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.3°C (100.9°F)
- Heart rate: 106 bpm
- Blood pressure: 136/69 mmHg (with readings ranging from 91/48 to 172/89 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 98%
- Sinus tachycardia

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation in CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 599 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 30. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.31, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 123 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -8, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 98%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, tremulousness with touching, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, clear breath sounds with tracheostomy, soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present but hypoactive, warm skin without rash or jaundice, and attentive neurologic status with normal tone.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.3 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, slightly low platelet count of 18 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dL, low potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L, normal sodium level of 137 mg/dL, elevated glucose level of 200 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 17.0 mmol/L. Other labs are within normal range or only slightly abnormal.

Imaging shows a chest X-ray indicating possible skin fold versus effusion on the left base, no other focal infiltrates, tracheostomy, and intra-jugular central venous catheter in place.

Microbiology results indicate positive blood cultures for Staphylococcus aureus.

The assessment and plan include multiple issues such as hypotension/sepsis, distended abdomen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic heart failure, and type 2 diabetes. He has been hospitalized with a rectal sheath hematoma and pneumonia caused by highly resistant Pseudomonas. The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, acute kidney injury (ARF), and urosepsis. He is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and has good oxygenation. His laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and acute kidney injury. Imaging shows no focal infiltrate on chest X-ray. Microbiology results are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension/Urosepsis: The patient is hypotensive and has evidence of urosepsis. He requires aggressive fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's ARF is likely due to sepsis-induced hypoperfusion. He should be closely monitored, and renal replacement therapy may be required.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation. His ABG results should be closely monitored, and adjustments to ventilation settings may be necessary.
4. COPD: The patient has COPD and is wheezy. Steroid taper should be continued, and"

   1. Patchy airspace opacities seen at the lung base as noted.
   2. Possible mass lesion within the interpolar region of the right
   kidney for
   which further evaluation by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is recommended.
   3. Cholelithiasis.
   4. Large lipoma is again seen within the pelvis on the right.
   Echo:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The number
   of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve is not
   well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Cannot assess endocarditis. If
   clinically indicated, a TEE is recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 1161**] is a 69F with multiple medical problems including COPD,
   diastolic dysfunction (EF 50%), DM, and respiratory failure s/p
   tracheostomy; who presented with fever,hypotension, and acute renal
   failure.  Found to have a positive UA, coagulase positive staph
   bacteremia and pre-renal failure not responsive to fluids.
   Septic shock: Now weaned off pressors, with CVPs and MAPs at goal and
   afebrile x 24hrs.  [**Known lastname 1526**] cultures with 1/4 bottles positive with coag
   positive staph sensitive to vancomycin, urine still [**Known lastname 1257**] with
   positive UA.  Treated with cefepime for presumed UTI based on past
   urine cultures and sensitivities, and vancomycin given hx of PICC
   infection.  Per OSH, this was staph hominis for which the patient had
   received a course of vanc and amikacin, with negative surveillance
   cultures.  Echo inconclusive with poor imaging quality, nothing seen on
   valves.
   -continue vanc and cefepime, renally dosing with daily vanc troughs
   -continue to monitor CVP and MAP, keeping at goal with IVF adding
   pressors prn
   -S/p stress dose steroids with inadequate [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim response, now
   tapering as off pressors
   -consider TEE to completely r/o endocarditis
   -surveillance cultures until negative
   Elevated LDH: PCP added on to sputum
   -Consider w/u for hemolysis with haptoglobin, direct bili, smear
   -CT showing renal mass, will need MRI vs. CT with contrast to further
   evaluate when renal failure stabilizes
    Distended abdomen: On admission noted to have a distended abdomen,
   lactates normalized, and guaiac negative.  Surgery recommending serial
   abdominal exams only, CT ab/pelvis negative for obstruction.
   -Serial exams
   -F/u final read CT
   ARF: Urine lytes with FeNa of 0.9%, and FeUrea of 25% reflecting
   pre-renal failure.  Very hypovolemic on admission, but has been
   minimally responsive to fluids with oliguria despite CVPs and MAPs at
   goal.  ATN also in the differential as this occured in the setting of

","Summary:
- The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including COPD, diastolic dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, and respiratory failure after tracheostomy.
- She presented with fever, hypotension, and acute renal failure.
- She had a positive urine analysis with coagulase-positive Staph bacteremia and pre-renal failure not responsive to fluids.
- Septic shock was diagnosed, and she was treated with cefepime for presumed urinary tract infection based on past urine cultures and sensitivities, as well as vancomycin given her history of PICC infection.
- An echocardiogram was inconclusive due to poor imaging quality, and no vegetations were seen on the valves.
- The patient's condition improved, with stabilization of blood pressure and heart rate, resolution of fever, and improvement in renal function.
- The patient's current medications include vancomycin and cefepime, which are being renally dosed with daily vancomycin troughs.
- She is being closely monitored for any signs of endocarditis, and surveillance cultures are being taken until they become negative.
- Other concerns include an elevated LDH level, a renal mass seen on CT scan, a distended abdomen, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, and seizure disorder.
- The patient's nutritional support includes receiving Nutren Renal (Full) at 30 mL/hour.

   3. Cholelithiasis.
   4. Large lipoma is again seen within the pelvis on the right.
   Echo:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The number
   of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve is not
   well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Cannot assess endocarditis. If
   clinically indicated, a TEE is recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems including COPD, diastolic dysfunction, DM, and respiratory failure, presented with fever, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient was found to have a positive urine analysis (UA), coagulase-positive staph bacteremia, and pre-renal failure not responsive to fluids. The patient was diagnosed with septic shock and treated with vancomycin and cefepime. An echocardiogram (echo) was inconclusive due to poor imaging quality, and no masses or vegetations were seen on the mitral valve. The patient's condition improved, but they continue to have oliguria and pre-renal failure. Other issues include elevated LDH, abdominal distension, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, and seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient's echo was inconclusive, and there is a possibility of endocarditis. A transesophageal echo (TEE) may be recommended to rule out endocarditis.
2. Renal Mass: A CT scan showed a possible mass lesion within the interpolar region of the right kidney. Further evaluation by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is recommended.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has pre-renal failure and oliguria, indicating AKI. Continued monitoring and management are necessary.

   1. Patchy airspace opacities seen at the lung base as noted.
   2. Possible mass lesion within the interpolar region of the right
   kidney for
   which further evaluation by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is recommended.
   3. Cholelithiasis.
   4. Large lipoma is again seen within the pelvis on the right.
   Echo:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The number
   of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve is not
   well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
   vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded
   due to suboptimal image quality. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Cannot assess endocarditis. If
   clinically indicated, a TEE is recommended.

   tracheostomy; who presented with fever,hypotension, and acute renal
   failure.  Found to have a positive UA, coagulase positive staph
   bacteremia and pre-renal failure not responsive to fluids.
   Septic shock: Now weaned off pressors, with CVPs and MAPs at goal and
   afebrile x 24hrs.  [**Known lastname 1526**] cultures with 1/4 bottles positive with coag
   positive staph sensitive to vancomycin, urine still [**Known lastname 1257**] with
   positive UA.  Treated with cefepime for presumed UTI based on past
   urine cultures and sensitivities, and vancomycin given hx of PICC
   infection.  Per OSH, this was staph hominis for which the patient had
   received a course of vanc and amikacin, with negative surveillance
   cultures.  Echo inconclusive with poor imaging quality, nothing seen on
   valves.
   -continue vanc and cefepime, renally dosing with daily vanc troughs
   -continue to monitor CVP and MAP, keeping at goal with IVF adding

   -Consider w/u for hemolysis with haptoglobin, direct bili, smear
   -CT showing renal mass, will need MRI vs. CT with contrast to further

    Distended abdomen: On admission noted to have a distended abdomen,
   lactates normalized, and guaiac negative.  Surgery recommending serial
   abdominal exams only, CT ab/pelvis negative for obstruction.
   -Serial exams
   -F/u final read CT
   ARF: Urine lytes with FeNa of 0.9%, and FeUrea of 25% reflecting
   pre-renal failure.  Very hypovolemic on admission, but has been
   minimally responsive to fluids with oliguria despite CVPs and MAPs at
   goal.  ATN also in the differential as this occured in the setting of
   hypotension.  Given home lasix dose with minimal response

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including COPD, diastolic dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, and respiratory failure after tracheostomy. She presented with fever, hypotension, and acute renal failure. She was found to have a positive urine analysis for coagulase-positive Staph bacteremia and pre-renal failure not responsive to fluids. She was treated with cefepime for presumed urinary tract infection and vancomycin due to a history of PICC line infection. An echocardiogram showed low normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 50-55%) and mild mitral regurgitation, but could not rule out endocarditis due to suboptimal image quality. The patient remains on vancomycin and cefepime, with daily vancomycin troughs, and is being closely monitored for CVP and MAP levels. She also has elevated LDH levels and has been started on PCP treatment. A CT scan showed a renal mass, and further evaluation with MRI or CT with contrast is recommended when renal failure stabilizes. The patient has a distended abdomen but no evidence of obstruction on CT abdomen/pelvis. She is being managed with serial abdominal exams and follow-up CT if necessary. She has acute renal failure with pre-renal causes, and her urine sodium and urea reflect this. She is receiving minimal fluids with oliguria despite goal CVPs and MAPs"

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese, anxious. The cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 sounds, and no murmurs are heard. The respiratory examination shows symmetric chest expansion and rhonchorous breath sounds. The abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. The extremities show no cyanosis or clubbing, and the skin is warm. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movements.

Laboratory results indicate the following:
- Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 209 K/uL
- Sodium: 134 mg/dL
- Potassium: 4.4 mEq/L
- Creatinine: 3.0 mg/dL (3.4-2.5-3.3)
- Glucose: 126 mg/dL
- Blood urea nitrogen: 41 mg/dL
- Calcium: 7.6 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
- Phosphate: 4.9 mg/dL
- Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L
- Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
- LDH: 2958 IU/L

Imaging studies show patchy ASD lung bases, possible right kidney mass, gallstones, lipoma, negative abscess, and SBO. The trans-thoracic echo shows no obvious vegetations, limited study, low normal EF.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension/septic shock, urine output, acute renal failure, abdominal distension, metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, COPD exacerbation, diastolic dysfunction, hypertension, and possible seizures. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of these complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including MMP (possibly meaning multi-systemic pathology or metabolic syndrome), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), diastolic CHF (congestive heart failure), DM2 (type 2 diabetes mellitus), and a recent prolonged hospitalization with a rectal sheath hematoma and PNA (pneumonia) with highly resistant Pseudomonas.

The patient presents with fevers, hypotension, and acute renal failure (ARF). She has been diagnosed with septic shock, as evidenced by hypotension and the presence of CPS (colony-forming units) in her blood. The patient's abdominal distension was initially attributed to a possible right kidney mass, but subsequent imaging ruled out abscess or bowel obstruction.

The patient's respiratory failure has improved with CPAP/PSV ventilation and high-flow oxygen, but she continues to have metabolic acidosis. Her COPD is being managed with steroid taper and MDI (metered-dose inhaler). She also has diastolic dysfunction and hypertension, for which her blood pressure medications were initially held but have now been restarted.

The patient's elevated LDH levels are being monitored, as well as her electrolyte levels, and she is receiving nutritional support through a renal formula diet. The patient's lines, including an arterial line and presep catheter, have been placed. Prophylactic measures for"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, recent prolonged hospitalization with rectal sheath hematoma, pneumonia with highly resistant Pseudomonas, and respiratory failure after tracheostomy. The patient presents with fevers, hypotension, and acute renal failure.

Key findings from the medical history and physical examination include:

1. Septic shock: The patient has signs of septic shock, which is a severe infection causing low blood pressure and poor perfusion.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to sepsis-induced low blood flow and pre-renal causes. Initial response to hydration was seen, but the patient remains on dialysis and requires careful monitoring of urine output and electrolytes.

3. Urine/Orosepsis: There is a concern for urinary tract infection or urosepsis, as indicated by pending urine culture results.

4. Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CABSI): The patient had a recent line infection, and there is a possibility of a central line-associated bloodstream infection.

5. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has AKI, which can be caused by sepsis and decreased renal perfusion. The patient initially responded to hydration but continues to require careful monitoring.

6. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient initially had"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 1161**] is a 69F with multiple medical problems including COPD,
   diastolic dysfunction (EF 50%), DM, and respiratory failure s/p
   tracheostomy; who presented with fever,hypotension, and acute renal
   failure.  Found to have a positive UA, coagulase positive staph
   bacteremia and pre-renal failure not responsive to fluids.
   .
   Septic shock: Now weaned off pressors, with CVPs and MAPs at goal and
   afebrile x 24hrs.  Blood cultures with 1/4 bottles positive with coag
   positive staph sensitive to vancomycin, urine still pending with
   positive UA and now with UCx >100K GNR.  Treated with cefepime for
   presumed UTI based on past urine cultures and sensitivities, and
   vancomycin given hx of PICC infection.  Per OSH, this was staph hominis
   for which the patient had received a course of vanc and amikacin, with
   negative surveillance cultures.  Echo inconclusive with poor imaging
   quality, nothing seen on valves.
   -continue vanc and cefepime, renally dosing with daily vanc troughs
   -continue to monitor CVP and MAP, keeping at goal with IVF adding
   pressors prn although currently hypertensive
   -S/p stress dose steroids with inadequate [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim response, now
   tapering as off pressors
   -consider TEE to completely r/o endocarditis
   -surveillance cultures until negative
   - Continue cefepime until sensitivities on urine returned and narrow as
   indicated.  Change foley, repeat Ua, UCx s/p foley change.

   Mental Status: This AM arousable only to sternal rub and with
   difficulty maintaining alertness.  New fentanyl patch applied earlier.
   Change to lower dose.  Finger stick normal.  Avoid other sedating
   medications.  ABG without CO2 narcosis.  If does not arouse with
   removal of new patch will try narcan to ensure can be awoken. CT head
   if no further change.
   - Repeat Ua.
   .
   Elevated LDH: PCP added on to sputum, no e/o hemolysis at this time and
   LDH returning to normal.
   -f/u PCP in sputum
   [**Name9 (PRE) 2818**] showing renal mass, will need MRI vs. CT with contrast to further
   evaluate when renal failure stabilizes
   .
   ARF: Urine lytes with FeNa of 0.9%, and FeUrea of 25% reflecting
   pre-renal failure.  Very hypovolemic on admission, but has been
   minimally responsive to fluids with oliguria despite CVPs and MAPs at
   goal.  ATN also in the differential as this occured in the setting of
   hypotension.  Given home lasix dose with minimal response
   -Continue to maintain CVP 10-12
   -ATN usuallly resolves, in the [**Last Name (LF) 2811**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] check [**Hospital1 **] lytes to
   ensure there is no urgent need for dialysis

   COPD-Currently with metabolic acidosis and respiratory compensation.
   Serum pH more acidotic today and patient clearly tacypneic on exam.
   Follow with [**Hospital1 **] ABG's and consider increasing ventilatory support PRN

","Summary:
Ms [**Known Last Name 1161**] is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems including COPD, diastolic dysfunction (EF 50%), DM, and respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy; who presented with fever, hypotension, and acute renal failure. She has a positive urine analysis, coagulase positive staph bacteremia, and pre-renal failure not responsive to fluids. The patient is now weaned off pressors, with CVPs and MAPs at goal and afebrile for 24 hours. Blood cultures are positive with coag positive staph sensitive to vancomycin, urine still pending with positive UA and UCx >100K GNR. She is being treated with cefepime for presumed UTI based on past urine cultures and sensitivities, and vancomycin given her history of PICC infection. An echocardiogram is inconclusive with poor imaging quality, showing nothing on valves. Other findings include mental status changes, elevated LDH, possible renal mass on imaging, pre-renal failure, hypertension, COPD exacerbation, metabolic acidosis, respiratory failure, diastolic dysfunction, and seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient has positive urine analysis and bacteremia with coagulase positive staph, which suggests a urinary tract infection that has spread to the bloodstream.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms [**Known Last Name 1161**], a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems including COPD, diastolic dysfunction (EF 50%), DM, and respiratory failure post tracheostomy, presented with fever, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient was found to have a positive urine analysis (UA), coagulase-positive staph bacteremia, and pre-renal failure not responsive to fluids. 

Septic shock was diagnosed, and the patient was weaned off pressors with CVPs and MAPs at goal and afebrile for 24 hours. Blood cultures showed coagulase-positive staph sensitive to vancomycin, while urine cultures showed >100K GNR. The patient was treated with cefepime for presumed UTI based on past urine cultures and sensitivities, and vancomycin was given due to a history of PICC infection. An echocardiogram (Echo) was inconclusive with poor imaging quality, and no abnormalities were seen on valves.

The patient's mental status is described as arousable only to sternal rub and with difficulty maintaining alertness. Fentanyl patches have been applied, and sedating medications have been avoided. The patient's elevated lactate levels have normalized, and there is no evidence of hemolysis at this time.

Renal failure is still present, and the patient has anuria despite CVPs and MAPs at goal"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including MMP, COPD, diastolic CHF, DM2, recent prolonged hospitalization with rectal sheath hematoma, PNA with highly resistant pseudomonas, and respiratory failure post tracheostomy. She presents with fevers, hypotension, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been diagnosed with presumed urosepsis, septic shock, and bacteremia caused by MRSA and GNR. She also has elevated liver enzymes and an altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension, and her respiratory status is stable with good oxygenation. Her renal function remains impaired, as indicated by elevated BUN and creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes are somewhat abnormal, with low calcium and magnesium levels. Her coagulation profile shows an elevated PT/INR and PTT.

Imaging studies reveal a renal mass in the right kidney and gallstones, but no significant changes in the chest X-ray. Microbiology tests indicate MRSA in the blood culture on 6/27 and a high count of GNR in the urine culture on 6/29.

The patient's active issues include septic shock, presumed urosepsis, CPS bacteremia, and altered mental status. The plan includes maintaining blood pressure off pressors with a MAP greater than 60, continuing cefepime, changing the Foley catheter, rechecking cultures,"

   Imaging: CT Head:IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
   Interval removal of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes with improved
   aeration in the visualized paranasal sinuses; opacification of the
   sphenoid sinus and mastoid air cells
   persists.
   .
   EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to persistent
   delta
   frequency slowing in the left temporal region consistent with an
   underlying area of cortical and subcortical dysfunction. The tracing
   cannot specify the etiology. In addition, the background was
   disorganized, slow, and interrupted by bursts of moderate amplitude
   generalized delta frequency slowing. This latter constellation of
   findings is consistent with a moderate global diffuse encephalopathy
   and
   suggests dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline
   structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, infection and anoxia
   are among the common causes of encephalopathy but there are others.
   There were no epileptiform features and no electrographic seizure
   activity was noted.
   Microbiology: Sputum [**6-28**]: MRSA+, +Pseudomonas
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms [**Known lastname 1161**] is a 69F with multiple medical problems including COPD,
   diastolic dysfunction (EF 50%), DM, and respiratory failure s/p
   tracheostomy; who presented with fever,hypotension, and acute renal
   failure.  Found to have a positive UA, coagulase positive staph
   bacteremia and pre-renal failure not responsive to fluids.
   .
   Septic shock: Now weaned off pressors, with CVPs and MAPs at goal and
   afebrile.  Blood cultures with 1/4 bottles positive with coag positive
   staph sensitive to vancomycin, urine with positive UA and now with UCx
   >100K GNR.  Treated with cefepime for presumed UTI but cultures growing
   on antibiotics.  Previous urine cultures sensitive.  Per OSH, only
   culture was staph hominis in blood for which the patient had received a
   course of vanc and amikacin, with negative surveillance cultures.  Echo
   inconclusive with poor imaging quality, nothing seen on valves.
   -continue vanc and cefepime, renally dosing with daily vanc troughs
   -continue to monitor CVP and MAP, keeping at goal with IVF adding
   pressors prn although currently hypertensive
   -S/p stress dose steroids with inadequate [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim response, now
   tapering as off pressors
 on home prednisone dose.
   -consider TEE to completely r/o endocarditis
 but given increasing
   likelihood that this is contaminant will hold on TEE for now.
   -surveillance cultures until negative
   - Continue cefepime until sensitivities on urine returned and narrow as
   indicated.  Change foley, repeat Ua, UCx s/p foley change.
   - Culture data from [**Hospital1 82**] (up to date as of today): BCx: [**6-27**] :
   NGTD [**5-15**], [**6-9**]: NGTD
 finalized, [**6-5**]: Staph Hominus
 bottles
   finalized.
   .
   Mental Status: This AM arousable only to sternal rub and with
   difficulty maintaining alertness.  Holding sedating medications.
   Finger stick normal.  ABG without CO2 narcosis.  Had been getting
   benzos and given new liver dysfunction may be impaired hepatic
   metabolism of benzos, acidosis, UTI.  CT Head negative/EEG negative.
   Most c/w toxic/metabolic delerium from meds/infections.
   - Consider MRI Brain/LP if febrile.
   - Repeat Ua, Ucx -> pending
   - decrease/hold fentanyl patch for now.
   - EEG negative for seizure activity
 just tox/met encephalopathy.
   - Obtain more information from family regarding baseline mental status.
   .
   Elevated LDH: PCP added on to sputum, no e/o hemolysis at this time and
   LDH returning to normal.
   -Sputum negative for PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 2818**] showing renal mass, will need MRI vs. CT with contrast to further
   evaluate when renal failure stabilizes
   .
   ARF: Urine lytes with FeNa of 0.9%, and FeUrea of 25% reflecting
   pre-renal failure.  Very hypovolemic on admission, but has been
   minimally responsive to fluids with oliguria despite CVPs and MAPs at
   goal.  ATN also in the differential as this occured in the setting of
   hypotension.
   -Continue to maintain CVP 10-12
   -ATN usuallly resolves, in the [**Last Name (LF) 2811**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] check [**Hospital1 **] lytes to
   ensure there is no urgent need for dialysis
   -?lasix to get UOP going
   .
   HTN: restarted metoprolol hydralazine and diltiazem -> and
   uptitrating.
   - Restart dilt yesterday
   - uptitrate Metoprolol to 50 TID and further as tolerated/needed
   - Needs afterload reduction -> ACE would be ideal but in ARF.  Add
   norvasc today and uptitrate as tolerated.  In interim period use IV
   hydral for diastolic BP > 110.
   .
   Respiratory Failure/COPD-Currently with metabolic acidosis and
   respiratory compensation.  Serum pH stable last 24 hours and is keeping
   up with respiratory drive.  Follow with [**Hospital1 **] ABG's and consider
   increasing ventilatory support PRN -- currently on [**9-18**] of PSupp.
   -continue nebs
   -Repeat ABG in PM and consider A/C for assistance with maintaining pH.
   .
   Distended abdomen: On admission noted to have a distended abdomen,
   lactates normalized, and guaiac negative.  Surgery recommending serial
   abdominal exams only, CT ab/pelvis negative for obstruction.
   -Serial exams
   -F/u final read CT
   .
   Metabolic acidosis: Initially a gap of 30 with elevated lactate, now
   with a closed gap and normalized lactate, likely secondary to normal
   saline
   -Monitor lytes
   -LR for fluids
   - repeat lactate level on next ABG.
   .
   Diastolic dysfunction
   -Restarting beta blocker, holding lasix
   .
   Seizure disorder:
   -continue home trileptal

   Imaging: CT Head:IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
   Interval removal of endotracheal and nasogastric tubes with improved
   aeration in the visualized paranasal sinuses; opacification of the
   sphenoid sinus and mastoid air cells
   persists.
   .
   EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to persistent
   delta
   frequency slowing in the left temporal region consistent with an
   underlying area of cortical and subcortical dysfunction. The tracing
   cannot specify the etiology. In addition, the background was
   disorganized, slow, and interrupted by bursts of moderate amplitude
   generalized delta frequency slowing. This latter constellation of
   findings is consistent with a moderate global diffuse encephalopathy
   and
   suggests dysfunction of bilateral subcortical or deep midline
   structures. Medications, metabolic disturbances, infection and anoxia
   are among the common causes of encephalopathy but there are others.
   There were no epileptiform features and no electrographic seizure
   activity was noted.

   Mental Status: This AM arousable only to sternal rub and with
   difficulty maintaining alertness but comfortable and appears overly
   sedated.  Holding sedating medications.  Finger stick normal.  ABG
   without CO2 narcosis.  Had been getting benzos and given new liver
   dysfunction may be impaired hepatic metabolism of benzos, acidosis,
   UTI.  CT Head negative/EEG negative.  Most c/w toxic/metabolic delerium
   from meds/infections.
   - Consider MRI Brain/LP if febrile.
   - Repeat Ua, Ucx -> pending
   - decrease/hold fentanyl patch for now.
   - EEG negative for seizure activity
 just tox/met encephalopathy.
   - Obtain more information from family regarding baseline mental status.

   Elevated LDH: PCP added on to sputum, no e/o hemolysis at this time and
   LDH returning to normal.
   -Sputum negative for PCP.
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 2818**] showing renal mass, will need MRI vs. CT with contrast to further
   evaluate when renal failure stabilizes
   .
   ARF: Urine lytes with FeNa of 0.9%, and FeUrea of 25% reflecting
   pre-renal failure.  Very hypovolemic on admission, but has been
   minimally responsive to fluids with oliguria despite CVPs and MAPs at
   goal.  ATN also in the differential as this occured in the setting of
   hypotension.
   -Continue to maintain CVP 10-12
   -ATN usuallly resolves, in the [**Last Name (LF) 2811**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] check [**Hospital1 **] lytes to
   ensure there is no urgent need for dialysis

   Respiratory Failure/COPD-Currently with metabolic acidosis and
   respiratory compensation.  Serum pH stable last 24 hours and is keeping
   up with respiratory drive.  Follow with [**Hospital1 **] ABG's and consider
   increasing ventilatory support PRN -- currently on [**9-18**] of PSupp.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems including COPD, diastolic dysfunction, DM, and respiratory failure who presented with fever, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a history of renal failure, and her urine analysis indicates pre-renal failure. She is oliguric despite fluid resuscitation, and there is a possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension.

2. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient was found to have a positive urine analysis for enterococcus and coagulase-positive Staph bacteremia. She has been treated with antibiotics targeting gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci. The source of infection is still being investigated.

3. Respiratory Failure/COPD: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for respiratory support. Her serum pH is stable, and she is maintaining adequate respiratory compensation.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains high despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications. Adjustments to the medication regimen are being made to better control her blood pressure.

5. Distended Abdomen: The patient was noted to have a distended abdomen upon admission. There are no signs of bowel obstruction, and serial"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, and recent prolonged hospitalization with rectal sheath hematoma. She presented with urosepsis and acute renal failure. She also has a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection.

The patient remains somnolent and altered mental status, likely due to narcotics and benzodiazepines in the setting of shock liver. Active issues include septic shock, urosepsis, and altered mental status.

The patient is currently being treated with cefepime for the urinary tract infection and linezolid for MRSA bacteremia. Foley catheter change has been ordered. Blood cultures are pending.

The patient's blood pressure is maintained off pressors, mean arterial pressure (MAP) is greater than 60, lactate levels are normal, and central venous pressures (CVPs) are greater than 10. The patient's respiratory status is stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV), and oxygenation is good.

Other ongoing issues include suspected CPAP MRSA bacteremia, sputum with MRSA, and altered mental status due to sedation in the setting of transaminitis with normal bilirubin (possibly shock liver). There are concerns about ongoing infection, urine now with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (V"

   consider further work-up as indicated.
   - Consider LP given low grade fevers but mental status clearly
   responsive to narcan so likely reasonable to defer.
   - Repeat Ua, Ucx -> dirty, consider treatint w/ linezolid.
   - Trend LFT's and resume fentanyl patch at lower dose.
   - EEG negative for seizure activity
 just tox/met encephalopathy.
   - Obtain more information from family regarding baseline mental status.
   - Continue lactulose with goal [**3-15**] BM's per day.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems including COPD, diastolic dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, and respiratory failure following a tracheostomy. She presented with fever, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient has a history of positive urine analysis, coagulase-positive Staph bacteremia, and pre-renal failure not responsive to fluids. She is currently on pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) and has been diagnosed with septic shock. 

The patient's urine culture showed Enterococcus, and sputum cultures revealed MRSA and Pseudomonas, likely colonization. There is also evidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diastolic dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, and respiratory failure. 

The patient's mental status has been altered, possibly due to narcotics, but further work-up is needed to determine the underlying cause. The patient's elevated lactic acid levels have normalized, indicating improvement in tissue perfusion. 

The patient's acute renal failure is attributed to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) caused by hypotension and coagulase-positive Staphylococcus bacteremia. 

The patient's hypertension is being managed with a combination of medications including metoprolol, hydralazine, and diltiazem. 

Respiratory failure/COPD: The patient is experiencing metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation."

She presented with fever, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and is currently showing signs of improvement.

The patient has a central line infection, as indicated by the arterial line stop and the presence of Enterococcus in the urine culture. The central line is being maintained, and the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for the suspected GNR infection in the urine. There is also a concern for MRSA, but it is likely a contaminant.

The patient's mental status is a concern, with fluctuating levels of consciousness and responsiveness. Narcan has been given, but the patient does not recover to a normal baseline mental status. A repeat head CT is planned to evaluate for evolving infarct or bleed.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with good oxygenation and ventilation. She is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set rate and tidal volume. There is no evidence of acute focal pneumonia on chest imaging.

The patient's renal function is improving, with decreasing serum creatinine levels. She is producing urine of about 1 liter per day. ATN is suspected, and the patient is being carefully monitored with electrolyte management and fluid balance.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, recent prolonged hospitalization with rectal sheath hematoma, pneumonia with highly resistant Pseudomonas, respiratory failure after tracheostomy, and urosepsis with acute renal failure. The patient remains critically ill with worsening renal failure and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient is still at risk for septic shock, despite being off pressors with a stable mean arterial pressure (MAP) and normal lactate levels.
2. Urosepsis: The patient continues to be at risk for urosepsis due to the presence of leukocytes and bacteria in the urine culture.
3. MRSA bacteremia: The patient has an active infection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as indicated by positive blood cultures.
4. VRE colonization: The patient is suspected to be colonized with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), which may require additional antibiotics such as daptomycin or linezolid.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status continues to be altered, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, which could include uremia, hepatic encephalopathy, or sedation.
6. Increased LDH: The patient's lactate dehydrogen"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, and recent prolonged hospitalization with rectal sheath hematoma, pneumonia with highly resistant PSA, respiratory failure following tracheostomy. She presents with urosepsis and acute renal failure. The patient has been stabilized from hemodynamic standpoint, off pressors, but remains critically ill with worsening renal failure and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient remains off pressors, but there are concerns about ongoing infection, specifically urosepsis caused by GNR bacteria. Coverage for this infection should be continued until official identification is obtained.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to sedation, opiates, transaminitis (shock liver), or acute renal failure. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely caused by sepsis-induced low flow and pre-renal conditions on admission. There are no immediate indications for dialysis, but renal awareness is necessary.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient initially had metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap likely due to lactate and acute renal failure. Nongap acidosis is now present from non-sodium sources, possibly related to renal failure.
5. Acute on Chronic Respir"

   69 F w/ MMP including copd, diastolic chf, dm2, recent prolonged

   prolonged virulent pseudomonal PNA, presented in septic shock, ARF and
   AMS
   Altered mental status: new altered mental status since admission.
   Highest on our diff was opiate toxicity given narcan response, but now
   her urine is clear of opiates.  Her urine GNR is not speciated, and it
   is possible that she has an ongoing infection without adequate
   coverage.  She is also developing a RLL PNA, but is therapeutic on vanc
   and covered with cefepime for pseudomonas (sputum had MRSA and PSA).
   Otherwise ddx includes uremia in the setting of ARF, seizures although
   EEG was neg., low suspicion for intracranial process as head CT
   negative, also could be meningitis.
   -Will consult ID for help in abx management, consider adding meropenam
   vs. fungal coverage.
   -Consider continous EEG, LP, MRI to fully work this up
   -Await [**Last Name (un) **]/speciation of GNR in urine
   Sepsis: Off pressors with CVP and MAPs at goal.  Lactates normalized.
   Likely urosepsis, also with new developing RLL PNA
   -continue cefepime for now, await final [**Last Name (un) **]/speciation on urine
   cultures
   -Sputum cultures with MRSA and PSA,  now with new infiltrate on RLL,
   already therapeutic on vanc, but will need daily levels and redosing
   -ID consult to help with ABX management.
   Acute renal failure: Likely ATN in the setting of hypotension with
   isosthenuric urine.  Creatinine continues to be elevated without
   significant improvement.  UOP adequate.
   -No acute indication for HD now, renal is aware of the patient
   -continue to monitor Cr and BUN
   Acute on chronic resp failure: Respiratory status worsened overnight,
   so we initially switched her over to AC from PSV with 400x22, PEEP 5
   and FiO2 of 40%.  She continued to have respiratory distress and ABG
   showed 7.31/39/50, and a CXR looked more wet so I increased settings to
   PEEP 10 and FiO2 50%, and gave 20mg IV lasix

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including COPD, diastolic CHF, DM2, and recent prolonged hospitalization.
- Patient became tracheostomy-dependent due to prolonged virulent Pseudomonal PNA and presented in septic shock, ARF, and AMS.
- Urine culture showed Gram-negative rods, but speciation is pending.
- Head CT was negative, ruling out intracranial process.
- Patient's respiratory status worsened, so ventilation settings were adjusted.
- Blood cultures are pending, and sputum culture showed MRSA and PSA.
- Patient is currently on cefepime and vancomycin, but may need additional antibiotics.
- Consider continuous EEG, LP, and MRI to fully work up AMS.
- Patient likely has urosepsis and developing right lower lobe pneumonia.
- Acute renal failure is suspected due to hypotension and isosthenuric urine.
- Respiratory failure has worsened, and ABG showed poor gas exchange.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring and adjustment of treatment as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ongoing infection: The patient may have an ongoing infection, especially with the presence of Gram-negative rods in the urine and the development of right lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and isosthenuric urine suggest possible acute renal failure, which needs to be"

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, and a recent prolonged hospitalization with a rectal sheath hematoma. She was admitted with urosepsis and acute renal failure. She has been stabilized from hemodynamic standpoint and is off pressors but remains critically ill with worsening renal failure and altered mental status.

The patient's recent events include worsening respiratory distress, increased crackles and wheezes, a new right pleural effusion, and possible right lower lobe consolidation. Her allergies include captopril, renal toxicity from Neurontin, shellfish, NSAIDs, promethazine, and hyperammonemia from valproate sodium.

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including lansoprazole, heparin sodium, furosemide, and nutritional support through tube feeds. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), current temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 143/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Her lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine level, low TCO2 level, high glucose level, and abnormal liver function tests."

   Total time spent:
","The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She was admitted with urosepsis and acute renal failure. The patient has been stabilized hemodynamically and is off pressors but remains critically ill with worsening renal failure and altered mental status.

The patient's recent events include worsening respiratory distress, crackles, and wheezes on auscultation. An arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.3, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 100. The chest X-ray reveals a new right pleural effusion and possible right lower lobe consolidation. 

The patient's allergies include captopril, gabapentin, shellfish, NSAIDs, promethazine, and valproate sodium. The last dose of antibiotics was cefepime on 07/03/2139 at 08:01 AM. The patient is currently receiving ICU medications such as heparin sodium, lansoprazole, and furosemide.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the worsening respiratory distress. Flowsheet data shows that the patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 501 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO"

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, recent prolonged hospitalization with rectal sheath hematoma, pneumonia with highly resistant PSA, respiratory failure post tracheostomy, urosepsis, and acute renal failure. The patient is critically ill with worsening renal failure and altered mental status.

The patient has several potential medical complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient remains off pressors, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, normal lactate levels, and central venous pressures (CVPs) above 10. The healthcare team suspects urosepsis caused by gram-negative bacteria (GNR) and is continuing cefepime. They are awaiting official GNR identification and ensuring adequate coverage, especially considering the patient is colonized with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE).
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is new since admission, and it is unclear if this is a baseline condition. The healthcare team suspects sedation or opiates in the setting of transaminitis (likely due to shock liver) and acute renal failure. They plan to clarify with the family and consider repeat EEG to rule out seizures.
3. Ongoing infection: Despite improvement from septic shock standpoint, the patient still has ongoing infection concerns, particularly with the unidentified GNR from urine"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical comorbidities including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and a history of prolonged hospitalization. She presented with severe pneumonia leading to tracheostomy dependence and subsequent septic shock, acute renal failure, and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has new-onset delirium, which is likely due to a combination of opiates, worsening liver function, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and urosepsis.

2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis has improved since being taken off pressors, with normalized lactate levels. However, she is still likely suffering from urosepsis and developing right lower lobe pneumonia. The attending physician plans to consult with an Infectious Disease specialist for appropriate antibiotic coverage.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension and isosthenuric urine. Her serum creatinine levels remain elevated without significant improvement. There is no immediate need for dialysis, but renal function should continue to be closely monitored.

4. Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient received 40mg of IV lasix this morning with the goal of net output. PEEP was"

   Otherwise ddx includes uremia in the setting of ARF, seizures although

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic CHF, DM2, and recent prolonged hospitalization leading to tracheal dependence. She was admitted due to septic shock, acute renal failure, and altered mental status.

The patient's recent events include being started on linezolid for urine RE >100K colonies and a non-fermenter, non-Pseudomonas >100K colonies. She was also given hydralazine and labetalol for hypertension. The patient's allergies include captopril, neurontin (gabapentin), shellfish, NSAIDs, promethazine, and valproate sodium.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.2°C (100.8°F)
- Heart rate: 75 bpm
- Blood pressure: 168/79 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on tracheostomy tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode

The patient's physical examination shows wheezes in the anterior chest, a soft and non-tender abdomen with diminished bowel sounds, and extremities with 1+ edema. Neurologic examination reveals that the patient responds to voice but does not maintain alertness or follow commands.

Laboratory results indicate the following abnormalities:
- Hemoglobin: 7.3 g/dL
- Leukocyte count: 231 K/uL
- Sodium: 134 mg/dL
- Potassium: 3.7 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 3.6 mg/dL
- Glucose: 134 mg/dL
- White blood cell count: 12.8 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 21.8%

- Partial thromboplastin time (PTT): 29.6 seconds
- International normalized ratio (INR): 1.0
- Lactic acid: 1.3 mmol/L
- Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
- Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 498 IU/L
- Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
- Phosphate: 2.1 mg/dL

Imaging shows bibasilar patchy opacities suspicious for pneumonia, along with a small right pleural effusion. Microbiology results indicate no new growth.

The patient's assessment and plan include sepsis, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with a recent decline. The highest differential includes opiate toxicity, but the urine is clear of opiates. There is also a possibility of an ongoing infection without adequate coverage. The patient is developing a right lower lobe pneumonia, but is therapeutic on vancomycin and covered with cefepime for Pseudomonas (sputum had MRSA and PSA). Other differentials include uremia in the setting of acute renal failure, seizures although EEG was negative, low suspicion for intracranial process as head CT was negative, and possibly meningitis.

The plan is to consult ID for help in antibiotic management, consider adding meropenem versus fungal coverage, and await urine GNR speciation. The patient is off pressors with central venous pressure (CVP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) at goal, and lactates have normalized. The patient is likely urosepsis, also with a new developing right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient has already completed a course of cefepime/vancomycin since admission, and this pneumonia has developed in-house. Therefore, it is advised to discuss appropriate coverage with ID. The patient will continue with ciprofloxacin/ceftazidime/linezolid for now.

Regarding acute renal failure, it is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension with isosthenuric urine. The patient's creatinine"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, recent prolonged hospitalization with rectal sheath hematoma, and pneumonia with highly resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient presents with urosepsis and acute renal failure. She has been stabilized from hemodynamic standpoint but remains critically ill with worsening renal failure and altered mental status. 

The patient has undergone various interventions, including broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, diuresis, and tracheostomy. She has also shown signs of foaming at the mouth, paradoxical abdominal movement, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Her laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated creatinine levels. Cultures have revealed heavy pseudomonas in sputum and VRE and GNR in urine. Chest X-ray shows right lower lobe infiltrate, indicating a new ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

The assessment and plan include the following:
- ID recommendations are appreciated, and the patient has been started on linezolid, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime to cover VAP, VRE, and MDR GNR in urine.
- The central line will be removed, and a PICC line will be ordered.
- Oxycodone will be used for pain management due to interactions with linezolid.
- Altered mental status"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic CHF, DM2, recent prolonged hospitalization with rectal sheath hematoma, and PNA with highly resistant PSA. She presents with urosepsis and acute renal failure (ARF) in septic shock. The patient's renal function has plateaued, and she has developed a new right lower lobe ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Urine GNR were resistant to cefepime, so broadened antibiotic coverage has been started to cover VAP, VRE, and MDR GNR in urine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure after tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure due to the new RLL VAP.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function has plateaued, indicating a lack of improvement in kidney function. AKI may progress further if the underlying cause is not addressed.
3. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient exhibits fluctuating AMS, which could be due to toxic encephalopathy from inadequately treated infections. Meningitis should also be considered, and close monitoring is necessary.
4. Sepsis: Although septic shock has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrent sepsis due to ongoing infections and resistant"

   Assessment and Plan
    69 F w/ MMP w/ copd, diastolic chf, dm2, recent prolonged
   hospitalization w/ rectal sheath hematoma, pna w/ highly resistan tPSA,
   resp failure s/p trach aadmitted with urosepsis and arf
   Stabilized from HD standpoint, off pressors, but remains critically ill
   with worsening renal failure and altered MS.
   Now with fever and increasing secretions with VAP on CXR.
   1.)      septic shock
 > remains off pressors, MAPS > 60, lactate nl,
   cvps > 10
   2.) Altered MS
 no opiates in urine any more. Likely toxic
   encephalopathy due to inadequately Rx infections. CT head neg. EEG
   neg.  Did not wake up after lactulose with normalization of ammonia.
   Meningitis at the back of our minds but not high on the list.
   3.) ID: low grade temp 100.4. On Vanc and Cefepime. Urine with VRE
   (colonizer) and GNR (yet to be speciated). Repeat sputum cx pend. Would
   like to expand GNR coverage for lung and urine. Will get ID consult
   today to help with abx. Therapeutic on Vanc. Has R IJ which may need to
   be changed, but will wait for ID input.
   4.)  ARF--likely ATN from sepsis low flow +  pre-renal on admit
   u/o improving, but bun/cr continue to rise
   no acute ind for HD, renal aware
   Add lasix to keep I/O neg daily.
   5.) met acidosis

   now likely primarily related to renal failure
   follow lytes
   compensate with vent
   6.) acute on chronic resp failure: Increased Peep and FiO2 due to fluid
   overload and new VAP.  Wean as tolerated. Repeat ABG today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical comorbidities including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), recent prolonged hospitalization with rectal sheath hematoma, and pneumonia with highly resistant PSA. The patient presents with urosepsis and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's condition has stabilized from hemodynamic standpoint, as she is off pressors with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 and central venous pressure (CVP) greater than 10. However, she remains critically ill with worsening renal failure and altered mental status (MS).

The patient has a fever and increasing secretions, suggesting a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is currently on vancomycin (Vanc) and cefepime for infection coverage, but her urine culture shows vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and a Gram-negative rod (GNR) that has not yet been specified. Repeat sputum culture is pending, and the healthcare team wants to expand GNR coverage for both lung and urine infections. An infectious disease (ID) consult will be obtained today to assist with antibiotic selection. The patient's renal impairment is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to sepsis and low flow states, with pre-renal component on admission. Her urine output is improving, but blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   69 F w/ MMP including copd, diastolic chf, dm2, recent prolonged
   hospitalization where she became trach- dependent secondary to
   prolonged virulent pseudomonal PNA, presented in septic shock, ARF and
   AMS
   .
   Altered mental status: new altered mental status since admission which
   clearly due in part to opiates in setting of worsening liver function
   on admit
 clearly improved off narcotics but with persistent
   delierium.  Likely from pna/ARF/urosepsis.  Opiates cleared from
   system, EEG, and head CT negative.
   -Continue to treat infections
   -Continue lactulose with goal [**3-15**] BM per day for now
   -Dialysis if renal function worsens.
   .
   Sepsis: Off pressors with CVP and MAPs at goal.  Lactates normalized.
   Likely urosepsis, also with new developing RLL PNA.  Has already
   completed course of cefepime/vanc since admission and this pneumonia
   has blossomed in-house, so will d/w ID regarding approrpiate coverage.
   Double cover Pseudomonas for now.
   - continue cipro/ceftaz/linezolid for now.
   - double coverage with ceftaz/cipro for PSA, linezolid for VRE in urine
   - ID consulting for abx management
   .
   Acute renal failure: Likely ATN in the setting of hypotension with
   isosthenuric urine.  Creatinine continues to be elevated without
   significant improvement.  UOP adequate.
   -No acute indication for HD
   -continue to monitor Cr and BUN
   .
   Acute on chronic resp failure:  Trach dependent with fluid overload
   -Continue to monitor ABGs and adjust settings prn
   -Lasix to keep even to slightly negative
   -Nebs prn

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), and recent prolonged hospitalization where she became tracheostomy-dependent secondary to a prolonged virulent pseudomonal pneumonia. The patient presented in septic shock, acute renal failure (ARF), and altered mental status (AMS).

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics including cefepime, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime. She also received a 10-day course of linezolid. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure of 124/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 24 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 54.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, sodium level of 129 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.7 mg/dL, creatinine level of 3.7 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 258 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein level of 21.2 mg/dL. The patient's urine output is 619 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including sepsis, acute renal failure, urosepsis, right lower lobe pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, hypertension, and seizure disorder. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of factors such as opiates, worsening liver function, pneumonia, ARF, and urosepsis.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing to treat infections, administering lactulose to manage hepatic encephalopathy, considering dialysis if renal function worsens, and monitoring for any signs of sepsis or organ dysfunction."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems including COPD, diastolic CHF, DM2, and recent prolonged hospitalization. She became trachea-dependent due to a severe Pseudomonas pneumonia and presented with septic shock, acute renal failure (ARF), and altered mental status (AMS). The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI) with a GNR and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has multiple infections including presumed VAP, UTI with GNR and VRE, and previously had virulent Pseudomonas pneumonia. These infections can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not properly managed.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension and inadequate renal perfusion. This can lead to further deterioration of renal function and the need for dialysis.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has non-gap metabolic acidosis, possibly due to a fistula from the wound site. This condition can worsen and result in life-threatening complications.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is trachea-dependent with fluid overload and VAP. Improper management of respiratory failure can lead to further deterioration of lung function and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic CHF, DM2, recent prolonged hospitalization with rectal sheath hematoma, PNA with highly resistant PSA, respiratory failure post tracheostomy, and currently presenting with urosepsis and ARF. She has been stabilized from hemodynamic standpoint but remains critically ill with worsening renal function and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure post tracheostomy and currently presents with new right lower lobe ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She may be at risk for further respiratory complications if the VAP does not improve or if there are any other infections in the respiratory tract.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) likely due to sepsis-induced low flow and pre-renal causes on admission. There is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from sepsis and low flow. Monitoring of urine output and adjusting fluid management will be important in managing this complication.
3. Infection: The patient has resistant organisms in the urine (MDR GNR) and abdominal wound infection with necrosis. It is crucial to continue appropriate antibiotic coverage to address these infections effectively.
4. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has a history of diastolic CHF, and her blood pressure needs to be closely monitored to ensure adequate cardiac"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, recent prolonged hospitalization with rectal sheath hematoma, pneumonia with highly resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and respiratory failure post tracheostomy. She presents with urosepsis and acute renal failure (ARF) in septic shock. The patient's condition has stabilized from hemodynamic standpoint and is off pressors but remains critically ill with worsening renal failure and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a new right lower lobe VAP, indicating a potential respiratory infection associated with the use of mechanical ventilation.

2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient still has her central line, which increases the risk of developing a bloodstream infection.

3. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI): The patient's urosepsis suggests a possible urinary tract infection, which could be related to the use of urinary catheters.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function has plateaued, indicating a possible ongoing kidney injury. AKI can lead to further complications such as fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including MMP, COPD, diastolic CHF, DM2, recent prolonged hospitalization with rectal sheath hematoma, PNA with highly resistant PSA, and respiratory failure post tracheostomy. The patient presents with urosepsis and ARF in septic shock. The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics to cover Pseudomonas VAP and MDR GNR in urine, as well as pain management with oxycodone due to interactions with other medications.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8 C (98.2 F), blood pressure ranging from 124/62 to 177/84 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's mental status has improved overall, and she denies pain.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, and responds to commands. The patient has paradoxical abdominal movement with end-expiratory rounding, rales and rhonchi in the chest, bilateral 1+ edema in the extremities, warm skin, and distended abdomen with pus in the abdominal wound which is tracking to her back. Bowel sounds are present, and the rest of the wound looks clean.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, tracheostomy dependence, and a history of pseudomonal pneumonia. She presented with septic shock, presumed to be urosepsis, and now shows improving mental status and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has sputum with 4+ pseudomonas and right lower lobe consolidation on CXR, indicating VAP. She will continue receiving linezolid/ceftaz/cipro for presumed VAP and follow ID recommendations based on sputum culture sensitivities.
2. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient is tracheostomy-dependent with fluid overload and VAP. ABGs should be monitored and settings adjusted as needed. Lasix should be administered to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1L. Nebulizers may be used prn, and steroid taper should be done slowly.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has had altered mental status since admission, which has improved but with persistent delirium. This is likely due to PNA/acute renal failure/urosepsis. Opiates have been cleared from her system, and EEG and head CT have been negative. Treatment of infections and weaning of vent settings should continue.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including COPD, diastolic CHF, DM2, and a recent prolonged hospitalization where she became trachea-dependent secondary to a prolonged virulent pseudomonal PNA. She presented in septic shock, acute renal failure (ARF), and altered mental status (AMS). 

The patient has been treated for various infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and sepsis. She has shown improvement in her mental status but still experiences delirium. Her renal function has not significantly improved, and she continues to have elevated creatinine levels. 

She is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), linezolid for VRE in urine, and ciprofloxacin/ceftazidime for pseudomonas coverage. 

The patient also has non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to a fistula from the wound site. Acute renal failure is suspected to be ATN due to hypotension and isosthenuric urine. 

She is experiencing acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, trachea-dependent with fluid overload and VAP. Her blood pressure is being managed with medication adjustments. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has sputum with 4+ pseudomonas, and right lower lobe consolidation on CXR, suggesting pneumonia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic CHF, DM2, and tracheal dependence. She presented in septic shock thought to be urosepsis and now has an improving mental status and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has sputum with 4+ Pseudomonas and consolidation on chest X-ray, indicating a presumed VAP. This requires continuation of linezolid, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin as per ID recommendations and following sputum culture sensitivities.

2. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient is tracheal-dependent with fluid overload, likely contributing to acute on chronic respiratory failure. Monitoring ABGs and adjusting settings as needed, continuing lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance, and weaning vent settings are recommended.

3. Altered mental status: The patient has persistent delirium likely from PNA/ARF/urosepsis. Treatment of infections and weaning vent settings should help improve mental status.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture shows a GNR sensitive to ceftazidime and VRE. Continuing linezolid for VRE and repeating Ucx pending, planning to discontinue linezolid if culture-negative, are suggested.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including COPD, diastolic CHF, DM2, tracheal dependence, and a history of pseudomonal pneumonia. She presented in septic shock, which was thought to be urosepsis, and now shows signs of improvement in mental status and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a sputum culture positive for Pseudomonas and consolidation on chest X-ray, indicating VAP. She is being treated with linezolid, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin as per ID recommendations.
2. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient is tracheally dependent with fluid overload and VAP. ABGs will be monitored, and ventilator settings will be adjusted as needed.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status since admission, which has improved but is still delirious. Causes may include PNA/ARF/urosepsis. Further evaluation is needed.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture shows a Gram-negative rod sensitive to ceftazidime and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Linezolid will be continued for VRE, and the other organism is sensitive to ceftazidime.

   Comments:
   Communication: Patient discussed on interdisciplinary rounds  Comments:
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, tracheostomy dependence, and a history of pseudomonal pneumonia. The patient presented with septic shock, which was thought to be urosepsis, and is now showing signs of improvement in mental status and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has sputum with 4+ pseudomonas and right lower lobe consolidation on CXR, indicating a presumed VAP. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of infection, and potential sepsis.

2. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient is tracheostomy-dependent and has fluid overload, contributing to acute on chronic respiratory failure. This can result in further deterioration of respiratory function and difficulty weaning off the ventilator.

3. Altered mental status: The patient has persistent delirium despite improvement off narcotics. This could be due to underlying infections or other factors such as medication effects or electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring and treatment of underlying infections are necessary to improve mental status.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture shows mixed flora including a gram-negative rod (GNR) and vancomycin-resistant Enteroc"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, tracheostomy dependence, and a history of pseudomonal pneumonia. The patient presented in septic shock, which was thought to be urosepsis. Currently, the patient has an improving mental status and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has sputum with 4+ pseudomonas and right lower lobe consolidation on chest X-ray. Presumed VAP is already being treated with antibiotics, but close monitoring for worsening symptoms and culture sensitivity should be continued.

2. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient is tracheostomy-dependent and has fluid overload. Monitoring of ABGs and adjusting settings as needed is recommended. Lasix should be continued to achieve a net negative fluid balance. Monitoring of creatinine and hemodynamics should also be continued.

3. Altered mental status: The patient has had altered mental status since admission, which has improved off narcotics but with persistent delirium. This is likely due to PNA/ARF/urosepsis. EEG and head CT have been negative. Treatment of infections and weaning of ventilator settings should continue.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture grew a Gram-negative rod and vancomycin-resistant Enter"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic CHF, DM2, trachea dependence, and a history of pseudomonal PNA. She presented in septic shock, thought to be urosepsis, and is now showing signs of improvement in mental status and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP).

Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has sputum with 4+ pseudomonas and right lower lobe consolidation on chest X-ray. Presumed VAP is being treated with ceftaz/cipro for a 10-day course.
2. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient is trachea-dependent with fluid overload and VAP. ABGs will be monitored and settings adjusted as needed.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has an altered mental status since admission, which has improved off narcotics but with persistent delirium. EEG and head CT are negative, so underlying infection is being treated and vent settings are being weaned.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture shows a GNR ([**Last Name (un)**]) and VRE. Linezolid is being used for VRE, and repeat Ucx mixed flora will be done.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic CHF, DM2, trachea dependence, and a history of pseudomonal PNA. She presented in septic shock and is now experiencing improving mental status and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has sputum with 4+ pseudomonas and consolidation on CXR, indicating a presumed case of VAP. Continuing antibiotics (ceftaz/cipro) is recommended.
2. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient is trachea-dependent with fluid overload. Monitoring ABGs and adjusting settings as needed, continuing Lasix to achieve negative fluid balance, and treating VAP are advised.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has been experiencing altered mental status since admission, which has improved but with persistent delirium. Treatment of underlying infection and weaning vent settings are recommended. Restarting low-dose pain medications should be monitored.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture shows GNR and VRE. Linezolid for VRE is prescribed, and repeating Ucx mixed flora is advised.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension and isosthenuric urine. Creatinine continues to be elevated. No acute indication"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic CHF, DM2, tracheal dependence, and a history of pseudomonal PNA. She presented in septic shock, believed to be due to urosepsis. The patient is now showing signs of improvement in her mental status and has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Her respiratory function is tracheal-dependent with fluid overload, and she has also developed acute renal failure. Other concerns include altered mental status, a urinary tract infection, hypertension, and a potential seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, as indicated by sputum culture revealing 4+ pseudomonas and right lower lobe consolidation on chest X-ray. It is important to continue treatment for presumed VAP with ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin for a 10-day course. Monitoring for clinical improvement and adjusting antibiotic therapy as per ID recommendations is crucial.

2. Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient is tracheal-dependent with fluid overload, indicating acute exacerbation of her chronic respiratory failure. Close monitoring of fluid status and diuresis will be necessary. Nebulizers should be used as needed, and there should be a gradual decrease in steroid dosage while continuing to wean ventilator settings.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems including COPD, diastolic CHF, DM2, trachea dependence, and a history of pseudomonal PNA. The patient presented with septic shock, presumed to be urosepsis, and now has improving mental status and VAP. The patient's current condition includes acute on chronic respiratory failure, altered mental status, UTI, acute renal failure, HTN, seizure disorder, and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Vent-associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has sputum with 4+ pseudomonas and RLL consolidation on CXR. Presumed VAP is present, which may lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
2. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient is trachea-dependent and has fluid overload. Monitoring ABGs and adjusting settings as needed is essential to prevent further respiratory compromise.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has had altered mental status since admission but has shown improvement off narcotics. Persistent delirium is still present. It is important to treat underlying infections and wean vent settings while monitoring for any changes in mental status.
4. UTI: The patient has a urine with GNR and VRE. Linezolid is prescribed for VRE, and repeat Ucx mixed flora should be done. It is crucial to follow ID recommendations for appropriate antibiotic therapy.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, readmitted with sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. She has shown significant improvement.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic respiratory failure. Her respiratory status is improving with diuresis and tolerance for tracheal collar. She is on mechanical ventilation and her oxygen saturation is maintained at 100%.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by an increasing creatinine level. Diuretics should be held due to this slight increase in creatinine. The patient may have reached a new baseline renal function.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed pseudomonal pneumonia, which is likely a result of VAP from her previous stay in the rehabilitation facility. She is receiving a complete course of antibiotics to treat the infection.

4. Rectus Sheath Hematoma: The patient has a rectus sheath hematoma, but her wound appears to be healing well.

5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high, and she needs to convert her medications back to enteral administration.

Potential Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, and there is a risk of recurrence if her infections are not adequately controlled.

2. Respiratory Distress: Due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, tracheal dependence, and a history of pseudomonal pneumonia. She presented in septic shock, which was thought to be due to urosepsis. The patient's mental status has improved, but she still has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as evidenced by sputum culture showing 4+ pseudomonas and consolidation on chest X-ray. She also has acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, fluid overload, and altered mental status. Other issues include urinary tract infection, acute renal failure, hypertension, and a possible seizure disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, which is a common complication in patients who are on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy for this infection.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) caused by hypotension and inadequate urine output. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.

3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension that needs to be managed with appropriate antihypertensive medications. Blood pressure control is essential to prevent further complications.

4. Urinary Tract"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, tracheal dependence, and a history of pseudomonal pneumonia. She presented in septic shock, which was believed to be urosepsis, and is now showing improvement in mental status and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently tolerating the tracheal collar well after diuresis and fluid overload management. However, her creatinine level increased to 3.8 following administration of lasix, so further lasix has been held. She is receiving antibiotics for presumed VAP and acute on chronic respiratory failure. Her altered mental status has improved, possibly due to reduced opioid doses for pain management. She has also been treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) with linezolid. Acute renal failure is suspected, likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension and isosthenuric urine. Her serum creatinine has remained stable at around 3.6, indicating oliguria. Lasix has been withheld due to a bump in creatinine levels, and there is no immediate indication for hemodialysis. The patient's hypertension is well-controlled with pain management. She also has a history of seizure disorder but no evidence of seizure on EEG, and she is being continued on trileptal. Her COPD requires daily prednisone at a"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. They have respiratory failure, renal failure, COPD, anemia, a thigh hematoma, confusion, and right upper extremity (RUE) swelling. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they require invasive ventilation with a tracheostomy collar. Their laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating possible renal impairment. The plan is to hold further administration of Lasix and repeat creatinine levels later today. An ultrasound will be performed on the RUE due to swelling. The patient is on various medications including prophylactic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and has a PICC line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory support indicates a high risk of complications related to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Renal Failure: The elevated creatinine levels suggest worsening renal function, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and decreased clearance of waste products.
3. Thigh Hematoma: The presence of a thigh hematoma could potentially cause complications such as infection, pressure on surrounding structures, or compromised blood flow.
4. Anemia: Anemia may contribute to symptoms like fatigue, weakness, and reduced oxygen-carrying capacity, increasing the risk of complications during surgeries or other interventions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, tracheostomy dependence, and a history of pseudomonal pneumonia. She presented with septic shock, which was thought to be urosepsis, and is now showing signs of improvement in mental status and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has completed a 10-day treatment for VAP with antibiotics Ceftazidime and Ciprofloxacin. However, there is still a risk of recurrence or worsening of symptoms.
2. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient is tracheostomy-dependent and has fluid overload, which can lead to further respiratory complications.
3. Altered mental status: Although the patient's mental status has improved, there is still a risk of deterioration or delirium.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has repeat urinalysis with elevated white blood cells and positive leuk esterase, indicating a possible UTI. Foley catheter change has been done, and follow-up cultures will be obtained.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are slowly increasing, suggesting possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This could be due to hypotension and decreased urine output. Fluid challenge with 500cc should be given"

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, tracheal dependence, and a history of pseudomonal pneumonia. The patient presented in septic shock, which was believed to be due to urosepsis. The patient's mental status has improved, and she is now being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with antibiotics.

The patient also has acute on chronic respiratory failure and is dependent on the trachea for breathing. She is tolerating the tracheal collar well after diuresis and may have reached a state of euvolemia, with third spacing of fluid but unable to diurese without increasing creatinine. Nebulizers are provided as needed.

The patient's altered mental status has improved, with oxygen supplementation at 3 liters per minute and the ability to answer questions appropriately. This may be related to opiates as well as infectious issues. Pain medication doses have been reduced.

The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) indicated by repeat urinalysis with elevated white blood cells and positive leukocyte esterase. Foley catheter was changed, and follow-up cultures were obtained. The patient is asymptomatic and afebrile, but if cultures are positive, treatment for complicated UTI will be initiated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including COPD, diastolic congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, tracheal dependence, and a history of pseudomonal pneumonia. The patient presented in septic shock, which was thought to be urosepsis, and now has improving mental status and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been treated with antibiotics (Ceftazidime and Ciprofloxacin) for VAP. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already been treated for VAP, but there is a risk of recurrence if appropriate precautions are not taken.
2. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient is trachea-dependent and has fluid overload, which can lead to worsening respiratory function.
3. Altered mental status: Although the patient's mental status has improved, there is still a possibility of further deterioration.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has repeat urine analyses with elevated white blood cells and positive leuk esterase, indicating a possible UTI. This needs to be addressed and treated accordingly.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are slowly increasing, indicating a possible acute renal failure. Further evaluation and management are required.
6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly lower than before, but careful monitoring is still necessary"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old female admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. She has a history of COPD, renal failure, and a hematoma. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/53-122/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on a tracheal mask. The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin sodium, and is being monitored for fluid balance, hemodynamic status, and renal function.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 13.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, blood glucose levels between 88-134 mg/dL, creatinine levels ranging from 3.6-4.2 mg/dL, and potassium levels between 4.3-4.8 mEq/L. Other lab values indicate elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and abnormal kidney function tests.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, crackles in the lungs, muscle wasting, and positive edema in both lower extremities. Neurological examination is incomplete due to inability to stand.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's main concerns include respiratory failure, COPD, renal failure, hematoma, anemia, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has a history of COPD and is currently on steroid therapy. The patient is also experiencing renal failure, as indicated by her rising creatinine levels and decreased urine output. She has a hematoma present and is anemic. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate within normal range and blood pressure closer to baseline after reducing BP medications. The patient's intake remains poor, and she is not a candidate for dialysis due to her wishes about a feeding tube and poor oral intake. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylactic measures for DVT and stress ulcers. VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) prevention is also being implemented. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is planned for transfer to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if her respiratory support is inadequate or if she develops new complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Progressive Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest ongoing renal dysfunction. If left untreated, this could lead to further deterioration in kidney function and potential complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Hematoma Complications: The presence of a hemat"
