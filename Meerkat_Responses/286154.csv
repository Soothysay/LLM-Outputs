","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of muscular dystrophy who presented with bilateral femur fractures and subsequently underwent bilateral intramedullary rod fixation. The patient is currently experiencing fevers and has a history of cough and infiltrate on pre-operative and post-operative chest X-ray. There is also a mention of stable tachycardia, which suggests the possibility of an infection. The differential diagnosis includes community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), aspiration pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's blood cultures are pending, as well as sputum cultures. The patient's low respiratory reserve and difficulty clearing the airway are concerning for possible quick decline. There is also a possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) due to recent surgery and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fevers and history of cough with infiltrate on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but further investigation is needed through blood and sputum cultures. Aspiration pneumonia is also a concern given the patient's difficulty in clearing the airway.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's low respiratory reserve and inability to clear secretions effectively may lead to hypoxia. Supplemental oxygen is being provided, and an echo has been ordered to assess for right heart strain.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE):"

The patient has a history of cough and infiltrate on pre-operative and post-operative chest X-ray, suggesting the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. Urinary studies have been negative so far, and blood cultures have been drawn. The patient also received a blood transfusion, which does not fit with an exchange reaction.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.8°F (39.9°C), blood pressure ranging from 84/42 mmHg to 114/58 mmHg, heart rate between 86-121 bpm, respiratory rate of 10-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and sputum and blood cultures have been obtained. The patient is also being monitored for possible pulmonary embolism due to recent surgery, tachycardia, and hypotension.

The patient's pain control is managed with various medications including MS Contin, Dilaudid, oxycodone, and Tylenol. Anemia is likely due to recent surgery and blood loss, and the patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells."

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old man with muscular dystrophy who is experiencing fevers and respiratory distress post-operation. He has a history of pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and pain control. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.8°F, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 96/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals anxiety, diminished breath sounds on the left base, and muscle wasting. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with normal creatinine and glucose levels. The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics, pain medication, and aspiration precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory distress and diminished breath sounds on the left base may indicate a potential respiratory complication, such as pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygen saturation is crucial.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and frequent reassessment of the patient's condition are necessary.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization due to muscle wasting and poor cough function increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as low molecular"

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old man with a history of muscular dystrophy who presented with fevers and respiratory distress post-operatively. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis without organ dysfunction. He also requires pain control due to both acute and chronic pain. The patient is currently being treated for respiratory distress with broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn/Azithro) to cover both community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and aspiration pneumonia. An in/exsufflator is being used to assist with secretion clearance. The patient likely has nocturnal hypoventilation and may benefit from a sleep study or consideration of nocturnal CPAP/BiPAP in the future. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Due to the patient's baseline neuromuscular weakness and poor cough, he is at risk for ongoing respiratory distress and potential complications such as ventilator dependence, pneumonia, or aspiration.
2. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing sepsis without organ dysfunction, which can progress to septic shock if not managed appropriately. Close monitoring and prompt treatment are essential.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobilized in the ICU, there is an increased risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) should be continued to prevent DVT formation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of muscular dystrophy, who presents with fever and respiratory distress post-operative. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient requires ongoing care in the ICU for pain control, close monitoring of respiratory status, and treatment for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has baseline neuromuscular weakness and poor cough, which increases the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia and aspiration. Continued aspiration precautions and aggressive secretion clearance techniques, like in/exsufflator, should be employed. Additionally, the patient may benefit from nocturnal CPAP/BiPAP to address hypoventilation during sleep.

2. Pain Control: The patient requires pain management with narcotics and recommendations from the pain service. Close monitoring of the patient's neurologic and respiratory status is necessary due to the impact of IV Ketamine on these systems.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Sensitivity to GNR is pending. If a UTI is confirmed, appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prophylaxis with Lovenox has been started. Regular monitoring for signs and symptoms of DVT is important.

5. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis due to his critical illness. Monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding is necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of muscular dystrophy who presented with bilateral femur fractures. He underwent bilateral intramedullary rod fixation and developed fevers. The differential diagnosis for his fevers includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) versus infection. The patient is currently on Lovenox and has a cough with infiltrate on pre-operative and post-operative chest X-ray, suggesting infection, possibly aspiration pneumonia. Other potential causes such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or exchange transfusion reaction have been ruled out. The patient's white blood cell count has decreased overnight. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, Zosyn, and azithromycin, and blood cultures are pending. Additionally, the patient has hypoxia, likely due to underlying infection and low respiratory reserve, which may lead to a quick decline. Pulmonary embolism is also a possibility given recent surgery and tachycardia. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, an echocardiogram to assess for right heart strain, and supplemental oxygen. Aspiration precautions and an exsufflator for ventilatory support are also being implemented. Pain control is essential due to underlying BMD and recent surgery, and the patient is on chronic narcotics. Anemia is likely due to recent surgery and blood loss, and the patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may be considered due to likely osteopenia"

The patient is a 30-year-old male with [Doctor's Last Name] muscular dystrophy, who presented with bilateral femur fractures and underwent bilateral intramedullary rod fixation. He has been experiencing fevers, and the differential diagnosis includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT), infection, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently on Lovenox, which makes infection less likely. Blood cultures have been sent, and sputum cultures will be sent as well. The patient's hypoxia is likely due to underlying infection and low respiratory reserve. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been ordered to assess for right heart strain. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's difficulty in clearing his airway due to low respiratory reserve and underlying muscular dystrophy, there is a risk of aspiration, leading to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk for DVT due to recent surgery and immobility. This can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if not managed properly.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fevers and tachycardia suggest an ongoing infection, which could progress to sepsis if not promptly treated.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and underlying respiratory issues may worsen, leading to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with [Doctor Last Name] muscular dystrophy who presented with bilateral femur fractures and subsequently underwent bilateral intramedullary rod fixation. The patient has been experiencing fevers, and the differential diagnosis includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT), infection, aspiration pneumonia, and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

The patient's hypoxia is likely due to underlying infection and low respiratory reserve. There is a concern for possible quick decline, and a pulmonary embolism (PE) is also a possibility given recent surgery, tachycardia, and hypotension.

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn/Azithromycin), and blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urinalysis are pending. A transthoracic echo has been ordered to assess for right heart strain.

In terms of pain control, the patient is on chronic narcotics for underlying [Doctor Last Name] muscular dystrophy. Methadone and ketamine have been started to increase pain management.

The patient's anemia is likely due to recent surgery and blood loss. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) with a repeat hematocrit (Hct) of 30.5, which is now stable for the last 2 days.

Baclofen has been continued for [Doctor Last Name] muscular dystrophy. The bilateral hip fracture has"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of muscular dystrophy.
- He presented with fevers and respiratory distress post-op.
- The patient has been treated for pneumonia and is showing overall improvement.
- He has baseline neuromuscular weakness and a poor cough, so broad-spectrum antibiotics were started to cover both community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and aspiration pneumonia.
- Aspiration precautions are still necessary, and an in/exsufflator will be used to assist with secretion clearance.
- The patient likely has nocturnal hypoventilation and would benefit from a future sleep study or consideration of nocturnal CPAP/BiPAP.
- Pain control is being managed with narcotics and recommendations from the pain service.
- The patient is tolerating IV Ketamine well, which provides good pain control without significant impact on neurologic and respiratory status.
- Naloxone is being started for bowel motility.
- Other issues remain as per housestaff notes.
- In the ICU, the patient is on a po diet with assistance, has glycemic control measures in place, and is receiving appropriate prophylactic treatments for DVT and stress ulcers.
- The patient's code status is full code, and he will be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient already has pneumonia, and there is a risk of worsening or developing new infections due to his compromised respiratory function and muscular dystrophy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of muscular dystrophy who presented with fevers and respiratory distress postoperatively. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, which requires pain control with narcotics. He also requires continued aspiration precautions due to his baseline neuromuscular weakness and poor cough. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover both community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and aspiration pneumonia. An in/exsufflator will be used to assist in secretion clearance. The patient may benefit from a sleep study or consideration of nocturnal CPAP/BiPAP for hypoventilation. Monitoring in the ICU is necessary for the impact of IV Ketamine on his neurological and respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's baseline neuromuscular weakness and poor cough put him at risk for continued respiratory distress. Close monitoring of vital signs and respiratory support, such as CPAP/BiPAP, may be required.
2. Infection: The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential infections. However, there is still a pending sensitivity result for a urinary tract infection (UTI). It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection and adjust the antibiotic regimen accordingly.
3. Pain management: The patient requires effective pain control with narcotics. However, close monitoring in the ICU is necessary due to the potential impact of"

","The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of [Doctor Last Name] muscular dystrophy presenting with fevers and respiratory distress post-operative. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 97/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus tachycardia as his heart rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the left base, indicating a possible left lower lobe pneumonia. The patient is anxious and unable to stand due to muscle wasting. Neurologically, he is attentive and follows simple commands.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and various electrolyte imbalances. Other lab values such as glucose, liver enzymes, and kidney function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include treating pneumonia and respiratory distress post-operatively, pain control with narcotics, and monitoring for the impact of IV ketamine on his neurologic and respiratory status. The patient also requires continued aspiration precautions, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and assistance with eating due to poor cough and neuromuscular weakness.
