   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is an 83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from
   an OSH for evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large
   pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections
   thought related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoanyeurism hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # PEA arrest:  Unclear precipitant.  No hypoglycemia on the scene, and
   no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  EKG w/o evidence of ACS, cardiac markers
   pending.  the patient was noted to be [**Last Name (LF) 12547**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] should consider
   PE.  No right heart strain on EKG.  The patient was noted noted to be
   hypoxic leading up to the event.  Must also consider more active bleed
   from pseudoaneurism.  Potential for aspiration as precipitating event
   as well
   -- continue intubation for airway protection and ween as tolerated
   -- fentanyl/midaz given active pancratic issues
   -- levophend for pressure support, IVF, ween pressures as tolerated
   -- TTE in am
   -- if have difficulty with oxygenation, will consider CTA for PE
   -- trend hct for e/o of active bleed
   -- CXR
   # Arterial epinephrine:  dopplerable pulse.  Warm and well perfused.
   Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections:
   On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect, suggestive
   of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS which revealed a
   large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also performed, which
   confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted multiple large abdominal
   fluid collections. He was evaluated by general surgery, who thought his
   abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation
   was relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage at
   this time was not indicated. They recommended that the patient continue
   to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks
   with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical
   intervention at that time.
   .
   Patient now with rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression.  Given hemmorhage into
   pseudocyst, may very well be reactive inflammation from hemorrhage.  CT
   did not reveal necrotic component.  Now s/p IR guided embolization of
   GDA pseudoanyeurism bleed.
   .
   - cont vanc/zosyn
   - looks like ID c/s, f/u am recs.  Will hold initiation of meropenem at
   this time.
   - f/u pending blood and urine cultures.
   - f/u general surgery recs
   - trend hct, if precipitious drop, IR embolization this evening,
   otherwise will reassess stability in am.
   .
   # Clostridium difficile infection:
   Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased diarrhea and
   marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff positive and started
   on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his diarrhea. He was initially
   stated on flagyl, but started on PO vanc on the day of ICU transfer.
   - cont PO vanc and cont for until has completed other antibiotics then
   for an additional 14d.
   .
   # Hepatic Cirrhosis
   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was
   consulted, and the felt no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.  They
   recommended a liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were
   unremarkable.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - cont amioderone at 400mg [**Hospital1 **] and clarify plan with primary team
   - while had a CHADS score of 3, hold anticoagulation in the setting of
   active bleed.
   - TTE in am
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatining started trending up in
   the last 24hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patinet was pulsesless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - cont mucomyst
   - trend creatinine.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1011**] and was continued on insulin during his hospitalization at
   [**Hospital1 5**]. [**Month (only) 8**] be the result of pancreatic insufficiency with pancreatitis
   vs. a new diagnosis of DM.
   - cont HISS
   - check Hbg A1c
   - adjust insulin in TPN

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of BPH who was transferred from another hospital for evaluation of pancreatitis. He has been diagnosed with multiple complications, including pancreatic pseudocysts, intra-abdominal fluid collections, atrial fibrillation, hepatic cirrhosis (disputed diagnosis), C. difficile infection, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, and potential pulmonary embolism.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.5°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 122/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that require attention. He has a history of pancreatitis with pancreatic pseudocysts and associated fluid collections, which have led to complications such as hemorrhage into a pseudocyst and a gastrointestinal artery pseudoaneurysm. The patient underwent interventional radiology-guided embolization for the pseudoaneurysm.

The patient also has a confirmed diagnosis of C. difficile infection, which started within 48 hours of admission and was treated with oral vancomycin.

There is a dispute regarding the diagnosis of hepatic cirrhosis, with the hepatology team suggesting that it may be secondary to pancreatitis rather than primary liver disease. Hepatitis serologies were unremarkable, and a liver biopsy was recommended"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is an 83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from
   an OSH for evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large
   pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections
   thought related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoanyeurism hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # PEA arrest:  Unclear precipitant.  No hypoglycemia on the scene, and
   no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  EKG w/o evidence of ACS, cardiac markers
   pending.  the patient was noted to be [**Last Name (LF) 12547**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] should consider
   PE.  No right heart strain on EKG.  The patient was noted noted to be
   hypoxic leading up to the event.  Must also consider more active bleed
   from pseudoaneurism.  Potential for aspiration as precipitating event
   as well
   -- continue intubation for airway protection and ween as tolerated
   -- fentanyl/midaz given active pancratic issues
   -- levophend for pressure support, IVF, ween pressures as tolerated
   -- TTE in am
   -- if have difficulty with oxygenation, will consider CTA for PE
   -- trend hct for e/o of active bleed
   -- CXR
   # Arterial epinephrine:  dopplerable pulse.  Warm and well perfused.
   Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections:
   On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect, suggestive
   of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS which revealed a
   large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also performed, which
   confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted multiple large abdominal
   fluid collections. He was evaluated by general surgery, who thought his
   abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation
   was relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage at
   this time was not indicated. They recommended that the patient continue
   to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks
   with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical
   intervention at that time.
   .
   Patient now with rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression.  Given hemmorhage into
   pseudocyst, may very well be reactive inflammation from hemorrhage.  CT
   did not reveal necrotic component.  Now s/p IR guided embolization of
   GDA pseudoanyeurism bleed.

   # Clostridium difficile infection:
   Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased diarrhea and
   marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff positive and started
   on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his diarrhea. He was initially
   stated on flagyl, but started on PO vanc on the day of ICU transfer.
   - cont PO vanc and cont for until has completed other antibiotics then
   for an additional 14d.
   .
   # Hepatic Cirrhosis
   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was
   consulted, and the felt no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.  They
   recommended a liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were
   unremarkable.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - cont amioderone at 400mg [**Hospital1 **] and clarify plan with primary team
   - while had a CHADS score of 3, hold anticoagulation in the setting of
   active bleed.
   - TTE in am
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatining started trending up in
   the last 24hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patinet was pulsesless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - cont mucomyst
   - trend creatinine.

   # Hyperglycemia
   He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1011**] and was continued on insulin during his hospitalization at

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of pancreatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by several medical complications, including:

1. Pancreatitis with pancreatic pseudocyst and intra-abdominal fluid collections.
2. Gastroduodenal artery (GDA) pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring interventional radiology (IR) guided embolization.
3. Cardiac arrest of unknown cause, with possible precipitants such as pulmonary embolism (PE), active bleeding from pseudoaneurysm, or aspiration.
4. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), which initially presented with increased diarrhea and leukocytosis but improved with treatment.
5. Atrial fibrillation (AF) that was initially treated with amiodarone but may need to be restarted.
6. Acute renal failure (ARF) with rising creatinine levels, possibly related to the recent IR procedure or potential for acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
7. Hyperglycemia due to pancreatic insufficiency or a new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM).

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is an 83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from
   an OSH for evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large
   pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections
   thought related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoanyeurism hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # PEA arrest:  Unclear precipitant.  No hypoglycemia on the scene, and
   no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  EKG w/o evidence of ACS, cardiac markers
   pending.  the patient was noted to be [**Last Name (LF) 12547**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] should consider
   PE.  No right heart strain on EKG.  The patient was noted noted to be
   hypoxic leading up to the event.  Must also consider more active bleed
   from pseudoaneurism.  Potential for aspiration as precipitating event
   as well
   -- continue intubation for airway protection and ween as tolerated
   -- fentanyl/midaz given active pancratic issues
   -- levophed for pressure support, IVF, ween pressures as tolerated
   -- TTE in am
   - LENIS for DVT/PE r/o
   -- if have difficulty with oxygenation, will consider CTA for PE
   -- trend hct for e/o of active bleed
   -- CXR
   # Arterial epinephrine:  dopplerable pulse.  Warm and well perfused.
   Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections:
   On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect, suggestive
   of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS which revealed a
   large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also performed, which
   confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted multiple large abdominal
   fluid collections. He was evaluated by general surgery, who thought his
   abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation
   was relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage at
   this time was not indicated. They recommended that the patient continue
   to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks
   with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical
   intervention at that time..
   Patient now with rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression.  Given hemmorhage into
   pseudocyst, may very well be reactive inflammation from hemorrhage.  CT
   did not reveal necrotic component.  Now s/p IR guided embolization of
   GDA pseudoanyeurism bleed.

   - f/u general surgery recs
   - trend hct, if precipitious drop, IR embolization this evening,
   otherwise will reassess stability in am.

   # Clostridium difficile infection:
   Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased diarrhea and
   marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff positive and started
   on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his diarrhea. He was initially
   stated on flagyl, but started on PO vanc on the day of ICU transfer.
   - cont PO vanc and cont for until has completed other antibiotics then
   for an additional 14d.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - cont amioderone at 400mg [**Hospital1 **] and clarify plan with primary team
   - while had a CHADS score of 3, hold anticoagulation in the setting of
   active bleed.
   - TTE in am
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatining started trending up in
   the last 24hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patinet was pulsesless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - cont mucomyst
   - trend creatinine.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1011**] and was continued on insulin during his hospitalization at
   [**Hospital1 5**]. [**Month (only) 8**] be the result of pancreatic insufficiency with pancreatitis
   vs. a new diagnosis of DM.
   - cont HISS
   - check Hbg A1c
   - adjust insulin in TPN
   .
   # Hepatic Cirrhosis
   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was
   consulted, and the felt no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.  They
   recommended a liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were
   unremarkable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of BPH who was admitted for evaluation of pancreatitis. He has a large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by a GDA pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, which required interventional radiology (IR) guided embolization. 

The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest with unclear precipitants. There was no evidence of hypoglycemia, hypo/hyperkalemia, or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) on the scene. The patient was noted to be hypoxic leading up to the event, and active bleeding from the pseudoaneurysm may also be a consideration. Potential aspiration as a precipitating event was also mentioned.

The patient continues to be intubated for airway protection and weaning as tolerated. He is on fentanyl/midazolam for active pancreatic issues, levophed for pressure support, and IV fluids are being weaned as tolerated. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is planned in the morning, and a lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENS) is recommended for deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE) rule out. If there is difficulty with oxygenation, a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, who presented with respiratory failure and experienced a cardiac arrest. The patient has multiple complications including large pancreatic pseudocyst with intra-abdominal fluid collections, gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, hypoxemia, possible pulmonary embolism, hypotension, sepsis, arterial administration of epinephrine, pancreatitis, Staph epidermis bacteremia, pseudocyst with bleeding, Clostridium difficile colitis, possible hepatic cirrhosis, nutritional support, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, fluid management, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for hypoxemia prior to the event, and radiographic evidence of left lower lobe density (atalectasis vs. pneumonia). Monitoring ABG, SaO2, mechanics, and CXR is planned.
2. Cardiac Arrest (PEA): The patient had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The cause is unclear, but concerns include hypoxemia (preceding event), aspiration, or hypovolemia (possible further bleed into pseudoaneurysm, third spacing). Monitoring vital signs, checking cardiac echo, and assessing for pulmonary embolism are"

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, who presented with a cardiac arrest and subsequent respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemia. The initial assessment indicates possible causes for the cardiac arrest, including hypoxemia, aspiration, or hypovolemia. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, attributed to hypovolemia and possible increased blood loss. There is also a concern for sepsis. 

Other ongoing issues include pancreatic pseudocysts with intra-abdominal fluid collections, which may be related to the initial pancreatitis episode. There is also a concern for a gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm and hemorrhage into a pseudocyst. 

Additionally, the patient has developed Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia, which is suspected to be line-related. 

The patient's nutritional support consists of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to being nil per os (NPO). 

Other medical concerns include atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, and potential hepatic cirrhosis. 

Fluid management is important to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) above 12 and monitor intake and output (I/O). 

In terms of prophylaxis, the patient is receiving systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom pancreatitis -->  large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple
   intra-abdominal fluid collections (?related to pseudocyst) -->
   gastroduodenal artery pseudoanyeurism hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, now
   s/p cardiac arrest (?PEA).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.
   Hypoxemia prior to event.  Radiographic evidence for LLL density
   (atalectasis vs. pneumonia).   Plan continue mechanical ventiation,
   monitor ABG, SaO2, mechanics, CXR.
   s/p PEA ARREST -- Unclear precipitant, but concerns include hypoxemia
   (preceeding event), aspiration, or hypovolemia (possible further bleed
   into pseudoaneurysm, 3rd spacing).  Pulmonary embolism possible,
   although no ECG changes (no right heart strain on EKG).   No cooling
   initiated because of active bleeding (and concerns for worsening
   bleeding if cooled).  Neurologically responsive this AM.  Continue to
   monitor VS.  Check cardiac echo, assess for pulmonary embolism (LE
   NIVS)
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia, possible increased blood
   loss, possible sepsis.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   ARTERIAL ADMINISTRATION of EPINEPHRINE -- occured during Code.  Right
   leg with preserved pulses, warm and well perfused.  No apparent
   clinical consequences.  Continue to monitor.
   PANCREATITIS -- c/b  Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections.   General Surgery recommended that the patient continue to
   be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks
   with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical
   intervention at that time.
   STAPH EPI BACTERIMIA -- suspect line-related.  Continue Vanco.
   PSEUDOCYST -- Rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression, with bleeding.   Continue
   vanc/zosyn.  ID consulted.
   C. DIFF COLITIS --  Continue PO vanc for an additional 14days
   (?) HEPATIC CIRRHOSIS -- suggested by CT and MRCP imaging.  Hepatology
   team impression that no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.  They
   recommended a liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were
   unremarkable.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   A-FIB -- new recent problem, plan monitor HR.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- anuric renal failure, in context of
   arrest/code.  At risk for ATN.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, uo.  Avoid
   nephrotoxic meds, mucomyst.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Likely related to pancreatitis complications.
   Continue insulin.
   FLUIDS -- maintain CVP >12.   Monitor I/O.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU.
- The patient suffered a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated, with unclear precipitants but concerns including hypoxemia, aspiration, or hypovolemia.
- The patient has respiratory failure and remains intubated.
- There are signs of hypotension attributed to hypovolemia, possible increased blood loss, or sepsis.
- The patient has an arterial administration of epinephrine during the code, but no apparent clinical consequences.
- The patient has pancreatitis with pancreatic pseudocysts and intra-abdominal fluid collections.
- There is a suspected line-related Staph epidermis bacteremia.
- The patient has a pseudocyst with interval progression and bleeding.
- The patient is at risk for acute renal failure, anuric renal failure, and hepatomegaly.
- The patient requires nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
- The patient has hyperglycemia, likely related to pancreatitis complications, and requires insulin.
- The patient's fluid status should be maintained with a central venous pressure (CVP) goal of >12.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation (A-FIB) and requires monitoring of heart rate.
- The patient has acute renal failure and requires monitoring of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and urine output. Nephrotoxic medications should be avoided.
- The patient has cirrhosis of the liver, which is a recent development, and a liver biopsy has been recommended.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABGs), oxygen saturation (SaO2), and ventilator settings is necessary.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, possibly due to hypoxemia, aspiration, or hypovolemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause. The patient's code status is full code.
3. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, likely due to hypovolemia, increased blood loss, or sepsis. Close monitoring of blood pressure and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg is essential.
4. Pancreatitis complications: The patient has pancreatitis with pseudocysts and intra-abdominal fluid collections. There is a risk of further bleeding into the pseudocyst. Surgical intervention may be required in the future.
5. Infection: The patient has a suspected line-related Staph epidermis bacteremia. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and source control measures should be taken.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient is at risk"

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of BPH, who was transferred from an OSH for evaluation of pancreatitis. He has been complicated by GDA pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR-guided embolization. The patient's course is also complicated by acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, C. difficile infection, and alteration in nutrition. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 110/48 to 122/51 mmHg, heart rate of 90 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 36.7 K/uL, elevated levels of lipase at 353 mg/dL, elevated creatinine at 1.4, low albumin at 1.8 g/dL, and elevated lactate at 2.8 mmol/L. The patient's renal function is worsening, and he has evidence of acute kidney injury with a creatinine rise to 1.2 after receiving lasix."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of BPH, admitted for evaluation of pancreatitis. He has a large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections related to the pseudocyst. The patient's course is complicated by GDA pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring interventional radiology (IR) guided embolization. The patient experienced two cardiac arrests, one due to a suspected pulmonary embolism and the other likely due to hemorrhage from the pseudoaneurysm. He also developed Clostridium difficile infection, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, and hepatic cirrhosis (although this diagnosis is uncertain). The patient's condition is complex and requires careful management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the patient's risk factors and recent events, PE should be considered as a potential complication. Further evaluation, such as a computed tomography angiography (CTA), may be necessary if there is difficulty with oxygenation.
2. Hemorrhage from the pseudoaneurysm: The patient has already experienced hemorrhage into the pseudocyst, leading to a cardiac arrest. Close monitoring of hemoglobin (Hct) levels is recommended, and urgent IR embolization should be considered if a precipitous drop in Hct is observed.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is an 83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from
   an OSH for evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large
   pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections
   thought related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoanyeurism hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # PEA arrest:  Unclear precipitant.  No hypoglycemia on the scene, and
   no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  EKG w/o evidence of ACS, cardiac markers
   pending.  the patient was noted to be [**Last Name (LF) 12547**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] should consider
   PE.  No right heart strain on EKG.  The patient was noted noted to be
   hypoxic leading up to the event.  Must also consider more active bleed
   from pseudoaneurism.  Potential for aspiration as precipitating event
   as well.  TTE and LENIS were negative.   Unable to wean pressors, on
   steroid trial.
   -- continue intubation for airway protection and ween as tolerated
   -- fentanyl/midaz given active pancratic issues
   -- levophed for pressure support, IVF, ween pressures as tolerated
   -- if have difficulty with oxygenation, will consider CTA for PE
   -- trend hct for e/o of active bleed
   # Arterial epinephrine:  dopplerable pulse.  Warm and well perfused.
   Continue to monitor.
   .
   # Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections:
   On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect, suggestive
   of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS which revealed a
   large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also performed, which
   confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted multiple large abdominal
   fluid collections. He was evaluated by general surgery, who thought his
   abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation
   was relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage at
   this time was not indicated. They recommended that the patient continue
   to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks
   with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical
   intervention at that time..
   Patient now with rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression.  Given hemmorhage into
   pseudocyst, may very well be reactive inflammation from hemorrhage.  CT
   did not reveal necrotic component.  Now s/p IR guided embolization of
   GDA pseudoanyeurism bleed.

   # Clostridium difficile infection:
   Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased diarrhea and
   marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff positive and started
   on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his diarrhea. He was initially
   stated on flagyl, but started on PO vanc on the day of ICU transfer.
   - cont PO vanc and cont for until has completed other antibiotics then
   for an additional 14d.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - cont amioderone at 400mg [**Hospital1 **] and clarify plan with primary team
   - while had a CHADS score of 3, hold anticoagulation in the setting of
   active bleed.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatining started trending up in
   the last 24hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patinet was pulsesless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - cont mucomyst
   - trend creatinine.

   # Hyperglycemia
   He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1011**] and was continued on insulin during his hospitalization at
   [**Hospital1 5**]. [**Month (only) 8**] be the result of pancreatic insufficiency with pancreatitis
   vs. a new diagnosis of DM.
   - cont HISS
   - check Hbg A1c
   - adjust insulin in TPN
   .
   # Hepatic Cirrhosis
   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was
   consulted, and the felt no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.  They
   recommended a liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were
   unremarkable.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia who was transferred from an outside hospital for evaluation of pancreatitis. He has a large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by a gastrodudodenal artery pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring interventional radiology-guided embolization.

The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, but the precipitant is unclear. There are no signs of hypoglycemia or electrolyte imbalances. The patient was hypoxic before the event, and potential causes include more active bleeding from the pseudoaneurysm, aspiration, or pulmonary embolism. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and lower extremity Doppler ultrasound were negative.

The patient has a history of pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocysts, intra-abdominal fluid collections, Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, and hepatic cirrhosis. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 102.2°F, blood pressure of 110/48 mmHg, heart rate of 90 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 50% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 36.7 K/uL, elevated lipase levels, and increasing left upper quadrant pain. His blood glucose levels are elevated at 353 mg/dL. He has a creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL and liver enzymes showing mild elevation. Other labs indicate possible ongoing inflammation or infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE) - The patient's hypoxia and PEA arrest may raise suspicion for PE. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) for PE could be considered if there is difficulty with oxygenation.
2. Active bleeding - The patient's hypotension and drop in hemoglobin could indicate ongoing internal bleeding, possibly from the gastrodudodenal artery pseudoaneurysm or other sources.
3. Aspiration - Given the patient's intubation status and risk factors, aspiration pneumonia is a concern.
4. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) - The patient has a history of CDI, and appropriate antibiotics should be continued.
5. Acute renal failure - The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest worsening renal function. Nephrotoxic medications should be avoided, and fluid management should be optimized.
6. Hyperglycemia - The patient's elevated blood glucose levels require careful monitoring and management.
7. Hepatic cirrhosis - Although the patient's hepatic cirrhosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom pancreatitis -->  large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple
   intra-abdominal fluid collections (?related to pseudocyst) -->
   gastroduodenal artery pseudoanyeurism hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, now
   s/p cardiac arrest (?PEA).  Overall, worsening clinical status.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.
   Hypoxemia prior to event.  Radiographic evidence for LLL density
   (atalectasis vs. pneumonia).   Plan continue mechanical ventiation,
   monitor ABG, SaO2, mechanics, CXR.
   s/p PEA ARREST -- Unclear precipitant, but concerns include hypoxemia
   (preceeding event), aspiration, or hypovolemia (possible further bleed
   into pseudoaneurysm, 3rd spacing).  Pulmonary embolism possible,
   although no ECG changes (no right heart strain on EKG), LE NIVS without
   DVT and cardiac echo without evidence for RV strain.   No cooling
   initiated because of active bleeding (and concerns for worsening
   bleeding if cooled).  Neurologically responsive this AM.  Continue to
   monitor VS.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, pancreatitis, and possible
   hypovolemia, and blood loss (less).  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60
   mmHg.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to bleeding of pseudoaneurysm into pseudocyst.
   Currently stable.
   ARTERIAL ADMINISTRATION of EPINEPHRINE -- occured during Code.  Right
   leg with preserved pulses, warm and well perfused.  No apparent
   clinical consequences.  Continue to monitor.
   PANCREATITIS -- c/b  Pancreatic Pseudocysts, multiple intra-abdominal
   fluid Collections.   General Surgery recommended that the patient
   continue to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in
   [**5-6**] weeks with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of
   surgical intervention at that time.
   STAPH EPI BACTERIMIA -- suspect line-related.  Continue Vanco.
   PSEUDOCYST -- Rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression, with bleeding.   Continue
   vanc/zosyn.  ID consult in progress.
   C. DIFF COLITIS --  Continue PO vanc for an additional 14 days.
   (?) HEPATIC CIRRHOSIS -- suggested by CT and MRCP imaging.  Hepatology
   team impression that no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis --> recommended a
   liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more secondary to
   pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were unremarkable.
   ARTERIAL ADMINISTRATION of EPINEPHRINE -- occured during Code.  Right
   leg with preserved pulses, warm and well perfused.  No apparent
   clinical consequences.  Continue to monitor.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   A-FIB -- new recent problem, plan monitor HR.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- anuric renal failure, in context of
   arrest/code.  At risk for ATN.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, uo.  Avoid
   nephrotoxic meds, mucomyst.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Likely related to pancreatitis complications.
   Continue insulin.
   FLUIDS -- maintain CVP >12.   Monitor I/O.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis and subsequent development of a pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated, but unfortunately, remains in critical condition.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and possible aspiration pneumonia. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. There is evidence of lower lobe density on radiographic imaging, which could be due to atelectasis or pneumonia.

The patient also had a cardiac arrest with an unclear precipitant, but concerns include hypoxemia (preceeding event), aspiration, or hypovolemia (possible further bleed into pseudoaneurysm, third spacing). Pulmonary embolism is a possibility, although no ECG changes (no right heart strain on EKG), left lower extremity non-invasive ventilation without DVT, and cardiac echo without evidence for right ventricular strain.

The patient has hypotension attributed to sepsis, pancreatitis, and possible hypovolemia, and blood loss. The patient's blood pressure is being monitored, and the plan is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg.

Anemia is present and attributed to bleeding of pseudoaneurysm into pseudocyst. The patient's arterial administration of epinephrine occurred during the code, but there were no apparent"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom pancreatitis -->  large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple
   intra-abdominal fluid collections (?related to pseudocyst) -->
   gastroduodenal artery pseudoanyeurism hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, now
   s/p cardiac arrest (?PEA).  Overall, worsening clinical status.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.
   Hypoxemia prior to event.  Radiographic evidence for LLL density
   (atalectasis vs. pneumonia).   Plan continue mechanical ventiation,
   monitor ABG, SaO2, mechanics, CXR.
   s/p PEA ARREST -- Unclear precipitant, but concerns include hypoxemia
   (preceeding event), aspiration, or hypovolemia (possible further bleed
   into pseudoaneurysm, 3rd spacing).  Pulmonary embolism possible,
   although no ECG changes (no right heart strain on EKG), LE NIVS without
   DVT and cardiac echo without evidence for RV strain.   No cooling
   initiated because of active bleeding (and concerns for worsening
   bleeding if cooled).  Neurologically responsive this AM.  Continue to
   monitor VS.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, pancreatitis, and possible
   hypovolemia, and blood loss (less).  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60
   mmHg.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to bleeding of pseudoaneurysm into pseudocyst.
   Currently stable.
   ARTERIAL ADMINISTRATION of EPINEPHRINE -- occured during Code.  Right
   leg with preserved pulses, warm and well perfused.  No apparent
   clinical consequences.  Continue to monitor.
   PANCREATITIS -- c/b  Pancreatic Pseudocysts, multiple intra-abdominal
   fluid Collections.   General Surgery recommended that the patient
   continue to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in
   [**5-6**] weeks with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of
   surgical intervention at that time.
   STAPH EPI BACTERIMIA -- suspect line-related.  Continue Vanco.
   PSEUDOCYST -- Rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression, with bleeding.   Continue
   vanc/zosyn.  ID consult in progress.
   C. DIFF COLITIS --  Continue PO vanc for an additional 14 days.
   (?) HEPATIC CIRRHOSIS -- suggested by CT and MRCP imaging.  Hepatology
   team impression that no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis --> recommended a
   liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more secondary to
   pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were unremarkable.
   ARTERIAL ADMINISTRATION of EPINEPHRINE -- occured during Code.  Right
   leg with preserved pulses, warm and well perfused.  No apparent
   clinical consequences.  Continue to monitor.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   A-FIB -- new recent problem, plan monitor HR.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- anuric renal failure, in context of
   arrest/code.  At risk for ATN.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, uo.  Avoid
   nephrotoxic meds, mucomyst.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Likely related to pancreatitis complications.
   Continue insulin.
   FLUIDS -- maintain CVP >12.   Monitor I/O.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male who was admitted with acute pancreatitis and developed a large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections. The patient then experienced a gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst and subsequently had a cardiac arrest with pulseless electrical activity (PEA). The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. Firstly, there is hypoxemia prior to the cardiac arrest, and the plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and monitor ABG, SaO2, mechanics, and CXR. Secondly, the patient had a PEA arrest with unclear precipitants, but concerns include hypoxemia, aspiration, or hypovolemia due to possible further bleeding into the pseudoaneurysm or third spacing. Pulmonary embolism is also a possibility, although no ECG changes were observed. LE NIVS without DVT and cardiac echo without evidence for RV strain were performed. No cooling was initiated due to active bleeding concerns. Thirdly, the patient is hypotensive, attributed to sepsis, pancreatitis, and possible hypovolemia, as well as blood loss. Monitoring of BP and maintaining MAP > 60 mmHg is recommended.

Additionally, the patient is anemic due to bleeding of the pseudoaneurysm into the pseud"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is an 83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from
   an OSH for evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large
   pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections
   thought related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoanyeurism hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # PEA arrest:  Unclear precipitant.  No hypoglycemia on the scene, and
   no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  EKG w/o evidence of ACS, cardiac markers
   pending.  the patient was noted to be [**Last Name (LF) 12547**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] should consider
   PE.  No right heart strain on EKG.  The patient was noted noted to be
   hypoxic leading up to the event.  Must also consider more active bleed
   from pseudoaneurism.  Potential for aspiration as precipitating event
   as well.  TTE and LENIS were negative.   Unable to wean pressors, on
   steroid v placebo trial.
   -- continue intubation for airway protection and wean as tolerated
   -- fentanyl/midaz given active pancreatic issues
   -- IVF, wean pressors as tolerated

   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatining started trending up in
   the last 48hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patient was pulsesless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.  Urine lytes consistent with intrarenal
   process, Eos negative but their NPV is ~ 16%. Worsening today,

   # Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections:
   On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect, suggestive
   of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS which revealed a
   large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also performed, which
   confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted multiple large abdominal
   fluid collections. He was evaluated by general surgery, who thought his
   abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation
   was relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage at
   this time was not indicated. They recommended that the patient continue
   to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks
   with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical
   intervention at that time..
   Patient now with rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression.  Given hemmorhage into
   pseudocyst, may very well be reactive inflammation from hemorrhage.  CT
   did not reveal necrotic component.  Now s/p IR guided embolization of
   GDA pseudoanyeurism bleed.

   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - cont amioderone at 400mg [**Hospital1 **] and clarify plan with primary team
   - while had a CHADS score of 3, hold anticoagulation in the setting of
   active bleed.

   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who was transferred from another hospital for evaluation of pancreatitis. He has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocysts, intra-abdominal fluid collections, Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, and hepatic cirrhosis. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which was likely caused by hemorrhage into a pseudocyst or a more active bleed from a pseudoaneurysm. He underwent interventional radiology (IR) guided embolization of the gastrointestinal duct artery (GDA) pseudoaneurysm bleed. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors including kidney injury, infection, fluid imbalance, and multiorgan dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating worsening kidney function. This could be due to intrinsic renal injury or prerenal causes such as hypovolemia or cardiogenic shock.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's lipase levels are elevated, suggesting ongoing inflammation of the pancreas. There is a risk of further pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst formation, and complications related to fluid collections.
3. Intra-abdominal Fluid Collections: The presence of multiple fluid collections around the pancreas may"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is an 83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from
   an OSH for evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large
   pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections
   thought related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # PEA arrest:  Unclear precipitant.  No hypoglycemia on the scene, and
   no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  EKG w/o evidence of ACS, cardiac markers
   pending.  the patient was noted to be tachypneic, so should consider
   PE.  No right heart strain on EKG.  The patient was noted noted to be
   hypoxic leading up to the event.  Must also consider more active bleed
   from pseudoaneurysm.  Potential for aspiration as precipitating event
   as well.  TTE and LENIS were negative.   Unable to wean pressors, on
   steroid v placebo trial.  Still worried about PE as causal
   -- continue intubation for airway protection and wean as tolerated
   -- fentanyl/midaz given active pancreatic issues
   -- IVF, wean pressors as tolerated
   -- trend hct for e/o of active bleed ([**Hospital1 **])
   -- consider CTA for eval for PE, especially if patient is to start CRRT
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatining started trending up in
   the last 48hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patient was pulsesless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.  Urine lytes consistent with intrarenal
   process, Eos negative but their NPV is ~ 16%. Worsening today,
   uptrending by 0.3 daily.
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
 d/c
d vancomycin, checking levels, redose
   when < 15
   - trend creatinine.
   - per prior discussion, family amenable to CRRT; renal c/s today
   .
   # Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections:
   On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect, suggestive
   of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS which revealed a
   large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also performed, which
   confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted multiple large abdominal
   fluid collections. He was evaluated by general surgery, who thought his
   abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation
   was relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage at
   this time was not indicated. They recommended that the patient continue
   to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks
   with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical
   intervention at that time..
   Patient now with rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression.  Given hemorrhage into
   pseudocyst, may very well be reactive inflammation from hemorrhage.  CT
   did not reveal necrotic component.
   - continue meropenem
   - ID recs
   - f/u pending blood and urine cultures.
   - f/u general surgery recs
   - Hct continues to drop; patient will go for IR-guided embolization of
   GDA pseudoaneurysm today
   .
   # Clostridium difficile infection:
   Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased diarrhea and
   marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff positive and started
   on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his diarrhea. He was initially
   stated on flagyl, but started on PO vanc on the day of ICU transfer.
   - cont vanc enemas and cont for until has completed other antibiotics
   then for an additional 14d.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - cont amiodarone at 400mg [**Hospital1 **] and clarify plan with primary team
   - while had a CHADS score of 3, hold anticoagulation in the setting of
   active bleed.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1011**] and was continued on insulin during his hospitalization at
   [**Hospital1 5**]. [**Month (only) 8**] be the result of pancreatic insufficiency with pancreatitis
   vs. a new diagnosis of DM.
   - cont HISS
   - adjust insulin in TPN
   .
   # Hepatic Cirrhosis
   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was
   consulted, and the felt no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.  They
   recommended a liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were
   unremarkable.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who was transferred from an outside hospital (OSH) for evaluation of acute pancreatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by several medical conditions, including a large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections, gallbladder artery pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst requiring interventional radiology (IR) guided embolization, acute renal failure, pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocysts, intra-abdominal fluid collections, Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, and hepatic cirrhosis.

The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest with an unclear precipitant, and further evaluation is pending. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and weaning of pressors as tolerated. The patient's Hct continues to drop, and he will undergo IR-guided embolization of the GDA pseudoaneurysm today.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, lipase levels, and creatinine, indicating ongoing inflammation and renal dysfunction. The patient's electrolytes are relatively stable, with the exception of slightly elevated potassium.

The patient's current medications include piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), meropenem, vancomycin, midazolam (Versed), phen"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is an 83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from
   an OSH for evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large
   pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections
   thought related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # PEA arrest:  Unclear precipitant.  No hypoglycemia on the scene, and
   no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  EKG w/o evidence of ACS, cardiac markers
   pending.  the patient was noted to be tachypneic, so should consider
   PE.  No right heart strain on EKG.  The patient was noted noted to be
   hypoxic leading up to the event.  Must also consider more active bleed
   from pseudoaneurysm.  Potential for aspiration as precipitating event
   as well.  TTE and LENIS were negative.   Unable to wean pressors, on
   steroid v placebo trial.
   -- continue intubation for airway protection and wean as tolerated
   -- fentanyl/midaz given active pancreatic issues
   -- IVF, wean pressors as tolerated
   -- trend hct for e/o of active bleed ([**Hospital1 **])
   -- consider CTA for eval for PE, especially if patient is to start CRRT
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatining started trending up in
   the last 48hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patient was pulsesless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.  Urine lytes consistent with intrarenal
   process, Eos negative but their NPV is ~ 16%. Worsening today,
   uptrending by 0.3 daily.
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
 d/c
d vancomycin, checking levels, redose
   when < 15
   - trend creatinine.
   - per prior discussion, family amenable to CRRT; renal c/s today
   .
   # Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections:
   On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect, suggestive
   of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS which revealed a
   large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also performed, which
   confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted multiple large abdominal
   fluid collections. He was evaluated by general surgery, who thought his
   abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation
   was relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage at
   this time was not indicated. They recommended that the patient continue
   to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks
   with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical
   intervention at that time..
   Patient now with rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression.  Given hemorrhage into
   pseudocyst, may very well be reactive inflammation from hemorrhage.  CT
   did not reveal necrotic component.
   - continue meropenem
   - ID recs
   - f/u pending blood and urine cultures.
   - f/u general surgery recs
   - Hct continues to drop; patient will go for IR-guided embolization of
   GDA pseudoaneurysm today
   .
   # Clostridium difficile infection:
   Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased diarrhea and
   marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff positive and started
   on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his diarrhea. He was initially
   stated on flagyl, but started on PO vanc on the day of ICU transfer.
   - cont vanc enemas and cont for until has completed other antibiotics
   then for an additional 14d.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - cont amiodarone at 400mg [**Hospital1 **] and clarify plan with primary team
   - while had a CHADS score of 3, hold anticoagulation in the setting of
   active bleed.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1011**] and was continued on insulin during his hospitalization at
   [**Hospital1 5**]. [**Month (only) 8**] be the result of pancreatic insufficiency with pancreatitis
   vs. a new diagnosis of DM.
   - cont HISS
   - adjust insulin in TPN
   .
   # Hepatic Cirrhosis
   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was
   consulted, and the felt no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.  They
   recommended a liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were
   unremarkable.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of BPH who was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of pancreatitis. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from his current condition and previous treatments.

1. Fever: The patient has had a fever with a peak temperature of 101.1°F (53.4°C). This could be indicative of an infection or inflammation in the body.

2. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's potassium levels have been elevated (5.5 in AM), indicating hyperkalemia. Close monitoring and management of electrolyte levels are necessary to avoid complications related to cardiac arrhythmias.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been rising, suggesting impaired kidney function. This could be due to factors such as dehydration, nephrotoxic medications, or the development of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to ischemia or toxins.

4. Pancreatitis and Pancreatic Pseudocysts: The patient has pancreatitis with associated complications such as pancreatic pseudocysts and intra-abdominal fluid collections. These can lead to further complications like infection, bleeding, or rupture of the pseudocysts.

5. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient developed diarrhea and marked leukocytosis, and tested positive for C. difficile. This infection needs to be treated appropriately with antibiotics.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is an 83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from
   an OSH for evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large
   pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections
   thought related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # PEA arrest:  Unclear precipitant.  No hypoglycemia on the scene, and
   no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  EKG w/o evidence of ACS, cardiac markers
   pending.  the patient was noted to be tachypneic, so should consider
   PE.  No right heart strain on EKG.  The patient was noted noted to be
   hypoxic leading up to the event.  Must also consider more active bleed
   from pseudoaneurysm.  Potential for aspiration as precipitating event
   as well.  TTE and LENIS were negative.   Unable to wean pressors, on
   steroid v placebo trial.
   -- continue intubation for airway protection and wean as tolerated
   -- fentanyl/midaz given active pancreatic issues
   -- IVF, wean pressors as tolerated
   -- trend hct for e/o of active bleed ([**Hospital1 **])
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatining started trending up in
   the last 48hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patient was pulsesless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.  Urine lytes consistent with intrarenal
   process, Eos negative but their NPV is ~ 16%. Worsening today,
   uptrending by 0.3 daily.
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
 d/c
d vancomycin, checking levels, redose
   when < 15
   - trend creatinine.
   - per prior discussion, family amenable to CRRT; renal c/s today
   .
   # Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections:
   On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect, suggestive
   of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS which revealed a
   large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also performed, which
   confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted multiple large abdominal
   fluid collections. He was evaluated by general surgery, who thought his
   abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation
   was relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage at
   this time was not indicated. They recommended that the patient continue
   to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks
   with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical
   intervention at that time..
   Patient now with rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression.  Given hemorrhage into
   pseudocyst, may very well be reactive inflammation from hemorrhage.  CT
   did not reveal necrotic component.
   - continue meropenem
   - ID recs
   - f/u pending blood and urine cultures.
   - f/u general surgery recs
   - Hct continues to drop; patient will go for IR-guided embolization of
   GDA pseudoaneurysm today
   .
   # Clostridium difficile infection:
   Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased diarrhea and
   marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff positive and started
   on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his diarrhea. He was initially
   stated on flagyl, but started on PO vanc on the day of ICU transfer.
   - cont vanc enemas and cont for until has completed other antibiotics
   then for an additional 14d.
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - cont amiodarone at 400mg [**Hospital1 **] and clarify plan with primary team
   - while had a CHADS score of 3, hold anticoagulation in the setting of
   active bleed.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1011**] and was continued on insulin during his hospitalization at
   [**Hospital1 5**]. [**Month (only) 8**] be the result of pancreatic insufficiency with pancreatitis
   vs. a new diagnosis of DM.
   - cont HISS
   - adjust insulin in TPN
   .
   # Hepatic Cirrhosis
   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was
   consulted, and the felt no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.  They
   recommended a liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were
   unremarkable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of BPH and pancreatitis. He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation and treatment of pancreatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by several medical complications including GDA pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, acute renal failure, Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, and hepatic cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GDA Pseudoaneurysm Hemorrhage: The patient experienced hemorrhage into a pseudocyst due to a GDA pseudoaneurysm. This required immediate intervention with interventional radiology (IR)-guided embolization.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been steadily worsening, indicating acute renal failure. This may be due to various factors such as ATN, intrarenal process, or potential contrast-induced nephropathy from the IR procedure.

3. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient developed increased diarrhea and marked leukocytosis after admission, and tested positive for C. diff. He was started on Flagyl and later transitioned to PO vancomycin.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and initially treated with diltiazem and amiodarone. However, his PICC line may have been triggering the atrial fibrillation"

   into pseudoaneurysm, 3rd spacing).  Pulmonary embolism possible,
   although no ECG changes (no right heart strain on EKG), LE NIVS without
   DVT and cardiac echo without evidence for RV strain.   No cooling
   initiated because of active bleeding (and concerns for worsening
   bleeding if cooled).  Neurologically responsive initially, now on
   sedation.  Continue to monitor VS.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, pancreatitis, and possible
   hypovolemia, and blood loss (less).  Concern for possible pulmonary
   embolism.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.  Plan to proceed with CT
   angio
 if clot identified, then would place IVC filter while remains
   at risk for bleeding.
   GDA ANERYSM
 will require IR-guided embolization when stable.  Hold
   anticoagulation.  If PE identified, will need IVC filter pending final
   intervention for aneurysm.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to bleeding of pseudoaneurysm into pseudocyst,
   phlebotomy.  Continues to require transfusion.
   PANCREATITIS -- c/b  Pancreatic Pseudocysts, multiple intra-abdominal
   fluid Collections.   General Surgery recommended that the patient
   continue to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in
   [**5-6**] weeks with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of
   surgical intervention at that time.
   STAPH EPI BACTERIMIA -- suspect line-related.  Continue Vanco.
   PSEUDOCYST -- Rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression, with bleeding.   Continue
   vanc/zosyn.  ID consult in progress.
   RASH -- diffuse, blanching erythema.  Suspect drug-related (probable
   antimicrobial).
   C. DIFF COLITIS --  Continue PO vanc for an additional 14 days.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   A-FIB -- new recent problem, plan monitor HR.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- anuric renal failure, in context of
   arrest/code.  Probable ATN.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, uo.  Avoid
   nephrotoxic meds, provide.mucomyst.  At risk for dye-induced renal
   injury required for CT angio and IR-directed embolization.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Likely related to pancreatitis complications.
   Continue insulin.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis who has developed multiple complications. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has an increased risk of developing pneumonia due to being intubated and immobile.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): This is a specific type of pneumonia that occurs in patients who are on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has lower extremity edema and is at risk for developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can potentially travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism.
4. Sepsis: The patient has an infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis, especially if it is a line-related infection.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient is anuric and has evidence of acute renal failure, which could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, likely related to complications of pancreatitis.
7. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient has been treated with vancomycin for suspected Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia and"

   intra-abdominal fluid collections (?related to pseudocyst) -->
   gastroduodenal artery pseudoanyeurism hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, now
   s/p cardiac arrest (?PEA).  Overall, worsening clinical status.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.
   Hypoxemia prior to event.  Radiographic evidence for LLL density
   (atalectasis vs. pneumonia).   Plan continue mechanical ventiation,
   monitor ABG, SaO2, mechanics, CXR.
   s/p PEA ARREST -- Unclear precipitant, but concerns include hypoxemia
   (preceeding event), aspiration, or hypovolemia (possible further bleed
   into pseudoaneurysm, 3rd spacing).  Pulmonary embolism possible,
   although no ECG changes (no right heart strain on EKG), LE NIVS without
   DVT and cardiac echo without evidence for RV strain.   No cooling
   initiated because of active bleeding (and concerns for worsening
   bleeding if cooled).  Neurologically responsive initially, now on
   sedation.  Continue to monitor VS.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, pancreatitis, and possible
   hypovolemia, and blood loss (less).  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60
   mmHg.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to bleeding of pseudoaneurysm into pseudocyst,
   phlebotomy.  Continues to require transfusion.

   fluid Collections.   General Surgery recommended that the patient
   continue to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in
   [**5-6**] weeks with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of
   surgical intervention at that time.

   PSEUDOCYST -- Rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression, with bleeding.   Continue
   vanc/zosyn.  ID consult in progress.
   RASH -- diffuse, blanching erythema.  Suspect drug-related (probable
   antimicrobial).
   C. DIFF COLITIS --  Continue PO vanc for an additional 14 days.
   (?) HEPATIC CIRRHOSIS -- suggested by CT and MRCP imaging.  Hepatology
   team impression that no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis --> recommended a
   liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more secondary to
   pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were unremarkable.
   ARTERIAL ADMINISTRATION of EPINEPHRINE -- occured during Code.  Right
   leg with preserved pulses, warm and well perfused.  No apparent
   clinical consequences.  Continue to monitor.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   A-FIB -- new recent problem, plan monitor HR.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- anuric renal failure, in context of

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, currently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. He has been intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient remains on vasopressors and is tolerating slowly weaning. He has anuric renal failure and received a unit of packed red blood cells for progressive anemia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 118/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

Physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, warm and dry skin, and diffuse erythematous blanching rash over the trunk. Neurologically, the patient is sedated but purposeful and responsive to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 25.3 K/uL, elevated glucose level of 353 mg/dL, elevated creatinine level of 2.7 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.8 mmol/L.

The patient's medical history includes pancreatitis with the formation of a pancreatic pseudocyst, multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections, and a gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, likely due"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom pancreatitis -->  large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple
   intra-abdominal fluid collections (?related to pseudocyst) -->
   gastroduodenal artery pseudoanyeurism hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, now
   s/p cardiac arrest (?PEA).  Overall, worsening clinical status.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.
   Hypoxemia prior to event.  Radiographic evidence for LLL density
   (atalectasis vs. pneumonia).   Plan continue mechanical ventiation,
   monitor ABG, SaO2, mechanics, CXR.
   s/p PEA ARREST -- Unclear precipitant, but concerns include hypoxemia
   (preceeding event), aspiration, or hypovolemia (possible further bleed
   into pseudoaneurysm, 3rd spacing).  Pulmonary embolism possible,
   although no ECG changes (no right heart strain on EKG), LE NIVS without
   DVT and cardiac echo without evidence for RV strain.   No cooling
   initiated because of active bleeding (and concerns for worsening
   bleeding if cooled).  Neurologically responsive initially, now on
   sedation.  Continue to monitor VS.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, pancreatitis, and possible
   hypovolemia, and blood loss (less).  Concern for possible pulmonary
   embolism.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.  Plan to proceed with CT
   angio
 if clot identified, then would place IVC filter while remains
   at risk for bleeding.
   GDA ANERYSM
 will require IR-guided embolization when stable.  Hold
   anticoagulation.  If PE identified, will need IVC filter pending final
   intervention for aneurysm.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to bleeding of pseudoaneurysm into pseudocyst,
   phlebotomy.  Continues to require transfusion.
   PANCREATITIS -- c/b  Pancreatic Pseudocysts, multiple intra-abdominal
   fluid Collections.   General Surgery recommended that the patient
   continue to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in
   [**5-6**] weeks with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of
   surgical intervention at that time.
   STAPH EPI BACTERIMIA -- suspect line-related.  Continue Vanco.
   PSEUDOCYST -- Rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression, with bleeding.   Continue
   vanc/zosyn.  ID consult in progress.
   RASH -- diffuse, blanching erythema.  Suspect drug-related (probable
   antimicrobial).
   C. DIFF COLITIS --  Continue PO vanc for an additional 14 days.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   A-FIB -- new recent problem, plan monitor HR.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- anuric renal failure, in context of
   arrest/code.  Probable ATN.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, uo.  Avoid
   nephrotoxic meds, provide.mucomyst.  At risk for dye-induced renal
   injury required for CT angio and IR-directed embolization.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Likely related to pancreatitis complications.
   Continue insulin.
   FLUIDS -- maintain CVP >12.   Monitor I/O.

   Patient is critically ill
   ------ Protected Section ------
   MICU Attending:
   Pt remains critically ill, intubated, mechanically ventilated,
   vasopressor dependent (3 vasopressors) and anuric renal failure.
   Regarding planned contrast studies, discussed extensively with all
   family members, including HCP.  Discussed medical indication for CT
   angiogram to assess for pulmonary embolism (for evaluation of arrest,
   persistent tachcardia and hypotension) and medical indication for
   IR-directed embolization of GDA aneurysm.  Unable to empirically
   anticoagulate because of bleeding GDA aneurysm.  Will require iv
   contrast dye for both studies, and HCP and family members all
   understand the high risk for further renal dysfunction and worsening
   renal failure, possible permanent.  Currently with anuric renal failure
   following cardiac arrest.  All understand risk for  prolonged or
   permanent renal failure, and possibilty that kidneys may not improve.
   All in agreement to assume the risks, and all in agreement to proceed
   with these procedures.  Renal consultants evaluated and prepared to
   initiate renal replacement  therapy for current anuric renal failure.
   Unfortunately, very difficult clinical situtuation for this critically
   ill patient.

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, who has developed multiple complications including respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, and sepsis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, receiving vasopressor support and has anuria. 

The patient's current condition is critical, and several potential medical complications can arise. These include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and potential pulmonary embolism. The patient also has a pseudocyst with a suspected bleeding pseudoaneurysm that requires intervention. 

Further management will involve monitoring vital signs, ABG results, and chest X-ray for respiratory status, as well as maintaining hemodynamic stability with appropriate vasopressor support. Renal function should be closely monitored, and if there is no improvement, renal replacement therapy may be necessary. 

Additionally, the patient's coagulation status should be evaluated, and a CT angiogram may be performed to assess for pulmonary embolism. If present, an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter may be considered. The bleeding pseudoaneurysm will require interventional radiology (IR)-guided embolization. 

Nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is recommended, and glycemic control should be maintained with insulin. Fluid balance should be closely monitored to maintain adequate CVP levels."

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of pancreatitis. He has developed several complications during his hospital stay, including a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from a pseudoaneurysm, acute renal failure (ARF), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, and hepatic cirrhosis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to airway protection and respiratory distress. He has multiple IV lines, including an arterial line and PICC line. The patient's condition is unstable, and he requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudoaneurysm: The patient has a history of GI bleed due to a pseudoaneurysm, which is a ruptured blood vessel within a pseudocyst. This complication can lead to significant blood loss and hemorrhagic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs and continuous blood pressure measurement is essential to detect any signs of hemodynamic instability.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have been increasing, indicating worsening kidney function. ARF can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Frequent monitoring of renal function markers and daily weight measurements should be performed.

3. Clostridium difficile ("

2. Renal failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure during his admission at the OSH, with a creatinine level of 1.9. His creatinine has been trending up in the last 48 hours. He received one dose of lasix on the floor, and his Cr rose to 1.2. Given the potential for ATN due to pulsesless state for 10 minutes, avoiding nephrotoxic medications and considering continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may be necessary.

3. Pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocysts: The patient has a history of pancreatitis with large pancreatic pseudocysts and associated inflammation. There is a concern for complications such as hemorrhage into the pseudocyst, which may require interventional radiology (IR)-guided embolization.

4. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI): The patient developed increased diarrhea and marked leukocytosis within 48 hours of admission. He was positive for C. diff and started on"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom pancreatitis -->  large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple
   intra-abdominal fluid collections (?related to pseudocyst) -->
   gastroduodenal artery pseudoanyeurism hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, now
   s/p cardiac arrest (?PEA).  Overall, worsening clinical status.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.
   Hypoxemia prior to event.  Radiographic evidence for LLL density
   (atalectasis vs. pneumonia).   Plan continue mechanical ventiation,
   monitor ABG, SaO2, mechanics, CXR.
   s/p PEA ARREST -- Unclear precipitant, but concerns include hypoxemia
   (preceeding event), aspiration, or hypovolemia (possible further bleed
   into pseudoaneurysm, 3rd spacing).  Pulmonary embolism possible,
   although no ECG changes (no right heart strain on EKG), LE NIVS without
   DVT and cardiac echo without evidence for RV strain.   No cooling
   initiated because of active bleeding (and concerns for worsening
   bleeding if cooled).  Neurologically responsive initially, now on
   sedation.  Continue to monitor VS.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, pancreatitis, and possible
   hypovolemia, and blood loss (less).  Concern for possible pulmonary
   embolism.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.  Plan to proceed with CT
   angio
 if clot identified, then would place IVC filter while remains
   at risk for bleeding.
   GDA ANERYSM
 will require IR-guided embolization when stable.  Hold
   anticoagulation.  If PE identified, will need IVC filter pending final
   intervention for aneurysm.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to bleeding of pseudoaneurysm into pseudocyst,
   phlebotomy.  Continues to require transfusion.
   PANCREATITIS -- c/b  Pancreatic Pseudocysts, multiple intra-abdominal
   fluid Collections.   General Surgery recommended that the patient
   continue to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in
   [**5-6**] weeks with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of
   surgical intervention at that time.
   STAPH EPI BACTERIMIA -- suspect line-related.  Continue Vanco.
   PSEUDOCYST -- Rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression, with bleeding.   Continue
   vanc/zosyn.  ID consult in progress.
   RASH -- diffuse, blanching erythema.  Suspect drug-related (probable
   antimicrobial).
   C. DIFF COLITIS --  Continue PO vanc for an additional 14 days.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   A-FIB -- new recent problem, plan monitor HR.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- anuric renal failure, in context of
   arrest/code.  Probable ATN.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, uo.  Avoid
   nephrotoxic meds, provide.mucomyst.  At risk for dye-induced renal
   injury required for CT angio and IR-directed embolization.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Likely related to pancreatitis complications.
   Continue insulin.
   FLUIDS -- maintain CVP >12.   Monitor I/O.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis who is currently in the ICU. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated, but there is uncertainty about the underlying cause. His clinical status has been worsening, with respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and signs of sepsis. There are also concerns about possible pulmonary embolism, hypovolemia, and bleeding from a gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm. The patient has anemia, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, and other complications related to pancreatitis and critical illness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised due to mechanical ventilation and the presence of a pseudocyst in the pancreas.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, possibly related to hypoxemia, aspiration, or hypovolemia.
3. Sepsis: The patient shows signs of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: There is a concern for pulmonary embolism due to the patient's immobilization and risk factors.
5. Hypovolemia: The patient may have hypovolemia due to bleeding from the pseudoaneurysm, further bleeding into the pseudocyst, and third spacing of fluids.
6. Acute Renal Failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom pancreatitis -->  large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple
   intra-abdominal fluid collections (?related to pseudocyst) -->
   gastroduodenal artery pseudoanyeurism hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, now
   s/p cardiac arrest (?PEA).  Overall, worsening clinical status.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.
   Hypoxemia prior to event.  Radiographic evidence for LLL density
   (atalectasis vs. pneumonia).   Plan continue mechanical ventiation,
   monitor ABG, SaO2, mechanics, CXR.
   s/p PEA ARREST -- Unclear precipitant, but concerns include hypoxemia
   (preceeding event), aspiration, or hypovolemia (possible further bleed
   into pseudoaneurysm, 3rd spacing).  Pulmonary embolism possible,
   although no ECG changes (no right heart strain on EKG), LE NIVS without
   DVT and cardiac echo without evidence for RV strain.   No cooling
   initiated because of active bleeding (and concerns for worsening
   bleeding if cooled).  Neurologically responsive initially, now on
   sedation.  Continue to monitor VS.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, pancreatitis, and possible
   hypovolemia, and blood loss (less).  Concern for possible pulmonary
   embolism.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.  Plan to proceed with CT
   angio
 if clot identified, then would place IVC filter while remains
   at risk for bleeding.
   GDA ANERYSM
 will require IR-guided embolization when stable.  Hold
   anticoagulation.  If PE identified, will need IVC filter pending final
   intervention for aneurysm.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to bleeding of pseudoaneurysm into pseudocyst,
   phlebotomy.  Continues to require transfusion.
   PANCREATITIS -- c/b  Pancreatic Pseudocysts, multiple intra-abdominal
   fluid Collections.   General Surgery recommended that the patient
   continue to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in
   [**5-6**] weeks with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of
   surgical intervention at that time.
   STAPH EPI BACTERIMIA -- suspect line-related.  Continue Vanco.
   PSEUDOCYST -- Rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression, with bleeding.   Continue
   vanc/zosyn.  ID consult in progress.
   RASH -- diffuse, blanching erythema.  Suspect drug-related (probable
   antimicrobial).
   C. DIFF COLITIS --  Continue PO vanc for an additional 14 days.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   A-FIB -- new recent problem, plan monitor HR.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- anuric renal failure, in context of
   arrest/code.  Probable ATN.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, uo.  Avoid
   nephrotoxic meds, provide.mucomyst.  At risk for dye-induced renal
   injury required for CT angio and IR-directed embolization.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Likely related to pancreatitis complications.
   Continue insulin.
   FLUIDS -- maintain CVP >12.   Monitor I/O.

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, who has developed a large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections. The patient also has a gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, resulting in cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). 

The patient's current condition is characterized by respiratory failure, intubated due to cardiac arrest, hypoxemia prior to the event, and radiographic evidence for left lower lobe density (atalectasis vs. pneumonia). The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG, SaO2, mechanics, and CXR.

The patient has had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, with unclear precipitants. Possible concerns include hypoxemia (preceeding event), aspiration, or hypovolemia (possible further bleed into pseudoaneurysm, third spacing). Pulmonary embolism is also a concern, although no ECG changes (no right heart strain on EKG), and left lower extremity non-invasive venous stasis without deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and cardiac echo without evidence for right ventricular strain. No cooling was initiated because of active bleeding (and concerns for worsening bleeding if cooled). The patient is still sedated and neurologically responsive initially.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from an OSH for
   evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large pancreatic
   pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections thought
   related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatining started trending up in
   the last 48hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patient was pulseless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.  Urine lytes consistent with intrarenal
   process, Eos negative but their NPV is ~ 16%. Worsening today,
   uptrending by 0.3 daily.
   - trial bolus of lasix to see if UOP improves; if he fails, start CVVH
   per Renal
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds; d/ced vancomycin
   - trend creatinine.
   - per prior discussion, family amenable to CRRT
   - f/u renal recs re: when to start CRRT
   .
   # Unresponsiveness S/p PEA arrest:  Unclear precipitant.  No
   hypoglycemia on the scene, and no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  EKG w/o
   evidence of ACS, cardiac markers pending.  the patient was noted to be
   tachypneic, so should consider PE.  No right heart strain on EKG.  The
   patient was noted noted to be hypoxic leading up to the event.  Must
   also consider more active bleed from pseudoaneurysm.  Potential for
   aspiration as precipitating event as well.  TTE, LENIs, CTA neg.
   - continue intubation for airway protection and wean as tolerated
   - avoiding BZDs today, continue fentanyl
   - IVF, wean pressors as tolerated
   - trend Hct for e/o of active bleed ([**Hospital1 **])
   .
   # AMS
 Still unresponsive after discontinuation of midazolam for
   sedation.  Rhythmic motion of R leg concerning for seizure. Worried
   that bzd were masking seizure
   - EEG to r/o epileptiform activity
   - hold on head imaging for now
   - continue to reassess mental status s/p withdrawal of midazolam this
   AM
   .
   # aspiration pneumonia
   - D6/8 of antibiotics; no source grown from sputum cx
   - switching from meropenem to zosyn given ID recs
   .
   # Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections:
   On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect, suggestive
   of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS which revealed a
   large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also performed, which
   confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted multiple large abdominal
   fluid collections. He was evaluated by general surgery, who thought his
   abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation
   was relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage at
   this time was not indicated. They recommended that the patient continue
   to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks
   with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical
   intervention at that time..
   Patient now with rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression.  Given hemorrhage into
   pseudocyst, may very well be reactive inflammation from hemorrhage.  CT
   did not reveal necrotic component.
   - ID recs
   - f/u pending blood and urine cultures.
   - f/u general surgery recs
   - Hct continues to drop; patient will go for IR-guided embolization of
   GDA pseudoaneurysm today
   .
   # Clostridium difficile infection:
   Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased diarrhea and

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of BPH, admitted to the ICU for evaluation of pancreatitis. He has a large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections. The patient's course is complicated by GDA pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR-guided embolization. The patient experienced a pulseless event (PEA arrest) and is currently unresponsive. He also has acute renal failure, AMS (altered mental status), aspiration pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, and hepatic cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating worsening renal function. The cause of acute renal failure could be related to the pulseless event or ongoing intra-abdominal processes.

2. Unresponsiveness/PEA Arrest: The patient experienced a pulseless event, resulting in prolonged hypoxia and possible brain injury. Further investigation is needed to determine the precipitant of the event and to rule out potential causes such as cardiac issues, pulmonary embolism, or massive bleeding from the pseudoaneurysm.

3. AMS: The patient remains unresponsive after discontinuation of midazolam sedation. Rhythmic motion of the right leg suggests possible seizure activity. An EEG should be performed to rule out epileptiform activity.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from an OSH for
   evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large pancreatic
   pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections thought
   related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatining started trending up in
   the last 48hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patient was pulseless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.  Urine lytes consistent with intrarenal
   process, Eos negative but their NPV is ~ 16%. Worsening today,
   uptrending by 0.3 daily.
   - start CVVH
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds; d/ced vancomycin
   - trend creatinine.
   - per prior discussion, family amenable to CRRT
   - f/u renal recs re: when to start CRRT
   .
   # PEA arrest:  Unclear precipitant.  No hypoglycemia on the scene, and
   no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  EKG w/o evidence of ACS, cardiac markers
   pending.  the patient was noted to be tachypneic, so should consider
   PE.  No right heart strain on EKG.  The patient was noted noted to be
   hypoxic leading up to the event.  Must also consider more active bleed
   from pseudoaneurysm.  Potential for aspiration as precipitating event
   as well.  TTE, LENIs, CTA neg.
   - continue intubation for airway protection and wean as tolerated
   - avoiding BZDs today, continue fentanyl
   - IVF, wean pressors as tolerated
   - trend Hct for e/o of active bleed ([**Hospital1 **])
   .
   # AMS
 Still unresponsive after discontinuation of midazolam for
   sedation.  Rhythmic motion of R leg concerning for seizure.
   - EEG to r/o epileptiform activity
   - hold on head imaging for now
   - continue to reassess mental status s/p withdrawal of midazolam this
   AM
   .
   # aspiration pneumonia
   - D6/8 of antibiotics; no source grown from sputum cx
   - switching from meropenem to zosyn given ID recs
   .
   # Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections:
   On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect, suggestive
   of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS which revealed a
   large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also performed, which
   confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted multiple large abdominal
   fluid collections. He was evaluated by general surgery, who thought his
   abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation
   was relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage at
   this time was not indicated. They recommended that the patient continue
   to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks
   with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical
   intervention at that time..
   Patient now with rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression.  Given hemorrhage into
   pseudocyst, may very well be reactive inflammation from hemorrhage.  CT
   did not reveal necrotic component.
   - Zosyn
   - ID recs
   - f/u pending blood and urine cultures.
   - f/u general surgery recs
   - Hct continues to drop; patient will go for IR-guided embolization of
   GDA pseudoaneurysm today
   .
   # Clostridium difficile infection:
   Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased diarrhea and
   marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff positive and started
   on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his diarrhea. He was initially
   stated on flagyl, but started on PO vanc on the day of ICU transfer.
   - cont vanc enemas and cont for until has completed other antibiotics
   then for an additional 14d
   - add IV flagyl per ID recs
   - KUB today to assess for megacolon
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained

   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - amiodarone redosed to gtt given inability to administer PO meds
   - while had a CHADS score of 3, hold anticoagulation in the setting of
   active bleed.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1011**] and was continued on insulin during his hospitalization at
   [**Hospital1 5**]. [**Month (only) 8**] be the result of pancreatic insufficiency with pancreatitis
   vs. a new diagnosis of DM.
   - cont HISS
   - adjust insulin in TPN
   .
   # Hepatic Cirrhosis
   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of pancreatitis. He has been complicated by several medical conditions during his hospital stay. 

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been trending up, indicating worsening renal function. He had a previous episode of acute renal failure during his admission at another hospital, and it is suspected that he may develop acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to his recent pulseless event. The plan is to start continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and avoid nephrotoxic medications.

2. Pulseless Event (PEA arrest): The patient experienced a pulseless event, and the cause is unclear. No hypoglycemia or evidence of acute coronary syndrome was found. The patient was hypoxic leading up to the event, and a potential active bleed from the pseudoaneurysm should be considered. An echocardiogram, CT angiography, and laboratory tests are pending to further evaluate the situation.

3. Alterative Mental Status (AMS): The patient remains unresponsive after discontinuing midazolam, a sedative medication. Rhythmic motion of the right leg suggests the possibility of a seizure, so an electroencephalogram (EEG) will be performed to rule out epileptiform activity. 

4. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient developed aspiration pneumonia"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from an OSH for
   evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large pancreatic
   pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections thought
   related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatining started trending up in
   the last 48hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patient was pulseless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.  Urine lytes consistent with intrarenal
   process, Eos negative but their NPV is ~ 16%. Worsening today,
   uptrending by 0.3 daily.
   - trial bolus of lasix to see if UOP improves; if he fails, start CVVH

   Collections:
   On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect, suggestive
   of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS which revealed a
   large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also performed, which
   confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted multiple large abdominal
   fluid collections. He was evaluated by general surgery, who thought his
   abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation
   was relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage at
   this time was not indicated. They recommended that the patient continue
   to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks
   with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical
   intervention at that time..
   Patient now with rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression.  Given hemorrhage into
   pseudocyst, may very well be reactive inflammation from hemorrhage.  CT
   did not reveal necrotic component.

   # Clostridium difficile infection:
   Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased diarrhea and
   marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff positive and started
   on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his diarrhea. He was initially
   stated on flagyl, but started on PO vanc on the day of ICU transfer.
   Now with worsening abdominal distention, although this could be from
   massive fluid overload.
   - cont vanc enemas and cont for until has completed other antibiotics
   then for an additional 14d
   - add IV flagyl per ID recs
   - KUB: limited evaluation
   - transduce bladder pressure

   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - amiodarone redosed to gtt given inability to administer PO meds
   - while had a CHADS score of 3, hold anticoagulation in the setting of
   active bleed.

   # Hyperglycemia
   He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1011**] and was continued on insulin during his hospitalization at
   [**Hospital1 5**]. [**Month (only) 8**] be the result of pancreatic insufficiency with pancreatitis
   vs. a new diagnosis of DM.
   - cont HISS
   - adjust insulin in TPN

   # Hepatic Cirrhosis
   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was
   consulted, and the felt no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.  They
   recommended a liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were
   unremarkable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for evaluation of acute pancreatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by several medical complications, including acute renal failure, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, altered mental status (AMS), aspiration pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, and hepatic cirrhosis.

The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) that revealed a large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections. A computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the presence of a large pseudocyst and identified a gastrodudodenal artery (GDA) pseudoaneurysm, which was successfully treated with interventional radiology (IR)-guided embolization.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lipase levels, and lactate levels, indicating ongoing inflammation and potential infection. His renal function has deteriorated, with increasing creatinine levels and oliguria. The patient also has electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hyponatremia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 110 to 120 mmHg and a heart rate between 76 and 107 beats per minute. His respiratory"

   Collections:
   On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect, suggestive
   of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS which revealed a
   large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also performed, which
   confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted multiple large abdominal
   fluid collections. He was evaluated by general surgery, who thought his
   abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation
   was relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage at
   this time was not indicated. They recommended that the patient continue
   to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks
   with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical
   intervention at that time..
   Patient now with rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression.  Given hemorrhage into
   pseudocyst, may very well be reactive inflammation from hemorrhage.  CT
   did not reveal necrotic component.

   marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff positive and started
   on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his diarrhea. He was initially
   stated on flagyl, but started on PO vanc on the day of ICU transfer.

   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions and complications. Here is a summary of the information:

1. The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who was admitted for evaluation of pancreatitis.
2. The patient has a large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections related to his pseudocyst.
3. He experienced a gastrointestinal bleed due to a gastro-duodenal artery (GDA) pseudoaneurysm, which was managed with interventional radiology (IR) guided embolization.
4. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, indicated by an increasing creatinine level. He is at risk for acute renal failure (ARF), potentially due to a pulseless event that occurred during his hospitalization.
5. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, the cause of which is unclear. Possible causes include pulmonary embolism (PE), active bleed from the GDA pseudoaneurysm, or aspiration.
6. The patient remains unresponsive and shows signs of agitation or seizure-like activity, leading to concerns about altered mental status (AMS).

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from an OSH for
   evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large pancreatic
   pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections thought
   related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatining started trending up in
   the last 48hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patient was pulsesless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.  Urine lytes consistent with intrarenal
   process, Eos negative but their NPV is ~ 16%. Worsening today,
   uptrending by 0.3 daily.

   no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  EKG w/o evidence of ACS, cardiac markers
   pending.  the patient was noted to be tachypneic, so should consider
   PE.  No right heart strain on EKG.  The patient was noted noted to be
   hypoxic leading up to the event.  Must also consider more active bleed
   from pseudoaneurysm.  Potential for aspiration as precipitating event
   as well.  TTE, LENIs, CTA neg.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for evaluation of acute pancreatitis. He has a large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections. His course is complicated by a gastroduodenal artery (GDA) pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, which required interventional radiology (IR) guided embolization. The patient also has acute renal failure, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, and hepatic cirrhosis. The patient's family contact is his niece, who can be reached at [**Name (NI) 12548**] [**Name (NI) 12549**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been trending upward, indicating worsening renal function. He has been given Mucomyst and NaHCO3 to anticipate contrast from an upcoming IR procedure. The possibility of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) should be considered due to the patient being pulseless for 10 minutes. The patient's urine electrolytes are consistent with an intrarenal process, and he is showing signs of worsening renal function.

2. PEA Arrest: The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PE"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom pancreatitis -->  large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple
   intra-abdominal fluid collections (?related to pseudocyst) -->
   gastroduodenal artery pseudoanyeurism hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, now
   s/p cardiac arrest (?PEA).  Overall, demonstrating clinical improvement
   over past 24 hrs.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.
   Hypoxemia prior to event.  Radiographic evidence for LLL density
   (atalectasis vs. pneumonia).   Plan continue mechanical ventiation,
   monitor ABG, SaO2, mechanics, CXR.
   s/p PEA ARREST -- Unclear precipitant, but concerns include hypoxemia
   (preceeding event), aspiration, or hypovolemia (possible further bleed
   into pseudoaneurysm, 3rd spacing).  No evidence for pulmonary embolism
   (no ECG changes, no right heart strain on EKG, LE NIVS without DVT, and
   negative CTA).  Neurologically responsive initially, now on sedation.
   Continue to monitor VS.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, pancreatitis, and possible
   hypovolemia, and blood loss (less).  Improved.  Monitor BP, maintain
   MAP > 60 mmHg.
   GDA ANERYSM
 s/p successful IR-guided embolization.  Hold
   anticoagulation.
   RHYTHMIC MOVEMENT RIGHT LEG -- concern for focal seizure.  Precipitants
   include s/p arrest, renal failure (although BUN <100).  Plan EEG to
   assess. Consider head imaging.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to bleeding of pseudoaneurysm into pseudocyst,
   phlebotomy.  Continues to require transfusion.
   PANCREATITIS -- c/b  Pancreatic Pseudocysts, multiple intra-abdominal
   fluid Collections.   General Surgery recommended that the patient
   continue to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in
   [**5-6**] weeks with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of
   surgical intervention at that time.  Monitor bladder pressure.  Low
   threshold for imaging.
   STAPH EPI BACTERIMIA -- suspect line-related.  s/p Vanco.
   PSEUDOCYST -- Rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression, with bleeding.   Continue
   vanc/zosyn.  ID consult in progress.
   RASH -- diffuse, blanching erythema.  Suspect drug-related (probable
   antimicrobial).
   C. DIFF COLITIS --  Continue PO vanc for an additional 14 days.  check
   for evidence of toxic megacolon.  KUB unrevealing, consider ABD CT.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   A-FIB -- new recent problem, plan monitor HR.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- anuric renal failure, in context of
   arrest/code.  Probable ATN.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, uo.  Avoid
   nephrotoxic meds, provide.mucomyst.  At risk for dye-induced renal
   injury required for CT angio and IR-directed embolization.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Likely related to pancreatitis complications.
   Continue insulin.
   FLUIDS -- maintain CVP >12.   Monitor I/O.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. Monitoring ABG, SaO2, and mechanics is necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to sepsis, pancreatitis, and possible hypovolemia. It is important to monitor the patient's blood pressure and maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

3. GDA aneurysm: The patient experienced a gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm, which has been successfully embolized. Anticoagulation should be held, and further imaging may be required.

4. Rhythmic movement of right leg: The patient displays rhythmic movement of the right leg, which could be a concern for focal seizure. An EEG should be performed to assess this further, and head imaging may be considered.

5. Anemia: The patient is anemic, likely due to bleeding from the pseudoaneurysm into the pseudocyst and phlebotomy. Continued transfusion support may be necessary.

6. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis with associated complications such as pancreatic pseudocysts and multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections. General surgery recommends continued nasogastric tube placement, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and follow-up imaging"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yom pancreatitis -->  large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple
   intra-abdominal fluid collections (?related to pseudocyst) -->
   gastroduodenal artery pseudoanyeurism hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, now
   s/p cardiac arrest (?PEA).  Overall, demonstrating clinical improvement
   over past 24 hrs.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- intubated in context of cardiac arrest.
   Hypoxemia prior to event.  Radiographic evidence for LLL density
   (atalectasis vs. pneumonia).   Plan continue mechanical ventiation,
   monitor ABG, SaO2, mechanics, CXR.
   s/p PEA ARREST -- Unclear precipitant, but concerns include hypoxemia
   (preceeding event), aspiration, or hypovolemia (possible further bleed
   into pseudoaneurysm, 3rd spacing).  No evidence for pulmonary embolism
   (no ECG changes, no right heart strain on EKG, LE NIVS without DVT, and
   negative CTA).  Neurologically responsive initially, now on sedation.
   Continue to monitor VS.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, pancreatitis, and possible
   hypovolemia, and blood loss (less).  Improved.  Monitor BP, maintain
   MAP > 60 mmHg.
   GDA ANERYSM
 s/p successful IR-guided embolization.  Hold
   anticoagulation.
   RHYTHMIC MOVEMENT RIGHT LEG -- concern for focal seizure.  Precipitants
   include s/p arrest, renal failure (although BUN <100).  Plan EEG to
   assess. Consider head imaging.
   ANEMIA -- attributed to bleeding of pseudoaneurysm into pseudocyst,
   phlebotomy.  Continues to require transfusion.
   PANCREATITIS -- c/b  Pancreatic Pseudocysts, multiple intra-abdominal
   fluid Collections.   General Surgery recommended that the patient
   continue to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in
   [**5-6**] weeks with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of
   surgical intervention at that time.  Monitor bladder pressure.  Low
   threshold for imaging.
   STAPH EPI BACTERIMIA -- suspect line-related.  s/p Vanco.
   PSEUDOCYST -- Rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression, with bleeding.   Continue
   vanc/zosyn.  ID consult in progress.
   RASH -- diffuse, blanching erythema.  Suspect drug-related (probable
   antimicrobial).
   C. DIFF COLITIS --  Continue PO vanc for an additional 14 days.  check
   for evidence of toxic megacolon.  KUB unrevealing, consider ABD CT.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TPN.
   A-FIB -- new recent problem, plan monitor HR.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- anuric renal failure, in context of
   arrest/code.  Probable ATN.  Monitor BUN, creatinine, uo.  Avoid
   nephrotoxic meds, provide.mucomyst.  At risk for dye-induced renal
   injury required for CT angio and IR-directed embolization.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- Likely related to pancreatitis complications.
   Continue insulin.
   FLUIDS -- maintain CVP >12.   Monitor I/O.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis and multiple complications. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The patient has been through cardiac arrest and was resuscitated.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is evidence of hypoxemia prior to the cardiac arrest. Continued monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation are necessary.
2. Pseudocyst with bleeding: The patient has a large pancreatic pseudocyst with intra-abdominal fluid collections, which may lead to further bleeding. Close monitoring and consideration of surgical intervention may be required.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension attributed to sepsis, pancreatitis, and possible hypovolemia. Close monitoring of blood pressure and maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg is essential.
4. GDA aneurysm: The patient had a gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm, which was successfully embolized. Anticoagulation should be avoided, and the patient's condition should be closely monitored.
5. Rhythmic movement of right leg: The patient exhibits rhythmic movement of the right leg, which may indicate a focal seizure. An electroencephalogram (EEG) should be performed to assess the brain activity, and consideration for head imaging is necessary.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to bleeding of the pseudoaneurysm into the pseudocyst and phlebotomy. Transfusion support may be needed.
7. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis requires ongoing management with nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and close monitoring. Surgical intervention may be necessary in the future.
8. Staph epidermidis bacteremia: The patient is suspected to have Staph epidermidis bacteremia, possibly related to a central line. Vancomycin therapy has been initiated.
9. Pseudocyst progression: The patient's pseudocyst is worsening, with increasing white blood cell count, rising lipase levels, and increasing left upper quadrant pain. Repeat imaging reveals interval progression with bleeding. Antibiotic therapy and further evaluation by an infectious disease consultant are necessary.
10. Rash: The patient has developed a diffuse, blanching erythema, which is suspected to be drug-related, most likely an antimicrobial agent. The medication causing the rash should be discontinued if possible.
11. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient may have developed Clostridium difficile colitis, and treatment with oral vancomycin for an additional 14 days is recommended. Monitoring for toxic megacolon and abdominal imaging may be required.
12. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring"

   CT ABDOMEN
   1. Extensive fluid collections identified in the abdomen and pelvis,
   most of
   which are stable in size. Percutaneous drains remain in situ within one
   of
   these along the right. A new fluid collection is seen adjacent to the
   pancreatic tail extending along small bowel loops to the left abdominal
   flank.
   2. New areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacity are identified
   in the
   right middle lobe and right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia or
   aspiration.
   Assessment and Plan
   83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from an OSH for
   evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large pancreatic
   pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections thought
   related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatinine started trending up in
   the last 48hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patient was pulseless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.  Urine lytes consistent with intrarenal
   process, Eos negative but their NPV is ~ 16%.  Worsening today,
   uptrending by 0.3 daily.
   - UOP improved today on lasix, but Cr still rising, worsening
   hyponatremia
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]; trend Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - per prior discussion, family amenable to CRRT
 reconfirm
   - f/u renal recs re: when to start CRRT (goals of care)
   - check pm lytes
   .
   # Unresponsiveness S/p PEA arrest:  Unclear precipitant.  No
   hypoglycemia on the scene, and no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  Cardiac
   enzymes and CTA chest were negative.  The patient was noted to be
   hypoxic leading up to the event.  Still unresponsive after
   discontinuation of midazolam for sedation.  DDx includes sedation
   (impaired renal clearance), uremia, structural defect (i.e. stroke),
   seizure, metabolic (i.e. hyponatremia).
   - f/u EEG resuls to r/o epileptiform activity
   - hold on head imaging for now
   - continue to reassess mental status s/p withdrawal of midazolam this
   AM
   .
   # aspiration +/- PNA
 as seen on CT chest
   - continue intubation and wean as tolerated
   - currently on Zosyn
   .
   # Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections: On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling
   defect, suggestive of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS
   which revealed a large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also
   performed, which confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted
   multiple large abdominal fluid collections. He was evaluated by general
   surgery, who thought his abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and
   associated inflammation was relatively immature, and that surgical
   intervention or drainage at this time was not indicated. They
   recommended that the patient continue to be NPO, continue nutrition
   with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks with repeat imaging and
   clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical intervention at that
   time.  Now s/p IR-guided embolization of GDA pseudoaneurysm, which
   appeared to have hemorrhaged into a pseudocyst.
    - was on meropenem; switched to Zosyn per ID recs as they felt that it
   could explain his abdominal rash
   - ID recs
   - f/u pending blood and urine cultures.
   - CT shows e/o new pseudocyst, may contribute to abdominal distention
   - f/u general surgery recs
   - trend Hct
   .
   # abdominal rash
 Continues to spread.  Thought to be drug-induced,
   with the most likely suspect being abx.  Both vancomycin and meropenem
   have been d/ced since development of rash.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Clostridium difficile infection:
   Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased diarrhea and
   marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff positive and started
   on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his diarrhea. He was initially
   stated on flagyl, but started on PO vanc on the day of ICU transfer.
   Now with worsening abdominal distention, although this could be from
   massive fluid overload.
   - cont vanc enemas + IV flagyl and cont for until has completed other
   antibiotics then for an additional 14d
   - transduce bladder pressure serially
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - amiodarone redosed to gtt given inability to administer PO meds;
   after 1 week will need to redose
   - while had a CHADS score of 3, hold anticoagulation in the setting of
   active bleed.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1011**] and was continued on insulin during his hospitalization at
   [**Hospital1 5**]. [**Month (only) 8**] be the result of pancreatic insufficiency with pancreatitis
   vs. a new diagnosis of DM.
   - cont HISS
   - adjust insulin in TPN
   .
   # Hepatic Cirrhosis
   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was
   consulted, and the felt no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.  They
   recommended a liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were
   unremarkable.

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 12690**]
s note above
   and agree with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 12624**] is a
   previously healthy elderly man with severe pancreatitis, psedocysts,
   pseudoanerysm, s/p PEA arrest with CPR for 25min, renal failure, resp
   failure, hypotension on pressors, severe ongoing leukocytosis, and
   obtundation despite our stopping sedatives.
   His obtundation is likely multifactorial. He did respond to commands
   shortly after being resuscitated, so I doubt anoxic encephalopathy
   explains it all. But this CNS insult, plus his age and renal failure
   and the SIRS state from pancreatitis may well be enough to keep him
   obtunded. His obtundation is contributing to his being on the vent
   still, as is his tense abdomen and acidosis and fluid overload.  His
   renal failure is likely from both his CP Arrest and pancreatitis.
   His prognosis is obviously not good, given the co-morbidities of great
   severity.  Goals of care are to be addressed by his neice who is his
   health care proxy, and another relative who is a physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the
   desire is to continue
aggressive
 care, then he will need CNS imaging
   in addition to the EEG the results of which are pending. He will also
   need consideration of CVHD by renal in an effort to get off fluid,
   correct hyponatremia, and improve mental status.  His pseudocysts are
   very large and he remains on broad spectrum antibiotics. Surgery
   following and we
ll discuss with them if any intervention is in order,
   which I doubt.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of BPH who was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of pancreatitis. He has been diagnosed with severe pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocysts, intra-abdominal fluid collections, and a gastro-duodenal artery pseudoaneurysm that required interventional radiology-guided embolization. The patient also has acute renal failure, unresponsiveness after a pulseless event, aspiration pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, and hepatic cirrhosis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated with multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem, which have been discontinued due to the development of an abdominal rash. The patient's family has been informed about his condition and the goals of care, and they are amenable to continuing aggressive treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating worsening renal function. He is already on furosemide (Lasix) but continues to have worsening hyponatremia. The plan is to monitor electrolytes and consider continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) if necessary.

2. Unresponsiveness: The patient remains unresponsive after a pulseless event, with unclear precipitants. Differential diagnoses include sedation, uremia, structural defects (e.g., stroke), seizure, and metabolic causes (e.g., hy"

   CT ABDOMEN
   1. Extensive fluid collections identified in the abdomen and pelvis,
   most of
   which are stable in size. Percutaneous drains remain in situ within one
   of
   these along the right. A new fluid collection is seen adjacent to the
   pancreatic tail extending along small bowel loops to the left abdominal
   flank.
   2. New areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacity are identified
   in the
   right middle lobe and right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia or
   aspiration.
   Assessment and Plan
   83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from an OSH for
   evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large pancreatic
   pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections thought
   related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatining started trending up in
   the last 48hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patient was pulseless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.  Urine lytes consistent with intrarenal
   process, Eos negative but their NPV is ~ 16%. Worsening today,
   uptrending by 0.3 daily.
   - UOP improved today on lasix, but Cr still rising
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]; trend Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - per prior discussion, family amenable to CRRT
   - f/u renal recs re: when to start CRRT
   .
   # Unresponsiveness S/p PEA arrest:  Unclear precipitant.  No
   hypoglycemia on the scene, and no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  EKG w/o
   evidence of ACS, cardiac markers pending.  the patient was noted to be
   tachypneic, so should consider PE.  No right heart strain on EKG.  The
   patient was noted noted to be hypoxic leading up to the event.  Must
   also consider more active bleed from pseudoaneurysm.  Potential for
   aspiration as precipitating event as well.  TTE, LENIs, CTA neg.
   - continue intubation for airway protection and wean as tolerated
   - avoiding BZDs today, continue fentanyl
   - IVF, wean pressors as tolerated
   - trend Hct for e/o of active bleed ([**Hospital1 **])

   # AMS
 Still unresponsive after discontinuation of midazolam for
   sedation.  Rhythmic motion of R leg concerning for seizure. Worried
   that prior BZDs were masking seizure.

   # Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections:
   On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect, suggestive
   of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS which revealed a
   large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also performed, which
   confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted multiple large abdominal
   fluid collections. He was evaluated by general surgery, who thought his
   abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation
   was relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage at
   this time was not indicated. They recommended that the patient continue
   to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks
   with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical
   intervention at that time..
   Patient now with rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression.  Given hemorrhage into
   pseudocyst, may very well be reactive inflammation from hemorrhage.  CT
   did not reveal necrotic component.
   - was on meropenem; switched to Zosyn per ID recs as they felt that it
   could explain his abdominal rash
   - ID recs
   - f/u pending blood and urine cultures.
   - CT shows e/o new pseudocyst
   - f/u general surgery recs
   - Hct continues to drop; patient will go for IR-guided embolization of
   GDA pseudoaneurysm today
   .
   # Clostridium difficile infection:
   Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased diarrhea and
   marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff positive and started
   on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his diarrhea. He was initially
   stated on flagyl, but started on PO vanc on the day of ICU transfer.
   Now with worsening abdominal distention, although this could be from
   massive fluid overload.
   - cont vanc enemas + IV flagyl and cont for until has completed other
   antibiotics then for an additional 14d
   - transduce bladder pressure
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - amiodarone redosed to gtt given inability to administer PO meds
   - while had a CHADS score of 3, hold anticoagulation in the setting of
   active bleed.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1011**] and was continued on insulin during his hospitalization at
   [**Hospital1 5**]. [**Month (only) 8**] be the result of pancreatic insufficiency with pancreatitis
   vs. a new diagnosis of DM.
   - cont HISS
   - adjust insulin in TPN
   .
   # Hepatic Cirrhosis
   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was
   consulted, and the felt no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.  They
   recommended a liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were
   unremarkable.

   CT ABDOMEN
   1. Extensive fluid collections identified in the abdomen and pelvis,
   most of
   which are stable in size. Percutaneous drains remain in situ within one
   of
   these along the right. A new fluid collection is seen adjacent to the
   pancreatic tail extending along small bowel loops to the left abdominal
   flank.
   2. New areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacity are identified
   in the
   right middle lobe and right lower lobe consistent with pneumonia or
   aspiration.
   Assessment and Plan
   83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from an OSH for
   evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large pancreatic
   pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections thought
   related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatinine started trending up in
   the last 48hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patient was pulseless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.  Urine lytes consistent with intrarenal
   process, Eos negative but their NPV is ~ 16%.  Worsening today,
   uptrending by 0.3 daily.
   - UOP improved today on lasix, but Cr still rising, worsening
   hyponatremia
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]; trend Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - per prior discussion, family amenable to CRRT

   - f/u renal recs re: when to start CRRT (goals of care)
   - check pm lytes
   .
   # Unresponsiveness S/p PEA arrest:  Unclear precipitant.  No
   hypoglycemia on the scene, and no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  Cardiac
   enzymes and CTA chest were negative.  The patient was noted to be
   hypoxic leading up to the event.  Still unresponsive after
   discontinuation of midazolam for sedation.  DDx includes sedation
   (impaired renal clearance), uremia, structural defect (i.e. stroke),
   seizure, metabolic (i.e. hyponatremia).
   - f/u EEG resuls to r/o epileptiform activity
   - hold on head imaging for now
   - continue to reassess mental status s/p withdrawal of midazolam this
   AM
   .
   # aspiration +/- PNA
 as seen on CT chest
   - continue intubation and wean as tolerated
   - currently on Zosyn
   .
   # Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections: On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling
   defect, suggestive of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS
   which revealed a large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also
   performed, which confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted
   multiple large abdominal fluid collections. He was evaluated by general
   surgery, who thought his abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and
   associated inflammation was relatively immature, and that surgical
   intervention or drainage at this time was not indicated. They
   recommended that the patient continue to be NPO, continue nutrition
   with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks with repeat imaging and
   clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical intervention at that
   time.  Now s/p IR-guided embolization of GDA pseudoaneurysm, which
   appeared to have hemorrhaged into a pseudocyst.
    - was on meropenem; switched to Zosyn per ID recs as they felt that it
   could explain his abdominal rash
   - ID recs
   - f/u pending blood and urine cultures.
   - CT shows e/o new pseudocyst, may contribute to abdominal distention
   - f/u general surgery recs

   # abdominal rash
 Continues to spread.  Thought to be drug-induced,
   with the most likely suspect being abx.  Both vancomycin and meropenem
   have been d/ced since development of rash.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Clostridium difficile infection:
   Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased diarrhea and
   marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff positive and started
   on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his diarrhea. He was initially
   stated on flagyl, but started on PO vanc on the day of ICU transfer.
   Now with worsening abdominal distention, although this could be from
   massive fluid overload.
   - cont vanc enemas + IV flagyl and cont for until has completed other
   antibiotics then for an additional 14d
   - transduce bladder pressure serially
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - amiodarone redosed to gtt given inability to administer PO meds;
   after 1 week will need to redose
   - while had a CHADS score of 3, hold anticoagulation in the setting of
   active bleed.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1011**] and was continued on insulin during his hospitalization at
   [**Hospital1 5**]. [**Month (only) 8**] be the result of pancreatic insufficiency with pancreatitis
   vs. a new diagnosis of DM.
   - cont HISS
   - adjust insulin in TPN
   .
   # Hepatic Cirrhosis
   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was
   consulted, and the felt no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.  They
   recommended a liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were
   unremarkable.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of BPH who was transferred from another hospital for evaluation of pancreatitis. He has a large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections, which are thought to be related to his pseudocyst. His course has been complicated by GDA pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring interventional radiology (IR) guided embolization. He also has acute renal failure, unresponsiveness following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, aspiration pneumonia, pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocysts, intra-abdominal fluid collections, abdominal rash, Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, and hepatic cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating worsening renal function. He has a history of acute renal failure during his admission at the other hospital, and there is a potential for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to the recent IR procedure. The patient's urine osmolality is consistent with an intrarenal process, and he has hyponatremia. Monitoring of electrolytes and trends in creatinine is recommended.

2. Unresponsiveness: The patient remains unresponsive after discontinuation of midazolam for sedation. Differential diagnoses include sedation (impaired renal clearance), uremia, structural defect"

   83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from an OSH for
   evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large pancreatic
   pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections thought
   related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatining started trending up in
   the last 48hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patient was pulseless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.  Urine lytes consistent with intrarenal
   process, Eos negative but their NPV is ~ 16%. Worsening today,
   uptrending by 0.3 daily.
   - UOP improved today on lasix, but Cr still rising, worsening
   hyponatremia
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]; trend Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - per prior discussion, family amenable to CRRT
 reconfirm
   - f/u renal recs re: when to start CRRT (goals of care)
   - check pm lytes
   .
   # Unresponsiveness S/p PEA arrest:  Unclear precipitant.  No
   hypoglycemia on the scene, and no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  EKG w/o
   evidence of ACS, cardiac markers pending.  the patient was noted to be
   tachypneic, so should consider PE.  No right heart strain on EKG.  The
   patient was noted noted to be hypoxic leading up to the event.  Must
   also consider more active bleed from pseudoaneurysm.  Potential for
   aspiration as precipitating event as well.  TTE, LENIs, CTA neg.
   - continue intubation for airway protection and wean as tolerated
   - avoiding BZDs today, continue fentanyl
   - IVF, wean pressors as tolerated
   - trend Hct for e/o of active bleed ([**Hospital1 **])
   .
   # AMS
 Still unresponsive after discontinuation of midazolam for
   sedation.  Rhythmic motion of R leg concerning for seizure. Worried
   that prior BZDs were masking seizure. Question uremia/structural defect
   (stroke).
   - f/u EEG resuls to r/o epileptiform activity
   - hold on head imaging for now
   - continue to reassess mental status s/p withdrawal of midazolam this
   AM
   .
   # aspiration +/- PNA
 as seen on CT chest
   - currently on Zosyn
   .
   # Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections:
   On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling defect, suggestive
   of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS which revealed a
   large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also performed, which
   confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted multiple large abdominal
   fluid collections. He was evaluated by general surgery, who thought his
   abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and associated inflammation
   was relatively immature, and that surgical intervention or drainage at
   this time was not indicated. They recommended that the patient continue
   to be NPO, continue nutrition with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks
   with repeat imaging and clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical
   intervention at that time..
   Patient now with rising WBC, rising lipase, and increasing LUQ pain.
   Repeat imaging reveals interval progression.  Given hemorrhage into
   pseudocyst, may very well be reactive inflammation from hemorrhage.  CT
   did not reveal necrotic component.
   - was on meropenem; switched to Zosyn per ID recs as they felt that it
   could explain his abdominal rash
   - ID recs
   - f/u pending blood and urine cultures.
   - CT shows e/o new pseudocyst, may contribute to abdomenal distention
   - f/u general surgery recs
   - Hct continues to drop; patient will go for IR-guided embolization of
   GDA pseudoaneurysm today
   .
   # Clostridium difficile infection:
   Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased diarrhea and
   marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff positive and started
   on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his diarrhea. He was initially
   stated on flagyl, but started on PO vanc on the day of ICU transfer.
   Now with worsening abdominal distention, although this could be from
   massive fluid overload.
   - cont vanc enemas + IV flagyl and cont for until has completed other
   antibiotics then for an additional 14d
   - transduce bladder pressure
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - amiodarone redosed to gtt given inability to administer PO meds
   - while had a CHADS score of 3, hold anticoagulation in the setting of
   active bleed.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1011**] and was continued on insulin during his hospitalization at
   [**Hospital1 5**]. [**Month (only) 8**] be the result of pancreatic insufficiency with pancreatitis
   vs. a new diagnosis of DM.
   - cont HISS
   - adjust insulin in TPN
   .
   # Hepatic Cirrhosis
   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was
   consulted, and the felt no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.  They
   recommended a liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were
   unremarkable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for evaluation of acute pancreatitis. The patient has several medical complications, including acute renal failure, unresponsiveness after a pulseless event, pancreatitis with pancreatic pseudocysts and intra-abdominal fluid collections, Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, and hepatic cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been rising, indicating worsening renal function. There is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to the pulseless event and potential nephrotoxic medications. The plan is to monitor electrolytes and trend creatinine levels, avoid nephrotoxic medications, and consider continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) if necessary.

2. Unresponsiveness: The patient remains unresponsive after discontinuation of midazolam for sedation. Differential diagnoses include sedation (impaired renal clearance), uremia, structural defect (i.e., stroke), seizure, and metabolic (i.e., hyponatremia). Further evaluation is needed, including follow-up EEG results to rule out epileptiform activity.

3. Pancreatitis with Pancreatic Pseudocysts and Intra-abdominal Fluid Collections: The patient has a large"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from an OSH for
   evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large pancreatic
   pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections thought
   related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatinine started trending up in
   the last 48hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patient was pulseless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.  Urine lytes consistent with intrarenal
   process, Eos negative but their NPV is ~ 16%.  Worsening today,
   uptrending daily.
   - UOP improved today on lasix, but Cr still rising, worsening
   hyponatremia
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]; trend Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - per prior discussion, family amenable to CRRT
 reconfirm
   - f/u renal recs re: when to start CRRT (goals of care)
   - check pm lytes
   .
   # Unresponsiveness S/p PEA arrest:  Unclear precipitant.  No
   hypoglycemia on the scene, and no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  Cardiac
   enzymes and CTA chest were negative.  The patient was noted to be
   hypoxic leading up to the event.  Still unresponsive after
   discontinuation of midazolam for sedation.  DDx includes sedation
   (impaired renal clearance), uremia, structural defect (i.e. stroke),
   seizure, metabolic (i.e. hyponatremia).
   - f/u EEG resuls to r/o epileptiform activity --> prelim is
   encephalopathy
   - hold on head imaging for now
   - continue to reassess mental status s/p withdrawal of midazolam this
   AM
   .
   # Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections: On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling
   defect, suggestive of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS
   which revealed a large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also
   performed, which confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted
   multiple large abdominal fluid collections. He was evaluated by general
   surgery, who thought his abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and
   associated inflammation was relatively immature, and that surgical
   intervention or drainage at this time was not indicated. They
   recommended that the patient continue to be NPO, continue nutrition
   with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks with repeat imaging and
   clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical intervention at that
   time.  Now s/p IR-guided embolization of GDA pseudoaneurysm, which
   appeared to have hemorrhaged into a pseudocyst. Worsening leukocytosis
    - was on meropenem; switched to Zosyn per ID recs and later to
   Aztreonam/Cipro
   - ID recs
   - f/u pending blood and urine cultures.
   - CT shows e/o new pseudocyst, may contribute to abdominal distention
   - f/u general surgery recs
   - trend Hct
   .
   # aspiration +/- PNA
 as seen on CT chest
   - continue intubation and wean as tolerated
   - currently on Aztreonam/Cipro
   .
   # abdominal rash
 Continues to spread.  Thought to be drug-induced,
   with the most likely suspect being abx.  Both vancomycin and meropenem
   have been d/ced since development of rash.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Clostridium difficile infection:
   Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased diarrhea and
   marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff positive and started
   on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his diarrhea. He as initially
   stated on flagyl, but started on PO vanc on the day of ICU transfer.
   Now with worsening abdominal distention, although this could be from
   massive fluid overload.
   - cont vanc enemas + IV flagyl and cont for until has completed other
   antibiotics then for an additional 14d
   - transduce bladder pressure serially
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - amiodarone redosed to gtt given inability to administer PO meds;
   after 1 week will need to redose
   - while had a CHADS score of 3, hold anticoagulation in the setting of
   active bleed.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1011**] and was continued on insulin during his hospitalization at
   [**Hospital1 5**]. [**Month (only) 8**] be the result of pancreatic insufficiency with pancreatitis
   vs. a new diagnosis of DM.
   - cont HISS
   - adjust insulin in TPN
   .
   # Hepatic Cirrhosis
   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was
   consulted, and the felt no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.  They
   recommended a liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were
   unremarkable.

   portion of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note
   above and agree with his findings and plan of care.  Unfortunately the
   patient continues with a multiplicity of severe medical problems:
   pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation, Resp Failure, Renal Failure,
   s/p PEA arrest, fevers and severe leukocytosis, Cdiff, hypotension
   requiring pressors, and obtundation despite no sedatives for several
   days.  Given his extremely limited prognosis,  renal service is
   understandably reluctant to commence CVVH. we hope to have a candid
   goals of care discussion with the family today.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of BPH, who was transferred from an OSH for evaluation of pancreatitis. He has multiple severe medical problems including pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation, respiratory failure, renal failure, cardiac issues, fevers, severe leukocytosis, Clostridium difficile infection, hypotension, and obtundation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been increasing, indicating worsening renal function. This could potentially progress to acute renal failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Unresponsiveness: The patient remains unresponsive after a pulseless event, which could be due to various causes such as sedation (impaired renal clearance), uremia, structural defect (i.e., stroke), seizure, or metabolic (i.e., hyponatremia).
3. Pancreatitis and Pancreatic Pseudocysts: The patient has a history of pancreatitis with pseudocyst formation, which can lead to complications like hemorrhage, infection, and obstruction.
4. Intra-abdominal Fluid Collections: The patient has multiple large abdominal fluid collections, which can cause abdominal distention and increase the risk of infection.
5. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, which can worsen if not treated promptly.
6. Hepatic Cirrhosis: Imaging studies revealed hepatic cirrhosis"

   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatinine started trending up in
   the last 48hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patient was pulseless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.  Urine lytes consistent with intrarenal

   which revealed a large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also
   performed, which confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted
   multiple large abdominal fluid collections. He was evaluated by general
   surgery, who thought his abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and
   associated inflammation was relatively immature, and that surgical
   intervention or drainage at this time was not indicated. They
   recommended that the patient continue to be NPO, continue nutrition
   with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks with repeat imaging and

   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - amiodarone redosed to gtt given inability to administer PO meds;

   # Hepatic Cirrhosis
   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was
   consulted, and the felt no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.  They
   recommended a liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Hepatitis serologies were sent and were
   unremarkable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of BPH, who was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of pancreatitis. He has several comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, hepatic cirrhosis (disputed diagnosis), and renal failure. The patient underwent an ERCP, which revealed a large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections. He also had a GDA pseudoaneurysm that was embolized. The patient developed an abdominal rash thought to be drug-induced, and he had an episode of unresponsiveness after a PEA arrest. He is currently on multiple antibiotics, including Aztreonam and Cipro, and is also receiving TPN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been rising, indicating worsening renal function. He has been given Lasix to improve urine output, but his condition is still deteriorating. There is a potential for ATN due to the pulseless event. The patient's urine electrolytes suggest an intrarenal process.
2. Unresponsiveness: The patient experienced an episode of unresponsiveness following a PEA arrest. It is unclear what caused the arrest, but possible causes include sedation (impaired renal clearance), uremia, structural defect (stroke), seizure, or metabolic disturbance (hyponatremia).
3. Aspiration/Pneumonia: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of BPH, who was admitted for evaluation of pancreatitis. He has a large pancreatic pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR-guided embolization. The patient has been unresponsive since a PEA arrest, with unclear precipitant. No hypoglycemia or electrolyte imbalances were noted at the time of the event. The differential diagnosis includes sedation, uremia, structural defect (i.e., stroke), seizure, and metabolic causes (i.e., hyponatremia). The patient has been on multiple antibiotics due to suspected infections, including C. difficile, which was initially positive but improved with Flagyl. He also has atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, and hepatic cirrhosis, although the latter two diagnoses are not confirmed. The patient's family has been informed and is amenable to CRRT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating worsening renal function. He has been given Lasix to improve urine output, but his creatinine continues to rise. Hyponatremia is also worsening. The patient's history of pulseless time during PEA arrest raises the possibility of ATN. Monitoring of electrolytes"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y/o male with history of BPH was transferred from an OSH for
   evaluation of pancreatitis. Evaluation was notable for large pancreatic
   pseudocyst with multiple intra-abdominal fluid collections thought
   related to his pseudocyst. His course is complicated by GDA
   pseudoaneurysm hemorrhage into a pseudocyst, requiring IR guided
   embolization.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure
   During his admission at the OSH, his creatinine was as high as 1.9 and
   then remained stable between .[**8-31**].  Creatinine started trending up in
   the last 48hrs, and was given one dose of lasix on the floor, with Cr
   rise to 1.2.  He was given mucomyst and NaHCO3 with the anticipation of
   contrast from IR procedure.  Given that patient was pulseless for 10
   minutes, potential for ATN.  Urine lytes consistent with intrarenal
   process, Eos negative but their NPV is ~ 16%.  Worsening today,
   uptrending daily.
   - UOP improved today on lasix, but Cr still rising, worsening
   hyponatremia
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]; trend Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - per prior discussion, family amenable to CRRT
 reconfirm
   - f/u renal recs re: when to start CRRT (goals of care)
   - check pm lytes
   .
   # Unresponsiveness S/p PEA arrest:  Unclear precipitant.  No
   hypoglycemia on the scene, and no e/o hypo/hyperkalemia.  Cardiac
   enzymes and CTA chest were negative.  The patient was noted to be
   hypoxic leading up to the event.  Still unresponsive after
   discontinuation of midazolam for sedation.  DDx includes sedation
   (impaired renal clearance), uremia, structural defect (i.e. stroke),
   seizure, metabolic (i.e. hyponatremia).
   - f/u EEG resuls to r/o epileptiform activity --> prelim is
   encephalopathy
   - hold on head imaging for now
   - continue to reassess mental status s/p withdrawal of midazolam this
   AM
   .
   # Pancreatititis, Pancreatic Pseudocysts, Intra-abdominal fluid
   Collections: On ERCP, patient was found to have bile duct filling
   defect, suggestive of external compression. He underwent follow-up EUS
   which revealed a large pancreatic pseudocyst. CTA Pancreas was also
   performed, which confirmed the large pseudocysts but also noted
   multiple large abdominal fluid collections. He was evaluated by general
   surgery, who thought his abdominal process of pancreatic pseudocyst and
   associated inflammation was relatively immature, and that surgical
   intervention or drainage at this time was not indicated. They
   recommended that the patient continue to be NPO, continue nutrition
   with TPN, and then follow-up in [**5-6**] weeks with repeat imaging and
   clinic follow-up for consideration of surgical intervention at that
   time.  Now s/p IR-guided embolization of GDA pseudoaneurysm, which
   appeared to have hemorrhaged into a pseudocyst. Worsening leukocytosis
    - was on meropenem; switched to Zosyn per ID recs and later to
   Aztreonam/Cipro
   - ID recs
   - f/u pending blood and urine cultures.
   - CT shows e/o new pseudocyst, may contribute to abdominal distention
   - f/u general surgery recs
   - trend Hct
   .
   # aspiration +/- PNA
 as seen on CT chest
   - continue intubation and wean as tolerated
   - currently on Aztreonam/Cipro
   .
   # abdominal rash
 Continues to spread.  Thought to be drug-induced,
   with the most likely suspect being abx.  Both vancomycin and meropenem
   have been d/ced since development of rash.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Clostridium difficile infection:
   Within 48 hours of admission, patient developed increased diarrhea and
   marked leukocytosis from 17 to 26. He was C. diff positive and started
   on flagyl on [**2166-5-7**] with improvement in his diarrhea. He as initially
   stated on flagyl, but started on PO vanc on the day of ICU transfer.
   Now with worsening abdominal distention, although this could be from
   massive fluid overload.
   - cont vanc enemas + IV flagyl and cont for until has completed other
   antibiotics then for an additional 14d
   - transduce bladder pressure serially
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation
   Patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation at the OSH and was
   started on diltiazem before being transitioned to amiodarone. Upon
   transfer to [**Hospital1 5**], his PICC line was noted to be advanced into the
   right atrium, and it was thought that this may have been triggering his
   atrial fibrillation. During his hospitalization at [**Hospital1 5**], he remained
   in sinus rhythm and with excellent rate control. His chart says that
   his amioderone was discontinued, but currently ordered.
   - amiodarone redosed to gtt given inability to administer PO meds;
   after 1 week will need to redose
   - while had a CHADS score of 3, hold anticoagulation in the setting of
   active bleed.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia
   He was started on insulin during his hospitalization at [**Hospital3 1011**] and was continued on insulin during his hospitalization at
   [**Hospital1 5**]. [**Month (only) 8**] be the result of pancreatic insufficiency with pancreatitis
   vs. a new diagnosis of DM.
   - cont HISS
   - adjust insulin in TPN
   .
   # Hepatic Cirrhosis
   Imaging from abdominal CT and MRCP revealed hepatic cirrhosis, although
   patient has no history of this in the past. The hepatology team was
   consulted, and the felt no evidence of hepatic cirrhosis.  They
   recommended a liver biopsy, but overall felt that ascites more

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of BPH who was admitted for evaluation of pancreatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by several medical conditions and complications. 

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been rising, indicating worsening renal function. There is concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to the pulseless event. The patient's urine output (UOP) improved with the administration of Lasix, but his creatinine continued to rise. He is experiencing worsening hyponatremia as well. The plan is to monitor electrolytes and trend creatinine, avoid nephrotoxic medications, and consider continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) given the family's amenability.

2. Unresponsiveness post Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA) arrest: The patient remains unresponsive after discontinuation of midazolam for sedation. Differential diagnoses include sedation (impaired renal clearance), uremia, structural defect (i.e., stroke), seizure, and metabolic (i.e., hyponatremia). Further evaluation is needed, including follow-up EEG results to rule out epileptiform activity, and reassessment of mental status following withdrawal of midazolam.
