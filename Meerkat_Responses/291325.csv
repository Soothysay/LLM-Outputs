   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o gentleman with no prior cardiac hx, presenting with syncope
   secondary to wide-complex tachycardia recorded on KOH and EMS strip.
   Another episode on arrival to CCU s/p DCCV.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Symptomatic wide-complex tachycardia concerning for
   monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.  ? related to sympathetic drive.
   Etiology of v-tach could also be secondary to ischemia given his age.
   However recent TTE on [**2162-7-19**] without focal WMA.  History not c/w
   cardiac ischemia.  However his trop was mildly elevated to 0.12 with
   flat CKs.  This could be secondary to Vtach itself in the setting of
   CKD.  No evidence of channelopathies on EKG.
   - Continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Amiodarone bolus with gtt, 300 mg IV bolus
   - Appreciate EP recommendations
   - ? need for cardiac catheterization prior to EP study, will d/w EP
   team in AM
   - Will keep on cardiac monitor
   - Repeat EKG in AM
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD (total chol 217, LDL 146 in [**12-28**]).
   Troponin-T elevated at 0.12 as above.
   - ASA 325 daily
   - ? diagnostic cath as above
   - will cycle troponins q6h, however expect mild elevation post DCCV
   - continue metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # PUMP: No evidence of heart failure on history and exam.  Normal
   systolic function on last echo on [**2162-7-19**] (LVEF>55%).
   - monitor I and O, daily weights
   .
   # HYPERTENSION: hypertensive vs. pre-hypertensive, not on medication
   - Continue metoprolol 50 [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: creatinine slightly elevated at 1.4 from
   baseline of 1.2. CKD may be secondary to hypertension with acute
   component of mild dehydration.
   - Trend renal function
   - avoid nephrotoxins/ renally dose meds

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with no prior cardiac history who presented with syncope secondary to wide-complex tachycardia. He had another episode upon arrival to the CCU after defibrillation. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 54-121 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 118/83 to 174/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10-20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. His temperature is within normal range.

The patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. Physical examination reveals normal heart sounds, no jugular venous distention, and no murmurs or rubs. His extremities have normal pulses and there is no edema. Neurologic examination was not performed.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 9.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 14.8 g/dL, platelet count of 208 K/uL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.18 (elevated), glucose of 131 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with symptomatic wide-complex tachycardia, potentially monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. The cause of the tachycardia is unclear, but it may be related to sympathetic drive or ischemia."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with no prior cardiac history presenting with syncope secondary to wide-complex tachycardia. He experienced another episode upon arrival at the CCU after DCCV (defibrillation). The patient's rhythm is concerning for monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, possibly related to sympathetic drive or ischemia. Recent TTE (transesophageal echocardiogram) on 07/19/2016 showed no focal wall motion abnormalities, and there is no evidence of channelopathies on EKG. 

The patient's coronary arteries are not known to have any blockages, and his troponin-T level is mildly elevated at 0.12. 

The patient's pump function is normal, with an LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) of >55% on the last echo. 

His hypertension is classified as hypertensive or pre-hypertensive, and he is not currently on medication for it. 

The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, with a creatinine level slightly elevated at 1.4 from a baseline of 1.2. This may be secondary to hypertension with an acute component of mild dehydration. 

The patient's code status is full code. 

The patient's disposition is currently in the CCU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with no prior cardiac history presenting with syncope secondary to wide-complex tachycardia. He experienced another episode upon arrival to the CCU after receiving defibrillation. The patient's rhythm is concerning for monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, possibly related to sympathetic drive or ischemia. His troponin-T level is mildly elevated at 0.12, which could be due to VT or CKD. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, and his recent TTE showed no focal wall motion abnormalities. The patient's CK and CK-MB levels are flat, and his glucose level is 131 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has experienced episodes of wide-complex tachycardia, which are concerning for monomorphic VT. This condition can lead to hemodynamic instability and may require further interventions such as antiarrhythmic medications or an electrophysiology study (EPS) with or without ablation.

2. Ischemic Heart Disease: Although the patient's recent echo did not show any evidence of ischemia, his age puts him at risk for coronary artery disease. The mildly elevated troponin-T level raises the possibility of myocardial ischemia or infarction. Further evaluation, such as an ischemic workup, may be necessary to rule out or confirm this condition.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with no prior cardiac history presenting with syncope secondary to wide-complex tachycardia. The patient experienced another episode upon arrival to the CCU after a defibrillation procedure. 

The assessment indicates that the patient is experiencing symptomatic wide-complex tachycardia, which is concerning for monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. The etiology of v-tach could be related to sympathetic drive or ischemia given the patient's age. However, recent tests have shown no evidence of cardiac ischemia, and the patient's troponin level was mildly elevated at 0.12, which could be secondary to v-tach itself in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD). No evidence of channelopathies on EKG.

The plan includes continuing metoprolol 25mg TID, discontinuing amiodarone, using lidocaine GTT if the patient experiences new episodes of sustained VT, appreciating EP recommendations, planning an EP study +/- ablation later this week, considering an ischemic workup after the EP study, and keeping the patient on a cardiac monitor.

Other assessments and plans include no known coronary artery disease, normal pump function, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, and code status as full code."

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with no prior cardiac history presenting with syncope secondary to wide-complex tachycardia recorded on KOH and EMS strip. He had another episode of wide-complex tachycardia upon arrival to the CCU after defibrillation. 

Rhythm: The patient had symptomatic wide-complex tachycardia concerning for monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. The etiology of v-tach could be related to sympathetic drive or ischemia given his age. However, recent TTE on [**2162-7-19**] without focal wall motion abnormalities. History not consistent with cardiac ischemia. His troponin T was mildly elevated to 0.12 with flat CKs, which could be secondary to VT itself in the setting of chronic kidney disease. No evidence of channelopathies on EKG.

Plan:
- Continue metoprolol 25mg TID
- Amiodarone discontinued
- Use lidocaine GTT if PT with new episodes of sustained VT
- Appreciate EP recommendations
- Can consider ischemic workup after EP study
- Will keep on cardiac monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old gentleman who presented with syncope secondary to wide-complex tachycardia. He had two episodes of wide-complex tachycardia recorded on KOH and EMS strips, and another episode upon arrival to the CCU after defibrillation. The patient's rhythm is symptomatic wide-complex tachycardia, which is concerning for monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. The possible etiology could be related to sympathetic drive or ischemia, but recent TTE did not show any focal wall motion abnormalities, and there is no history of cardiac ischemia. However, his troponin T level was mildly elevated at 0.12, which could be secondary to VT itself in the setting of chronic kidney disease. No evidence of channelopathies on EKG was observed.

The patient has no known coronary artery disease, but his LDL cholesterol level is elevated at 146. He has a history of hypertension but is not currently on medication. There is no evidence of heart failure on history and exam, and his left ventricular ejection fraction is above 55% based on the last echo. The patient's renal function is slightly impaired with a creatinine level of 1.5 from a baseline of 1.2, which may be due to hypertension with acute mild dehydration.

The patient's plan includes continuing metoprolol 25 mg TID, discontinuing amiodarone"

","Summary:
The patient is a 102 kg male with a chief complaint of ventricular tachycardia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 129/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the ventricular tachycardia. The patient's flow sheet data shows that they have received a total of 1,360 mL of fluids, with 360 mL given orally, 1,000 mL given intravenously, and 975 mL output in the urine. The patient's blood products and drains are also noted. The patient is not receiving respiratory support, with an SpO2 of 98% and normal ABG results. Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient with no acute distress, with normal heart sounds, peripheral pulses, and respiratory system examination. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Extremities show no edema, and the patient's skin and neurologic examinations are not assessed. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated troponin T, and other abnormalities. The patient has been on the ICU since [**2162-7-24**] at 11:20 PM, with recent events including episodes of ventricular tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventricular tachycardia recurrence: The patient has a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia, which can potentially recur and may require further intervention.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may suggest an underlying infection, which could lead to complications such as sepsis if not properly managed.
3. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and low International Normalized Ratio (INR) indicate a risk of bleeding, especially considering the patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 440 mL since midnight, indicating potential dehydration or ongoing fluid losses.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, with a minimum reading of 104/51 mmHg, indicating a potential risk of hypotension.
6. Respiratory issues: Although the patient is not currently receiving respiratory support, the presence of crackles at the lung bases may suggest underlying pulmonary issues that could progress to respiratory failure if not addressed.
7. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male who presented with syncope secondary to wide-complex tachycardia. He had two episodes of wide-complex tachycardia, one on the way to the hospital and another upon arrival at the CCU. He was successfully defibrillated with DCCV. 

The patient has a history of hypertension but no prior cardiac history. His recent TTE showed no focal wall motion abnormalities, and his troponin-T level was mildly elevated at 0.12, which could be due to the ventricular tachycardia itself in the setting of chronic kidney disease. There is no evidence of channelopathies on the EKG.

The plan is to continue metoprolol 25 mg three times a day, discontinue amiodarone, and use lidocaine GTT if the patient experiences new episodes of sustained VT. An EP study is recommended, and after the procedure, consideration can be given to an ischemic workup. The patient will remain on cardiac monitor and will be NPO for an EP ablation procedure today.

The patient's coronary arteries are not known to be diseased, with a total cholesterol level of 217 and LDL of 146 on [**12-28**]. Troponin-T will be monitored every six hours, and it is expected to show mild elevation post DCCV. The patient will continue taking metoprolol 25 mg three times a day"

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of wide-complex tachycardia, which may progress to ventricular tachycardia. This condition can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
2. Ischemia: The patient's elevated troponin T level suggests possible myocardial ischemia. If left untreated, this could lead to further damage to the heart muscle.
3. Dehydration: The patient's slightly elevated creatinine level may be"

   64 y/o gentleman with no prior cardiac hx, presenting with syncope
   secondary to wide-complex tachycardia recorded on KOH and EMS strip.
   Another episode on arrival to CCU s/p DCCV.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Symptomatic wide-complex tachycardia concerning for
   monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.  ? related to sympathetic drive.
   Etiology of v-tach could also be secondary to ischemia given his age.
   However recent TTE on [**2162-7-19**] without focal WMA.  History not c/w
   cardiac ischemia.  However his trop was mildly elevated to 0.12 with
   flat CKs.  This could be secondary to Vtach itself in the setting of
   CKD.  No evidence of channelopathies on EKG.   Pt now s/p unsuccessful
   EP ablation, possible epicardial focus of VT.
   - Will use lidocaine GTT if PT w/ new episodes of sustained VT
   - Appreciate EP recommendations
   - Can consider ischemic w/u after EP study
   - Will keep on cardiac monitor
   - will continue sotalol 80 mg PO BID, uptitrate to 120 mg PO BID at
   discharge, check ECG after each dose for QT prolongation
   - Cardiac MRI this morning, will pre-medicate with valium/ativan, pt
   anxious/clostrophobic
   - plan for ICD placement tomorrow
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD (total chol 217, LDL 146 in [**12-28**]).
   Troponin-T elevated at 0.12 as above.
   - ASA 81 daily
   - will cycle troponins q6h, however expect mild elevation post DCCV ->
   trending down, peak 0.18
   - Cardiac MRI today
   .
   # PUMP: No evidence of heart failure on history and exam.  Normal
   systolic function on last echo on [**2162-7-19**] (LVEF>55%).
   - monitor I and O, daily weights

   # HYPERTENSION: hypertensive vs. pre-hypertensive, not on medication
   - Continue sotalol
   .
   # CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: creatinine slightly elevated at 1.5 from
   baseline of 1.2. CKD may be secondary to hypertension with acute
   component of mild dehydration.
   - Trend renal function

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with no prior cardiac history who presented with syncope secondary to wide-complex tachycardia recorded on KOH and EMS strip. Another episode occurred upon arrival to the CCU after DCCV. The patient underwent unsuccessful EP ablation, possible epicardial focus of VT. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 131/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and temperature within normal limits. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The creatinine level is slightly elevated at 1.5 from a baseline of 1.2, which may be due to chronic renal insufficiency secondary to hypertension with an acute component of mild dehydration. 

The patient has a mildly elevated troponin-T level of 0.12, but flat CK levels. There is no evidence of channelopathies on EKG. 

The plan is to use lidocaine GTT if the patient experiences new episodes of sustained VT, continue sotalol 80 mg PO BID with plans to uptitrate to 120 mg PO BID at discharge, and monitor for QT prolongation. The patient will undergo cardiac MRI today and will be pre-medicated with valium/ativan due to anxiety and claustrophobia. A plan for"

","Summary:
The patient presented with syncope and wide-complex tachycardia. They underwent cardiac catheterization and EP ablation, during which they experienced a brief episode of ventricular tachycardia, unresponsiveness, and seizure-like activity. They received two shocks, returned to sinus rhythm, and were easily reoriented. The patient has no known drug allergies and is currently on various medications including omeprazole and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Their review of systems is unchanged from admission except for post-procedure symptoms. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate at 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. They are well-nourished and not in acute distress. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities, including the absence of lower extremity edema. Lab results show normal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and blood glucose levels. However, there is a slight elevation in creatinine and troponin T levels. The patient's current assessment is ventricular tachycardia, and they are being closely monitored in the ICU with appropriate care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient has a full code status and their disposition is pending further evaluation.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male who presented with syncope secondary to wide-complex tachycardia. He had two episodes of ventricular tachycardia, one during the cardiac catheterization procedure and another upon arrival at the CCU, which was successfully terminated with defibrillation. The patient's troponin-T levels were mildly elevated at 0.12, which could be related to the ventricular tachycardia itself or CKD (chronic kidney disease). 

The patient has a history of hypertension but no known cardiac history. His most recent echocardiogram showed normal systolic function with an ejection fraction >55%. There is no evidence of heart failure on history and physical examination. 

The patient's renal function is slightly impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.5 from a baseline of 1.2. This may be due to hypertension with an acute component of mild dehydration. 

The patient is currently on metoprolol 25mg three times a day and is scheduled for an electrophysiology (EP) ablation procedure today. Lidocaine GTT (guardian time tape) will be used if the patient experiences new episodes of sustained VT (ventricular tachycardia). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrence of ventricular tachycardia: The patient has already experienced two episodes"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with no prior cardiac history, presenting with syncope secondary to wide-complex tachycardia. He experienced another episode of wide-complex tachycardia upon arrival to the CCU following DCCV. The patient underwent an unsuccessful EP ablation, suggesting a possible epicardial focus of VT. The plan is to use lidocaine GTT if PT with new episodes of sustained VT, appreciate EP recommendations, consider ischemic workup after EP study, continue cardiac monitoring, and keep on sotalol 80 mg PO BID, uptitrating to 120 mg PO BID while checking ECG after each dose for QT prolongation. A cardiac MRI will be done this morning, and the patient will be pre-medicated with ativan due to anxiety and claustrophobia. The plan for ICD placement tomorrow has been made.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of wide-complex tachycardia or ventricular tachycardia.
2. Development of QT prolongation due to sotalol administration.
3. Contrast-induced nephropathy from the cardiac MRI.
4. Possible complications associated with ICD placement, such as infection, pneumothorax, or lead dislodgment.
5. Acute kidney injury due to dehydration or underlying chronic renal insufficiency.
6. Hypoglycemia if insulin therapy is required for glycemic control.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) despite prophylaxis with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (SCD's)."

   64 y/o gentleman with no prior cardiac hx, presenting with syncope
   secondary to wide-complex tachycardia recorded on KOH and EMS strip.
   Another episode on arrival to CCU s/p DCCV.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Symptomatic wide-complex tachycardia concerning for
   monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.  ? related to sympathetic drive.
   Etiology of v-tach could also be secondary to ischemia given his age.
   However recent TTE on [**2162-7-19**] without focal WMA.  History not c/w
   cardiac ischemia.  However his trop was mildly elevated to 0.12 with
   flat CKs.  This could be secondary to Vtach itself in the setting of
   CKD.  No evidence of channelopathies on EKG.   Pt now s/p unsuccessful
   EP ablation, possible epicardial focus of VT.
   - Will use lidocaine GTT if PT w/ new episodes of sustained VT
   - Appreciate EP recommendations
   - Can consider ischemic w/u after EP study
   - Will keep on cardiac monitor
   - will continue sotalol 80 mg PO BID, uptitrate to 120 mg PO BID at
   discharge, check ECG after each dose for QT prolongation
   - Cardiac MRI this morning, will pre-medicate with valium/ativan, pt
   anxious/clostrophobic

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 64-year-old man with no prior cardiac history who presented with syncope secondary to wide-complex tachycardia.
- He experienced another episode of wide-complex tachycardia upon arrival to the CCU and was successfully defibrillated.
- The patient underwent unsuccessful EP ablation due to a possible epicardial focus of VT.
- His troponin-T levels were mildly elevated at 0.12, which could be related to the VT itself or chronic kidney disease.
- The patient has been prescribed sotalol 80 mg PO BID and will be uptitrated to 120 mg PO BID at discharge, with ECG monitoring for QT prolongation.
- A cardiac MRI is pending and an ICD placement is planned for today.
- The patient has no known coronary artery disease, but his cholesterol levels are slightly elevated.
- There is no evidence of heart failure based on the patient's history and examination.
- The patient's systolic function on the last echo was normal with an LVEF>55%.
- He has a history of chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine levels slightly elevated at 1.5 from a baseline of 1.2.
- The patient is experiencing right great toe pain, suspected to be podagra, and will be treated with indomethacin after ICD placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient has already experienced episodes of wide-complex tachycardia concerning for monomorphic VT. If left untreated or uncontrolled, it can lead to hemodynamic instability and potential cardiac arrest.

2. Cardiac ischemia: Although the patient's recent TTE did not show any focal wall motion abnormalities (WMA), there is still a possibility of underlying cardiac ischemia, especially considering the patient's age. If not properly managed, it can lead to myocardial infarction or worsening heart failure.

3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient has a slightly elevated creatinine level, indicating potential CKD. This can further complicate the management of medications and may require dose adjustments or alternative treatments.

4. Prolonged QT interval: The patient's QT interval was noted to be prolonged at around 450 msec. If not closely monitored and managed, this can increase the risk of torsades de pointes or other serious arrhythmias.

5. Podagra: The patient's right great toe pain is suspected to be podagra, a type of gout flare. If not appropriately treated, it can lead to increased pain, inflammation, and potential complications related to gout.

6. Infection: Although not explicitly mentioned in the progress note, patients in the ICU are at increased risk of developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old gentleman with no prior cardiac history, presenting with syncope secondary to wide-complex tachycardia. He experienced another episode upon arrival at the CCU after defibrillation. The patient underwent unsuccessful EP ablation, possible epicardial focus of VT. His cardiac MRI was tolerated well, and results are pending. The plan is to place an ICD tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) - The patient's current condition includes symptomatic wide-complex tachycardia concerning for monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. VT is a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia that can lead to cardiac arrest if not managed promptly.
2. Ischemia - Although the patient's recent TTE showed no focal wall motion abnormalities, there is still a possibility of ischemia-related VT. Ischemia can result in decreased blood flow to the heart muscle, causing chest pain or discomfort, which may lead to arrhythmias.
3. Prolonged QT interval - The patient's EKG shows a QT interval of ~450 msec, indicating a prolonged QT interval. Prolonged QT can increase the risk of developing life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency - The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated from the baseline of 1.2 to 1.5. This suggests chronic kidney disease ("

- The patient is a 64-year-old male with no prior cardiac history.
- He presented with syncope secondary to wide-complex tachycardia.
- He experienced another episode upon arrival to the CCU after defibrillation (DCCV).
- The patient's rhythm is symptomatic wide-complex tachycardia, possibly monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT).
- There is a concern for sympathetic drive or ischemia as potential causes.
- The patient underwent unsuccessful EP ablation, suggesting a possible epicardial focus of VT.
- The plan includes using lidocaine GTT if PT with new episodes of sustained VT, continuing sotalol 80 mg PO BID, uptitrate to 120 mg PO BID at discharge, and checking ECG after each dose for QT prolongation.
- A cardiac MRI was performed today, and the patient will receive pre-medication due to anxiety and claustrophobia.
- ICD placement is planned for tomorrow.
- The patient has no known coronary artery disease (CAD), but his total cholesterol is elevated at 217, with LDL at 146 on [**12-28**].
- Troponin-T is mildly elevated at 0.12.
- The patient's heart function is normal, with an LVEF>55% on the last echo.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o gentleman with no prior cardiac hx, presenting with syncope
   secondary to wide-complex tachycardia recorded on KOH and EMS strip.
   Another episode on arrival to CCU s/p DCCV.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Symptomatic wide-complex tachycardia concerning for
   monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.  ? related to sympathetic drive.
   Etiology of v-tach could also be secondary to ischemia given his age.
   However recent TTE on [**2162-7-19**] without focal WMA.  History not c/w
   cardiac ischemia.  However his trop was mildly elevated to 0.12 with
   flat CKs.  This could be secondary to Vtach itself in the setting of
   CKD.  No evidence of channelopathies on EKG.   Pt now s/p unsuccessful
   EP ablation, possible epicardial focus of VT, which had different
   morphology than initial VT.
   - Will use lidocaine GTT if PT w/ new episodes of sustained VT
   - Appreciate EP recommendations
   - Will keep on cardiac monitor
   - will continue sotalol 80 mg PO BID, uptitrate to 120 mg PO BID at
   discharge, check ECG after each dose for QT prolongation
   - Cardiac MRI results pending, will follow up today
   - plan for ICD placement today, pt currently NPO
   .
   # CORONARIES: No known CAD (total chol 217, LDL 146 in [**12-28**]).
   Troponin-T elevated at 0.12 as above.
   - ASA 81 daily
   - will cycle troponins q6h, however expect mild elevation post DCCV ->
   trending down, peak 0.18
   - Cardiac MRI f/u, ICD today
   .
   # PUMP: No evidence of heart failure on history and exam.  Normal
   systolic function on last echo on [**2162-7-19**] (LVEF>55%).
   - monitor I and O, daily weights
   .
   # HYPERTENSION: hypertensive vs. pre-hypertensive, not on medication ->
   will start lisinopril today
   - Continue sotalol
   .
   # CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY: creatinine slightly elevated at 1.5 from
   baseline of 1.2. CKD may be secondary to hypertension with acute
   component of mild dehydration.
   - Trend renal function
   - avoid nephrotoxins/ renally dose meds

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of syncope secondary to wide-complex tachycardia. The patient had two episodes of wide-complex tachycardia, one while at home and another upon arrival at the CCU. The patient underwent successful defibrillation for ventricular tachycardia (VT) and had unsuccessful epicardial focus of VT with different morphology.

The patient has a history of no prior cardiac issues but presented with syncope and wide-complex tachycardia. The EKG shows a prolonged QT interval of 450 milliseconds. The cardiac MRI was tolerated well, and the results are pending. The plan is for ICD placement today.

The patient also has right great toe pain, suspected to be podagra. He will be treated with indomethacin.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 123/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. The patient is alert and oriented, and his physical examination is largely unremarkable except for a non-displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI) and jugular venous distention (JVD) at 7 cm.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 14.6 g"
