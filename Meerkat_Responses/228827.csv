   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   60 y/o M s/p fall down and EtOH intox found to have comminuted
   fractures of the right tibia and the fibula.
   .
   # Afib/flutter with RVR: Patient with first ECG that looked like 2:1
   flutter and repeat after slowing down in ED that looked like A-fib.
   Likely RVR in setting of pain and EtOH intox as well as questionable
   intake of medications.  Patient is having difficulty taking PO
   medications and heart rate control was not acheived on the floor.  He
   does respond to both diltiezem and metoprolol IV.  As he was previously
   on metoprolol PO as outpatient will continue BB for AV nodal blockage.
   -Currently well rate controlled on dilt drip.
   -continue home 50mg metoprolol PO.
   - IVF PRN.
   -Holding anticoagulation in periop setting.  Likely can just start
   aspirin daily.
   -Continue to monitor for symptoms of withdraw/intox.
   -Pain control.
   -Per EP, would go for TEE/Cardioversion if rate control cannot be
   achieved with dilt drip.
   .
   # Ankle fracture: Needs to go to OR for ? staged procedure.
   - appreciate ortho recs
   - pain management with IV dilaudid.
   - NPO for now
   .
   # Preop risk assessment: Patient needs the procedure for pain control
   per Ortho team. Moderate risk procedure. Will need to optimize his
   heart rate prior to going to the procedure.
   - continue betablockade, needs RVR under control prior to going to OR
   - please see below for further details of risk assessment
   .
   # Per patient the last drink was on [**2176-12-21**] in the afternoon.  No
   recorded EtOH level at this time.  Unclear if patient is currently
   intoxicated or withdrawing.  The timeframe and tremor indicate
   withdraw.  However he is having slurred/mumbling speech which could
   support intoxication.  His elevated HR and pain are also confusing the
   picture.  He is not hallucinating or hypertensive.  Putting all of this
   together he is likely just starting to go through withdraw from EtOH.
   Will continue with symptom based benzodiazepine administration.
   - Continue CIWA with valium 5mg PO for CIWA > 10 q2h prn
   - F/u serum and urine tox for any evidence of other ingestions.  Also
   EtOH level from am may be useful in assess current toxicity v.
   withdraw.
   - thiamine/folate/MVI
   .
   # N/V: Nonbloody and nonbilious. ? secondary to pain. Normal abd exam
   is reassuring but will need to rule out alcoholic hepatitis or
   pancreatitis.
   - check LFTs and lipase
   - NPO for now
   - odensetron IV prn
   .
   # Anemia: Macrocytic in an alcoholic patient. Probably secondary to
   nutritional deficiency.
   - guaic stools
   - iron panel/B12/folate levels
   .
   # Throbocytopenia: Thought to be due to alcoholism.
   - continue to trend
   - transfuse for Plt < 20 or active bleeding
   - avoid heparin products for now
   .
   Per the Revised [**Doctor Last Name 3480**] cardiac risk index (RCRI), the 6 independent
   predictors of perioperative cardiac complications are:
   1) High-risk surgery (includes any intraperitoneal, intrathoracic,
   suprainguinal, or peripheral arterial vascular procedures)
   2) History of ischemic heart disease (h/o MI or positive stress test,
   current CP thought due to cardiac angina, use of nitrate therapy, or
   ppathological Q waves on EKG, but NOT including revascularization)
   3) History of Heart Failure
   4) Stroke
   5) preoperative treatment with insulin (eg IDDM)
   6) Creatinine >2.0 mg/dL
   .
   The perioperative rate of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial
   infarction, and nonfatal cardiac arrest is approximately:
   .
   No risk factors - 0.4 percent (95% CI 0.1-0.8 percent)
   One risk factor - 1.0 percent (95% CI 0.5-1.4 percent)
   Two risk factors - 2.4 percent (95% CI 1.3-3.5 percent)
   Three or more risk factors - 5.4 percent (95% CI 2.8-7.9 percent)
   ([**Location (un) **], TH, [**Doctor Last Name 10710**], ER, [**Last Name (un) 10711**], CM, et [**Doctor Last Name **], Circulation [**2165**];
   100:1043)
   .
   By adding beta blocker therapy, this risk can be reduced to:
   No risk factors - <1% (versus 0.4 to 1.0%)
   One to two risk factors - 0.8 to 1.6% (versus 2.2 to 6.6%)
   Three or more risk factors - >3% (versus >9 %)
   (Auerbach, A, [**Doctor Last Name 3480**], L. Circulation [**2172**]; 113:1361)
   .
   This patient has 0 risk factors, and hence has a 0.4% risk of
   perioperative cardiac complications.
   .
   He will need to be continued on betablockade periprocedure especially
   in the setting of of Atrial fibrillation/ atrial flutter with RVR.
   Needs RVR undercontrol prior to patient going to OR.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male who presented to the hospital with a history of EtOH intoxication and sustained comminuted fractures of the right tibia and fibula from a fall. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and is currently being treated with diltiazem and metoprolol IV. The patient's heart rate has been well controlled on the diltiazem drip.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure of 136/67 mmHg, heart rate of 91 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 6.4 K/uL, hematocrit of 33.9%, platelet count of 83 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and glucose level of 121 mg/dL. Other labs, including calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels, are within normal range.

The patient's pain is being managed with IV dilaudid, and he is NPO (nothing by mouth) at the moment. The patient is at moderate risk for perioperative cardiac complications, but this risk can be reduced with continued beta-blocker therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further"

   Per the Revised [**Doctor Last Name 3480**] cardiac risk index (RCRI), the 6 independent
   predictors of perioperative cardiac complications are:
   1) High-risk surgery (includes any intraperitoneal, intrathoracic,
   suprainguinal, or peripheral arterial vascular procedures)
   2) History of ischemic heart disease (h/o MI or positive stress test,
   current CP thought due to cardiac angina, use of nitrate therapy, or
   ppathological Q waves on EKG, but NOT including revascularization)
   3) History of Heart Failure
   4) Stroke
   5) preoperative treatment with insulin (eg IDDM)
   6) Creatinine >2.0 mg/dL
   .
   The perioperative rate of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial
   infarction, and nonfatal cardiac arrest is approximately:
   .
   No risk factors - 0.4 percent (95% CI 0.1-0.8 percent)
   One risk factor - 1.0 percent (95% CI 0.5-1.4 percent)
   Two risk factors - 2.4 percent (95% CI 1.3-3.5 percent)
   Three or more risk factors - 5.4 percent (95% CI 2.8-7.9 percent)

   .
   By adding beta blocker therapy, this risk can be reduced to:
   No risk factors - <1% (versus 0.4 to 1.0%)
   One to two risk factors - 0.8 to 1.6% (versus 2.2 to 6.6%)
   Three or more risk factors - >3% (versus >9 %)

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU with a right ankle fracture complicated by alcohol withdrawal and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR). The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right ankle fracture, received antibiotics peri-operatively, and was started on DVT prophylaxis with Lovenox. Post-operatively, there was some bleeding around the surgical site, which is expected according to the orthopedics. The patient's atrial fibrillation transitioned to sinus rhythm most of the day while on diltiazem, but had a 14-beat run of ventricular tachycardia (VT) at 1600, which was asymptomatic. The patient's temperature spiked to 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit and blood cultures were sent earlier that day, so they were not repeated. The patient has no known drug allergies and received cefazolin for surgery. The patient is currently on various medications including enoxaparin (Lovenox), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted complications. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated blood pressure. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,011 mL and output of 1,775 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 236"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:  60 yom with h/o ETOH abuse admitted with right
   ankle fracture complicated by ETOH withdrawal and AF with RVR now POD 1
   s/p ORIF of right ankle.
   # AF with RVR: patient now successfully transitioned from diltiazem gtt
   to PO and has remained in NSR most of night.  14 beat run of isolated
   asymptomatic VT in setting of normal electrolytes likely do to
   combination of ETOH withdrawal and pain with irritable myocardium.
   - rate control: PO Diltiazem and consider transitioning to 60-80 mg PO
   QID (max 360 mg daily), consider transitioning to B-
     blockade for perioperative mortality benefit
   - ETOH withdrawal: continue CIWA as discussed below
   - pain control: as discussed below.
   .
   # ETOH withdrawal:  last drink on [**12-21**] now nearing 72 hours out
   anticipating withdrawal symptoms to subside throughout day, patient
   with decreasing CIWA requirements.
   - continue CIWA scale Diazepam 5-10 mg PO q 1 hour PRN, may space to 2
   hours as requirements decrease
   .
   # Ankle fracture: POD 1 s/p ORIF right ankle
   - pain control: Dilaudid 1 mg IV q 4 hours PRN for pain control, will
   add PO pain medicines as CIWA requirement abate for
     improved long term control
   - anticoagulation: lovenox 40 mg SQ daily
   .
   # Anemia: macrocytic anemia in setting of ETOH abuse likely
   representing nutritional deficiency.  B12 level on low end of normal as
   suspected culprit.  Remaining Fe studies WNL.
   - consider B12 supplementation
   - continue to guiac stools in setting of anticoagulation and GIB [**1-29**]
   PUD in PMH
   .
   # Throbocytopenia: likely resulting from alcoholism, remain stable
   - trend with daily CBC

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU with a right ankle fracture, complicated by alcohol withdrawal and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent an open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right ankle and received antibiotics peri-operatively. He is currently on prophylactic anticoagulation with Enoxaparin (Lovenox) and pain control with Hydromorphone (Dilaudid). The patient's vital signs show a slight elevation in temperature, but he is hemodynamically stable. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,011 mL and output of 1,775 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 236 mL. The patient's labs indicate anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are likely related to alcoholism. Imaging studies are pending. The patient's assessment includes rate control for atrial fibrillation, management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, pain control, and monitoring for complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics peri-operatively, but there is a risk of post-operative infection due to the surgical procedure.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on prophylactic antico"

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU for a right ankle fracture complicated by alcohol withdrawal and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of the right ankle fracture, received antibiotics peri-operatively, and received prophylactic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient experienced some bleeding around the surgical site post-operatively, which is expected according to the orthopedic surgeon. The patient was also diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and is being transitioned to oral diltiazem. The patient had a brief run of ventricular tachycardia but was asymptomatic. The patient's temperature spiked to 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit and blood cultures were sent. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient is receiving enoxaparin (Lovenox) for DVT prophylaxis, hydromorphone (Dilaudid) for pain management, and other medications as needed. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the new onset of atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 120/60 to 181/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%."
