   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Doctor Last Name 7575**] is a 17 year old Guatemalan male previously
   healthy who presents with 1 week of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
   diarrhea, diffuse rash found to have rhabdomyolysis, ARF, bilateral
   pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum.
   # Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for worsening dyspnea and
   hypoxia with initial increase in oxygen requirement concerning for
   [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS with P/F <300 and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.  CXR much
   improved this AM with patient tolerating PSV.  Hypoxemic respiratory
   failure likely secondary to volume overload from ARF now improving
   after HD.
   - SBT today, plan to extubate after HD
   # ARF: Consistent with GN with additional component of pigment
   nephropathy from rhabdomyolysis.  Most likely etiology at this time is
   post-strep GN, although other etiologies including Strep or Staph toxic
   shock, pesticide mediated exposure, +/- ANCA associated vasculitis or
   IgA/HSP vasculitis, viral infection with myositis although rapid viral
   screen negative, tick-borne infection including Erlichia and RMSF, or
   bacterial infection including meningococcemia cannot be excluded
   completely at this time. Bronch inconsistent with DAH. LP with WBC 2
   and otherwise unconcerning.
   - Continue solumedrol 125 mg Q24 (day [**1-11**])
   - Hold vanco, doxycycline, acyclovir, pip/tazo, and clindamycin.
   Convert amp to amp/sulbactam.
   - Follow-up culture data, serologies, ASLO, GAS throat swab.
   - Hold IVIG
   - Follow-up inflammatory work-up including ANCA and complement levels.
   - Appreciate derm, ID, thoracic, toxicology recs, liver, and renal recs
   - Consent for HIV test when extubated.
   - Trend lytes TID, plan for HD today. Kayexalate prn for hyperkalemia
   - F/u renal recs if any.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Unclear precipitating event at this time, although
   differential includes allergic, toxic, infectious, traumatic, or
   inflammatory.  Rhabdo most inconsistent with post-Strep GN. As patient
   is anuric/oliguric, patient unlikely to benefit from continued IVFs.
   - Serial CKs and electrolytes
   - Continue work-up as above.
   # Fever: Broad differential as above including infectious,
   inflammatory, toxin-mediated. Patient continues to be hemodynamically
   stable.
   - Culture if spikes.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   # Anemia: Hematocrit trending down to 26.4 from 38 on admission.
   Hemolysis unlikely given normal haptoglobin. Concern over GIB given
   coffee ground emesis and continued clots on OGT suctioning.
   Differential includes [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, gastritis, PUD, or other
   UGIB.
   - Serial hct and repeat DIC labs, transfuse for hct <21 or signs or
   symptoms of end organ damage.
   - Appreciate GI and thoracic recs
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - 2 large bore PIV
   - Active T+S.
   # Rash: Rapidly improved over the course of yesterday. Appreciate
   dermatology consult, who feel that transient nature of rash most
   consistent with toxin-mediated mechanism.  Mucositis improved today.
   - Follow-up derm recs if any, although unlikely to biopsy at this time.
   # Pneumomediastinum: Per Thoracics, less likely esophageal source given
   location and more likely to be ruptured bleb.
    - Appreciate thoracics input
   - Amp/sulbactam as above.
   # Acid base balance: Patient with anion gap acidosis (AG 18) likely
   from uremia with relatively appropriate respiratory compensation.
   Given delta gap, likely with element of metabolic alkalosis as well
   from vomiting.
   - Trend chemistries
   - HD per renal
   # Transaminitis: Likely seconadry to rhabdomyolysis rather than liver
   disease given preserved synthetic function.
   - Serial LFTs with CKs and lytes
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Follow-up hep serologies, AMA, [**Last Name (un) 4195**].
   # Hypocalcemia: Likely related to elevated phosphate in setting of ARF
   versus toxic shock mediated.
   - Trend Ca and replete as necessary with calcium gluconate and via HD
   bath.
   # Hyperkalemia: Likely due to combination of rhabdomyolysis and ARF.
   Serum potassium remains elevated today despite HD session yesterday.
   ECG today without changes.
   - Kayexalate titrated to BM
   - Serial chemistries as above
   - HD per renal
   FEN: NPO, replete as necessary.
   PPx: SCDs. PPI [**Hospital1 7**].
   ACCESS: PIV x4. Radial arterial line.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 17-year-old male who was previously healthy and presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a diffuse rash.
- He was found to have rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure (ARF), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum.
- The patient is currently intubated for respiratory failure due to worsening dyspnea and hypoxia.
- He has ARF, likely secondary to glomerulonephritis with an additional component of pigment nephropathy from rhabdomyolysis.
- Possible etiologies include post-strep glomerulonephritis, toxic shock syndrome, pesticide exposure, ANCA-associated vasculitis, IgA/hypersensitivity pneumonitis, viral infection with myositis, tick-borne infection, or bacterial infection.
- The patient has a history of fever, anemia, rash, pneumomediastinum, acid-base imbalance, transaminitis, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening dyspnea and hypoxia indicate a risk of respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which is helping to improve his condition.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to ARF. This could progress to chronic"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Doctor Last Name 7575**] is a 17 year old Guatemalan male previously
   healthy who presents with 1 week of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
   diarrhea, diffuse rash found to have rhabdomyolysis, ARF, diffuse
   pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum.
   # Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for worsening dyspnea and
   hypoxia with initial increase in oxygen requirement concerning for
   [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS with P/F <300 and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.  Etiology
   still unclear at this time, although differential is still broad and
   includes toxin mediated exposure, Strep or Staph toxic shock, pesticide
   mediated exposure, +/- ANCA associated vasculitis, viral infection with
   myositis although rapid viral screen negative, tick-borne infection
   including Erlichia and RMSF, or bacterial infection including
   meningococcemia.  Bronch inconsistent with DAH.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation at ARDS settings
   - Continue solumedrol 125 mg Q24 (day [**1-11**])
   - Consider additional IVIG dosing.
   - Continue vanco, clindamycin, ampcillin, acylovir, and doxycycline.
   Will likely be able to pull off antibiotics as culture and serology
   data returns.
   - Follow-up culture data, serologies, ASLO, GAS throat swab.
   - Follow-up inflammatory work-up including ANCA and complement levels.
   - Appreciate derm, ID, thoracic, toxicology recs, liver, and renal recs
   - Consent for HIV test
   # ARF: Likely element of GN given urine sediment consistent with
   nephritic process with rhabdomyolysis contributing. Patient had HD line
   placed yesterday with 2 hours of HD performed with 500 cc
   ultrafiltrated. Electrolytes remain abnormal today including
   hyperkalemia without ECG changes and elevated BUN/Cr. Remains oliguric.
   - Kayexylate
   - Follow-up with renal regarding HD today.
   - Check lytes TID
   - Monitor UOP
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Unclear precipitating event at this time, although
   differential includes allergic, toxic, infectious, traumatic, or
   inflammatory.
   - Serial CKs and electrolytes
   - Continue work-up as above.
   # Fever: Broad differential as above including infectious,
   inflammatory, toxin-mediated. Patient continues to be hemodynamically
   stable.
   - Culture if spikes.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   # Anemia: Hematocrit trending down to 26.4 from 38 on admission.
   Hemolysis unlikely given normal haptoglobin. Patient likely was
   hemoconcentrated on admission, although concern over GIB given coffee
   ground emesis and continued clots on OGT suctioning. Differential
   includes [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, gastritis, PUD, or other UGIB.  OGT
   suctioning clots.
   - Serial hct and repeat DIC labs, transfuse for hct <21 or signs or
   symptoms of end organ damage.
   - Appreciate GI and thoraric recs
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - 2 large bore PIV
   - Active T+S.
   # Rash: Rapidly improved over the course of yesterday. Appreciate
   dermatology consult, who feel that transient nature of rash most
   consistent with toxin-mediated mechanism.  Mucositis appears to be
   clinically worsens with questionable development of vesicles on tongue.
   - antimicrobials as above.
   - follow-up derm recs if any, although unlikely to biopsy at this time.
   # Pneumomediastinum: source either from lungs, trachea, or esophagus.
   Per Thoracics, less likely esophageal source given location. Feels more
   likely bleb rupture from wretching.
   - appreciate thoracics input
   - repeat CXR for difficulty ventilating
   - antibiotic therapy as above
   # Acid base balance: Patient with anion gap acidosis (AG 18) likely
   from uremia with relatively appropriate respiratory compensation.
   Given delta gap, likely with element of metabolic alkalosis as well
   from vomiting.
   - Trend lytes
   - HD per renal
   # Transaminitis: Likely seconadry to rhabdomyolysis rather than liver
   disease given preserved synthetic function.
   - Serial LFTs with CKs and lytes
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Follow-up hep serologies, AMA, [**Last Name (un) 4195**].
   # Hypocalcemia: Likely related to elevated phosphate in setting of ARF
   versus toxic shock mediated.
   - Trend Ca and replete as necessary
   # Hyperkalemia: Likely due to combination of rhabdomyolysis and ARF.
   Serum potassium remains eleveated today despite HD session yesterday.
   ECG today without changes.
   - Kayexalate titrated to BM
   - Serial chemistries as above
   - HD per renal
   FEN: NPO, replete as necessary.
   PPx: Heparin SQ. PPI [**Hospital1 7**].
   ACCESS: 20G PIV x2, 18G PIV x 1. A-line.
   - monitor BP closely and place central line if requires pressors

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Doctor Last Name 7575**] is a 17 year old Guatemalan male previously
   healthy who presents with 1 week of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
   diarrhea, and a  diffuse rash found to have rhabdomyolysis, ARF,
   bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum.
   # Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated for worsening dyspnea and
   hypoxia with initial increase in oxygen requirement concerning for
   [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS with P/F <300 and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.  CXR much
   improved yesterday, and patient was able to be extubated [**4-24**].
   Hypoxemic respiratory failure thought to be secondary to volume
   overload from ARF now improving after HD.  Desaturation am of [**4-25**]
   perhaps related to mucus/sputum/plugging.
   - continues to require 70% FiO2 face tent.  Wean as tolerated.
   Encourage IS and coughing.
   # ARF: Consistent with GN with additional component of pigment
   nephropathy from rhabdomyolysis.  Most likely etiology at this time is
   post-strep GN, although other etiologies including Strep or Staph toxic
   shock, pesticide mediated exposure, +/- ANCA associated vasculitis or
   IgA/HSP vasculitis, viral infection with myositis although rapid viral
   screen negative, tick-borne infection including Erlichia and RMSF, or
   bacterial infection including meningococcemia cannot be excluded
   completely at this time. Bronch inconsistent with DAH. LP with WBC 2
   and otherwise unconcerning.
   - Follow up renal biopsy [**4-25**]
   - Continue solumedrol 125 mg Q24 (day [**2-8**]), consider continuing based
   on renal recs.
   - Continue unasyn for now
   - Follow-up culture data, serologies, ASLO, GAS throat swab.
   - Follow-up inflammatory work-up including ANCA and complement levels.
   - Appreciate derm, ID, thoracic, toxicology recs, liver, and renal recs
   - consider testing for HIV, though low on differential.
   - Trend lytes. Kayexalate prn for hyperkalemia
   - F/u renal recs if any- may be a candidate for UF if does not require
   HD
   - Monitor UOP.
   - Consider d/c femoral HD line if does not need dialysis today.  Would
   prefer placement of permanent catheter following 1 day line holiday.
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Unclear precipitating event at this time, although
   differential includes allergic, toxic, infectious, traumatic, or
   inflammatory.  Rhabdo most inconsistent with post-Strep GN. As patient
   is anuric/oliguric, patient unlikely to benefit from continued IVFs.
   - Serial CKs and electrolytes
   - Continue work-up as above.
   # Fever: Broad differential as above including infectious,
   inflammatory, toxin-mediated. Patient continues to be hemodynamically
   stable.  Afebrile for > 24 hours.
   - Culture if spikes.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   # Anemia: Hematocrit trending down to 24.2 from 38 on admission.
   Hemolysis unlikely given normal haptoglobin. Concern over GIB given
   coffee ground emesis and continued clots on OGT suctioning.
   Differential includes [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, gastritis, PUD, or other
   UGIB.
   - Serial hct and repeat DIC labs, transfuse for hct <21 or signs or
   symptoms of end organ damage.
   - Appreciate GI and thoracic recs
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - 2 large bore PIV
   - Active T+S.
   # Rash: Rapidly improved over the course of yesterday. Appreciate
   dermatology consult, who feel that transient nature of rash most
   consistent with toxin-mediated mechanism.  Mucositis improved today.
   - Follow-up derm recs if any, although unlikely to biopsy at this time.
   # Pneumomediastinum: Per Thoracics, less likely esophageal source given
   location and more likely to be ruptured bleb.
    - Appreciate thoracics input
   - Amp/sulbactam as above
   - Thin barium swallow today to evaluate for leak
   # Acid base balance: Patient with anion gap acidosis (AG 18) likely
   from uremia with relatively appropriate respiratory compensation.
   Given delta gap, likely with element of metabolic alkalosis as well
   from vomiting.
   - Trend chemistries
   - HD per renal
   # Transaminitis: Likely seconadry to rhabdomyolysis rather than liver
   disease given preserved synthetic function.
   - Serial LFTs with CKs and lytes
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Follow-up hep serologies, AMA, [**Last Name (un) 4195**].
   # Hypocalcemia: Likely related to elevated phosphate in setting of ARF
   versus toxic shock mediated.
   - Trend Ca and replete as necessary with calcium gluconate and via HD
   bath.
   # Hyperkalemia: Likely due to combination of rhabdomyolysis and ARF.
   Serum potassium at 4.2today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The note mentions that the patient has been extubated but required a face tent and 100% oxygen due to low oxygen saturation levels. The patient also has a history of invasive ventilation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, and electrolyte/fluid disorder.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116-177 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of PSV/SBT, FiO2 of 100%, and RSBI of 27.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose, high levels of liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated lactate, low albumin, and abnormal electrolyte levels including potassium, sodium, chloride, and calcium.

The patient has several lines including an arterial line, central venous catheter, and dialysis catheter. The patient is also on multiple medications such as heparin, midazolam, and pantoprazole.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory, renal, electrolyte, and infectious issues."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Doctor Last Name 7575**] is a 17 year old Guatemalan male previously
   healthy who presents with 1 week of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
   diarrhea, diffuse rash found to have rhabdomyolysis, ARF, bilateral
   pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum.
   # Respiratory failure: Patient intubated for worsening dyspnea and
   hypoxia with initial increase in oxygen requirement concerning for
   [**Doctor Last Name 11**]/ARDS with P/F <300 and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.  CXR much
   improved this AM with patient tolerating PSV.  Hypoxemic respiratory
   failure likely secondary to volume overload from ARF now improving
   after HD.
   - SBT today, plan to extubate after HD
   # ARF: Consistent with GN with additional component of pigment
   nephropathy from rhabdomyolysis.  Most likely etiology at this time is
   post-strep GN, although other etiologies including Strep or Staph toxic
   shock, pesticide mediated exposure, +/- ANCA associated vasculitis or
   IgA/HSP vasculitis, viral infection with myositis although rapid viral
   screen negative, tick-borne infection including Erlichia and RMSF, or
   bacterial infection including meningococcemia cannot be excluded
   completely at this time. Bronch inconsistent with DAH. LP with WBC 2
   and otherwise unconcerning.
   - Continue solumedrol 125 mg Q24 (day [**1-11**])
   - Hold vanco, doxycycline, acyclovir, pip/tazo, and clindamycin.
   Convert amp to amp/sulbactam.
   - Follow-up culture data, serologies, ASLO, GAS throat swab.
   - Hold IVIG
   - Follow-up inflammatory work-up including ANCA and complement levels.
   - Appreciate derm, ID, thoracic, toxicology recs, liver, and renal recs
   - Consent for HIV test when extubated.
   - Trend lytes TID, plan for HD today. Kayexalate prn for hyperkalemia
   - F/u renal recs if any.
   - Monitor UOP.
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Unclear precipitating event at this time, although
   differential includes allergic, toxic, infectious, traumatic, or
   inflammatory.  Rhabdo most inconsistent with post-Strep GN. As patient
   is anuric/oliguric, patient unlikely to benefit from continued IVFs.
   - Serial CKs and electrolytes
   - Continue work-up as above.
   # Fever: Broad differential as above including infectious,
   inflammatory, toxin-mediated. Patient continues to be hemodynamically
   stable.
   - Culture if spikes.
   - Antimicrobials as above.
   # Anemia: Hematocrit trending down to 26.4 from 38 on admission.
   Hemolysis unlikely given normal haptoglobin. Concern over GIB given
   coffee ground emesis and continued clots on OGT suctioning.
   Differential includes [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear, gastritis, PUD, or other
   UGIB.
   - Serial hct and repeat DIC labs, transfuse for hct <21 or signs or
   symptoms of end organ damage.
   - Appreciate GI and thoracic recs
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - 2 large bore PIV
   - Active T+S.
   # Rash: Rapidly improved over the course of yesterday. Appreciate
   dermatology consult, who feel that transient nature of rash most
   consistent with toxin-mediated mechanism.  Mucositis improved today.
   - Follow-up derm recs if any, although unlikely to biopsy at this time.
   # Pneumomediastinum: Per Thoracics, less likely esophageal source given
   location and more likely to be ruptured bleb.
    - Appreciate thoracics input
   - Amp/sulbactam as above.
   # Acid base balance: Patient with anion gap acidosis (AG 18) likely
   from uremia with relatively appropriate respiratory compensation.
   Given delta gap, likely with element of metabolic alkalosis as well
   from vomiting.
   - Trend chemistries
   - HD per renal
   # Transaminitis: Likely seconadry to rhabdomyolysis rather than liver
   disease given preserved synthetic function.
   - Serial LFTs with CKs and lytes
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Follow-up hep serologies, AMA, [**Last Name (un) 4195**].
   # Hypocalcemia: Likely related to elevated phosphate in setting of ARF
   versus toxic shock mediated.
   - Trend Ca and replete as necessary with calcium gluconate and via HD
   bath.
   # Hyperkalemia: Likely due to combination of rhabdomyolysis and ARF.
   Serum potassium remains elevated today despite HD session yesterday.
   ECG today without changes.
   - Kayexalate titrated to BM
   - Serial chemistries as above
   - HD per renal
   FEN: NPO, replete as necessary.
   PPx: SCDs. PPI [**Hospital1 7**].
   ACCESS: PIV x4. Radial arterial line.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 17-year-old male who presented with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a diffuse rash. He was found to have rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure (ARF), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the note are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to worsening dyspnea and hypoxia. There is a concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a low PaO2/FiO2 ratio. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload from ARF, which is now improving after hemodialysis (HD).

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has ARF, consistent with glomerulonephritis (GN) with an additional component of pigment nephropathy from rhabdomyolysis. Post-streptococcal GN is the most likely etiology at this time. Other potential etiologies include toxic shock syndrome, pesticide exposure, ANCA-associated vasculitis, IgA/hypersensitivity pneumonitis, viral infection with myositis, tick-borne infections like Erlichia and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, or bacterial infection including meningococcemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Doctor Last Name 7575**] is a 17 year old Guatemalan male previously
   healthy who presents with 1 week of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
   diarrhea, and a  diffuse rash found to have rhabdomyolysis, ARF,
   bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum.
   # RP bleed/anemia: In setting of renal biopsy and uremic platelets.
   - Trend hct Q6H, transfuse for hct<21
   - Follow-up with IR and transplant surgery
   - Patient may require IR procedure for embolization
   - Consider DDAVP and amicar.
   - Hold AV nodal blockade
   # ARF: Initial renal biopsy results most consistent with pigment
   nephropathy with complete results pending.  ASO negative, making
   post-Strep GN unlikely. Would consider IgA process or other vasculitis
   process with labs pending.  C3 low, normal C4. Patient completed pulse
   dose steroids on [**4-25**].
   - Continue steroids for now pending renal biopsy results
   - Follow-up with renal regarding biopsy results
   - Follow-up culture data, serologies, inflammatory work-up including
   ANCA.
   - If renal biopsy most consistent with pigment nephropathy, consider
   rheum consult for possible muscle biopsy.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 22.1 with left shift.  Likely stress reaction
   to RP bleed.  Patient has been afebrile and was pan-cultured yesterday.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Continue amp/sulbactam for now for possible peri-procedure coverage.
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Unclear precipitating event at this time. Trending
   down with steroids and initial fluid, though that has been stopped as
   patient is anuric. As above, if ARF is ultimately secondary to pigment
   nephropathy, would need to further work-up rhabdomyolysis including
   rheum consult and possible muscle biopsy.
   - Serial CKs and electrolytes
   # Fever: Patient has been afebrile since [**4-23**].  Broad differential as
   has been noted including infectious, inflammatory, toxin-mediated.
   Continues to be hemodynamically stable.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Continue prophylactic amp/sulbactam for now.
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of coffee-ground emesis, now extubated.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   # GIB: Multifactorial from GI losses, bleeding diathesis from uremic
   platelets with most recent complication being RP bleed from renal
   biopsy.
   - Continue to trend and transfuse for Hct < 21 and or HD instability
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - 2 large bore PIV
   - Active T+S.
   # Rash: Rapidly improved over the course of hospitalization. Appreciate
   dermatology consult, who feel that transient nature of rash most
   consistent with toxin-mediated mechanism.  Mucositis improved today.
   - Follow-up derm recs if any, although unlikely to biopsy at this time.
   # Pneumomediastinum: Per Thoracics, less likely esophageal source given
   location and more likely to be ruptured bleb. Esophagram without
   extravasation.
   - Appreciate thoracics input
   # Acid base balance: Patient with anion gap acidosis  likely from
   uremia with relatively appropriate respiratory compensation.  Given
   delta gap, likely with element of metabolic alkalosis as well from
   vomiting.
   - Trend chemistries
   - HD per renal
   # Transaminitis: Likely seconadry to rhabdomyolysis rather than liver
   disease given preserved synthetic function. AMA, [**Last Name (un) 4195**], [**Doctor First Name **] negative.
   - Serial LFTs with CKs and lytes
   - Appreciate liver input
   # Hypocalcemia: Likely related to elevated phosphate in setting of ARF
   versus toxic shock mediated.
   - Trend Ca and replete as necessary with calcium gluconate and via HD
   bath.
   # Hyperkalemia: Likely due to combination of rhabdomyolysis and ARF.
   Serum potassium at 4.2today.
   - Kayexalate titrated to BM
   - Serial chemistries as above

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 17-year-old male with a history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a diffuse rash. He was found to have rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure (ARF), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum. The patient underwent a renal biopsy, which showed signs of pigment nephropathy. He has been treated with pulse dose steroids and is currently being monitored for renal biopsy results.

The patient also presented with leukocytosis, likely due to stress reaction from a recent right-sided pleural bleed. He has been pan-cultured and is currently being followed for culture data. The patient's rhabdomyolysis is unclear in etiology and may require further investigation, including a rheumatology consult and possible muscle biopsy.

The patient's fever has resolved since April 23rd, and he continues to be hemodynamically stable. He has been weaned off the ventilator but remains on supplemental oxygen. The patient has experienced gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from multiple factors, including gastrointestinal losses and uremic platelets. He is being closely monitored for Hct levels and is receiving IV pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's rash has improved rapidly during hospitalization and is believed to be toxin-mediated. He has also been diagnosed with pneumomediastinum, which is thought to be caused by a ruptured bleb rather than an esophageal source. The"

   rheum consult for possible muscle biopsy.
   - Plan for IR temp HD line tomorrow.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 22.1 with left shift.  Likely stress reaction
   to RP bleed.  Patient has been afebrile and was pan-cultured yesterday.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Continue amp/sulbactam for now for possible peri-procedure coverage.
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Unclear precipitating event at this time. Trending
   down with steroids and initial fluid, though that has been stopped as
   patient is anuric. As above, if ARF is ultimately secondary to pigment
   nephropathy, would need to further work-up rhabdomyolysis including
   rheum consult and possible muscle biopsy.

   - Continue prophylactic amp/sulbactam for now.
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of coffee-ground emesis, now extubated.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated
   # GIB: Multifactorial from GI losses, bleeding diathesis from uremic
   platelets with most recent complication being RP bleed from renal
   biopsy.
   - Continue to trend and transfuse for Hct < 21 and or HD instability
   - 2 large bore PIV
   - Active T+S.
   # Rash: Rapidly improved over the course of hospitalization. Appreciate
   dermatology consult, who feel that transient nature of rash most
   consistent with toxin-mediated mechanism.  Mucositis improved today.
   - Follow-up derm recs if any, although unlikely to biopsy at this time.
   # Pneumomediastinum: Per Thoracics, less likely esophageal source given
   location and more likely to be ruptured bleb. Esophagram without
   extravasation.
   - Appreciate thoracics input
   # Acid base balance: Patient with anion gap acidosis  likely from
   uremia with relatively appropriate respiratory compensation.  Given
   delta gap, likely with element of metabolic alkalosis as well from
   vomiting.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 17-year-old male who presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a diffuse rash. He was found to have rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure (ARF), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum. The patient underwent a renal biopsy and developed a retroperitoneal bleed, requiring urgent urologic consultation. Imaging also revealed new fluid around the spleen and liver, which may be due to aggressive resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. RP bleed/anemia: The patient developed a retroperitoneal bleed following renal biopsy, leading to anemia. Close monitoring of hematocrit (hct) levels is recommended, with transfusion for hct < 21. An interventional radiology (IR) procedure may be necessary for embolization. Vitamin K administration and consideration of desmopressin (DDAVP) and aminocaproic acid (amicar) are advised.

2. ARF: The patient has acute renal failure, and initial renal biopsy results suggest pigment nephropathy. Complete results are pending, and it is important to follow up with renal consultation. Steroids should be held pending renal biopsy results. Cultures, serologies, and inflammatory work-up should also be continued.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated with a left shift, likely due to stress"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Doctor Last Name 7575**] is a 17 year old Guatemalan male previously
   healthy who presents with 1 week of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
   diarrhea, and a  diffuse rash found to have rhabdomyolysis, ARF,
   bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum.
   # RP bleed/anemia: In setting of renal biopsy and uremic platelets.
   Hct stable since transfusion. Per surgery, will hold off on angio and
   embolization for now. Patient received IV vitamin K yesterday.
   - Trend hct and coags Q12H, transfuse for hct<21
   - Follow-up with IR and transplant surgery
   # ARF: Initial renal biopsy results most consistent with pigment
   nephropathy with complete results pending.  ASO negative, making
   post-Strep GN unlikely. Would consider IgA process or other vasculitis
   process with immunostaining pending.  C3 low, normal C4, ANCA negative.
   Patient completed pulse dose steroids on [**4-25**]. Adenovirus negative, HSV
   1 IgG positive/[**Doctor Last Name 7665**] negative, EBV equivocal.
   - HD per renal
   - Follow-up with renal regarding biopsy results
   - Follow-up culture data, serologies, inflammatory work-up.
   - If renal biopsy most consistent with pigment nephropathy, consider
   rheum consult for possible muscle biopsy.
   - Plan for IR temp HD line today.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 23 with left shift.  Likely stress reaction
   to RP bleed.  Patient has been afebrile and was pan-cultured yesterday.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Continue amp/sulbactam through this morning, then discontinue
   - IF patient spikes or becomes hemodynamically unstable, would consider
   non-con CT chest to eval for organized effusions.
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Unclear precipitating event at this time. CKs and
   LFTs trending down.  Trending down with steroids and initial fluid,
   though that has been stopped as patient is anuric. As above, if ARF is
   ultimately secondary to pigment nephropathy, would need to further
   work-up rhabdomyolysis including rheum consult and possible muscle
   biopsy.
   - Serial CKs, LFTs, and electrolytes
   - Check TSH
   # Fever: Patient has been afebrile since [**4-23**].  Broad differential as
   has been noted including infectious, inflammatory, toxin-mediated.
   Continues to be hemodynamically stable.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Hold amp/sulbactam as above.
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of coffee-ground emesis, now extubated.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated, currently at 2L nc.
   # GIB: Multifactorial from GI losses, bleeding diathesis from uremic
   platelets with most recent complication being RP bleed from renal
   biopsy.
   - Continue to trend and transfuse for Hct < 21 and or HD instability
   - 2 large bore PIV
   - Active T+S.
   # Rash: Rapidly improved over the course of hospitalization. Appreciate
   dermatology consult, who feel that transient nature of rash most
   consistent with toxin-mediated mechanism.  Mucositis improved today.
   - Follow-up derm recs if any, although unlikely to biopsy at this time.
   # Pneumomediastinum: Per Thoracics, less likely esophageal source given
   location and more likely to be ruptured bleb. Esophagram without
   extravasation.
   - Follow-up thoracics recs if any
   # Acid base balance: Patient with anion gap acidosis likely from uremia
   with relatively appropriate respiratory compensation.
   - Trend chemistries
   - HD per renal
   # Transaminitis: Likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis rather than liver
   disease given preserved synthetic function. AMA, [**Last Name (un) 4195**], [**Doctor First Name **] negative.

The patient is a 17-year-old male who presented with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a diffuse rash. He was found to have rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure (ARF), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum. The patient received a blood transfusion and IV vitamin K. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. RP bleed/anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is stable since the transfusion. Surgery has decided to hold off on angioembolization for now.
2. ARF: The initial renal biopsy results suggest pigment nephropathy, but complete results are pending. Other possibilities, such as IgA process or other vasculitis process, are also being considered.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, likely due to stress reaction from the RP bleed. Cultures were obtained, and antibiotics were started.
4. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's creatine kinase levels are trending down, indicating improvement. Steroids and initial fluid therapy have been stopped due to anuria.
5. Fever: The patient has been afebrile since April 23rd. Broad differential diagnoses, including infectious, inflammatory, and toxin-mediated causes, should be considered.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection and is now extubated. Oxygen therapy should be continued as tolerated.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient experienced bleeding from GI losses, uremic platelets, and a recent complication of RP bleed from renal biopsy. Close monitoring of hemoglobin concentration and coagulation parameters is recommended.
8. Rash: The patient's rash has rapidly improved during hospitalization. A dermatology consult suggests a toxin-mediated mechanism.
9. Pneumomediastinum: The patient likely has a ruptured bleb as the source of pneumomediastinum, rather than an esophageal source.
10. Acid-base balance: The patient has anion gap acidosis due to uremia with appropriate respiratory compensation.
11. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes are likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis rather than liver disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient has ARF, which may progress to chronic renal failure if not treated appropriately.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates increase the risk of further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GIB and low platelet count due to uremia put him at risk for recurrent bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to ARF and recent use of immunosuppressive medications increase the risk of infection.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac status should"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Doctor Last Name 7575**] is a 17 year old Guatemalan male previously
   healthy who presents with 1 week of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
   diarrhea, and a  diffuse rash found to have rhabdomyolysis, ARF,
   bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum.
   # RP bleed/anemia: In setting of renal biopsy and uremic platelets.
   Hct stable since transfusion. Per surgery, will hold off on angio and
   embolization for now. Patient received IV vitamin K yesterday.
   - Trend hct and coags Q12H, transfuse for hct<21
   - Follow-up with IR and transplant surgery
   # ARF: Initial renal biopsy results most consistent with pigment
   nephropathy with complete results pending.  ASO negative, making
   post-Strep GN unlikely. Would consider IgA process or other vasculitis
   process with immunostaining pending.  C3 low, normal C4, ANCA negative.
   Patient completed pulse dose steroids on [**4-25**]. Adenovirus negative, HSV
   1 IgG positive/[**Doctor Last Name 7665**] negative, EBV equivocal.
   - HD per renal
   - Hold steroids for now pending renal biopsy results
   - Follow-up with renal regarding biopsy results
   - Follow-up culture data, serologies, inflammatory work-up.
   - If renal biopsy most consistent with pigment nephropathy, consider
   rheum consult for possible muscle biopsy.
   - Plan for IR temp HD line today.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC up to 23 with left shift.  Likely stress reaction
   to RP bleed.  Patient has been afebrile and was pan-cultured yesterday.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Continue amp/sulbactam for now for possible peri-procedure coverage.
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Unclear precipitating event at this time. CKs and
   LFTs trending down.  Trending down with steroids and initial fluid,
   though that has been stopped as patient is anuric. As above, if ARF is
   ultimately secondary to pigment nephropathy, would need to further
   work-up rhabdomyolysis including rheum consult and possible muscle
   biopsy.
   - Serial CKs, LFTs, and electrolytes
   - Check TSH
   # Fever: Patient has been afebrile since [**4-23**].  Broad differential as
   has been noted including infectious, inflammatory, toxin-mediated.
   Continues to be hemodynamically stable.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Continue prophylactic amp/sulbactam for now.
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of coffee-ground emesis, now extubated.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated, currently at 2L nc.
   # GIB: Multifactorial from GI losses, bleeding diathesis from uremic
   platelets with most recent complication being RP bleed from renal
   biopsy.
   - Continue to trend and transfuse for Hct < 21 and or HD instability
   - 2 large bore PIV
   - Active T+S.
   # Rash: Rapidly improved over the course of hospitalization. Appreciate
   dermatology consult, who feel that transient nature of rash most
   consistent with toxin-mediated mechanism.  Mucositis improved today.
   - Follow-up derm recs if any, although unlikely to biopsy at this time.
   # Pneumomediastinum: Per Thoracics, less likely esophageal source given
   location and more likely to be ruptured bleb. Esophagram without
   extravasation.
   - Appreciate thoracics input
   # Acid base balance: Patient with anion gap acidosis  likely from
   uremia with relatively appropriate respiratory compensation.
   - Trend chemistries
   - HD per renal
   # Transaminitis: Likely seconadry to rhabdomyolysis rather than liver
   disease given preserved synthetic function. AMA, [**Last Name (un) 4195**], [**Doctor First Name **] negative.
   - Trend LFTs with CKs and chemistries
   - Appreciate liver input
   # Hypocalcemia: Likely related to elevated phosphate in setting of ARF
   versus toxic shock mediated.
   - Trend Ca and replete as necessary with calcium gluconate and via HD
   bath.
   # Hyperkalemia: Likely due to combination of rhabdomyolysis and ARF.
   Serum potassium at 4.2today.
   - Kayexalate titrated to BM
   - Serial chemistries as above
   - HD per renal
   FEN: Regular, replete as necessary, ISS
   PPx: SCDs.
   ACCESS: PIV x4. Right femoral HD line.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 17-year-old male with a history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a diffuse rash. He was found to have rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure (ARF), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) yesterday morning and his hemoglobin concentration decreased from 29 to 27. The patient's femoral line was clotted and subsequently discontinued. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 134/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is indicated by the elevated creatinine and urea levels in the lab results. This could lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis).

2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) suggest rhabdomyolysis. This condition can lead to muscle damage and release of myoglobin into the bloodstream, which can cause kidney injury and acute kidney injury.

3. Pulmonary Complications: The patient has bilateral"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of retroperitoneal bleed, procedure-related pain control, electrolyte and fluid disorder, gastrointestinal bleed, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, impaired skin integrity, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 136/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring shows stable central venous pressure and mean arterial pressure. Fluid balance indicates an input of 600 mL, including 350 mL via the oral route, 250 mL via intravenous fluids, and an output of 1000 mL, with a negative balance of 400 mL. Respiratory support is provided through supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. ABG results show a pH of 7.25.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and elevated inflammatory markers such as D-dimer and lactic acid, indicating a possible infection.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and ABG results show a pH of 7.25, suggesting respiratory acidosis. The presence of ARDS can lead to difficulty in"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Doctor Last Name 7575**] is a 17 year old Guatemalan male previously
   healthy who presents with 1 week of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
   diarrhea, and a  diffuse rash found to have rhabdomyolysis, ARF,
   bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum.
   # RP bleed/anemia: In setting of renal biopsy and uremic platelets.
   Hct stable since transfusion. Per surgery, will hold off on angio and
   embolization for now.
   - Trend hct and coags Q12H, transfuse for hct<21
   - Follow-up with IR and transplant surgery
   # ARF: Initial renal biopsy results most consistent with pigment
   nephropathy with complete results pending.  ASO negative, making
   post-Strep GN unlikely. Would consider IgA process or other vasculitis
   process with immunostaining pending.  C3 low, normal C4, ANCA negative.
   Patient completed pulse dose steroids on [**4-25**]. Adenovirus negative, HSV
   1 IgG positive/[**Doctor Last Name 7665**] negative, EBV equivocal.  IR temp HD line placed
   yesterday.
   - HD per renal
   - Follow-up with renal regarding biopsy results
   - Follow-up culture data, serologies, inflammatory work-up.
   - If renal biopsy most consistent with pigment nephropathy, patient
   will likely require intrinsic muscle disorder work-up including muscle
   biopsy when stable.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC stable at 23 with left shift.  Likely stress
   reaction to RP bleed.  Patient has been afebrile and was pan-cultured.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Continue amp/sulbactam through this morning, then discontinue
   - IF patient spikes or becomes hemodynamically unstable, would consider
   non-con CT chest to eval for organized effusions.
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Unclear precipitating event at this time. CKs and
   LFTs trending down.  As above, if ARF is ultimately secondary to
   pigment nephropathy, would need to further work-up rhabdomyolysis. TSH
   normal.
   - Serial CKs, LFTs, and electrolytes
   # Fever: Patient has been afebrile since [**4-23**].  Broad differential as
   has been noted including infectious, inflammatory, toxin-mediated.
   Continues to be hemodynamically stable.
   - Follow-up culture data
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of coffee-ground emesis, now extubated.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated, currently at 2L nc.
   # GIB: Multifactorial from GI losses, bleeding diathesis from uremic
   platelets with most recent complication being RP bleed from renal
   biopsy.
   - Continue to trend and transfuse for Hct < 21 and or HD instability
   - 2 large bore PIV
   - Active T+S.
   # Rash: Rapidly improved over the course of hospitalization. Appreciate
   dermatology consult, who feel that transient nature of rash most
   consistent with toxin-mediated mechanism.  Mucositis improved today.
   - Follow-up derm recs if any, although unlikely to biopsy at this time.
   # Pneumomediastinum: Per Thoracics, less likely esophageal source given
   location and more likely to be ruptured bleb. Esophagram without
   extravasation.
   - Follow-up thoracics recs if any
   # Acid base balance: Patient with anion gap acidosis likely from uremia
   with relatively appropriate respiratory compensation.
   - Trend chemistries
   - HD per renal
   # Transaminitis: Likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis rather than liver
   disease given preserved synthetic function. AMA, [**Last Name (un) 4195**], [**Doctor First Name **] negative.
   - Trend LFTs with CKs and chemistries

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 17-year-old male with a history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a diffuse rash. He presented with rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure (ARF), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum. The patient underwent a renal biopsy and is being treated with hemodialysis. His leukocyte count is elevated, but he is not febrile. He has improved from a respiratory failure episode and has been extubated. The patient has experienced gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to uremic platelets, a rash that has improved, and pneumomediastinum. His acid-base balance is affected by uremia, and he has transaminitis likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis. The patient's condition is stable, and he will continue to be monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to ARF, increasing the risk of infections. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters, such as white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, is necessary to detect any signs of infection.

2. Bleeding: The patient's GIB and low platelet count due to uremia increase the risk of bleeding. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic stability, and regular assessment of clotting parameters like prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplast"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 17-year-old male who presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a diffuse rash. He was found to have rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure (ARF), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum. The patient underwent a renal biopsy, which showed pigment nephropathy with complete results pending. His blood work revealed leukocytosis, elevated creatine kinase (CK), liver function tests (LFTs), and other abnormalities. The patient was intubated for airway protection and later extubated. He experienced gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and a ruptured bleb, which was treated conservatively. The patient's rash improved over time and was likely due to a toxin-mediated mechanism. His transaminitis is secondary to rhabdomyolysis. The patient is currently stable and receiving hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ARF: The patient initially presented with ARF, which can be potentially life-threatening. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.

2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has evidence of rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to kidney damage and other complications. Monitoring CK levels, LFTs, and electrolytes is crucial.

3. GIB: The patient had multifactorial GIB, including GI losses and bleeding diathesis from uremic plate"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Doctor Last Name 7575**] is a 17 year old Guatemalan male previously
   healthy who presents with 1 week of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
   diarrhea, and a  diffuse rash found to have rhabdomyolysis, ARF,
   bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum.
   # RP bleed/anemia: In setting of renal biopsy and uremic platelets.
   Hct stable since transfusion. Per surgery, will hold off on angio and
   embolization for now.
   - Trend hct and coags Q12H, transfuse for hct<21
   - Follow-up with IR and transplant surgery
   # ARF: Initial renal biopsy results most consistent with pigment
   nephropathy with complete results pending.  ASO negative, making
   post-Strep GN unlikely. Would consider IgA process or other vasculitis
   process with immunostaining pending.  C3 low, normal C4, ANCA negative.
   Patient completed pulse dose steroids on [**4-25**]. Adenovirus negative, HSV
   1 IgG positive/[**Doctor Last Name 7665**] negative, EBV equivocal.  IR temp HD line placed
   yesterday.
   - HD per renal
   - Follow-up with renal regarding biopsy results
   - Follow-up culture data, serologies, inflammatory work-up.
   - If renal biopsy most consistent with pigment nephropathy, patient
   will likely require intrinsic muscle disorder work-up including muscle
   biopsy when stable.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC stable at 23 with left shift.  Likely stress
   reaction to RP bleed.  Patient has been afebrile and was pan-cultured.
   - Follow-up culture data
   - Continue amp/sulbactam through this morning, then discontinue
   - IF patient spikes or becomes hemodynamically unstable, would consider
   non-con CT chest to eval for organized effusions.
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Unclear precipitating event at this time. CKs and
   LFTs trending down.  As above, if ARF is ultimately secondary to
   pigment nephropathy, would need to further work-up rhabdomyolysis. TSH
   normal.
   - Serial CKs, LFTs, and electrolytes
   # Fever: Patient has been afebrile since [**4-23**].  Broad differential as
   has been noted including infectious, inflammatory, toxin-mediated.
   Continues to be hemodynamically stable.
   - Follow-up culture data
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection in the setting
   of coffee-ground emesis, now extubated.
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerated, currently at 2L nc.
   # GIB: Multifactorial from GI losses, bleeding diathesis from uremic
   platelets with most recent complication being RP bleed from renal
   biopsy.
   - Continue to trend and transfuse for Hct < 21 and or HD instability
   - 2 large bore PIV
   - Active T+S.
   # Rash: Rapidly improved over the course of hospitalization. Appreciate
   dermatology consult, who feel that transient nature of rash most
   consistent with toxin-mediated mechanism.  Mucositis improved today.
   - Follow-up derm recs if any, although unlikely to biopsy at this time.
   # Pneumomediastinum: Per Thoracics, less likely esophageal source given
   location and more likely to be ruptured bleb. Esophagram without
   extravasation.
   - Follow-up thoracics recs if any
   # Transaminitis: Likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis rather than liver
   disease given preserved synthetic function. AMA, [**Last Name (un) 4195**], [**Doctor First Name **] negative.
   - Trend LFTs with CKs and chemistries
   - Appreciate liver input
   FEN: Regular, replete as necessary, ISS
   PPx: SCDs.
   ACCESS: PIV x4. HD line.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 17-year-old male with a history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a diffuse rash. He has been diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure (ARF), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and pneumomediastinum. The patient's condition has been stabilized, but he still faces several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute renal failure, which requires ongoing management and treatment.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: Although the patient's creatine kinase (CK) levels are trending down, there is still a risk of complications associated with muscle breakdown.
3. Pulmonary issues: The patient has bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and pneumomediastinum, indicating potential respiratory problems. Monitoring and treatment for these conditions are necessary.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has experienced bleeding from gastrointestinal losses and uremic platelets. Close monitoring of hematocrit (Hct) levels and transfusion as needed are important to prevent further bleeding.
5. Fever: Despite being afebrile since April 23rd, the patient's fever needs to be closely monitored, and follow-up culture data should be obtained to rule out any ongoing infectious processes.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count remains elevated, likely due to stress from recent events. Ongoing follow-up and monitoring"
