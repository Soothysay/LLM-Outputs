   Assessment and Plan
   40 year old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, CAD, htn, s/p PE
   with IVC filter in place now found to have large IVC thrombosis
   transferred to MICU for observation s/p TPA by IR.
   .
   # IVC Thrombosis and Post-procedure mgmt: s/p TPA by IR with question
   of anaphylaxis.  Procedure complicated by tachycardia, hypoxemia.
   Transferred to ICU for monitoring.  Hypoxemia and tachycardia likely
   [**3-9**] to multiple small PE as a consequence of the procedure.  No
   evidence for aspiration at this time.  Low suspicion for MI by history
   but would rule out with serial enzymes.  Lastly might represent CHF
   given e/o volume overload on exam and h/o diastolic dysfunction.
   - 0.5mg/hr TPA on each side for total of 1.0mg/hr
   - 250 units heparin gtt per hour for each sheeth (total 500)
   - no other heparin products to be given
   - Avoid blood draws, arterial sticks or arterial lines
   - frequent neuro checks q2 hours for stroke
   - Coags and fibrinogen q3 hours, h/h q6 hours
   - If fibrinogen < 150, decrease by [**2-6**] and recheck in 1 hour.
   - If firbinogen < 100, stop TPA and call IR, can draw from sheaths as
   long as it is flushed with saline.
   - 40mg Prednisone 16, 8 and 2 hour pre-procedure - plan for 10am today
   - 150mg zantac 1 hour pre-procedure
   - 15mg PO benadryl 1 hour pre-procedure
   .
   #Hypoxemia: PE vs. aspiration vs. CHF vs obsesity hypoventilation and
   derecruitment in setting of procedure and sedation.  Question of volume
   overload given h/o diastolic CHF and lying supine for procedure.  CXR
   concerning for possible fluid overload, less likely aspiration.  BNP
   only mildly elevated, r/o with CEs.
   - NRB and wean as tolerated.
   - c/s ABX for possible aspiration given O2 requirements (leukocytosis
   difficult to interpret given recent steroids
 will check diff)
   - autoset CPAP overnight
   .
   #Renal Failure: Baseline Cr 1.1.  Team thought pre-renal complicated by
   slight ATN.  Renal ultrasound without obstruction.
   - IVF's, mucomyst, bicarbonate pre-procedure
   - Continue hydration
   - renal ultrasound without obstruction
   .
   #Hypertension: Has h/o HTN.  Received one dose of hydralazine [**3-24**] PM
   as low suspicion for MI, and beta-blockade in setting of PE may
   precipitate hypotension.
   .
   #Tachycardia: Appears to be sinus tach by ECG.  PE vs. pain vs.
   agitation.
   -          Continue to follow
   -          Management as above
   .
   # RUQ abdominal pain: Likey due to diabetic gastroparesis and erosive
   gastritis
   - N/V/D fluctuating, pain slightly improved.
   - gastroparesis explains most symptoms, except diarrhea/fevers (has
   been afebrile)
   - will need gastric emptying study as outpt
   - treating with amitriptyline qhs for promotility. Will d/w GI re why
   not reglan or erythromycin.
   - continue promethazine and dilaudid prn
   - Gastritis - H. Pylori neg, treating with PPI daily
   .
   # UTI: Treated and resolved, follow Cr.
   .
   # Anemia: Continues to trend down and started on Fe replacement.
   Negative EGD.  Will need to trend hematocrit on TPA and heparin.
   - anemia panel c/w AOCD and [**Doctor First Name **] -> will start PO iron repletion.
   - RDW elevated - macrocytosis likely due to low retic count (? due to
   low iron vs poor BM function)
   - Pt unable to tolerate bowel prep now (nausea, renal failure), but if
   diarrhea or worsening anemia persists, will need colonoscopy
   .
   # CAD: Known nonobstructive CAD on recent cath. Normal recent ECHO and
   stress test. given chest pain on presentation will cycle enzmes -> CEs
   negative.
   - no aspirin given allergy
   - continue statin
   - continue holding BP meds

","The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, and a previous pulmonary embolism (PE) who underwent thrombolytic therapy for a large inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis. She developed anaphylaxis during the procedure, leading to hypoxemia and tachycardia. The cause of her hypoxemia is uncertain, with potential explanations including multiple small PE, aspiration, congestive heart failure (CHF), or obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient's current medications include prednisone, Zantac, Benadryl, TPA, heparin, and hydralazine.

The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed. These include:
1. IVC Thrombosis: The patient had a large IVC thrombosis treated with thrombolytic therapy. She developed anaphylaxis during the procedure, and there is concern for possible complications such as recurrent PE or volume overload due to lying supine during the procedure.
2. Hypoxemia: The cause of the patient's hypoxemia is unclear. Possible causes include PE, aspiration, CHF, or obesity hypoventilation syndrome. The patient is on non-rebreather oxygen and will be weaned off as tolerated. Antibiotics have been given for possible aspiration, and CPAP has been initiated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions and complications. The summary of the information is as follows:

- The patient has marked deep venous thrombosis (DVT), including an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter clot.
- She is experiencing hypoxemia and acute renal failure, which is improving.
- The patient is obese and likely has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
- She has a known contrast allergy.
- The etiology of hypoxemia is unclear, with pneumonia and pulmonary embolism (PE) being considered. The patient is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and will have cultures checked.
- Due to her known DVT, the patient will only pursue a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of the chest if right ventricular (RV) dilation is present, as she is at higher risk for contrast-induced acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient's tachycardia may be due to hypovolemia, PE, or pericardial effusion. An echocardiogram (echo), electrocardiogram (EKG), and fluid challenge will be administered. Depending on the echo findings and fluid response, a trial of beta-blocker may be considered due to the possibility of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
- The patient is allergic to aspirin (ASA) and Plavix.
- Diabetes management will involve"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. She has a history of obesity and probable obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as a contrast allergy. She has been diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis (DVT), including an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter clot. The patient is also experiencing hypoxemia, acute renal failure (improving), and marked DVT. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased hematocrit and creatinine levels. Chest X-ray reveals increased right base opacity and left base consolidation. The patient is currently on multiple medications including alteplase (TPA), heparin sodium, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), prednisone, hydralazine, and others. The patient's condition is critical, and she requires full code status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the presence of DVT and IVC filter clot, there is a risk of a potentially life-threatening PE. This can occur if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemia and bilateral lung infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of ARDS. This"

   Assessment and Plan
   40 year old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, CAD, htn, s/p PE
   with IVC filter in place now found to have large IVC thrombosis
   transferred to MICU for observation s/p TPA by IR.
   .
   # IVC Thrombosis: Patient is s/p TPA by IR with question of anaphylaxis
   manifested tachycardia and hypoxemia.  Hypoxemia and tachycardia likely
   [**3-9**] to multiple small PE as a consequence of the procedure vs possible
   aspiration PNA on CXR [**3-25**].  Low suspicion for MI by history ruled out
   with serial enzymes.  Stopped heparin ggt through fem catheters once
   power PICC placed.
   .
   #Hypoxemia: PE vs. pulmonary infarct vs. aspiration vs obsesity
   hypoventilation and derecruitment in setting of procedure and
   sedation.  PE high-risk given clot burden and peri-procedure;
   aspiration/HAP given body habitus, leukocytosis and low grade fever;
   CHF less likely given unilateral findings on CXR, BNP.
   - currently on face mask, wean O2 as tolerated
   - will obtain induced sputum cx
   - vanc/ Aztreonam /cipro for HAP/aspiration
   - will perform non-contrast CT (investigate pulmonary infiltrate) and
   venogram (holding for now given ARF.
   .
   #Renal Failure: Baseline Cr 1.1.  Likely pre-renal complicated by ATN
   from contrast nephropathy.  Renal ultrasound without obstruction.
   - Renal following, recs no dye load at this time, holding off on
   venogram for now
   - when okay with renal, will give prehydration protocol - IVF's,
   mucomyst, bicarbonate pre-procedure
   .
   # RUQ abdominal pain: Likey due to diabetic gastroparesis and erosive
   gastritis , H. Pylori neg.
   - N/V/D fluctuating, pain slightly improved.
   - gastroparesis explains most symptoms, except diarrhea/fevers (has
   been afebrile)
   - will need gastric emptying study as outpt
   - treating with amitriptyline qhs and reglan for promotility.
   - continue dilaudid prn  pain and ativan for nausea given allergy
   profile
   - Gastritis - treating with PPI daily
   .
   # Anemia: Concerning in the setting of heparin ggt and TPA
   administration and s/p multiple procedures.
   - anemia panel c/w AOCD and [**Doctor First Name **] -> will start PO iron repletion.
   - RDW elevated - macrocytosis likely due to low retic count (? due to
   low iron vs poor BM function)
   - pan-scan CT [**3-26**], eval for femoral bleed and RP bleed
   .
   # CAD: Known non-obstructive CAD on recent cath. Normal recent ECHO and
   stress test. Given chest pain on presentation will cycle enzmes -> CEs
   negative. [**3-25**] EKG with TWI in V1 and V2. Cardiology shown EKG, no ACS.
   On heparin ggt for thrombosis.
   - no aspirin given allergy
   - continue statin
   - will add BP meds as tolerated
   - obtained rpt EKG [**3-26**], resolving TWI
   .
   # DM1:, needs basal insulin. Poorly controlled even while NPO.  Takes
   100 units glargine qhs, HbA1C 10.8 [**11/2104**], 7.9 [**2105-3-19**]
   - continue insulin gtt until tolerating PO, FS 100-150, checking FS Q1H
   - Diabetic diet
   .
   # Hypercoagulability: Appreciate heme-onc rec's, will check factor V
   leiden as per heme-onc.  Do not believe diagnosis of protein C
   deficiency is valid at this time.
   #Hypertension: Has h/o HTN.  Received one dose of hydralazine [**3-24**] PM
   as low suspicion for MI, and beta-blockade in setting of PE may
   precipitate hypotension.
   - will add home regimen as BP tolerates
   .
   # treated UTI: Treated and resolved.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Tg 280, LDL 225, CHol 303
   - continue statin
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN). She presented with a large inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis and underwent tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) therapy by interventional radiology (IR). Following the procedure, she developed tachycardia and hypoxemia, which could be due to multiple small pulmonary embolisms as a consequence of the procedure or aspiration pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient also has renal failure with a baseline creatinine (Cr) level of 1.1, likely pre-renal acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from contrast nephropathy. Renal ultrasound showed no obstruction. The patient has a history of non-obstructive CAD, with normal recent echocardiogram (ECHO) and stress test. She experienced chest pain on presentation, but serial enzymes were negative for myocardial infarction (MI). The patient is allergic to several medications, including penicillins, aspirin, ibuprofen, Tylenol, codeine, Plavix, Percocet, Zofran, and Visipaque. She is currently on insulin gtt for poorly controlled diabetes, heparin ggt for thrombosis, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for erosive gastritis. The patient's anemia panel showed acute blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type I, chronic pain, and DVT in the lower extremity. He was admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient experienced several events on 3/25, including chest pain with twinning in V1 and V2 leads, for which heparin was started. There were also changes made to his antibiotics and the insertion of a power PICC line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a pre-existing condition of DVT in the lower extremity. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening or new thrombus formation.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome: The chest pain with twinning in V1 and V2 leads raises concerns for acute coronary syndrome. The patient is already on heparin therapy, which is appropriate for anticoagulation.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and changes in antibiotics suggest the possibility of an infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and lab parameters is necessary.
4. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant intake of 8,514 mL and output of 1,910 mL since 12 AM. This indicates the need for careful monitoring and management of fluid status.
5. Respiratory Support: The patient is on high-flow nasal cannula for respiratory support, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type I, chronic pain, and lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT). He was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. 

24-hour events include an EKG at 03:18 PM and 04:50 PM, blood cultured at 05:00 PM, and a transesophageal echo also at 05:00 PM. The patient experienced chest pain around 6 PM, with T-wave inversion in leads V1 and V2. Cardiology was notified, and heparin drip with weight-based protocol was initiated. Enzyme cycling was continued. An IR placed power PICC line, which is now appropriately positioned. 

The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, aspirin, Motrin (Ibuprofen), Tylenol (Dm Hb/Pseudoephed/Acetamin/Cp), codeine, Plavix (Clopidogrel Bisulfate), Percocet (Oxycodone Hcl/Acetaminophen), Zofran (Ondansetron Hcl), morphine, Optiray 320 (Ioversol), Visipaque (Iodixanol), tramadol, and ketorolac.

   Assessment and Plan
   40 year old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, CAD, htn, s/p PE
   with IVC filter in place now found to have large IVC thrombosis
   transferred to MICU for observation s/p TPA by IR.
   .
   # IVC Thrombosis and Post-procedure mgmt: s/p TPA by IR with question
   of anaphylaxis.  Procedure complicated by tachycardia, hypoxemia.
   Transferred to ICU for monitoring.  Hypoxemia and tachycardia likely
   [**3-9**] to multiple small PE as a consequence of the procedure.  Possible
   aspiration PNA on CXR [**3-25**].  Low suspicion for MI by history and will
   continue to rule out with serial enzymes.  Lastly might represent CHF
   given e/o volume overload on exam and h/o diastolic dysfunction,
   however abnormalities on CXR appear unilateral.
   - 0.5mg/hr TPA on each side for total of 1.0mg/hr
   - 250 units heparin gtt per hour for each sheeth (total 500)
   - no other heparin products to be given
   - Avoid blood draws, arterial sticks or arterial lines
   - frequent neuro checks q2 hours for stroke
   - Coags and fibrinogen q3 hours, h/h q6 hours
   - If fibrinogen < 150, decrease by [**2-6**] and recheck in 1 hour.
   - If firbinogen < 100, stop TPA and call IR, can draw from sheaths as
   long as it is flushed with saline.
   - 40mg Prednisone 16, 8 and 2 hour pre-procedure - plan for 10am today
   - 150mg zantac 1 hour pre-procedure
   - 15mg PO benadryl 1 hour pre-procedure
   .
   #Hypoxemia: PE vs. aspiration vs. CHF vs obsesity hypoventilation and
   derecruitment in setting of procedure and sedation.  PE high-risk given
   clot burden and peri-procedure; aspiration/HAP given body habitus,
   leukocytosis and low grade fever;  CHF less likely given unilateral
   findings on CXR, BNP.
   - check ABG today
   - trial on venti-mask to assess O2 requirements
   - send sputum cxs
   - vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro for HAP/aspiration
   - if can obtain PIV access will perform CTA to investigate PE (would
   require more aggressive anticoagulation) and venogram to investigate
   status of IVC.  If only have PICC access will perform non-contrast CT
   (investigate pulmonary infiltrate) and venogram.
   .
   #Renal Failure: Baseline Cr 1.1.  Likely pre-renal complicated by ATN
   from contrast nephropathy.  Renal ultrasound without obstruction.
   - IVF's, mucomyst, bicarbonate pre-procedure
   - renal ultrasound without obstruction
   .
   #Hypertension: Has h/o HTN.  Received one dose of hydralazine [**3-24**] PM
   as low suspicion for MI, and beta-blockade in setting of PE may
   precipitate hypotension.
   - will add home regimen as BP tolerates
   .
   # RUQ abdominal pain: Likey due to diabetic gastroparesis and erosive
   gastritis
   - N/V/D fluctuating, pain slightly improved.
   - gastroparesis explains most symptoms, except diarrhea/fevers (has
   been afebrile)
   - will need gastric emptying study as outpt
   - treating with amitriptyline qhs for promotility. Will d/w GI re why
   not reglan or erythromycin.
   - continue promethazine and dilaudid prn
   - Gastritis - H. Pylori neg, treating with PPI daily
   .
   # UTI: Treated and resolved, follow Cr.
   .
   # Anemia: Continues to trend down and started on Fe replacement.
   Negative EGD.  Will need to trend hematocrit on TPA and heparin.
   - anemia panel c/w AOCD and [**Doctor First Name **] -> will start PO iron repletion.
   - RDW elevated - macrocytosis likely due to low retic count (? due to
   low iron vs poor BM function)
   - Pt unable to tolerate bowel prep now (nausea, renal failure), but if
   diarrhea or worsening anemia persists, will need colonoscopy
   .
   # CAD: Known non-obstructive CAD on recent cath. Normal recent ECHO and
   stress test. Given chest pain on presentation will cycle enzmes -> CEs
   negative.
   - no aspirin given allergy
   - continue statin
   - will add BP meds as tolerated
   .
   # Diabetes: Poorly controlled even while NPO.  Takes 100 units glargine
   qhs
   - HbA1C 10.8 [**11/2104**], 7.9 [**2105-3-19**]
   - start insulin gtt given poor control of BS
   - Diabetic diet
   .
   # Hypercoagulability: Appreciate heme-onc rec's, will check factor V
   leiden as per heme-onc.  Do not believe diagnosis of protein C
   deficiency is valid at this time.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Tg 280, LDL 225, CHol 303
   - continue statin
   .
   # FEN: Diabetic diet,IVF, lytes prn
   # Access: PICC, 2 femoral sheaths, will attempt to get PIV access for
   CTA
   # PPx: heparin IV infusion, TPA, no other heparin products at this time
   -> will need to transition to long-term anticoagulation based on CTA
   results
   # Code: presumed FULL

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and a previous pulmonary embolism (PE) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place. The patient presented with a large IVC thrombosis and underwent thrombolytic therapy (TPA) by interventional radiology (IR). However, the procedure was complicated by tachycardia, hypoxemia, and possible anaphylaxis.

The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed. These include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels may be due to a pulmonary embolism (PE), aspiration pneumonia (PNA), congestive heart failure (CHF), or obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Further investigations are needed, such as an arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, a trial of ventilation mask, and sputum cultures.

2. Renal failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine (Cr) level of 1.1, which is likely pre-renal and further complicated by contrast-induced nephropathy. Renal ultrasound shows no obstruction, and the patient should receive intravenous fluids (IVF), Mucomyst, and bicarbonate before any further procedures.

3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of HTN, and beta-blockers should be avoided due to the risk"

 improving
          Obesity and probable OSA
          Contrast allergy
    Etiology of hypoxemia remains uncertain.  CXR suggests pneumonia; PE
   is in DDx.  We will complete a course of therapy for HAP x 8 days if
   unable to get cultures, and try to get sputum (none so far).  Since she
   has known DVT (and therefore will be anticoagulated), and RV is not
   dilated, we have held off on CTA, since she is at higher-than-average
   risk for contrast-induced ARF.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. The key findings and potential medical complications that can arise are as follows:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient presented with respiratory distress, which suggests possible pulmonary issues such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism (PE). The hypoxemia is improving, but the etiology of hypoxemia remains uncertain. Pneumonia is suspected, and PE is in the differential diagnosis.

2. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has marked deep venous thrombosis, including an IVC filter clot. She will be anticoagulated due to the presence of DVT.

3. Contrast Allergy: The patient has a known contrast allergy, which is important to consider when planning further diagnostic tests such as a CT angiography (CTA).

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, but it is improving. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary.

5. Obesity and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient is obese and likely has OSA, which can contribute to respiratory distress and complications during sedation or anesthesia.

6. Aspiration Pneumonia: Given the patient's respiratory distress and obesity, aspiration pneumonia is a probable diagnosis. Efforts should be made to obtain sputum cultures and complete a course of therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN). She was admitted to the ICU for observation after being found to have a large inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis. She underwent thrombolytic therapy (TPA) by interventional radiology (IR), which was complicated by anaphylaxis manifested by tachycardia and hypoxemia. The patient's current concerns include hypoxemia, renal failure, right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain, anemia, CAD, diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1), hypercoagulability, hypertension, treated urinary tract infection (UTI), hyperlipidemia, and fluid electrolyte imbalance (FEN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient may experience continued low oxygen levels due to multiple small pulmonary embolisms (PEs) as a consequence of the TPA procedure or possible aspiration pneumonia (PNA) on chest X-ray.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, indicating possible pre-renal acute kidney injury (AKI) complicated by contrast-induced nephropathy. Further evaluation and management are required.
3. RUQ Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain may be due to diabetic gastroparesis and erosive gastritis. Treatment options include gastric emptying study as an"

The patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for observation after being found to have a large inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis. She underwent thrombolytic therapy (TPA) by interventional radiology (IR) but experienced anaphylaxis, hypoxemia, and tachycardia, which were likely due to multiple small pulmonary embolisms (PEs) as a consequence of the procedure or possible aspiration pneumonia on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels may be due to PE, pulmonary infarct, aspiration, or obesity hypoventilation. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and TPA administration. A gastric emptying study is recommended as an outpatient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, pain control (acute and chronic), and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's history of diabetes mellitus type I puts him at risk for DKA. Monitoring blood glucose levels and electrolyte imbalances is crucial.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient already has a diagnosis of DVT, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism. Regular monitoring of vital signs, performing Doppler ultrasounds if necessary, and considering anticoagulation therapy are important.
3. Respiratory infection: Given the patient's current ICU admission and possible ventilation support, there is a risk of developing a respiratory infection. Frequent assessment of respiratory status, cultures, and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be required.
4. Medication allergies: The patient has a history of hives and shortness of breath with various medications, including penicillins, aspirin, Motrin, Tylenol, codeine, Plavix, Percocet, Zofran, morphine, and tramadol. Close monitoring for any signs of allergic reactions is necessary when administering medications.
5. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI): Since the patient has multiple catheters,"
