She has a history of heart disease, other, and is on coumadin and aspirin. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) continues to increase inappropriately despite no other signs of active bleeding. She received vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reverse anticoagulation. 

The plan includes urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) this morning, and if negative, a tagged red blood cell (tRBC) scan may be needed. She will be given heparin via gtt starting between 7 AM and 1 PM, and will continue intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) gtt as recommended by GI. The need for prophylactic antibiotics will be discussed with GI, and Dr. [**Doctor First Name 91**] recommends discussing the need for prophylactic antibiotics.

The patient also has demand ischemia, with ST depressions and shortness of breath. An EKG should be rechecked, cardiac enzymes trended, and the patient transfused to a hematocrit (Hct) of 30.

The patient's anticoagulation needs to be managed due to her significant stroke risk given her mechanical mitral valve and atrial fibrillation. The goal INR is 2.5-3.5, and it is likely"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old woman with a mechanical mitral valve, atrial fibrillation, and a history of heart disease. She is currently in the ICU and presenting with multiple medical complications.

The patient's chief complaint and significant events include gastrointestinal bleeding, inappropriate hematocrit response to blood transfusions, and potential demand ischemia. She has a central line placed and is receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/60 mmHg to 102/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

Her laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 192 K/uL, low hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, high potassium level of 6.2 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose of 146 mg/dL, and abnormal coagulation profile with PT/PTT/INR values of 20.1/35.3/1.9.

The patient has been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by melena and a negative NG lavage. Her hematocrit levels continue to increase inappropriately, suggesting ongoing bleeding despite the absence of other signs of active bleeding. She has received vitamin K and fresh"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, rheumatic heart disease, and previous mechanical mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve repair, and atrial septal defect repair. She is currently on coumadin and ASA for post-operative atrial fibrillation, and recently started on amiodarone and augmentin. The patient presents with melena and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR. She has received blood transfusions for anemia and has been treated with IV pantoprazole, as well as other ICU medications. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 57 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She has a history of atrial flutter and is on systemic anticoagulation with heparin. The patient's recent laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, leukocyte count of 192 K/uL, platelet count of 146 mg/dL, sodium level of 25 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL. The patient's condition remains stable from a hemodynamic standpoint, but she requires close monitoring for rebleeding due to ongoing anticoagulation. The patient has undergone an endoscopic examination that revealed two fungating masses in the stomach, which appear friable but no active bleeding was observed. Biopsy was not performed due to the need for ongoing anticoagulation and high bleeding risk. Surgical consultation has been obtained, considering the possibility of surgical intervention for tissue/staging or massive bleeding recurrence. The patient will also be discussed with the ERCP team for an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Once stabilized, a CT scan with contrast and/or positron emission tomography (PET) will be considered to evaluate for metastasis or additional lesions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient's ongoing need for anticoagulation increases the risk of rebleeding.
2. Stroke: The patient has mechanical heart valves, which increase the risk of thromboembolism and stroke. Anticoagulation reversal is limited due to the mechanical valves.
3. Infection: The patient is critically ill and at an increased risk of infection, especially with the presence of indwelling lines and tubes.
4. Organ dysfunction: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated creatinine level. Close monitoring and supportive care will be required.
5. Malignancy progression: The presence of fungating masses in the stomach suggests possible malignancy. Further evaluation and staging are necessary to determine the extent of disease and appropriate treatment options."

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and mechanical heart valves. She is currently on Coumadin and ASA for her heart condition and has recently started on amio and augmentin. The patient presents with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and a supratherapeutic INR level. She also has a history of post-operative atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has been experiencing melena. She was transfused with blood products due to demand ischemia and received two units of fresh frozen plasma. Her INR has been brought down to therapeutic levels. 

The patient's medical history includes mechanical heart valves, atrial fibrillation, and a recent mechanical valve replacement surgery. She is also on Coumadin and ASA. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the gastrointestinal bleeding.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient's temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are within normal ranges. Her weight has increased by 2.6 kg since admission. The patient has received a total of 4 units of blood products, and her hemoglobin concentration has improved from 27-30% to 34%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,061 mL and output of 1,700 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 361 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, rheumatic heart disease, and a history of mechanical mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve repair, and atrial septal defect repair. The patient is currently on Coumadin and aspirin for anticoagulation, and recently started on amiodarone and augmentin. She presents with melena and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR. The patient remains stable from a hemodynamic standpoint with adequate urine output. 

The plan is to continue pantoprazole (Protonix), follow serial hemoglobin/hematocrit levels, and closely monitor for rebleeding given the ongoing need for anticoagulation. An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is planned in the morning, followed by a possible colonoscopy and surgery. Mechanical heart valves pose a high stroke risk due to mitral valve replacement, limiting the time for anticoagulation reversal. Heparin infusions will be continued at this time, and a cardiology consultation will be obtained to assist with surgical management of anticoagulation and risk stratification.

Potential Complications:
1. Rebleeding: Given the ongoing need for anticoagulation, there is a risk of rebleeding.
2. Stroke: The patient's mechanical heart valves increase the risk of stroke, especially considering the limited time for anticoagulation reversal.
3. Infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, rheumatic heart disease, and previous surgeries including mechanical mitral valve replacement, tricuspid valve repair, and atrial septal defect repair. She is currently in the ICU due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and presents with melena. Her INR is supratherapeutic, indicating a high risk of bleeding. The patient has gastric masses, which are likely the source of the bleed. She is being treated with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), close monitoring for rebleed, and possible endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and colonoscopy in the morning. Due to her mechanical heart valves, there is a high stroke risk if anticoagulation is reversed. Therefore, she will continue with heparin infusion and cardiology consultation for surgical management of anticoagulation and risk stratification. The patient also has evidence of demand ischemia, but the ECG changes have resolved. The rest of the note is consistent with the resident's note. ICU care includes advancing to clear liquids, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is on systemic anticoagulation with heparin and remains in the ICU due to the high risk of bleeding while on heparin."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of heart disease and gastric masses. She presented with gastrointestinal bleeding, specifically melena, and was found to have gastric lesions on endoscopy. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has remained stable at 33, and she received a blood transfusion two days ago. Although her melena is currently resolved, she is at high risk for rebleeding from the gastric lesion. Her INR was initially supratherapeutic but has since resolved.

The patient also experienced demand ischemia, which appeared to be resolved with transfusion and did not cause an increase in enzymes. Cardiology consulted and determined that no further cardiac workup is required at this time, but advised restarting heparin as soon as possible after all procedures.

Regarding anticoagulation, the patient has a significant stroke risk due to a mechanical mitral valve and atrial fibrillation. The goal PTT is 60-80, and she will be on a heparin bridge. Coumadin will be held for now and resumed once bleeding is stable after surgery. Aspirin will also be held temporarily, while statin therapy will continue.

The patient's hypertension is well-controlled, and home medications lisinopril and metoprolol will be held. Gentle beta-blockers will be used for any blood pressure readings above target.

Diabetes management will involve holding home regimens and closely monitoring glucose levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of heart disease and gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to ongoing bleeding from a gastric lesion, which initially presented as melena. The patient's INR is elevated, and there have been concerns about rebleeding. The PTT has been consistently above 150 despite efforts to keep it between 60-80. The patient received a blood transfusion to raise his Hct level to 30. Heparin gtt will be restarted between 7 AM and 1 PM. Pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion will continue as recommended by GI. Sucralfate may be considered, and procedures such as EUS and colonoscopy are planned. The patient also has demand ischemia, which appears to have resolved with transfusion and did not result in elevated enzymes. Surgery wants to assess the patient's cardiac risk and guide anticoagulation. The patient has a mechanical mitral valve and atrial fibrillation, posing a significant stroke risk. The goal is to maintain a PTT between 60-80. Heparin bridge will be implemented as mentioned earlier. Coumadin will be resumed once bleeding is stable after surgery, and aspirin will be temporarily held. The patient's hypertension is well-controlled, and home medications lisinopril and metoprolol will be held. Gentle beta-blockers will be used for RVR. Diabetes management"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mechanical mitral valve replacement, admitted with melena and found to have a gastric mass. She is currently awaiting endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for staging and is likely to undergo surgery later this week. The patient's vital signs have been stable overnight, with no significant changes. Her heart rhythm is atrial flutter, and she is receiving heparin sodium infusions for her mechanical mitral valve. Other medications include pantoprazole, insulin sliding scale, amiodarone, and pravastatin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed secondary to gastric mass: The patient's melena indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be attributed to the gastric mass. Continuous monitoring of hematocrit levels is necessary, and she is currently on heparin drip for her mechanical mitral valve. Once the EUS is completed, the heparin may be held, and the patient may proceed to the operating room for surgery.
2. Mechanical mitral valve: The patient also has a mechanical mitral valve and is at risk for thromboembolic events.
