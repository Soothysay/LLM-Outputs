","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, who underwent CABG x2 and mitral valve repair. He is admitted for acute on chronic CHF exacerbation and diuresis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal failure, hypothyroidism, OSA, possible gout, anxiety, and fen Fen. He is currently receiving various medications including furosemide, milrinone, metolazone, spironolactone, neosynephrine, and others. His labs show elevated creatinine levels and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation
2. Hypokalemia due to diuretic use and ongoing losses
3. Hyperglycemia due to poorly controlled DM
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening renal failure
5. Hypomagnesemia
6. Ventricular arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances and history of VT/ICD firing
7. Infection risk due to prolonged hospital stay and immunocompromised state
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding risk due to use of aspirin and other medications
9. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) risk due to immobility

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction 20%, and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgeries. He presented with acute on chronic congestive heart failure exacerbation and was admitted for diuresis. The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure. He is currently receiving treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) for fluid overload and dyspnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) symptoms: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and previous CABG surgeries. He is currently experiencing acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. There is a potential risk of worsening CHF symptoms if diuresis is not effectively managed.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing dyspnea and requires CPAP mask support for oxygen delivery. There is a potential risk of respiratory distress if oxygenation is not maintained properly.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, ranging from 107/61 mmHg to 135/85 mmHg. There is a potential risk of hypotension if vasopressor support is not provided adequately.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has elevated serum creatinine levels, indicating impaired renal function. There is a potential risk of electrolyte imbalances, especially potassium imbalances, which can lead to arr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of cardiomyopathy and type II diabetes mellitus, admitted to the ICU with complaints of dyspnea and volume overload. The patient is currently receiving lasix infusion at 20 mg/hr and milrinone at 0.375 mcg/kg/min. The patient's breathing has shown improvement, as reported by the patient. The patient has allergies to penicillins and heparin agents.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's history of cardiomyopathy puts him at risk for cardiogenic shock, especially if there is worsening of cardiac function or inadequate response to treatment.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and volume overload may indicate respiratory distress. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory effort is necessary to detect any deterioration in respiratory status.
3. Renal impairment: The patient's lab results show an elevated creatinine level, which may suggest renal impairment. Monitoring of renal function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly is important to avoid further renal damage.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's lab results indicate elevated glucose levels, indicating hyperglycemia. This could be related to the patient's history of diabetes or stress response in the ICU setting. Close monitoring and management of blood glucose levels are essential to prevent complications associated with hyperglycemia.
5. Bleeding risk: The patient has a positive history for unknown heparin agent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) twice and had a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented with an acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure and was admitted for diuresis. 

The patient has been receiving milrinone and furosemide infusions to improve cardiac function and manage volume overload. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/61 to 135/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on CPAP.

Physical examination reveals a well-healed midline sternotomy scar, bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation, obesity with distention, and venous stasis dermatitis bilaterally. Laboratory results show elevated glucose levels and renal dysfunction.

Assessment and Plan:
1. PUMP: The patient has a history of acute on chronic systolic heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%. He is currently being treated with milrinone and furosemide to improve cardiac function and manage volume overload.
2. CORONARIES: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD admitted with acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. He is currently receiving treatment for diuresis. 

The patient has a history of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%. He underwent mitral valve repair in [**2176**] with improvement in cardiac function since. However, he is now presenting with significant fluid overload, as indicated by his current weight being 45-50 pounds above his dry weight. 

The patient is being treated with milrinone and lasix to improve cardiac function and diurese excess fluid. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 107/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on CPAP. 

Physical examination reveals a well-healed midline sternal scar, obesity, distended abdomen, no hepatojugular venous distention, and venous stasis dermatitis bilaterally. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 14.3 g/dL, creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL, blood glucose of 354 mg/dL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4.6 mEq/L, and magnesium of 2.3 mg/dL. 

The patient's medical history includes cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal failure, coronary artery disease with previous CABG surgeries, rhythm disturbances, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea, gout, anxiety, and fenofibrate use. 

The patient's current medications include furosemide (Lasix), milrinone, metoprolol, asa 81, lipitor 20, carvedilol, amiodarone, cinacalcet, vitamin D, levothyroxine, allopurinol, ativan prn, ambien for sleep, and a low salt, cardiac diet. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for worsening heart failure due to fluid overload, further deterioration of renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and possible arrhythmias."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD, admitted with acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. He is currently in the ICU for diuresis and has been receiving milrinone, lasix, metolazone, neosynephrine, and electrolyte management. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal failure, hypothyroidism, OSA, gout, anxiety, and fen. He is on various medications for these conditions and has been placed on a low salt, cardiac diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and previous CHF exacerbation puts him at risk for further worsening of his heart failure. Close monitoring of his vital signs, fluid balance, and response to diuretic therapy will be important.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of VT and ICD firing, it is crucial to monitor his heart rhythm and continue with appropriate anti-arrhythmic medications (e.g., metoprolol, amiodarone).
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 2.4-2.9 and is currently at 2.9. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly will be necessary."

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction 20%, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) twice. He presented with an acute exacerbation of chronic systolic heart failure. The patient has a past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea, gout, anxiety, and fenofibrate-induced nephropathy. He is currently admitted for diuresis and management of his heart failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/59 mmHg to 131/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm. The patient appears comfortable and oriented, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals a well-healed midline sternal scar, bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation, distended abdomen, and venous stasis dermatitis on both lower extremities.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 14.5 g/dL, blood glucose levels between 245 mg/dL and 352 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, sodium"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, who has undergone two coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) and has a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He is admitted with acute-on-chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and is currently being treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient has several comorbidities including chronic renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), possible gout, and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) - The patient's current presentation of acute-on-chronic CHF exacerbation indicates that there is a potential for further deterioration in cardiac function, leading to increased fluid retention, pulmonary edema, and respiratory distress.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias - Given the patient's history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ICD firing, there is a risk of recurrent arrhythmias, which could lead to hemodynamic instability and potentially require interventions such as antiarrhythmic medications or cardioversion.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) - The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, and there is a potential for AKI due to factors such as hypotension, nephrotoxic medications, or ongoing"

He presents with acute on chronic CHF exacerbation and is admitted for diuresis. The patient is currently experiencing symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF), including distended abdomen, bibasilar crackles, and cool extremities. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, chronic renal failure, hypothyroidism, OSA, possible gout, and anxiety. The patient is on multiple medications including milrinone, Lasix, metolazone, neosynephrine, spironolactone, aspirin, lipitor, carvedilol, amiodarone, cinacalcet, vitamin D, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to worsening CHF
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to hypotension and renal hypoperfusion
3. Hyperkalemia due to renal failure and medications like spironolactone and amiodarone
4. Ventricular arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances and history of VT/ICD firing
5. Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged ICU stay and immobility
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary emb"

   below 3.5 which is Dr.[**Initials (NamePattern4) 6567**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 9934**] for stopping diuresis.  Blood
   sugar control remains a problem-> home regimen of long acting insulins
   increased and humalog SS tightened.  A1C=9.2 (was running 7.5, 7.1 at
   last two readings) and TSH=0.14 (therefore increased Synthroid to

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, and previous CABG surgeries. He was admitted for acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. The patient has been experiencing difficulty with blood sugar control and requires adjustments to his insulin regimen. His thyroid function is also being monitored and managed. He has a history of chronic renal failure and type II DM. The patient's current condition includes hypothyroidism, OSA, possible gout, and anxiety. The treatment plan involves diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and other medications tailored to his specific conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is currently comfortable with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities. Lab results show elevated glucose levels and slightly abnormal kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic CHF exacerbation: The patient's history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and previous CABG surgeries put him at risk for heart failure. His current symptoms and fluid balance indicate ongoing cardiac issues. Close monitoring of fluid status and adjustment of diuretic therapy are necessary to prevent worsening of heart failure.
2. Poorly controlled DM: The patient's elevated HbA1C levels suggest suboptimal blood sugar control. Failure to manage diabetes properly can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or an increased risk of infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction 20%, who has undergone two coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) and is equipped with a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He was admitted with an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure and is being treated with diuretics, milrinone, and neosynephrine to support blood pressure. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea, possible gout, and anxiety. The plan includes diuresis, monitoring of electrolytes, especially potassium, and adjustment of medications accordingly. The patient will be monitored in the ICU for now and then transferred to the CCU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening heart failure due to inadequate diuresis or medication non-compliance.
2. Development of renal failure or worsening of existing renal failure due to dehydration or medication toxicity.
3. Hypokalemia or hyperkalemia due to imbalances caused by diuretic use and the patient's history of ventricular tachycardia with ICD firing at low potassium levels.
4. Hypotension or hypertension due to the use of neosynephrine and other medications affecting blood pressure regulation.
5. Infection or deep vein thrombosis due to immobility and central"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 68-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, s/p CABG x2, admitted for acute on chronic CHF exacerbation.
- He has a history of mitral valve repair, improvement in cardiac function since, and is currently 45-50 pounds above his dry weight.
- labs show elevated glucose levels and high creatinine.
- The patient has a history of type II DM, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, and other medical conditions.
- Current medications include diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, and others.
- The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are being closely monitored.
- The patient is on a cardiac diet, low salt intake, and receiving prophylactic treatments for DVT and stress ulcers.
- The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic CHF exacerbation: The patient's current condition suggests worsening heart failure. If not properly managed, it may lead to further fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Poorly controlled DM: The elevated A1C level indicates poor blood sugar control, which increases the risk of diabetic complications such as neuropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular events.
3. Chronic renal failure: The patient's history of renal failure and elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. If not managed appropriately, it may progress to end-stage"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction 20%, and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) x2. He was admitted with an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current medications include metoprolol, carvedilol, aspirin, atorvastatin, pantoprazole, milrinone, lasix, spironolactone, neosynephrine, amiodarone, cinacalcet, and levothyroxine.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated blood sugar levels, with HbA1C at 9.2, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. His potassium levels are also low, and he has a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) with ICD firing provoked by low potassium levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals a distended abdomen, cool extremities, and evidence of venous stasis dermatitis. His vital signs include a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 94/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on nasal cannula, and temperature of 36.1°C.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, who has had two coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) and a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He was admitted with an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient's medical history includes type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, gout, anxiety, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). He is being treated with various medications and interventions to manage his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure: The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate worsening heart failure, which can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and hypotension.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and an ICD implantation. His current medication regimen includes beta-blockers and amiodarone to prevent ectopy and maintain sinus rhythm.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS): The patient's high blood glucose levels and elevated HbA1C suggest poor glycemic control, which increases the risk of diabetic complications such as DKA or HHS.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal impairment,"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, who underwent CABG x2 and mitral valve repair.
- He is admitted with an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure (CHF) and is being treated with diuretics.
- The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), possible gout, and anxiety.
- He is currently on multiple medications including spironolactone, metolazone, neosynephrine, beta-blockers, aspirin, lipitor, carvedilol, amiodarone, cinacalcet, levothyroxine, CPAP, allopurinol, and ativan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's symptoms and history suggest ongoing heart failure, which can lead to further fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Renal dysfunction: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, and his current condition may worsen due to inadequate renal perfusion or medication-induced nephrotoxicity.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient is on multiple antidiabetic medications, and the risk of hypoglycemia is present, especially with the use of insulin and NPH.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, who has undergone two coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) and received a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He was admitted with an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure and was placed on diuresis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 95/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals a well-healed midline sternotomy scar, bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation, obesity with a distended abdomen, and venous stasis dermatitis on both lower extremities.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of glucose (354 mg/dL), creatinine (3.6 mg/dL), potassium (5.3 mEq/L), and blood urea nitrogen (108 K/uL). The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's medical history includes ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%, prior mitral valve repair, and extensive coronary artery disease treated with CABG. He also has chronic renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism,"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD, admitted with acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. The patient has been experiencing episodes of falling, but denies any loss of consciousness, dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 95/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation support.

Physical examination reveals a well-healed midline sternal scar, obesity, distended abdomen, and cool extremities with palpable pulses. The patient also has a holosystolic murmur at the sternal borders and bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine levels. Electrolyte imbalances include hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia.

The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, spironolactone, metolazone, beta-blockers, carvedilol, ASA, lipitor, amiodarone, and cinacalcet.

Assessment and plan:
1. PUMP: The patient has a history of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and previous mitral valve repair. He is experiencing fluid overload, as evidenced by his weight gain and negative fluid balance.
   - Diuresis was initiated, but stopped due to elevated creatinine levels.
   - Restarted spironolactone at 25 mg daily.
   - Home dose of lasix 160 mg started today.
   - Holding ACE inhibitors due to acute on chronic renal failure.
   - Metolazone 5 mg qMonday, with extra doses if fluid overloaded.
   - Continue outpatient imdur.
   - Diuresis stopped now that creatinine is 3.5.

2. CORONARIES: The patient has a history of extensive coronary artery disease, s/p CABG x2, with a widely patent left internal mammary artery graft and a saphenous vein graft to the omohyoid artery with proximal 30% stenosis. No acute issues were identified.
   - Continue ASA 81 mg and lipitor 20 mg.
   - Restart on home carvedilol.
   - Holding ACE inhibitors due to acute on chronic renal failure.

3. RHYTHM: The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm but has a history of ventricular tachycardia with ICD firing provoked by potassium levels below 4.8.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, ejection fraction of 20%, who has undergone two coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) and has a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He was admitted with an acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure and is currently being treated with diuretics. The patient also has chronic renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), possible gout, and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and previous CABG surgeries put him at risk for further cardiac complications. His current acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure may progress, leading to fluid overload and respiratory distress.
2. Renal dysfunction: The patient has chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine level of 2.4-2.9, which may worsen during his hospital stay due to the use of nephrotoxic medications or fluid overload.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ICD firing at low potassium levels (<4.8) increases the risk of hyperkalemia during his hospitalization. Close monitoring and repletion of potassium are essential.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes requires careful management of blood glucose"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 yo M with Ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 20%, s/p CABG
   x2, s/p BIV ICD admitted with acute on chronic CHF exacerbation
   admitted for diuresis.
   .
   # PUMP: He has history of acute on chronic systolic heart failure [**1-25**]
   ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%.  He is s/p mitral valve repair in [**2176**]
   with improvement in cardiac function since.  Now coming in 45-50 pounds
   above his dry weight.
   - yesterday- stopped milrinone and lasix gtt given Cr and u/s showing
   no ascites
   - restarted spironolactone at 25mg daily
   - home dose of lasix 160mg [**Hospital1 **] started today
   - holding acei given acute on chronic renal failure
   - metolazone 5mg qMonday.  Give extra if fluid overloaded.
   - has been -436mL overnight, ~4L total while hospitalized
   - electrolytes [**Hospital1 **] with goal of K 5-5.5 (pt has history of VT/ICD
   firing for K <4.8)
   - on BB to prevent ectopy
   - continue outpatient imdur
   - diuresis stopped now that Cr is 3.5

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%, s/p CABG x2, s/p BIV ICD, admitted with acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. He has a history of acute on chronic systolic heart failure, ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF 20%. He underwent mitral valve repair in [**2176**] and showed improvement in cardiac function since then. He is currently presenting with a weight gain of 45-50 pounds above his dry weight.

The patient has been started on diuretics for diuresis and his electrolytes are being monitored. His potassium levels need to be maintained between 5-5.5 due to a history of ventricular tachycardia/ICD firing for K <4.8. He is also on beta-blockers to prevent ectopy.

The patient has a history of extensive coronary artery disease s/p CABG x2, last cath in [**2176**] with LIMA widely patent, SVG to OM with proximal 30% stenosis, SVG jump graft to D1 and distal diag patent. No acute issues are reported.

The patient is currently in normal sinus rhythm on admission and has a BIV PPM/ICD paced at HR=60. He has a history of ventricular tachycardia with ICD firing provoked by K <4.8. His pacer HR was increased"
