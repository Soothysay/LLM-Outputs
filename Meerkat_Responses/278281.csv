   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo female with PMH significant for ILD on home O2, diastolic CHF,
   cor pulmonale, s/p liver transplant on immunosuppression,
   post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab who
   was initially admitted to hospital after a mechanical fall for pain
   control who is now being transferred to the MICU for
   hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of emesis
   .
   # Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: In the setting of witnessed
   emesis prior to decompensation, it is reasonable to suspect aspiration
   pneumonia. Also, given her elevated PCO2 on ABGs, she has had increased
   CO2 retention for some time, and may have worsening underlying
   pulmonary disease. Post-intubation she did well on AC, and during
   rounds was able to tolerate PS. Will continue to wean as tolerated,
   keeping in mind her small reserve. Also in setting of high fever and
   SVT last night, it may not take much for her to decompensate. While the
   family is ok with intubation, they do not wish to escalate level of
   care so pressors and compressions would not be appropriate should she
   decompensate.
   - continue vanco, zosyn for aspiration pneumonia vs HAP
   - wean to PS as tolerated today, rest on AC
   -monitor fluid status to avoid gross pulmonary edema (lasix 40 IV is
   suspect flash)
   -nebs prn
   - consider adding on steroids if underlying disease appears to have
   worsened
   .
   # emesis: unclear cause. History of one dose of ultram written for on
   the floor however it is unclear if this was the cause of her emesis.
   Has not recurred overnight, not tender to palp on exam, LFTs normal.
   Tac level pending. CE negative.
   - OG in place
   - currently resolved but continue NPO for now
   .
   # SVT: Overnight patient went from sinus tachycardia to SVT, ? atrial
   fibrillation w/PACs vs MAT. Unclear at this point if it could be a
   combination of both, in the setting of pulmonary disease and sepsis.
   Was not resolved with po toprol, IV lopressor and finally was started
   on amiodarone drip. She reverted in the morning back to NSR. It is
   possible she may have reverted on her own, given her significant
   improvement today. At this point, would attempt to restart her home
   beta blocker and take off amiodarone (not an ideal medication given her
   underlying pulmonary disease).
   -d/c amiodarone
   -monitor on telemetry
   -restart home toprol 37.5mg po tid
   -if reverts to SVT reload with amiodarone
   .
   # s/p fall: no evidence of fracture. Complained of back pain during
   rounds this AM, which was present while she was on the wards. Will
   avoid more narcotics- currently she is written for bolus fentanyl,
   Tylenol and has lidocaine patch.
   - cont lidocaine patch, tylenol
   - fentanyl for pain now, but may need to wean if ready to extubate
   -PT
   .
   # DM: Good FSBG control. Currently NPO and on sliding scale.
   .
   # ILD: Pulmonary following, resistant to steroids as outpatient
   treatment.  For now, treat for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure.
   - wean off ventilator if tolerates PS
   - treat PNA
   - alb/atrovent nebs
   -currently no role for steroids
   .
   # PTLD: no known active issues currently.
   - LFTs normal
   - continue tacrolimus, level pending this AM
   .
   # HTN: significantly hypotensive overnight, held beta blocker. Will
   restart today given improvement.
   - Continue outpt metoprolol and monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue Levothyroxine
   .
   # Access: PIV

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), cor pulmonale, post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder, and a recent liver transplant on immunosuppression. She was admitted to the hospital after a mechanical fall for pain control and is now in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure, possibly caused by aspiration pneumonia or worsening underlying pulmonary disease. The patient also experienced emesis prior to decompensation, and her current condition includes nausea/vomiting, fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to aspiration pneumonia, which can occur when foreign material, such as gastric contents, enters the lungs causing infection and inflammation.
2. Worsening Pulmonary Disease: The patient's underlying ILD may be worsening, leading to increased CO2 retention and hypoxia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, potentially secondary to pneumonia or another source of infection.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CHF and cor pulmonale increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Delirium: The patient's altered mental"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever, intubated for respiratory failure, and experiencing hypotension. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has been receiving various medications including amiodarone, metoprolol, and heparin. The patient's temperature is elevated at 102.3°F (39.1°C), heart rate is 117 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure is low at 81/53 mmHg, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's arterial line was placed due to a high PCO2 level of 100s on ABG, and they experienced a rapid ventricular response to 130s, possibly due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (MAT) or atrial fibrillation. The patient did not respond to PO and was given toprol, lopressor IV, and amiodarone load. The patient's ABG showed improved PCO2 levels in the 50s, and they were decreased on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's family does not want to escalate care. The patient has allergies to codeine, oxycodone/acetaminophen, morphine sulfate, and unknown allergies. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) at 04:00 AM on 12/13/2125. The patient is currently on infusions of amiodarone at 1 mg/min and has received various other medications including midazolam (versed) at 04:00 AM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the fever. The patient's vital signs show an increase in temperature, elevated heart rate, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and high oxygen saturation. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation. The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 294 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 55 mmHg, PaO2 of 302 mmHg, and bicarbonate level of 42 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals no assessment of peripheral vascular pulses, skin, or neurologic status. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and slightly elevated creatinine level. The patient's troponin-T levels are within normal range, and their electrolyte levels are relatively stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, which may indicate an infection. The patient has been started on vancomycin and zosyn, suggesting a concern for a hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is an underlying lung pathology such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's ABG results show respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can lead to poor cardiac output and increased risk of thromboembolic events.

5. Medication Reactions: The patient has known allergies to several medications, and there is a risk of an allergic reaction if exposed to these medications.

6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and decreased mobility due to being intubated increase the risk"

   73 yo female with PMH significant for ILD on home O2, diastolic CHF,
   cor pulmonale, s/p liver transplant on immunosuppression,
   post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab who
   was initially admitted to hospital after a mechanical fall for pain
   control who is now being transferred to the MICU for
   hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of emesis
   .
   # Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: given current ABG, suspect
   she has had increased CO2 retention over last month. Also given that
   she is not currently obtunded argues in favor of this. Acute worsening
   in oxygenation likely due to aspiration or flash pulmonary edema in the
   setting of emesis. Other possible etiologies including pna or PE seem
   less likely. She has been on DVT ppx. Not good NIPPV candidate
   currently given emesis. Given severity of underlying lung disease,
   intubation unlikely to be reversible.
   - discuss goals of care with family
   - serial ABGs
   - cont supplemental O2
   - add on BNP
   - lasix 40 IV for pulmonary edema
   - hold off on abx without clear infection
   - nebs
   - hold off on steroids as has been steroid unresponsive in past and no
   evidence of obstructive exacerbation at this time
   .
   # emesis: unclear cause. Patient cannot provide adequate history at
   this time. Abdominal exam benign at this time. Does have midline hernia
   but reducible.
   - abdominal film to check fo obstruction
   - add on LFTs, PEs
   - check tacro level to assess for toxicity
   - check cardiac enzymes and ECG

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a significant medical history, including interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), cor pulmonale, a previous liver transplant on immunosuppression, and post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder treated with CHOP and rituximab. She was initially admitted for pain control following a mechanical fall and is now being transferred to the MICU for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure, suspected to have developed over the last month. The cause of acute worsening in oxygenation is likely due to aspiration or flash pulmonary edema following emesis. Other possible etiologies, such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism, seem less likely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's underlying lung disease, combined with increased CO2 retention and hypoxia, indicates a severe respiratory condition that requires immediate attention.
2. Aspiration: The patient's inability to provide adequate history and the presence of emesis suggest a possible aspiration event, which can lead to lung infection and further respiratory compromise.
3. Flash pulmonary edema: Given the acute worsening of oxygenation following emesis, flash pulmonary edema is a likely complication in this case.
4. Pneumonia or pulmonary embolism: Although less likely based on the current presentation, these conditions should still be considered as potential complications due to the patient's immunosuppressed state"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo female with PMH significant for ILD on home O2, diastolic CHF,
   cor pulmonale, s/p liver transplant on immunosuppression,
   post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab who
   was initially admitted to hospital after a mechanical fall for pain
   control who is now being transferred to the MICU for
   hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of emesis
   .
   # Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: In the setting of witnessed
   emesis prior to decompensation, it is reasonable to suspect aspiration
   pneumonia. Also, given her elevated PCO2 on ABGs, she has had increased
   CO2 retention for some time, and may have worsening underlying
   pulmonary disease. Post-intubation she did well on AC, and during
   rounds was able to tolerate PS. Will continue to wean as tolerated,
   keeping in mind her small reserve. Also in setting of high fever and
   SVT last night, it may not take much for her to decompensate. While the
   family is ok with intubation, they do not wish to escalate level of
   care so pressors and compressions would not be appropriate should she
   decompensate.
   - continue vanco, zosyn for aspiration pneumonia vs HAP
   - wean to PS as tolerated today, rest on AC
   -monitor fluid status to avoid gross pulmonary edema (lasix 40 IV is
   suspect flash)
   -nebs prn
   - consider adding on steroids if underlying disease appears to have
   worsened
   .
   # emesis: unclear cause. History of one dose of ultram written for on

   Has not recurred overnight, not tender to palp on exam, LFTs normal.

   # SVT: Overnight patient went from sinus tachycardia to SVT, ? atrial
   fibrillation w/PACs vs MAT. Unclear at this point if it could be a
   combination of both, in the setting of pulmonary disease and sepsis.
   Was not resolved with po toprol, IV lopressor and finally was started
   on amiodarone drip. She reverted in the morning back to NSR. It is
   possible she may have reverted on her own, given her significant
   improvement today. At this point, would attempt to restart her home
   beta blocker and take off amiodarone (not an ideal medication given her
   underlying pulmonary disease).
   -d/c amiodarone
   -monitor on telemetry
   -restart home toprol 37.5mg po tid
   -if reverts to SVT reload with amiodarone
   .
   # s/p fall: no evidence of fracture. Complained of back pain during
   rounds this AM, which was present while she was on the wards. Will
   avoid more narcotics- currently she is written for bolus fentanyl,
   Tylenol and has lidocaine patch.

   assessment and plan as outlined. She had a very unstable night with
   fever spike, hypotension, tachycardia but temp now down.  CXR and
   sputum suggest she aspirated. No further episodes of emesis since
   transfer.  We have converted vent to PSV but at 20 cmH2O she is over
   ventilating. Will decrease pressure and decrease FIO2.  She is still
   having back pain so we will up pain meds.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 73-year-old female with a medical history significant for interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), cor pulmonale, post-liver transplant on immunosuppression, post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder treated with CHOP and rituximab, was initially admitted to the hospital after a mechanical fall for pain control. She is now being transferred to the MICU for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of emesis.

The patient's condition overnight was complicated by several issues. She developed invasive ventilation and an arterial line due to worsening respiratory failure. She experienced a fever spike of 102.3 degrees Fahrenheit and had an episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which was initially treated with PO toprol, IV lopressor, and eventually amiodarone drip. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, blood pressure of 81/53 mmHg, heart rate of 117 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.46, PCO2 of 55 mmHg, PO2 of 151 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 42 mEq/L. Her white blood cell (WBC) count is 8.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) is 35.1%, platelet count (Plt) is 243 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) is 1.0 mg/dL, and troponin-T is <0.01 ng/mL. Other laboratory values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles and diminished breath sounds throughout the chest, as well as soft and distended abdomen. Neurologic examination shows that she responds to voice and commands, is on minimal sedation, and is intubated.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia or worsening underlying pulmonary disease. She will be weaned off the ventilator as tolerated, with monitoring for any signs of decompensation.
2. Emesis: The cause of the patient's emesis is unclear. She has been placed on nothing by mouth (NPO) status, and her liver function tests (LFTs) are normal. Tacrolimus level is pending.
3. SVT: The patient experienced a SVT, which was treated with amiodarone drip. She has since reverted back to normal sinus rhythm. She will be monitored on telemetry, and if she reverts to SVT, amiodarone will be reloaded.
4. Fall: The patient had a mechanical fall for pain"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), cor pulmonale, post-liver transplant on immunosuppression, and post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder treated with CHOP and rituximab. She was initially admitted to the hospital after a mechanical fall for pain control and is now being transferred to the MICU for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of emesis.

The patient has several medical complications that could arise based on her current condition and medical history. These potential complications include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's witnessed emesis prior to decompensation, there is a suspicion of aspiration pneumonia. She is currently being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for this condition.

2. Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has elevated CO2 retention on ABGs, indicating an underlying pulmonary disease. She is being weaned off the ventilator as tolerated while monitoring her fluid status to avoid gross pulmonary edema.

3. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): The patient experienced an episode of SVT overnight, which was resolved with amiodarone drip. She is being monitored on telemetry and restarting her home beta blocker.

4. Fall-related complications: Although no evidence of fracture was found, the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo female with PMH significant for ILD on home O2, diastolic CHF,
   cor pulmonale, s/p liver transplant on immunosuppression,
   post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab who
   was initially admitted to hospital after a mechanical fall for pain
   control who is now being transferred to the MICU for
   hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of emesis
   .
   # Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: In the setting of witnessed
   emesis prior to decompensation, it is reasonable to suspect aspiration
   pneumonia. Also, given her elevated PCO2 on ABGs, she has had increased
   CO2 retention for some time, and may have worsening underlying
   pulmonary disease. Post-intubation she did well on AC, and during
   rounds was able to tolerate PS. Will continue to wean as tolerated,
   keeping in mind her small reserve. Also in setting of high fever and
   SVT last night, it may not take much for her to decompensate. While the
   family is ok with intubation, they do not wish to escalate level of
   care so pressors and compressions would not be appropriate should she
   decompensate.
   - switch abx to flagyl to cover for aspiration PNA
   - wean to PS as tolerated today
   -monitor fluid status to avoid gross pulmonary edema, IV Lasix prn
   -nebs prn
   -will d/w pt and family plans options and status of resp support
   .
   # SVT: Overnight patient went from sinus tachycardia to SVT, ? atrial
   fibrillation w/PACs vs MAT. Unclear at this point if it could be a
   combination of both, in the setting of pulmonary disease and sepsis.
   Was not resolved with po toprol, IV lopressor and finally was started
   on amiodarone drip. She reverted in the morning back to NSR. It is
   possible she may have reverted on her own, given her significant
   improvement today. At this point, would attempt to restart her home
   beta blocker and take off amiodarone (not an ideal medication given her
   underlying pulmonary disease).
   -d/c
d amiodarone
   -monitor on telemetry
   -advanced toprol to 50mg po tid
   -if reverts to SVT reload with amiodarone
   .
   # s/p fall: no evidence of fracture. Complained of back pain during
   rounds this AM, which was present while she was on the wards. Will
   avoid more narcotics- currently she is written for bolus fentanyl,
   Tylenol and has lidocaine patch. Pain well controlled minus lidocaine
   patch
   - d/c lidocaine patch & Tylenol (do not want to mask fever if PNA does
   not respond to Flagyl)
   - fentanyl for pain now, but may need to wean if ready to extubate
   -PT
   .
   # DM: Good FSBG control. Currently NPO and on sliding scale.  Will
   adjust accordingly when tube feeds start
   .
   # ILD: Pulmonary following, resistant to steroids as outpatient
   treatment.  For now, treat for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure.
   - wean off ventilator if tolerates PS
   - treat PNA
   - alb/atrovent nebs
   -currently no role for steroids
   .
   # emesis: unclear cause. History of one dose of ultram written for on
   the floor however it is unclear if this was the cause of her emesis.
   Has not recurred overnight, not tender to palp on exam, LFTs normal.
   Tac level pending. CE negative.
   - OG in place
   - currently resolved, will start tube feeds today based on nutrition
   recs
   .
   # PTLD: no known active issues currently.
   - LFTs normal
   - continue tacrolimus
   .
   # HTN: significantly hypotensive overnight, held beta blocker. Will
   restart today given improvement.
   - On toprol 50mg TID
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue Levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history significant for interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), cor pulmonale, post-liver transplant, and myeloproliferative disorder. She was admitted to the hospital after a mechanical fall for pain control and is now in the intensive care unit (ICU) for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. She has had increased CO2 retention and may have worsening underlying pulmonary disease. The family does not wish to escalate the level of care, so pressors and compressions would not be appropriate if she decompensates.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to an inability to adequately ventilate and oxygenate. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the witnessed emesis prior to decompensation, there is a concern for aspiration pneumonia. The patient's small reserve for weaning off the ventilator and the elevated PCO2 on ABGs suggest that she may have increased CO2 retention for some time, which could indicate worsening underlying pulmonary disease.

3. SVT (Supraventricular Tachycardia): The patient experienced an episode of SVT overnight, which was not resolved with oral pro"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 112/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values show a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 61 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 337 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 40 mEq/L, and base excess (BE) of -14 mEq/L.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation. The ABG results show hypercapnia (elevated PaCO2) and hypoxemia (low PaO2), suggesting inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is below the normal range, indicating"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo female with PMH significant for ILD on home O2, diastolic CHF,
   cor pulmonale, s/p liver transplant on immunosuppression,
   post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab who
   was initially admitted to hospital after a mechanical fall for pain
   control who is now being transferred to the MICU for
   hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of emesis
   .
   # Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: In the setting of witnessed
   emesis prior to decompensation, it is reasonable to suspect aspiration
   pneumonia. Also, given her elevated PCO2 on ABGs, she has had increased
   CO2 retention for some time, and may have worsening underlying
   pulmonary disease. Post-intubation she did well on AC, and during
   rounds was able to tolerate PS. Will continue to wean as tolerated,
   keeping in mind her small reserve. Also in setting of high fever and
   SVT last night, it may not take much for her to decompensate. While the
   family is ok with intubation, they do not wish to escalate level of
   care so pressors and compressions would not be appropriate should she
   decompensate.
   - continue vanco, zosyn for aspiration pneumonia vs HAP
   - wean to PS as tolerated today, rest on AC
   -monitor fluid status to avoid gross pulmonary edema (lasix 40 IV is
   suspect flash)
   -nebs prn
   - consider adding on steroids if underlying disease appears to have
   worsened
   .
   # emesis: unclear cause. History of one dose of ultram written for on
   the floor however it is unclear if this was the cause of her emesis.
   Has not recurred overnight, not tender to palp on exam, LFTs normal.
   Tac level pending. CE negative.
   - OG in place
   - currently resolved but continue NPO for now
   .
   # SVT: Overnight patient went from sinus tachycardia to SVT, ? atrial
   fibrillation w/PACs vs MAT. Unclear at this point if it could be a
   combination of both, in the setting of pulmonary disease and sepsis.
   Was not resolved with po toprol, IV lopressor and finally was started
   on amiodarone drip. She reverted in the morning back to NSR. It is
   possible she may have reverted on her own, given her significant
   improvement today. At this point, would attempt to restart her home
   beta blocker and take off amiodarone (not an ideal medication given her
   underlying pulmonary disease).
   -d/c amiodarone
   -monitor on telemetry
   -restart home toprol 37.5mg po tid
   -if reverts to SVT reload with amiodarone
   .
   # s/p fall: no evidence of fracture. Complained of back pain during
   rounds this AM, which was present while she was on the wards. Will
   avoid more narcotics- currently she is written for bolus fentanyl,
   Tylenol and has lidocaine patch.
   - cont lidocaine patch, tylenol
   - fentanyl for pain now, but may need to wean if ready to extubate
   -PT
   .
   # DM: Good FSBG control. Currently NPO and on sliding scale.
   .
   # ILD: Pulmonary following, resistant to steroids as outpatient
   treatment.  For now, treat for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure.
   - wean off ventilator if tolerates PS
   - treat PNA
   - alb/atrovent nebs
   -currently no role for steroids
   .
   # PTLD: no known active issues currently.
   - LFTs normal
   - continue tacrolimus, level pending this AM
   .
   # HTN: significantly hypotensive overnight, held beta blocker. Will
   restart today given improvement.
   - Continue outpt metoprolol and monitor
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue Levothyroxine
   .
   # Access: PIV

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure, cor pulmonale, post-liver transplant on immunosuppression, and post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder who was admitted to the hospital for pain control after a mechanical fall. She is now in the MICU for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure, suspected aspiration pneumonia versus healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), and other medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's elevated PCO2 on ABGs indicates increased CO2 retention, which may be due to worsening underlying pulmonary disease. She will be weaned off the ventilator as tolerated, keeping in mind her small reserve. Close monitoring is necessary to avoid decompensation.

2. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the witnessed emesis prior to decompensation, there is a suspicion of aspiration pneumonia. She is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for treatment.

3. SVT and atrial fibrillation: The patient experienced an episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which could potentially progress to atrial fibrillation with premature atrial contractions (PACs) or multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT). She was treated with amiodarone drip but reverted back to normal sinus rhythm (NSR)"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo female with PMH significant for ILD on home O2, diastolic CHF,
   cor pulmonale, s/p liver transplant on immunosuppression,
   post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab who
   was initially admitted to hospital after a mechanical fall for pain
   control who is now being transferred to the MICU for
   hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of emesis
   .
   # Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: In the setting of witnessed
   emesis prior to decompensation, it is reasonable to suspect aspiration
   pneumonia. Also, given her elevated PCO2 on ABGs, she has had increased
   CO2 retention for some time, and may have worsening underlying
   pulmonary disease. Post-intubation she did well on AC, and during
   rounds was able to tolerate PS. Will continue to wean as tolerated,
   keeping in mind her small reserve. Also in setting of high fever and
   SVT last night, it may not take much for her to decompensate. While the
   family is ok with intubation, they do not wish to escalate level of
   care so pressors and compressions would not be appropriate should she
   decompensate.
   - switch abx to flagyl to cover for aspiration PNA
   - wean to PS as tolerated today
   -monitor fluid status to avoid gross pulmonary edema, IV Lasix prn
   -nebs prn
   -will d/w pt and family plans options and status of resp support
   .
   # SVT: Overnight patient went from sinus tachycardia to SVT, ? atrial
   fibrillation w/PACs vs MAT. Unclear at this point if it could be a
   combination of both, in the setting of pulmonary disease and sepsis.
   Was not resolved with po toprol, IV lopressor and finally was started
   on amiodarone drip. She reverted in the morning back to NSR. It is
   possible she may have reverted on her own, given her significant
   improvement today. At this point, would attempt to restart her home
   beta blocker and take off amiodarone (not an ideal medication given her
   underlying pulmonary disease).
   -d/c
d amiodarone
   -monitor on telemetry
   -advanced toprol to 50mg po tid
   -if reverts to SVT reload with amiodarone
   .
   # s/p fall: no evidence of fracture. Complained of back pain during
   rounds this AM, which was present while she was on the wards. Will
   avoid more narcotics- currently she is written for bolus fentanyl,
   Tylenol and has lidocaine patch. Pain well controlled minus lidocaine
   patch
   - d/c lidocaine patch & Tylenol (do not want to mask fever if PNA does
   not respond to Flagyl)
   - fentanyl for pain now, but may need to wean if ready to extubate
   -PT
   .
   # DM: Good FSBG control. Currently NPO and on sliding scale.  Will
   adjust accordingly when tube feeds start
   .
   # ILD: Pulmonary following, resistant to steroids as outpatient
   treatment.  For now, treat for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure.
   - wean off ventilator if tolerates PS
   - treat PNA
   - alb/atrovent nebs
   -currently no role for steroids
   .
   # emesis: unclear cause. History of one dose of ultram written for on
   the floor however it is unclear if this was the cause of her emesis.
   Has not recurred overnight, not tender to palp on exam, LFTs normal.
   Tac level pending. CE negative.
   - OG in place
   - currently resolved, will start tube feeds today based on nutrition
   recs
   .
   # PTLD: no known active issues currently.
   - LFTs normal
   - continue tacrolimus
   .
   # HTN: significantly hypotensive overnight, held beta blocker. Will
   restart today given improvement.
   - On toprol 50mg TID
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue Levothyroxine
   .
   # Access: PIV  - will plan for PICC eval and possible placement
   .
   # FEN: will switch to tube feeds, vitamin D, replete electrolytes prn
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Heparin SC 5000 tid, PPI
   - Bactrim M/W/F

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo female with PMH significant for ILD on home O2, diastolic CHF,
   cor pulmonale, s/p liver transplant on immunosuppression,
   post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab who
   was initially admitted to hospital after a mechanical fall for pain
   control who is now being transferred to the MICU for
   hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of emesis
   .
   # Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: In the setting of witnessed
   emesis prior to decompensation, it is reasonable to suspect aspiration
   pneumonia. Also, given her elevated PCO2 on ABGs, she has had increased
   CO2 retention for some time, and may have worsening underlying
   pulmonary disease. Post-intubation she did well on AC, and during
   rounds was able to tolerate PS. Will continue to wean as tolerated,
   keeping in mind her small reserve. Also in setting of high fever and
   SVT last night, it may not take much for her to decompensate. While the
   family is ok with intubation, they do not wish to escalate level of
   care so pressors and compressions would not be appropriate should she
   decompensates.
   - switch back to Vancomycin/Zosyn for 5 more days to cover for PNA
   - wean as tolerated today, eval for extubation
   -monitor fluid status to avoid gross pulmonary edema, IV Lasix prn
   -nebs prn
   -will d/w pt and family plans options and status of resp support
   .
   # SVT: Pt had sinus tachycardia to SVT on [**12-13**], ? of atrial
   fibrillation w/PACs vs MAT. Unclear at this point if it could be a
   combination of both, in the setting of pulmonary disease and sepsis.
   Was not resolved with po toprol, IV lopressor and finally was started
   on amiodarone drip. She reverted in the morning back to NSR. It is
   possible she may have reverted on her own, given her significant
   improvement today. At this point, would attempt to restart her home
   beta blocker and take off amiodarone (not an ideal medication given her
   underlying pulmonary disease).
   -d/c
d amiodarone [**12-14**]
   -monitor on telemetry
   -advanced toprol to 50mg po tid
   -if reverts to SVT reload with amiodarone
   .
   # s/p fall: no evidence of fracture. Complained of back pain during
   rounds this AM, which was present while she was on the wards. Will
   avoid more narcotics- currently she is written for bolus fentanyl,
   Tylenol and has lidocaine patch. Pain well controlled minus lidocaine
   patch.  Now pt with no c/o pain
 will d/c fetanyl and lidocaine.
   Tylenol PRN
   - PT following
   .
   # DM: Good FSBG control. Currently NPO and on sliding scale.  Will
   adjust accordingly when tube feeds start
   .
   # ILD: Pulmonary following, resistant to steroids as outpatient
   treatment.  For now, treat for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure.
   - wean off ventilator if tolerates PS
   - treat PNA
   - alb/atrovent nebs
   -currently no role for steroids
   .
   # Emesis: unclear cause. History of one dose of ultram written for on
   the floor however it is unclear if this was the cause of her emesis.
   Has not recurred overnight, not tender to palp on exam, LFTs normal.
   Tac level pending. CE negative.
   - OG in place
   - currently resolved, will start tube feeds today based on nutrition
   recs
   .
   # PTLD: no known active issues currently.
   - LFTs normal
   - continue tacrolimus
   .
   # HTN: significantly hypotensive overnight, held beta blocker. Will
   restart today given improvement.
   - On toprol 50mg TID
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue Levothyroxine
   .
   # Access: PIV  - PICC eval and possible placement today
   .
   # FEN: will start tube feeds if not intubated today, replete
   electrolytes prn
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Heparin SC 5000 tid, PPI

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), cor pulmonale, a history of liver transplant, and post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder treated with CHOP and rituximab. The patient was initially admitted for pain control due to a mechanical fall and is now in the MICU for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of emesis.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has increased CO2 retention and may have worsening underlying pulmonary disease. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and will be weaned as tolerated.
2. Suspected aspiration pneumonia: The patient had witnessed emesis prior to decompensation, which raises suspicion for aspiration pneumonia. She is being treated with antibiotics to cover for possible pneumonia.
3. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): The patient had a sinus tachycardia that progressed to SVT, which was initially managed with propranolol, lopressor, and amiodarone drip. She reverted back to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) in the morning. She will be monitored on telemetry and advanced to metoprolol 50mg po tid. If she reverts to SVT, amiodarone will be reloaded.

   73 yo female with PMH significant for ILD on home O2, diastolic CHF,
   cor pulmonale, s/p liver transplant on immunosuppression,
   post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab who
   was initially admitted to hospital after a mechanical fall for pain
   control who is now being transferred to the MICU for
   hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of emesis
   .
   # Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: In the setting of witnessed
   emesis prior to decompensation, it is reasonable to suspect aspiration
   pneumonia. Will continue to wean as tolerated, keeping in mind her
   small reserve. Has been doing very well on minimal PS, will attempt to
   decrease to 5/0 today. If she does well, might need to consider trach
   placement.  Having thick secretions which may be barrier to extubation.
   - continue Vancomycin/Zosyn (last day [**12-19**])
   - wean as tolerated today, eval for extubation
   - IV Lasix prn
   -nebs prn
   -will d/w pt and family plans options and status of resp support

   # SVT: Pt had sinus tachycardia to SVT on [**12-13**], ? of atrial
   fibrillation w/PACs vs MAT. Has resolved since.
   -d/c
d amiodarone [**12-14**]
   -monitor on telemetry
   - toprol to 50mg po tid
   -if reverts to SVT reload with amiodarone
   .
   # s/p fall: no evidence of fracture. Pain well controlled minus
   lidocaine patch.  Now pt with no c/o pain.  Tylenol PRN
   - PT following
   .
   # DM: Good FSBG control. Currently NPO and on sliding scale.  Will
   adjust accordingly when tube feeds start
   .
   # ILD: Pulmonary following, resistant to steroids as outpatient
   treatment.  For now, treat for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure.
   - wean off ventilator if tolerates PS
   - treat PNA
   - alb/atrovent nebs
   .
   # Emesis: unclear cause. History of one dose of ultram written for on
   the floor however it is unclear if this was the cause of her emesis.
   Has not recurred overnight, not tender to palp on exam, LFTs normal.
   Tac level pending. CE negative.
   - OG in place
   - currently resolved, will start tube feeds today based on nutrition
   recs
   .
   # PTLD: no known active issues currently.
   - LFTs normal
   - continue tacrolimus
   .
   # HTN: significantly hypotensive overnight, held beta blocker. Will
   restart today given improvement.
   - On toprol 50mg TID

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a significant medical history including interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), cor pulmonale, post-liver transplant on immunosuppression, and a history of myeloproliferative disorder treated with CHOP and rituximab. The patient was initially admitted for pain control after a mechanical fall and is now in the MICU for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure suspected to be due to aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 113/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular pulses assessed, no skin assessment, and neurologic assessment is not available due to intubation.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, platelet count of 42 K/uL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, troponin-t of 0.01, blood glucose levels ranging from 109-190 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo female with PMH significant for ILD on home O2, diastolic CHF,
   cor pulmonale, s/p liver transplant on immunosuppression,
   post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder s/p CHOP and rituximab who
   was initially admitted to hospital after a mechanical fall for pain
   control who is now being transferred to the MICU for
   hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of emesis
   .
   # Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure: In the setting of witnessed
   emesis prior to decompensation, it is reasonable to suspect aspiration
   pneumonia. Also, given her elevated PCO2 on ABGs, she has had increased
   CO2 retention for some time, and may have worsening underlying
   pulmonary disease. Post-intubation she did well on AC, and during
   rounds was able to tolerate PS. Will continue to wean as tolerated,
   keeping in mind her small reserve. Also in setting of high fever and
   SVT last night, it may not take much for her to decompensate. While the
   family is ok with intubation, they do not wish to escalate level of
   care so pressors and compressions would not be appropriate should she
   decompensates.
   - switch back to Vancomycin/Zosyn for 5 more days to cover for PNA
   - wean as tolerated today, eval for extubation
   -monitor fluid status to avoid gross pulmonary edema, IV Lasix prn
   -nebs prn
   -will d/w pt and family plans options and status of resp support
   .
   # SVT: Pt had sinus tachycardia to SVT on [**12-13**], ? of atrial
   fibrillation w/PACs vs MAT. Unclear at this point if it could be a
   combination of both, in the setting of pulmonary disease and sepsis.
   Was not resolved with po toprol, IV lopressor and finally was started
   on amiodarone drip. She reverted in the morning back to NSR. It is
   possible she may have reverted on her own, given her significant
   improvement today. At this point, would attempt to restart her home
   beta blocker and take off amiodarone (not an ideal medication given her
   underlying pulmonary disease).
   -d/c
d amiodarone [**12-14**]
   -monitor on telemetry
   -advanced toprol to 50mg po tid
   -if reverts to SVT reload with amiodarone
   .
   # s/p fall: no evidence of fracture. Complained of back pain during
   rounds this AM, which was present while she was on the wards. Will
   avoid more narcotics- currently she is written for bolus fentanyl,
   Tylenol and has lidocaine patch. Pain well controlled minus lidocaine
   patch.  Now pt with no c/o pain
 will d/c fetanyl and lidocaine.
   Tylenol PRN
   - PT following
   .
   # DM: Good FSBG control. Currently NPO and on sliding scale.  Will
   adjust accordingly when tube feeds start
   .
   # ILD: Pulmonary following, resistant to steroids as outpatient
   treatment.  For now, treat for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure.
   - wean off ventilator if tolerates PS
   - treat PNA
   - alb/atrovent nebs
   -currently no role for steroids
   .
   # Emesis: unclear cause. History of one dose of ultram written for on
   the floor however it is unclear if this was the cause of her emesis.
   Has not recurred overnight, not tender to palp on exam, LFTs normal.

   # PTLD: no known active issues currently.

   # Hypothyroidism: Continue Levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), cor pulmonale, post-liver transplant on immunosuppression, and post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder who was admitted to the hospital for pain control after a mechanical fall. She is currently in the MICU for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of emesis. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 113/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the witnessed emesis prior to decompensation, there is a suspicion of aspiration pneumonia. This could lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis.

2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has elevated PCO2 on ABGs, indicating increased CO2 retention. This may be due to worsening underlying pulmonary disease or inadequate ventilation.

3. SVT (Supraventricular Tachycardia): The patient experienced a sinus tachycardia that progressed to SVT. It is unclear if it was atrial fibrillation with PACs or MAT. The patient was treated with pro"

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of interstitial lung disease (ILD), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), cor pulmonale, and post-transplant myeloproliferative disorder. She was initially admitted for pain control and mechanical fall and is now in the MICU for hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure possibly due to aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 106/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on face tent. She is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 286 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) result of pH 7.46, PaCO2 of 50 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 277.

The patient has been weaned off invasive ventilation but still requires supplemental oxygen. She has crackles in her lungs, diminished breath sounds, and a history of emesis. Her neurologic examination shows altered mental status (AXO3).
