   [**Hospital1 54**] and d/c to rehab p/w altered mental status of one days duration
   after recent d/c for AMS on [**2112-8-8**].
   .
   # AMS: Seemingly rapid change over one day history. Per discussion with
   daughter, patient had fluctuating mental status over 24 hour period
   with associated hallucinations. Had several episodes of a similar
   presentation in the past. Two for hypercarbia, one for hypercalcemia.
   It has also come to light that the patient received one dose of
   levaquin over the past weekend at his rehab, which has been described
   to cause psychosis.  He is currently alert with less rigidity and
   myoclonus.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male who presented with altered mental status, myoclonic movements, and hypercarbic respiratory failure after intubation. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, recent pulmonary embolism, and recent cerebrovascular accident. He underwent a subtotal colectomy for large lower gastrointestinal bleed and had a long hospital course at Hospital1 before being discharged to rehabilitation, where he developed altered mental status after recent discharge for altered mental status on 08/08/2012.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AMS (Altered Mental Status): The patient has experienced multiple episodes of AMS in the past, associated with conditions such as hypercarbia and hypercalcemia. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's mental status closely.
2. Ventilatory failure: The patient became hypercarbic in the setting of AMS but has resolved since intubation. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and likely extubation later in the day. However, the patient will remain intubated for bronchoscopy to examine the chronically collapsed left lower lobe with associated effusion.
3. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient is likely experiencing pre-renal acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine level of 1.1-1.4. Aggressive intravenous fluids and close monitoring of urine output are recommended.
4. J-tube site"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male who presented with altered mental status (AMS), myoclonic movements, and hypercarbic respiratory failure after intubation. The patient has a history of an old cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The recent events include a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing no change from prior, an electroencephalogram (EEG) read pending, and a lumbar puncture (LP) performed with mildly elevated protein, 2 white blood cells (WBC), and 2 red blood cells (RBC). The patient also had a computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis done, which revealed a stable pleural effusion and stranding near the gastric tube (G-tube) site. Sedation was changed to propofol, and the patient received antibiotics, including piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient has multiple infusions, including propofol and heparin sodium for prophylaxis, as well as other medications. The review of systems remains unchanged except for AMS. The flow sheet data shows stable vital signs, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results. Physical examination findings are not assessed in several areas. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there are some abnormalities in liver function tests and electrolytes. The assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein throm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male who presents with altered mental status, myoclonic movements, and hypercarbic respiratory failure after intubation. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, recent pulmonary embolism, recent cerebrovascular accident, and subtotal colectomy for large lower gastrointestinal bleed. The patient was previously hospitalized at Hospital1 and discharged to rehabilitation, where he developed altered mental status of one day's duration after recent discharge for altered mental status on August 8th.

The patient's current condition includes seemingly rapid change over one day history, fluctuating mental status over 24-hour period with associated hallucinations, episodes of similar presentation in the past for hypercarbia and hypercalcemia. The patient also received one dose of levaquin over the past weekend, which has been described to cause psychosis.

The patient is currently alert with less rigidity and myoclonus. The plan includes following neuro recommendations, adding on paraneoplastic antibody to serum/CSF, and following serum protein electrophoresis on CSF, possibly oligoclonal bands.

The patient experienced ventilatory failure and became hypercarbic in the setting of altered mental status but has resolved since intubation. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and likely extubation later today. The patient will remain intubated for bronchoscopy to examine chronically collapsed left lower l"

   No leukocytosis on admission. CXR stable from prior but with large left
   pleural effusion that was tapped on prior admission with resultant
   improvement in respiratory status.
   - Infectious work up, blood, stool, urine and sputum cultures
   - f/u repeat labs, check B12, TSH, folate
   - Tx hypercarbia and ARF as below
   - Neuro to follow, recommends EEG, MRI.
   .
   # Respiratory acidosis: Likely increasing hypoventilation in setting of
   AMS, myoclonic jerks may be manifestation of hypercarbia. Gas improved
   when pt awoken for exam/IVs.  Pt recently failed video swallow,
   demonstrating near constant aspiration, had G-tube placed for feeds.
   Pt still at risk for aspiration, may be chronically aspirating into
   collapsed LLL with interval worsening of parapneumonic effusion.
   -Trial of Bipap (as pt has responded to this in the past) to improve
   hypercarbia, if pt not improved will consider intubation
   -treat HAP/aspiration PNA with vanc/zosyn
   -sputum cultures
   -frequent suctioning/mouth care/chest PT

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, recent pulmonary embolism, and recent cerebrovascular accident. He underwent a subtotal colectomy for large lower gastrointestinal bleed and has had a prolonged hospital stay at Hospital1.

The patient was discharged to rehabilitation but returned with altered mental status after recent discharge for altered mental status on August 8, 2012. The patient's current complaints include altered mental status, myoclonic movements, and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The 24-hour events include a magnetic resonance imaging that showed no change from prior, an old cerebrovascular accident. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is pending, and a lumbar puncture was performed, revealing mildly elevated protein, 2 white blood cells (WBC), and 2 red blood cells (RBC).

A computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis was done, showing a stable pleural effusion and stranding near the gastrostomy (G-tube) site. The infection control team is requesting wound care recommendations.

Regarding medications, the patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin on August 22, 2012, at 03:23 PM, followed by Vancomycin at 06:00 PM. The dose of Vancomycin was increased to Hospital1 as renal function improved. Piperacillin/T"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and a history of throat cancer resection. He presented with myoclonus, increased tone, and visual hallucinations, which led to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has a complicated medical history, including a massive gastrointestinal bleed, subtotal colectomy, pneumonia, respiratory failure, peritonitis, and recent hospitalization for altered mental status with pleural effusion.

The patient was initially intubated due to poor mental status and placed on BIPAP. He was then transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for further management. His current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 132/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with PSV/SBT ventilation.

The patient's physical examination revealed dilated right pupil, heart rhythm with regular rate and rhythm, clear lungs anteriorly, and mild erythema at the G-tube site. Neurological examination showed normal tone and rare left hand twitching.

Laboratory results indicated elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, glucose, and liver function tests were within normal limits. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis showed respiratory acidosis with"

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, recent pulmonary embolism, recent cerebrovascular accident, and a recent subtotal colectomy for large lower gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been admitted to the hospital multiple times and discharged to rehabilitation. The patient presented with altered mental status of one day's duration after recent discharge for altered mental status.

On admission, the patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. A bronchoscopy was performed, which showed macroscopically unremarkable results. Thoracocentesis was attempted but deferred due to the small size of the pleural effusion. The patient experienced carbon dioxide accumulation and desaturation overnight, so he was put on CPAP with good results. However, there were transient desats in the 50s with hypopnea in the early morning, prompting replacement of CPAP.

The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including Piperacillin-Tazobactam (Zosyn), Vancomycin, and Piperacillin. He is also receiving Heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98.5°F)
- Heart rate: 90 bpm (79-104)
- Blood pressure: 159/59 mmHg (96/42-170/65)
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute ("

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on 08/23/2112 at 01:45 PM, which was macroscopically unremarkable. The patient was subsequently placed on invasive ventilation but had to be stopped due to concerns of CO2 accumulation. A thoracocentesis was attempted but deferred due to a small pleural effusion. The patient experienced transient desaturations in the 50s overnight and was placed on CPAP with good results. In the early morning, the patient was removed from CPAP and experienced transient desaturations in the 50s with hypopnea, so CPAP was replaced.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics, Piperacillin, was administered on 08/22/2112 at 03:23 PM. Vancomycin was given on 08/23/2112 at 08:48 PM, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) was started on 08/24/2112 at 12:00 AM. The patient is receiving prophylactic Heparin Sodium and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7 C (98 F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 159"

   after recent d/c for AMS on [**2112-8-8**].
   .
   # AMS: Seemingly rapid change over one day history. Per discussion with
   daughter, patient had fluctuating mental status over 24 hour period
   with associated hallucinations. Had several episodes of a similar
   presentation in the past. Two for hypercarbia, one for hypercalcemia.
   It has also come to light that the patient received one dose of
   levaquin over the past weekend at his rehab, which has been described
   to cause psychosis.  He is currently alert with less rigidity and
   myoclonus.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, recent pulmonary embolism, and recent cerebrovascular accident. He underwent a subtotal colectomy for large lower gastrointestinal bleed three months ago and was discharged to rehabilitation, where he developed altered mental status. The patient presented to the emergency department with a seemingly rapid change in mental status over one day, associated with hallucinations. He has had similar episodes in the past, including two for hypercarbia and one for hypercalcemia. It was also discovered that the patient received one dose of levaquin over the weekend, which can cause psychosis. Currently, the patient is alert with less rigidity and myoclonus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilatory failure: The patient became hypercarbic in the setting of altered mental status but has resolved since intubation. He is doing well on pressure support and is planned for a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and likely extubation later today. However, he will remain intubated for bronchoscopy to examine the chronically collapsed left lower lobe with associated effusion.
2. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient likely has pre-renal acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine around 1.1-1.4. Aggressive intravenous fluid administration and bolus fluids as needed for urine output less than 50/hour are recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
    82 yo M with DM, AFib, HTN, throat CA s/p resection 20 years ago, who
   had a massive GI bleed this spring with subtotal colectomy complicated
   by pneumonia and respiratory failure, peritonitis, who was most
   recently discharged to rehab on [**2112-8-8**] after hospitalization for AMS
   with pleural effusion.  Presented with mycolonus, increased tone and
   visual hallucinations with subsequent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   1)Hypercarbic respiratory failure-Unclear etiology.  Able to wean to
   PSV, check SBT today with follow up gas. - will check formal PFTs with
   MIP/MEEP and VC supine and sitting up -Will need Sleep study to see if
   there is a component of central apnea post CVA
   2)Myoclonus-Will consider sending  paraneoplastic panel if CSF with
   oligoclonal bands or IgG is positive-F/U  EEG-Question visual
   hallucinations related to levaquin-Obtain OSH records
    3)Pleural effusion-Exudative based on past taps-Will repeat tap, send
   studies and cytology -Obtain OSH records from previous taps to follow
   up if cytology has been negative, no cyto on last tap here
   4)Gtube placement-F/U IR recs but this was a very complicated g tube-
   would involve DR [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**] in any decision before pulling it/treating
   through it.  For now will continue abx course
   -Continue antibiotics vanc/Zosyn 7 day course
   5)Wound care-Wound care consult for abdominal wound looks CDI with
   granulation tissue
   6)HTN-Continue hydroclorathiazide.
   7)Hypercalcemia-Noted at OSH will obtain records per family he received
   pamidronate for hypercalcemia.-Will check 25 vit D, [**1-22**] Vit D, PTH and
   PTrP
   8)FEN: Will restart tube feeds today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and throat cancer status post resection 20 years ago. The patient had a massive gastrointestinal bleed this spring with subsequent subtotal colectomy, complicated by pneumonia and respiratory failure, peritonitis, and was most recently discharged to rehab on [**2112-8-8**]. The patient presented with myoclonus, increased tone, and visual hallucinations, leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and transferred to the MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypercarbic respiratory failure - Unclear etiology. The patient's ability to breathe is affected, resulting in increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood.
2) Myoclonus - The patient is experiencing sudden muscle twitches, which may have various underlying causes.
3) Pleural effusion - The patient has an accumulation of fluid in the pleural space around the lungs, potentially due to an infection.
4) G-tube placement - The patient has a feeding tube inserted into the stomach, which may require further evaluation and management.
5) Wound care - The patient's abdominal wound shows signs of infection and poor healing.
6) Hypertension - The patient's high blood pressure needs to be managed and controlled.
7) Hypercalcemia - The patient has high levels of calcium in the blood, which requires further investigation"

   Assessment and Plan
    82 yo M with DM, AFib, HTN, throat CA s/p resection 20 years ago, who
   had a massive GI bleed this spring with subtotal colectomy complicated
   by pneumonia and respiratory failure, peritonitis, who was most
   recently discharged to rehab on [**2112-8-8**] after hospitalization for AMS
   with pleural effusion.  Presented with mycolonus, increased tone and
   visual hallucinations with subsequent hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   1)Hypercarbic respiratory failure-Unclear etiology.  Able to wean to
   PSV, check SBT today with follow up gas. - will check formal PFTs with
   MIP/MEEP and VC supine and sitting up -Will need Sleep study to see if
   there is a compenent of central apnea post CVA
   2)Myoclonus-Will consider sending  paraneoplastic panel if CSF with
   oligoclonal bands or IgG is positive-F/U  EEG-Question visual
   hallucinations related to levaquin-Obtain OSH records
    3)Pleural effusion-Exudative based on past taps-Will repeat tap, send
   studies and cytology -Obtain OSH records from previous taps to follow
   up if cytology has been negative, no cyto on last tap here
   4)Gtube placement-F/U IR recs but this was a very complicated g tube-
   would involve DR [**Last Name (STitle) 1924**] in any decision before pulling it/treating
   through it.
   -Continue antibiotics vanc/Zosyn 7 day course
   5)Wound care-Wound care consult for abdominal wound looks CDI with

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and throat cancer status post resection 20 years ago. He presented to the ICU with twitching, visual hallucinations, and subsequent hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes a massive gastrointestinal bleed this spring with subtotal colectomy, complicated by pneumonia and respiratory failure, peritonitis, and most recently discharged to rehab on [**2112-8-8**] after hospitalization for altered mental status with pleural effusion.

24-hour events include desaturation overnight and CO2 up to 49, requiring a trial of CPAP which responded with decreased CO2. The patient was initially intubated due to poor mental status but extubated on [**2112-8-23**] at 02:30 PM.

Medications include Piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications.

Physical examination findings include dilated right pupil, intubated, heart rhythm with regular rate and regular rhythm, lungs clear to auscultation anteriorly, abdomen soft, non-tender, and non-distended with a gastrostomy tube site showing mild erythema. Neurological examination reveals normal tone with rare myoclonus in the left hand.

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and a history of throat cancer resection. He presented with twitching, visual hallucinations, and subsequent hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's recent medical history includes a massive gastrointestinal bleed, subtotal colectomy, pneumonia, respiratory failure, peritonitis, and hospitalization for altered mental status with pleural effusion. 

Based on the progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient had a successful extubation but experienced hypercarbic overnight. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the respiratory failure, which could be due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central hypoventilation, or neuromuscular weakness.

2. Myoclonus: The patient presented with twitching and visual hallucinations. An EEG has been ordered to investigate further, and a paraneoplastic panel will be sent if cerebrospinal fluid with oligoclonal bands or IgG is positive.

3. Pleural effusion: The patient has an exudative pleural effusion based on past taps. A repeated tap at the bedside has been performed, and cytology is pending.

4. G-tube placement: The patient has a gastrostomy tube that was placed due to complicated gastrostomy tube placement. Antibiotics have been prescribed, and the patient will continue on a "

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient underwent thoracentesis on 08/24/2112 and had a possible small apical pneumothorax but was stable on follow-up chest imaging. The effusion is exudative, and the patient's PTH level is normal. The patient started on HCTZ for hypertension and tried CPAP during the day for hypoventilation during napping with desats, but did not tolerate CPAP overnight with stable oxygen saturation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumothorax: The patient had a possible small apical pneumothorax after thoracentesis. This can potentially lead to respiratory distress or failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure was recorded as 120/63 mmHg, indicating hypotension. This can be a concern for inadequate organ perfusion and may require further evaluation and treatment.
3. Hypoventilation: The patient experienced hypoventilation during napping and required CPAP support. This suggests the possibility of underlying respiratory muscle weakness or fatigue, which can be a complication in critically ill patients.
4. Allergic Reaction: Although no known drug allergies are reported, it is important to monitor the patient for any potential allergic reactions to medications or other substances.
5. Infection: The patient is on multiple antibiotics, indicating the presence of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, recent pulmonary embolism, and recent cerebrovascular accident. He underwent a subtotal colectomy for large lower gastrointestinal bleed three months ago and has been hospitalized at Hospital1 54 before being discharged to rehab. The patient presented with altered mental status and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has since resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient previously experienced hypercarbic respiratory failure, which resolved but the cause is still unclear. Monitoring while sleeping and encouraging CPAP use is advised.
2. Pleural effusion: The patient has chronic, recurring pleural effusion on the left side, making it unusual. The fluid is exudative, and 1.1L was removed on 08/24/2112. Potential malignancy or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) should be considered, and further tests such as bronchoscopy and cytology are pending.
3. J-tube site cellulitis: The patient has evidence of stranding around the J-tube site on CT scan, suggesting possible infection. Wound care and continuing antibiotics are recommended.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient likely has pre-renal ARF, with baseline creatinine levels around 1.1-1.4. Holding nephrotoxic medications is advised.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, recent pulmonary embolism, recent cerebrovascular accident, and subsequent subtotal colectomy for large lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient was admitted to the hospital and later transferred to a rehabilitation facility, where he developed altered mental status and hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current condition includes a possible small apical pneumothorax, which is stable on follow-up chest imaging despite intermittent use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The patient did not tolerate CPAP overnight but had stable oxygen saturation levels. An arterial line was placed and later stopped. 

The patient also has a pleural effusion that was found to be exudative. A thoracentesis was performed, and cytology is pending. The cause of the patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is still unclear, as the patient becomes hypopneic and desaturates while sleeping with a rise in carbon dioxide levels. 

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure (ARF) likely due to pre-renal causes. The patient's baseline creatinine levels have not returned to normal. Nephrotoxic medications have been withheld. 

There is a concern for possible cellulitis at the site of a feeding tube (J-tube) with evidence of stranding on a CT scan around the site. An ostomy care surgical consult has been recommended. 

The patient's diabetes is stable"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, recent pulmonary embolism, recent cerebrovascular accident, and previous subtotal colectomy. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

The assessment and plan section of the note mentions several concerns:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's head CT and MRI were unremarkable for any new neurologic process, and lumbar puncture (LP) was unrevealing. There is no clear source of infection or metabolic derangement identified other than hypercarbia. The theory suggests that the patient's progressive accumulation of carbon dioxide due to chronic hypoventilation may be the culprit. The plan includes continued CPAP, follow-up serum protein electrophoresis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sleep study, and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to evaluate for a neuromuscular component of hypoventilation.
2. Pleural effusion: The patient has had chronic, recurring pleural effusion, which is unusual in location as isolated on the left. It is difficult to tie together with possible diaphragmatic paralysis or potential malignancy. A bronchoscopic procedure was performed yesterday, and cytology results are pending. Thoracentesis with ultrasound guidance by interventional radiology (IP) today will be followed up to determine transudative vs exudative"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and a history of throat cancer resection. He presented with twitching, visual hallucinations, and subsequent hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient underwent a thoracentesis and was intubated due to poor mental status. He has been on various antibiotics and medications, including HCTZ and metoprolol for hypertension. The patient's recent history includes a massive GI bleed, subtotal colectomy, pneumonia, respiratory failure, peritonitis, and hospitalization for altered mental status with pleural effusion. He was most recently discharged to rehab on [**2112-8-8**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient was successfully extubated but experienced hypercarbic overnight, indicating a possible underlying condition such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central hypoventilation, or neuromuscular weakness. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, including a sleep study while in the house and formal pulmonary function tests (PFTs) with maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum expiratory pressure (MEEP), and vital capacity (VC) in both supine and sitting positions.
2) Myoclonus: The patient is experiencing twitching and visual hallucinations, which could be related to a paraneoplastic syndrome. A paraneoplastic panel should be sent if cerebrosp"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and throat cancer status post resection 20 years ago. He presented to the ICU with myoclonus, increased tone, and visual hallucinations. He had a massive GI bleed this spring with subsequent colectomy, complicated by pneumonia and respiratory failure, peritonitis, and was recently discharged to rehab. The patient's current presentation includes twitching and visual hallucinations, leading to intubation and transfer to the MICU. He has been doing well after thoracentesis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's overnight hypercarbic levels suggest the possibility of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central hypoventilation, or neuromuscular weakness. Further investigation, including formal pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and sleep study, is recommended.
2. Myoclonus: A paraneoplastic panel should be sent, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for oligoclonal bands or IgG positivity. An EEG should also be performed to evaluate the visual hallucinations.
3. Pleural effusion: The effusion is exudative based on previous taps. A repeat tap at the bedside was performed, and the cytochrome pending.
4. G-tube placement: The patient requires an IR consult for further recommendations regarding the g-tube placement.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and a history of throat cancer resection 20 years ago. The patient had a massive gastrointestinal bleed this spring with subsequent subtotal colectomy, complicated by pneumonia and respiratory failure, peritonitis, and was most recently discharged to rehab on [**2112-8-8**]. 

The patient presented with myoclonus, increased tone, and visual hallucinations, which led to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was successfully extubated but experienced hypercarbia overnight, raising the question of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) versus central respiratory depression versus hypoventilation. The plan is to watch for apnea and change to BIPAP if necessary. A sleep study will also be conducted while in the house. 

The patient's pleural effusion was found to be exudative, and a thoracentesis was performed. A small apical pneumothorax was discovered, which is resolving. The patient is currently doing well after the thoracentesis. 

Regarding the gastrointestinal tube placement, further imaging recommendations will be obtained, and antibiotics have been prescribed. Wound care is also recommended for the abdominal wound, which appears to have Clostridium difficile infection with granulation tissue. 

The patient's hypertension is being managed with hydrochlorothiazide and metoprolol. Additionally, the patient has hyper"
