","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile colitis. He presented to the emergency department with worsening hypoxia and mental status at home, and is now also hypotensive. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to resistant pneumonia, and has been receiving antibiotics in the emergency department. His chest X-ray shows worsening pneumonia in the right lower lobe. The patient's current condition includes atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and potential sources of infection such as a central line and Clostridium difficile. Treatment plans include continuing current antibiotics, sending blood cultures, sputum culture, and stool for Clostridium difficile. The patient will receive IV fluids and vasopressor support as needed, and will have serial chest X-rays and follow-up cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis could progress to organ dysfunction, particularly in the lungs, kidneys, or liver.
2. Respiratory failure: Given the worsening pneumonia and current hypoxia, there is a risk of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
3. Septic shock: If the patient's hypotension does not respond to fluid resuscitation, septic shock may develop, necessitating further management with vasopressors and other supportive measures.
4. Clostridium difficile infection: Although the patient's"

","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile infection, hepatitis C, bipolar disorder, and recent pneumonia who was discharged on June 21st on Vancomycin and Meropenem for pneumonia. He was found by family to be fatigued, warm, and with gray skin. He was brought to the emergency department where he had a temperature of 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit, initial blood pressure of 150/80, tachycardia of 100 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on non-rebreather mask. His lactate level was elevated at 2.6, and a chest X-ray showed a coiled PICC line that was subsequently pulled. In the emergency department, his blood pressure dropped, and a right central venous line was placed. Four liters of normal saline were given, which increased his blood pressure to 95-100. The patient has been receiving intravenous antibiotics since being sick on Vancomycin and Zosyn, and Vancomycin has been redosed.

The patient's 24-hour events include improved oxygen requirement to 5 liters nasal cannula (off face tent) and no pressor requirements. The chest X-ray shows increased opacification in the right middle lobe and left lower lobe. Allergies include Pneumovax 23 (Injection) (Pneumococcal 23-valent [First Name] polysaccharide vaccine).

The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin on June 24th at 9:00 PM (Day 2), and Meropenem on June 25th at 2:53 AM (Day 2). Other ICU medications include Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis) started on June 25th at 5:00 AM. The patient's other medications include Flecainide, digoxin, and changes to his medical and family history are unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.7 degrees Celsius (101.7 degrees Fahrenheit), current temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius (100.1 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 107 beats per minute (with a normal range of 74-118), blood pressure of 105/69 (with a normal range of 75-139/46-86) millimeters of mercury, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 12-23), and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and his central venous pressure is 11 millimeters of mercury (with a normal range of 7-17).

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 4,140 mL since 12 AM, including 418 mL of PO and 2,890 mL of IV fluids. His total output includes 2,230 mL of urine and 370 mL of blood products. The patient's respiratory support includes delivery of oxygen through a face tent and an oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination is described in detail below.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.9 thousand cells per microliter (with a normal range of 5.8-10.5), hemoglobin level of 9.2 grams per deciliter (with a normal range of 13.5-17.5 for men), platelet count of 150 thousand cells per microliter (with a normal range of 150-450), blood urea nitrogen level of 27 milligrams per deciliter (with a normal range of 7-20), creatinine level of 0.7 milligrams per deciliter (with a normal range of 0.6-1.2), and glucose level of 87 milligrams per deciliter (with a normal range of 70-99). Other lab results are provided in detail.

The patient's assessment and plan include sepsis, likely secondary to a line infection given his hypotension after PICC line removal. COPD and pneumonia treatment failure are also potential contributors. The patient will continue on Vancomycin and Tobramycin for now. His hypoxemic respiratory distress is multifactorial, including pulmonary edema after resuscitation, COPD, and underlying pneumonia. He will receive atrovent every six hours, and empiric antibiotics will be given. The patient's atrial fibrillation will be managed with digoxin and Flecainide, and his blood pressure will be controlled with Lopressor for a goal systolic blood pressure of less than 110. The patient's neurologic status will be monitored, and he will receive Tylenol for fever. His dysphagia diet will remain unchanged. The patient has multiple lines, including a right internal jugular central venous line and three peripheral intravenous lines. He will receive heparin subcutaneously for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and pneumococcal vaccination. The patient's family is a healthcare provider. He will be dispositioned to the floor tonight if he continues to be hemodynamically stable."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yr old man with recent PNA returns with sepsis.  Overall story
   suspicious for line infection given his HoTN came only after PICC
   removal.  COPD and PNA treatment failure also potential contributors.
   1. Sepsis:
   Continue Vanco and [**Last Name (un) **] for now.  Hold [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9024**] goal -1L
   TTE to look for vegetations, eval murmur heard on exam.
   2. Hypoxemic Resp Distress:
   Likely multifactorial: pulm edema after resuscitation, COPD, underlying
   PNA.
   Standing atrovent q6.  Empiric ABX
   3. Afib:
   -continue with Dig and Flecanide (home meds)
   -give lopressor for goal SBP<110
   4. Neuro:
   -tylenol for fever
   -continue depakote, olanzipine.
   5. GI:
   -Dysphagia diet.

","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile infection, Hepatitis C, bipolar disorder, and recent pneumonia who was discharged on June 21st on Vancomycin and Meropenem for pneumonia. He was found by family to be fatigued, warm, and with gray skin. He was brought to the emergency department where he was found to have a temperature of 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit, initial blood pressure of 150/80 mmHg, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on NRB, and lactate level of 2.6. A chest X-ray showed a coiled PICC line that was pulled. In the emergency department, his blood pressure dropped, and a right central venous line was placed. He received four liters of normal saline with an improvement in his blood pressure to 95-100. The patient has been receiving Vancomycin and Meropenem since the emergency department.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's oxygen requirement improved to 5 liters by nasal cannula (off face tent). No pressor requirements were needed. The chest X-ray shows increased opacification in the right middle lobe and left lower lobe. The patient has allergies to Pneumovax 23 (Injection) and has received his last dose of antibiotics, Vancomycin, on the night of June 24"

The patient is a [**Male First Name (un)**] with a history of allergies to Pneumovax 23 (Injection) and hypotension. They were admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.7°F, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/69 mmHg to 139/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is currently receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and various other medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except as noted below. The patient's blood cultures were obtained on [**2186-6-24**] at 09:30 AM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe immune response to an infection. If not properly managed, sepsis can lead to organ failure, respiratory distress, and even death.

2. Pneumonia: The patient also has pneumonia, which is an infection in the lungs. If left untreated or inadequately treated, pneumonia can worsen and lead to respiratory failure and other complications.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm disorder characterized by"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile infection, hepatitis, bipolar disorder, and recent pneumonia who was discharged on June 21st on Vancomycin and Zosyn for pneumonia. The patient was found by family to be fatigued, warm, and with gray skin. He was brought to the emergency department where he had a temperature of 101.4 degrees Fahrenheit, initial blood pressure of 150/80, heart rate of 100 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 99% on NRB (weaned to 6 liters but saturation dropped to 80). Lactate level was 2.6, and a chest X-ray showed a coiled PICC line that was pulled. In the emergency department, his blood pressure dropped, and a right central venous line was placed. Four liters of normal saline were given, which increased his systolic blood pressure to 95-100. ID consultations were made since he was sick on Vancomycin and Zosyn, and Vancomycin was redosed. 

Yesterday's events include:
- No need for pressors.
- Rigor x1 overnight -> Demerol.
- Oxygen weaned to 4 liters.
- Some verbal hesitancy noted on exam by RN - not baseline per family.
- Fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit this morning.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile infection, hepatitis C, bipolar disorder, and recent pneumonia who presented to the emergency department with sepsis. He was found by his family to be fatigued, warm, and with gray skin. His initial vital signs included a temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure of 150/80 mmHg, heart rate of 100 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. A PICC line was placed, but it was subsequently pulled. In the emergency department, his blood pressure dropped, and a right central venous line was placed. He received fluids and antibiotics, including vancomycin and tobramycin.

The patient's 24-hour events include improved oxygen requirement, no pressor requirements, and an increased opacification in the right middle lobe and left lower lobe on chest X-ray. His allergies include pneumococcal vaccination. His last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on June 24th at 9:00 PM, and meropenem on June 25th at 2:53 AM. He is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis, flecainide, digoxin, and other ICU medications.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever. His flow sheet data shows a maximum temperature of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. He presented to the emergency department with worsening hypoxia, mental status changes, and hypotension. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being treated for sepsis secondary to pneumonia. His condition appears to be worsening, with new or developing right lower lobe pneumonia seen on a chest X-ray. The patient is on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and tobramycin, and is receiving IV fluids and vasopressors for hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already being treated for sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia seems to be worsening, with the development of new or worsening right lower lobe pneumonia. This could potentially lead to respiratory failure if not effectively treated.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to septic shock, and it needs to be closely monitored and managed with IV fluids and vasopressors.
4. C. diff colitis: Although the patient's stool test for C. diff is negative, his history of C. diff colitis increases his risk for recurrence. Monitoring for symptoms such as watery diarrhea and abdominal pain is important.

","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile colitis. He presented to the emergency department with worsening hypoxia and mental status at home, and is now also hypotensive. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 89%) and worsening pneumonia indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring and supportive care, such as non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or intubation, may be necessary.

2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently experiencing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with PVCs. It is important to continue antiarrhythmic medications and maintain electrolyte balance to prevent further cardiac complications.

3. Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests show elevated bilirubin levels. Close monitoring of liver enzymes and appropriate management, such as discontinuation of hepatotoxic medications, may be required.

4. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient's history of C. difficile colitis increases the risk of recurrence or complications. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and measures to prevent transmission should be implemented.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobile and has multiple risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile infection, hepatitis C, bipolar disorder, and recent pneumonia. He was discharged on June 21st and readmitted on June 24th with sepsis. The patient's hypotension occurred after the removal of his PICC line, suggesting a possible line infection. Other potential contributors include COPD and treatment failure for pneumonia. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 90/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a 40% mask. His review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for new symptoms related to his current condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's recent history of pneumonia and the presence of sepsis indicate a potential infection-related complication. Continuing antibiotics is recommended.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be multifactorial, including pulmonary edema after resuscitation, underlying COPD, and previous pneumonia. Supportive care with bronchodilators and diuretics is advised.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. It is important to continue antiarrhythmic medications and closely monitor his heart"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and pneumonia. The vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation at 94%.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 193 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein level of 28.3%, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 133. The kidney function seems to be normal based on the creatinine level of 0.7. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for slightly low potassium levels.

The patient has been receiving various medications including tobramycin, vancomycin, meropenem for infection, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,330 mL and output of 1,770 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,560 mL.

The patient's respiratory support consists of delivering oxygen through an aerosol-cool device, and their ABG results are not available. Physical examination findings include not assessed peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, and movement.

The patient's condition has been monitored closely with frequent vital sign checks, hemodynamic monitoring, and regular lab tests. The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (Afib), Clostridium difficile (C diff), hepatitis C virus (HCV), bipolar disorder, and recent pneumonia (PNA) who was discharged on June 21st. He is currently admitted to the ICU with sepsis, suspected to be caused by a line infection, possibly due to a PICC line removal. The patient has COPD and treatment failure for PNA, which are also potential contributors to his condition.

The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 100.1°F, blood pressure ranging from 90/53 to 147/77 mmHg, heart rate between 75-126 bpm, respiratory rate of 17-35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a 40% mask.

Physical examination reveals clinical improvement, no murmurs or gallop, bilateral end expiratory wheeze, distended abdomen, edematous extremities, skin abrasions on the left knee and toes, verbal hesitancy improved, mild anisocoria with nebs but EOMI, and fluid in the right fissure, RML air bronchogram/atelectasis.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 193 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 28.3%, decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.2 g/dL, decreased platelet count (Plt) of 133 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 0.8 mg/dL, and other abnormalities in electrolyte levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: Continue Vancomycin and [Last Name] for now. The patient is currently on day 13/14 of Vancomycin and day 4 of [Last Name] for 7 days. Consider switching to daptomycin if all cultures are negative.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Distress: Likely multifactorial including pulmonary edema after resuscitation, COPD, and underlying PNA. Administer Atrovent q6, empiric antibiotics, and repeat speech and swallow evaluation. Goal is negative diuresis.
3. Afib: Continue with Digoxin and Felonide (home meds), give Lopressor for goal SBP < 110, and space out medications to prevent hypotension.
4. Neuro: Suspicion for component of Parkinson's disease. Administer Tylenol for fever, continue Depakote, and check level.
5. GI: Dysphagia diet, will need video swallow and if fails, PEG consideration due to marginal nutritional intake.
6. Lines: Right internal jugular (IJ) line, 3 peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines.

ICU care includes regular dysphagia diet, speech and swallow evaluation, glycemic control, line management, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is on full code status and will remain in the ICU until respiratory status improves."

   66-yo man w/ pAF, h/o C.diff colitis, recent pneumonia, d/c'd two days
   ago on Vanc / Zosyn, who p/w worsening hypoxia and mental status at
   home, now also hypotensive.
   #. Sepsis - Pt w/ high fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. Given recent
   pneumonia, resistant organism most likely source, esp given current
   hypoxia. Received Abx in ED: Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/Tobra. CXR appears worse than
   recent discharge, with ? new or developing RLL pneumonia. Hypotension
   IVF responsive. Other sources of sepsis would include PICC line
   (pulled, cx pending),  C.diff given hx and concurrent Abx use,
   worsening PNA. Based on chest XR and serial imaging, he has an area in
   the right base that is most likely a component of atelectaasis and
   resolving pneumonia.
   - cont Vanc (d13) / [**Last Name (un) **] (day 4)
   - f/u all culture data
   - IVF boluses PRN hypotension, follow CVP
   - if needed, will use Levophed for vasopressor support
   - Tylenol PRN
   #. Hypoxia - Likely [**3-20**] pneumonia. [**Month (only) 60**] have organism resistant to prior
   Vanc / Zosyn. CXR w/ worsening pneumonia in RLL. Benefits from face
   mask as he is a mouth breather
   - follow serial CXRs
   - send sputum cx
   #. Bradycardia / hypotension - Pt noted to have a few short episodes of
   bradycardia and hypotension on arrival to ED. Resolved on own, and pt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile colitis. He was discharged two days ago on vancomycin and meropenem but presented to the emergency department with worsening hypoxia and mental status. He is now admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has high fever, hypoxia, and hypotension, which are signs of sepsis. The recent pneumonia may be the source of infection, especially considering the current hypoxia. He received antibiotics in the emergency department, including vancomycin and tobramycin. The chest X-ray shows worsening pneumonia in the right lower lobe.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to the worsening right lower lobe pneumonia. The organism causing the pneumonia is resistant to the previously prescribed antibiotics (vancomycin and meropenem). The patient benefits from using a face mask as he is a mouth breather.

3. Bradycardia/Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of bradycardia and hypotension on arrival to the emergency department but resolved on their own.

4. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is on flecainide and digoxin for his atrial fibrillation. His digoxin level in the emergency department was low"

","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation, recent pneumonia, Clostridium difficile colitis, and bipolar disorder. He presented to the emergency department with worsening hypoxia, mental status changes, and hypotension. He has been treated with various antibiotics for his conditions, including Vancomycin and Meropenem.

Upon admission to the ICU, the patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature of 38.0°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 65-77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula, and an irregular heart rhythm consistent with atrial fibrillation.

The patient's physical examination revealed anisocoria with a dilated and non-reactive right pupil, dry mouth, supple neck, anterior crackles at bilateral lung bases, irregular heart rhythm with normal S1-S2 sounds, and positive bowel sounds with distention and tightness in the abdomen. The patient also had pitting edema with abrasions on the left toes.

Laboratory results showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18,800 cells/microliter, elevated creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and slightly low hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL. Other lab values were within normal limits.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.0°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 92/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 21 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination shows crackles at the left base of the lungs, irregular heart rhythm, and 2+ bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.8 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 8.0 mg/dL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 29 mEq/L, hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L, and slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL.

The patient has multiple medical conditions, including sepsis, pneumonia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient's 24-hour events include receiving IVF boluses without response, decreased Lopressor dose due to hypotension, and administration of IV Lasix with good urine output but continued hypotension. The patient's blood pressure remains in the 80s systolic and 60s mean arterial pressure (MAP), indicating persistent hypotension. The patient's diet has been adjusted to nectar thick liquids and soft solids, and a bedside swallowing evaluation has been ordered. Nutrition consultation has been sought, and valproic acid level and HIV testing will be done tomorrow. The patient's CBC w/ diff and immunoglobulin levels are within normal limits. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed to rule out endocarditis, showing a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 55% and no vegetations, but suboptimal image quality. The patient's allergies include Pneumovax 23 (Injection) (Pneumococcal 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine). The patient received antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and meropenem, on [**2186-6-26**] at 08:00 PM and [**2186-6-27**] at 03:00 AM, respectively.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, recent pneumonia, c.diff colitis, and bipolar disorder. He presented with recurrent pneumonia/sepsis just two days after discharge. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presented with high fever, hypoxia, and hypotension, indicating a possible sepsis. Given the recent pneumonia and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, there is a concern for resistant organisms.
2. Anisocoria: The patient has anisocoria with a dilated right pupil, which could be related to atrovent use or sympathetic irritation/damage. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing hypoxia, likely due to [**3-20**] pneumonia. He benefits from using a face mask as he is a mouth breather. Daily CXR and re-sending sputum culture if able to produce should be considered.
4. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is on Flecainide and Digoxin at home. His dig level in the ED was low at 0.5, so it is important to continue digoxin and flecainide, as"

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile colitis, recent pneumonia, and hepatitis C. He presented to the ICU with recurrent pneumonia/sepsis just two days after discharge. His current symptoms include high fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics, so there is concern for resistant organisms. The chest X-ray shows worsening right lower lobe pneumonia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has recurrent pneumonia, and the worsening right lower lobe pneumonia on the chest X-ray indicates a possible infection in the lungs.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates poor perfusion to vital organs and may require vasopressor support.
4. Bradycardia: The patient has experienced short episodes of bradycardia, which is a slow heart rate and can be a sign of heart block or medication side effects.
5. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of this cardiac arrhythmia, and it is currently present with PVCs (premature ventricular contractions).
6. Bipolar disorder: The patient is stable on Depakote"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile infection, hepatitis C, bipolar disorder, and recent pneumonia who was discharged on June 21st on Vancomycin and Meropenem for pneumonia. 
- He presented with sepsis, and his symptoms suggest a line infection, possibly due to the placement of a PICC line. Other potential contributors include COPD and treatment failure for pneumonia.
- The patient has shown clinical improvement with improved vital signs, reduced fluid balance, and improved oxygen saturation.
- His physical examination reveals bilateral end-expiratory wheeze, mild anisocoria with nebs, and preserved ejection fraction on echocardiogram.
- Lab results show improved white blood cell count and hemoglobin levels, but elevated lactate levels.
- The patient's antibiotic regimen has been adjusted based on blood culture results, which were negative for MRSA. Additional tests, such as sputum and stool cultures, are pending.
- The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, for which he is currently being managed with digoxin and flecainide. His blood pressure is being closely monitored, and he is receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis.
- There are suspicions of Parkinson's disease and pupil anisocoria, which require further evaluation.
- The patient's gastrointestinal status includes dysphag"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. He has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and alteration in nutrition. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, diuretics, and anticoagulant therapy. His vital signs are stable, but he has been experiencing hypotension and fever. The patient's blood work shows elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, indicating an ongoing infection. Imaging studies reveal consolidation in the right lower lobe of the lung.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest pneumonia. Complications such as sepsis, respiratory failure, or empyema may arise if the infection progresses.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): AFib is present in this patient and can lead to complications like stroke or heart failure if left untreated or uncontrolled.

3. Sepsis: Given the patient's hypotension, elevated inflammatory markers, and known infection, sepsis is a concern. If not managed promptly and effectively, it can progress to septic shock and organ dysfunction.

4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid in the past 24 hours, but still shows a negative fluid balance. Close monitoring of fluid status is essential to prevent complications like fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile infection, hepatitis C, bipolar disorder, and recent pneumonia who was discharged on June 21st on Vancomycin and Meropenem for pneumonia. He presents with sepsis, and the story is suspicious for a line infection given his hypotension came only after the removal of the PICC line. COPD and pneumonia treatment failure are also potential contributors.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 84/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula, and atrial fibrillation.

Physical examination findings include clinical improvement, no murmurs or murmurs with respiration, bilateral end expiratory wheeze, distended and soft abdomen, edematous extremities, and abrasions on the left knee and toes. Neurological examination reveals verbal hesitancy, mild anisocoria with nebs but equal motor strength. Labs show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 7.9 thousand/mm3, elevated creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 8.0 mg/dL. Other labs are within normal limits.

   66 yr old man with recent PNA returns with sepsis.  Overall story
   suspicious for line infection given his HoTN came only after PICC
   removal.  COPD and PNA treatment failure also potential contributors.
   1. Sepsis: resolved
   Continue Vanco and [**Last Name (un) **] for now.
   Currently Day 14/14 vanc and day 5 [**Last Name (un) 430**] for 7 days
   Will consider d
c if all cx negative
   TBB goal -1L
   2. Hypoxemic Resp Distress: -this is his 4^th RML PNA
   Likely multifactorial: pulm edema after resuscitation, COPD, underlying
   PNA.
   Would repeat speech and swallow evalutation
   goal negative diuresis
   Check total IgG and HIV
   3. Afib:
   -continue with Dig and Flecanide (home meds)
   -give lopressor for goal SBP<110
   -Will space out medications to prevent hypotension
   4. Neuro: suspicion for component of parkinsons
   -tylenol for fever
   -continue depakote .  check level
   5.Pupil anasacoria-Will check visual exam and fundoscopic exam
   -Will hold atrovent nebs
   -Hx of right sided craniotomy recent negative CT scan will review
   records to see if these findings are old.
   6. GI:
   -Dysphagia diet. , will need video swallow and if he fails, PEG a
   consideration too given marginal nutritional  intake

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile infection, hepatitis C, bipolar disorder, and recent pneumonia who was discharged on Vancomycin and Meropenem for pneumonia. He presented with sepsis and is now in the ICU.

The patient's chief complaint is sepsis. The history of present illness mentions that he has a suspicious line infection given his hypotension came only after the removal of the PICC line. Other potential contributors include COPD and pneumonia treatment failure.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/54 mmHg to 77/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

Physical examination findings include clinically improved general appearance, normal airway, breathing, and circulation, right pupil minimally reactive, left pupil within normal limits, superior oblique weakness on exam, no diplopia, clear optic disc and retina, no murmurs, wheezing on lung examination, distended and soft abdomen, edematous extremities, abrasions on the left knee and toes, verbal hesitancy improved, and improved edema with right middle lobe consolidation continued.

","The patient presents with unequal pupils, right eye ptosis, and difficulty with upward gaze on the right. The CT head without contrast did not show any intracranial hemorrhage, but the neurology team is suggesting an angiogram to evaluate for re-expansion of an aneurysm. They believe that an MRI or CTA brain would not be helpful due to artifacts from the clip.

The patient has a history of pneumovax 23 injection, hypotension, and allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin at 08:00 PM on 2186-6-27 and meropenem at 03:00 AM on 2186-6-28. Heparin sodium is being administered as prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 61 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 103/55 to 82/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, c.difficile colitis, recent pneumonia, and hepatitis C. He presented with recurrent pneumonia and sepsis just two days after discharge. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/55 mmHg to 82/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination revealed unequal pupils, right eye ptosis, and difficulty with upward gaze on the right eye. He also has new or developing right lower lobe pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient's blood cultures showed no growth, and he is currently receiving intravenous fluids that are responsive to hypotension. 

The patient has multiple medical conditions and is on various medications, including vancomycin, meropenem, heparin sodium, and others. His lab results indicate leukocytosis, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal glucose levels. Other lab results show abnormal values for PT/PTT/INR, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and albumin.

   Assessment and Plan:  66M with a history of pAF, c.diff colitis, recent
   pneumonia, admitted to the ICU with recurrent PNA/sepsis just two days
   after discharge.  Now w/ fevers.
   # Pneumonia:  Continues to require 4L NC.  Presented with high fever,
   hypoxia, and hypotension. CXR with evidence of RLL pneumonia. Probably
   aspirated given results of swallowing study. Given repeated pneumonias
   checked HIV Ab and IgG, both unremarkable.
   - Clinically improving on meropenem, continue to complete 8d course
   (day 7=[**6-29**])

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, C. diff colitis, and heavy alcohol use. He was admitted to the ICU with recurrent pneumonia and sepsis, and now presents with fevers. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.8°F (39.3°C), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 99/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on face tent. The patient has been on meropenem therapy, which is showing clinical improvement. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and slightly elevated platelet count. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal with elevated alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin. The patient also has a prolonged prothrombin time, likely due to liver dysfunction. 

Imaging studies reveal stable right middle lobe consolidation, increased right middle lobe volume loss, bilateral pleural effusions with more on the right side, and multiple bilateral 3-6 mm nodules. A follow-up CT scan in one year is recommended. 

The patient has several ongoing medical issues including pneumonia, fever, anisocoria (unequal pupil sizes), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, anemia, bipolar disorder, possible liver disease, and bradycardia. 

The patient's care plan includes"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath (SOB). The patient converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) at approximately 6:30 am, but then reverted back to atrial fibrillation (AF) by 6:30 pm. The patient's HIV test returned negative, and a fungal panel was sent. The patient's vancomycin level was within therapeutic concentration, so it was discontinued after completing a full 14-day course. The patient's temperature spiked late afternoon, and the use of atrovent nebs was changed back. The patient also started e-mycin eye ointment for possible conjunctivitis. Three peripheral IV lines were placed, and the central venous line (CVL) was pulled with the tip sent for culture. A bronchoscopy was deferred due to evidence of aspiration. The patient's CT chest showed stable right middle lobe (RML) consolidation and increased volume loss, along with slightly larger pleural effusions, right-sided. There are also approximately six nodules that have remained unchanged since 06/25/2185.

The patient has allergies to Pneumovax 23 injection and hypotension. The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 06/28/2186 at 8:00 am, followed by meropenem on 06/29/2186 at 3:00 am. The patient is currently receiving prophylactic he"

   middle lobe volume loss without evidence of endobronchial lesion.
   Several
   enlarged and numerous prominent mediastinal lymph nodes not
   significantly
   changed from the prior study and likely reactive in nature.
   2. Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions right greater than
   left.
   3. Multiple bilateral 3-6 mm nodules, unchanged compared to the prior
   study.
   A followup CT is recommended in one year to ensure two-year stability.
   4. Findings consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan:  66M with a history of pAF, c.diff colitis, recent
   pneumonia, presenting with recurrent PNA/sepsis just two days after
   discharge.
   # Pneumonia:  Presented with high fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. CXR
   with evidence of RLL pneumonia. Probably aspirated given results of
   swallowing study. Given repeated pneumonias checked HIV Ab and IgG,
   both unremarkable.
   - Clinically improving on meropenem, continue to complete 8d course
   (day 7=[**6-29**])
   - Consider thoracentesis today
   - Will need followup CT as outpt to f/u nodules
   - F/u glucan and galactomannan
   # Anisicoria:  Apparently an old finding from record review.
   - Follow
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  On Flecainide and Digoxin at home.
   Dig level in ED low at 0.5.
   - Continue digoxin and flecainide
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Continue aspirin
   - Per discussion with PCP and cards recommend NO anticoagulation given
   h/o falls
   # Bipolar disorder:  Stable on Depakote for several years with no
   recent changes. Initial concerns over somnolence and flat affect.
   - Continue home Depakote
   - Holding olanzapine,
   - Consider psych consult
   # Hepatitis C:
   - Outpatient liver f/u
   # Bradycardia:  Noted to have a few short episodes of bradycardia and
   hypotension on arrival to ED. Resolved.

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, C. difficile colitis, recent pneumonia, and hepatitis C. He presented with high fever, hypoxia, and hypotension, and was found to have right middle lobe pneumonia on chest X-ray. He was started on meropenem and has been clinically improving. His HIV tests were negative. He also has anisocoria, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, bipolar disorder, and hepatitis C.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.3°C (102.8°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 99/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He is receiving supplemental oxygen through a face tent. His lung exam shows decreased breath sounds at the left lung with a few basilar crackles. He is also experiencing some gastrointestinal symptoms.

His laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.3 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 12 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL. His blood cultures are pending, as well as tests for glucan and galactomannan. His chest X-ray shows stable right middle lobe consolidation with increased volume loss, slightly larger pleural effusions, and multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile infection, hepatitis C, bipolar disorder, and recent pneumonia who was discharged on June 21st on Vancomycin and meropenem for pneumonia. The patient presented with sepsis and had a PICC line inserted. After the removal of the PICC line, the patient's high temperature occurred. The patient also has COPD and treatment failure for pneumonia. 

The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea. The patient is on respiratory support with face tent and oxygen saturation at 100%. The physical examination reveals right pupil larger than left, decreased upward gaze on right, normal ocular pressures, and course bilateral bronchial sounds with decreased breath sounds on the right side. The patient has distended, soft, and obese abdomen, edematous extremities, and abrasions on the left knee and toes. Neurological examination shows verbal hesitancy, mild anisocoria with nebs but extraocular movements intact.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal glucose levels, and elevated potassium levels. Blood cultures were taken on June 28th, and the patient is currently on meropenem and Vancomycin. The patient's daily fluid balance shows a net intake of 1,800 mL"

   Assessment and Plan:  66M with a history of pAF, c.diff colitis, recent
   pneumonia, admitted to the ICU with recurrent PNA/sepsis just two days
   after discharge.  Now w/ fevers.
   # Pneumonia:  Continues to require 4L NC.  Presented with high fever,
   hypoxia, and hypotension. CXR with evidence of RLL pneumonia. Probably
   aspirated given results of swallowing study. Given repeated pneumonias
   checked HIV Ab and IgG, both unremarkable.
   - Clinically improving on meropenem, continue to complete 8d course
   (day 7=[**6-29**])
   - Consider thoracentesis today
   - Will need follow-up CT as outpt to f/u nodules
   - F/u glucan and galactomannan
   # Fever:  Unclear etiology. ? from drugs.  LE U/S w/o DVT.
   - continue [**Last Name (un) 430**] for PNA treatment
   - send for cdiff
   - Will tap R pleural effusion.
   - Consider bronch to eval for malignancy, fungal infection, nocardia
   - send sputum
   # Anisicoria:  Apparently an old finding from record review.
   - Follow
   # Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  On Flecainide and Digoxin at home.
   Dig level in ED low at 0.5.
   - Continue digoxin and flecainide
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Continue aspirin
   - Per discussion with PCP and cards recommend NO anticoagulation given
   h/o falls
   #Anemia: Stable.  Macrocytic and likely from liver disease.  Recent
   B12/Folate wnl.
   - trend for now
   - guaiac stools
   # Bipolar disorder:  Stable on Depakote for several years with no
   recent changes. Initial concerns over somnolence and flat affect.
   - Continue home Depakote
   - Holding olanzapine as has some parkinsonism
   - Consider psych consult
   # ? Liver disease:  Hep C Ab neg. Hep B serologies c/w prior infection
   (surface and core Ab+.  Transaminases wnl  Mild thrombocytopenia.  INR
   1.3.  Does have a remote history of heavy alcohol use.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, C. difficile colitis, and recent discharge from the hospital. He was admitted to the ICU with recurrent pneumonia and sepsis. The patient presented with high fever, hypoxia, and hypotension, and his chest X-ray showed evidence of right middle lobe pneumonia. He has been clinically improving on meropenem and is completing an 8-day course. Thoracentesis was deferred due to difficulty positioning and little fluid. The patient was also seen by ophthalmology for dry eyes and filamentary keratitis, and received treatment with erythromycin and lubricant eye drops.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stable right middle lobe consolidation with interval increase in right middle lobe volume loss without evidence of endobronchial lesion.
2. Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
3. Multiple bilateral 3-6 mm nodules, unchanged compared to the prior study.
4. Findings consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
5. Yeast infection in the urine culture.
6. Unclear etiology of fever, possibly from drugs. Considered to be leukocyte guidelines until further evaluation.
7. Recurrent pneumonia, which may be due to aspiration given the results of the swallowing study.
8. Hypotension and bradycardia on arrival to the emergency department.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, c.difficile colitis, and recent hospitalization. He was admitted to the ICU with recurrent pneumonia/sepsis and presented with high fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. His chest X-ray shows evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia. He is currently on meropenem for pneumonia treatment and is clinically improving. The patient also has anisocoria, stable anemia, bipolar disorder, and possible liver disease.

Potential Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's recurrent pneumonia and sepsis indicate a potential complication related to his respiratory system. Continuous monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Aspiration: Given the patient's repeated pneumonias and swallowing study results, there is a possibility of aspiration pneumonia. Proper airway protection and feeding techniques should be implemented to minimize this risk.
3. Thoracentesis: Considering the patient's pleural effusions, a thoracentesis may be needed to analyze the fluid and determine the cause of the effusion. This procedure carries a small risk of complications such as bleeding, infection, or pneumothorax.
4. Anisocoria: The patient's anisocoria (unequal pupil sizes) may indicate an underlying neurological issue. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's paroxysmal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile colitis, and recent discharge from the hospital. He was admitted to the ICU with recurrent pneumonia and sepsis. The patient presented with high fever, hypoxia, and hypotension, and had evidence of right middle lobe consolidation on imaging. He also had multiple bilateral 3-6 mm nodules, enlarged and numerous prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, and bilateral pleural effusions. The patient's vital signs showed a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 97/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient was on mechanical ventilation, receiving meropenem and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation and presents with high fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. The presence of right middle lobe consolidation suggests a possible aspiration pneumonia. This condition requires close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Sepsis: Given the patient's recurrent pneumonia and recent discharge from the hospital, there is a concern for sepsis. The patient's hypotension and fever suggest systemic infection, which needs to be addressed promptly.
3. Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions"

   suspicious for line infection given his HoTN came only after PICC
   removal.  COPD and PNA treatment failure also potential contributors.
   Continues to demonstrate fevers with increased right sided effusion.
   1. Sepsis: Fevers improved
   Continue   [**Last Name (un) **] for 10 day course.
   Currently Day day 7 [**Last Name (un) 430**] for 10 days
   Will continue C.Diff tx even with negative c.diff
   will tap effusion given recurrent fevers, suspect either catheter
   infection or C. Diff colitis ( will start Flagyl today)
   2. Hypoxemic Resp Distress: -unresolving PNA
   Likely multifactorial: pulm edema after resuscitation, COPD, underlying
   PNA.
   speech and swallow evalutation micro aspiration
   Sputum cx if possible
   -X-ray tomorrow.
   3. Afib: known back in NSR
   -continue with Dig and Flecanide (home meds)
   -give lopressor for goal SBP<110
   -Will restart Atrovent and hold xopenex
   -Will discuss anticoagulation, recommended against secondary to falls.
   4. Neuro: suspicion for component of parkinsons
   -tylenol for fever
   -continue depakote.  check level
   -Suspect some component of hepatic encephalopathy
   -Will ask neuro regarding treatment for parkinsons
   Will start SSRI or low dose Ritalin
   5.Pupil anasacoria-Will check visual exam and fundoscopic exam
   -neuro following most likely chronic changes
   6.Depression-will speak with psychiatrist given depressive symptoms and
   signs of parkinsons
   7. GI:
   -Dysphagia diet. Will discuss placing NG tube to provide nutritional
   support, may need TPN if intake not optimal with NG tube

","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile (C. diff), hepatitis C, bipolar disorder, and recent pneumonia who was discharged on June 21st on Vancomycin and Meropenem for pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU with suspected line infection, possibly due to the removal of his PICC line, as well as treatment failure for COPD and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 101/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with sepsis.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count within normal range, elevated creatinine, low albumin, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals right pupil larger than left, decreased upward gaze on right, dry eyes, edematous extremities, distended abdomen, course bilateral crackles in the lungs, and abrasions on the left knee and toes. Neurological examination shows mild anisocoria with nebs but equal optic mediastinal innervation.

   66 yr old man with recent PNA returns with sepsis.  Overall story
   suspicious for line infection given his HoTN came only after PICC
   removal.  COPD and PNA treatment failure also potential contributors.
   Continues to demonstrate fevers with increased right sided effusion.
   1. Sepsis: Fevers improved
   Continue   [**Last Name (un) **] for 10 day course.
   Currently Day day 7 [**Last Name (un) 430**] for 10 days
   Will continue C.Diff tx even with negative c.diff
   will tap effusion given recurrent fevers, suspect either catheter
   infection or C. Diff colitis ( will start Flagyl today)
   2. Hypoxemic Resp Distress: -unresolving PNA
   Likely multifactorial: pulm edema after resuscitation, COPD, underlying
   PNA.
   speech and swallow evalutation micro aspiration

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with multiple comorbidities including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, hepatitis C, bipolar disorder, and recent pneumonia (PNA). The patient presented with sepsis, and his symptoms are suspicious for a line infection, especially since his hypotension occurred only after the removal of the percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line. Other potential contributors include COPD and treatment failure for PNA.

The patient has been febrile with increased right-sided effusion. His vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/62 mmHg to 117/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AF).

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT). His blood glucose levels have been within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals right pupil larger than the left, decreased upward gaze on the right, dry eyes, course bilateral breath sounds with decreased breath sounds on the right compared to the left, distended and soft abdomen, edematous extremities, abrasions on the left knee and toes,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile colitis, recent pneumonia, and admitted to the ICU with recurrent pneumonia/sepsis. He presented with high fever, hypoxia, and hypotension, and his chest X-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient is currently on meropenem, and his condition is clinically improving. Further follow-up with a CT scan is planned to evaluate nodules seen on imaging. A thoracentesis has been deferred. The patient's fever has improved following the initiation of flagyl, and he will continue this medication for an additional 10-14 days after completing the meropenem course. He will also continue treatment for pneumonia with [Last Name (un) 430]. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's recurrent pneumonia/sepsis indicates a possible underlying issue that needs further investigation. The presence of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension suggests a serious infection, and the evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia on the chest X-ray supports this diagnosis. The patient is currently responding well to meropenem, but close monitoring and follow-up with appropriate tests are necessary to ensure complete resolution.

2. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient has a history of c.difficile colitis, which can lead to severe diarrhea and abdominal pain. Since the patient refused dopoff"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, c. difficile colitis, recent pneumonia, and admitted to the ICU with recurrent pneumonia/sepsis just two days after discharge. The patient presented with high fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. A chest X-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia, which is likely due to aspiration given the results of the swallowing study. The patient has been clinically improving on meropenem, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, and is completing a 10-day course.

The patient also has an unclear etiology of fever, which may be related to drug-induced causes. The healthcare team continues with flagyl, an antibiotic commonly used for treating C. difficile infection, and plans to continue for 10-14 days post-end of meropenem course. The patient is also on Last Name (un) 430 for pneumonia treatment as above, and follow-up pending micro and reculture if febrile.

Additionally, the patient has anisocoria, which is an old finding from record review and will be followed up. The patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is being managed with Flecainide and Digoxin at home, and the Dig level in the Emergency Department was low at 0.5. The healthcare team continues with digoxin and Flecainide, along with metoprolol, aspirin, and no anticoagulation given the patient's history of falls.

The patient also has stable anemia, which is macrocytic and likely from liver disease. Recent B12/Folate levels were within normal limits. The healthcare team will trend for now and perform guaiac stools. The patient has bipolar disorder, which is stable on Depakote for several years with no recent changes. The healthcare team will continue home Depakote, consider an antidepressant, and discuss parkinsonism with a neurologist.

There is also a question of liver disease, as the patient has negative Hep C antibody but positive Hep B serologies, indicating prior infection. The transaminases are within normal limits, with mild thrombocytopenia and INR 1.3. The patient has a remote history of heavy alcohol use. The healthcare team recommends an outpatient liver follow-up.

The patient experienced episodes of bradycardia and hypotension on arrival to the Emergency Department, which have since resolved.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition will be addressed by considering the placement of a dopoff for tube feeds (the patient refuses currently). The patient's blood sugar levels have been well-controlled. The patient has multiple lines, including an 18-Gauge line placed on [**2186-6-28**] at 12:12 PM. Prophylaxis measures include boots and subcutaneous UF Heparin for DVT prevention, as well as"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, recent pneumonia, and admitted to the ICU with recurrent pneumonia/sepsis just two days after discharge. The patient presented with high fever, hypoxia, and hypotension, and a chest X-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient is suspected to have aspirated given the results of a swallowing study.

The patient is currently on meropenem for pneumonia treatment and has shown clinical improvement. However, the patient still requires 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen due to ongoing hypoxia. The plan is to complete a 10-day course of meropenem.

The patient's fever improved following the initiation of Flagyl, but the exact cause of the fever remains unclear, possibly due to drug reaction or another etiology. A lower extremity ultrasound was performed without evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient has anisocoria, which is an old finding from record review, and will be monitored.

The patient's paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is being managed with Flecainide and Digoxin at home. The patient's digoxin level in the emergency department was low at 0.5, so it will be continued along with F"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, Clostridium difficile colitis, recent pneumonia, and chronic liver disease. He was admitted to the ICU with recurrent pneumonia and sepsis just two days after discharge. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, showing signs of hypoxia and hypotension. His temperature is slightly elevated. He has a history of bipolar disorder and is stable on Depakote. The patient's anemia is stable and likely due to liver disease. He has a remote history of heavy alcohol use. His blood glucose levels are well-controlled.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient continues to require 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen and has evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia on chest X-ray. Given repeated pneumonias, HIV status has been checked and is unremarkable.
2. Fever: The patient's fever improved following the initiation of Flagyl, suggesting possible improvement of C. difficile colitis. However, the etiology of the fever is still unclear, and it could be due to other causes such as drug reactions. Further investigation is needed.
3. Anisocoria: The patient has an old finding of anisocoria, which may have been present before admission. Further evaluation is required.
4. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is currently on"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, c.diff colitis, recent pneumonia, and admitted to the ICU with recurrent pneumonia/sepsis. The patient presented with high fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. A chest X-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia, and a swallowing study indicated possible aspiration. HIV Ab and IgG were unremarkable. The patient is clinically improving on meropenem and will complete a 10-day course. A follow-up CT scan is needed to monitor nodules. Thoracentesis has been postponed, and further tests such as glucan and galactomannan will be conducted.

The patient also had an unclear fever etiology, possibly due to drugs, and underwent a leg ultrasound without evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Flagyl was initiated, and the patient will continue the medication for 10-14 days after the end of the meropenem course. Treatment for pneumonia will continue as before, and pending microbiology results will be followed up with reculture if febrile.

Other conditions mentioned include anisocoria (likely an old finding), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on Flecainide and Digoxin), anemia (macrocytic and likely from liver disease), bipolar disorder (stable on Depakote), and possible liver disease (Hep B serologies positive, remote"

The patient in the ICU has been experiencing hypoxia and has a history of depression. They have been receiving treatment with ritalin for persistent somnolence. The patient attempted to reach their psychiatrist but could not reach them. Tube feeds were planned for the morning but the patient refused dopoff placement. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1 C (100.5 F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/65 mmHg to 79/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,963 mL with outputs of 700 mL in urine and 410 mL in blood products. The patient's ABG results indicate hypoxia. 

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic assessment also not assessed. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and slightly elevated glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal. 

The patient has been diagnosed with depression, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired knowledge, alteration in nutrition, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and pneumonia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, c.difficile colitis, recent pneumonia, and heavy alcohol use. He was admitted to the ICU with recurrent pneumonia/sepsis just two days after discharge. The patient presented with high fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. A chest X-ray showed evidence of right middle lobe/right lower lobe pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration. The patient is clinically improving on meropenem and will complete a 10-day course. Follow-up CT is recommended to check for nodules. Glucan and galactomannan tests are pending. The patient has been empirically treated for c.difficile colitis and is showing improvement. He has anisocoria, which is an old finding. The patient's digoxin level in the emergency department was low at 0.5, and he will continue on digoxin and flecainide. Metoprolol will be decreased on July 1st. Aspirin will be continued, and anticoagulation will not be recommended due to a history of falls. The patient has stable anemia, which is macrocytic and likely from liver disease. Recent B12/Folate levels were normal, so it will be trended for now. The patient is stable on Depakote for bipolar disorder, but concerns over somnolence and flat affect will be considered."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of depression, c.difficile infection, and recurrent pneumonia. He is currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction and pneumonia. The patient has shown improvement on meropenem, with fever down and resolution of diarrhea presumed to be caused by c.difficile. He also has bipolar disorder, Parkinson's disease, and is considering ritalin treatment. The patient is malnourished but showing signs of improvement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has impaired respiration/gas exchange, which could lead to respiratory failure if not adequately supported.
2. Sepsis: Despite improvement on meropenem, there is still a risk of sepsis due to his compromised immune system and underlying medical conditions.
3. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition status needs to be addressed to prevent further complications and support his recovery process.
4. Bipolar Disorder/Parkinson's Disease: The patient's psychiatric condition and Parkinson's disease require ongoing management and may pose challenges in his overall recovery.
5. Pneumonia: The patient still has pneumonia, which needs to be treated and monitored closely to prevent complications such as lung abscess or pleural effusion.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Although on prophylaxis, the patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU.
7. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be a potential complication in critically ill patients."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of depression, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, impaired knowledge, alteration in nutrition, atrial fibrillation (AFib), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection (CDiff) and recurrent pneumonia. He is currently on day 9 of a 10-day course of meropenem.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), blood pressure ranging from 96/63 mmHg to 80/41 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL, platelet count of 133 K/uL, blood glucose levels ranging from 81 mg/dL to 101 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated levels of ALT, AST, Alk Phos, and T Bili, as well as decreased levels of albumin and magnesium.
