","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm), currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, acute on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented with neutropenic fever and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient has small bowel obstruction (SBO) and requires nasogastric tube decompression. There is also evidence of right-sided pleural effusion.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
- Heart rate: 97 bpm (normal range: 68-124 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 100/65 mmHg (normal range: 79-162/53-95 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute (normal range: 12-30 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on 40% FiO2

   vasculature is engorged suggesting increased intravascular volume or
   pressure. There is no pulmonary edema, but bibasilar atelectasis has
   worsened. Heart size is obscured but not appreciably enlarged. No
   pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.
   Final CT Abd Read [**2113-2-7**]:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Focal dilatation of the second portion of the duodenum, which tapers
   as it
   crosses the midline concerning for partial obstruction, particularly
   given the
   lack of transit of oral contrast out of the stomach at the time of the
   study.
   However, given the fluid-filled loops of jejunum distal to the duodenal
   dilatation, a motility disorder such as ileus is also possible. There
   may be
   minimal wall thickening of some of the loops of small bowel, but no
   definite
   evidence of ischemia.
   2. Interval increase in loculated right pleural effusion and small left
   effusion with associated opacity at the left base which may represent
   infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, presenting with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. She has a history of malignancy and superior vena cava syndrome (SVC). The patient has been resuscitated with 7 liters of intravenous fluids and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She has multiple medical complications including septic shock, febrile neutropenia, respiratory failure, pancytopenia, loculated right pleural effusion, and low urine output. The patient's condition is unstable, and she is not a surgical candidate for partial small bowel obstruction vs. ileus. Her code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already in septic shock, which indicates a severe systemic infection. The source of infection is likely pulmonary or gastrointestinal.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her current condition and the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which is a decrease in all types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). This can lead to anemia, increased risk of infection, and bleeding complications.
4. Loculated Right Pleural Effusion: The patient has a loculated right pleural effusion, which may be due to infection or malignancy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented from a nursing home with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. She has been on palliative chemotherapy and received her last dose of gemcitabine on February 25th. The patient's current condition includes septic shock, febrile neutropenia, possible partial small bowel obstruction (SBO) versus ileus, respiratory failure, pancytopenia, loculated right pleural effusion, low urine output, hypokalemia, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention. It is important to continue monitoring vital signs, trend lactate levels, and administer appropriate antibiotics to cover potential sources of infection.

2. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient has febrile neutropenia, which is a serious infection that can occur in patients with weakened immune systems, such as those undergoing chemotherapy. Close monitoring of blood counts, administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and continued coverage with broad-spectrum antibiotics are necessary.

3. Partial SBO vs. Motility Disorder: The patient may have a partial SBO or a motility disorder, as indicated by the focal dilat"

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer admitted with
   sepsis and respiratory failure.
   1)Sepsis--Patient with significant compromise at the time of admission
   with severe sepsis and now with >6 liters of IVF pressors have been
   able to be weaned to off at this time.  LIkely sources do include
   pulmonary source with pleural fluid source considered but with WBC=19
   in exudative effusion by LDH criteria but not with active infection
   suggested with normal glucose.  We do not have evidence of active
   infection in alternative areas.
   -Flagyl/Vanco/Cefepime/Cipro
   -Methylprednisolone in place
   -Will continue to follow cultures as they return but by objective
   measures we have seen some reasonable improvement in hemodynamic
   stability
   2)Respiratory Failure-Much improved pulmonary mechanics
   -Bolus sedation would be desired if able to transition patient
   -Will repeat CXR today
   -Will drain fluid from pleural space to maintain optimization of
   pulmonary mechanics
   -Move to MMV mode and look to wean today
   3) CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG-Known disease and current
   palliative Rx in place.
   -Continue with pleural fluid drainage
   4)Neutropenia
Oncology team engaged in process
   -Will continue with GCSF
   -Hope for return of WBC count with last chemotherapy last month and
   will maintain until neutropenia resolved.
   5)Hypokalemia-
   -Replete K+ today
   6)Thrombocytopenia
Source is likely the marrow supression in the
   setting of chemotherapy at this time but will have to monitor counts
   and stability and hold anticoagualtion in the setting of severe
   thrombocytopenia
   -Follow PLT count q day

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer admitted for sepsis and respiratory failure.
- The patient's condition has improved with the weaning off of Levophed, a medication used to support blood pressure, and the initiation of steroids and G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) therapy.
- The patient remains on mechanical ventilation support with pressure-controlled ventilation mode and has shown improved pulmonary mechanics.
- The patient has a pleural effusion that is being drained to optimize pulmonary function.
- The patient's neutropenia is being managed with G-CSF therapy, and there is hope for a return to normal white blood cell count following recent chemotherapy.
- The patient has hypokalemia and thrombocytopenia, which are being addressed accordingly.
- The patient's cancer is known, and current palliative treatment is in place.
- There are concerns for potential medical complications such as superior vena cava syndrome, small bowel obstruction, respiratory failure, neutropenia, septic shock, and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVC): This condition occurs when there is obstruction of the superior vena cava, leading to swelling and impaired blood flow from the head, neck, and upper extremities to the heart.
2. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): This refers to a blockage in the small intestine,"

","The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer admitted with sepsis and respiratory failure. She has a history of morphine allergy, unknown sulfa allergy, and nausea/vomiting. The patient is unable to provide a medical history as she is sedated.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 92/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a tracheostomy tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation. The patient's recent medical events include pleural effusion drained at 400cc, weaning off Levophed dosing, starting steroids and G-CSF, and continued requirement for A/C ventilator support with PSV trialed and failed.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for tachypnea, anemia, immunocompromised status, and no pain. The patient's physical examination findings include overweight/obese appearance, pinpoint pupils, tracheostomy tube in place, distant heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, dullness to percussion, diminished breath sounds, soft non-tender distended abdomen, 4+ bilateral lower extremity edema, inability to stand, and unassessed neurologic status.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with neutropenic fever. The patient has a history of [briefly mention any relevant medical history]. On [date], the patient's family was updated, and the tracheostomy tube was changed to fibersource HN at 40cc/hr continuous. The patient's oncology recommendations have been exhausted. The patient is being monitored on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with stable oxygen saturation. 

During the day, the patient received a 500mL bolus of NaHCO3/D5W at 4 pm. However, the patient appeared uncomfortable on the ventilator, and the blood pressure increased to the 140s. The patient's face appeared more swollen, and the breath sounds seemed diminished on the left side. A chest X-ray showed no evidence of pneumothorax or other new abnormalities, but there were moderate bilateral pulmonary effusions unchanged from previous days.

An arterial blood gas (ABG) was performed and showed a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 58, PaO2 of 92, and HCO3- of 32. The ABG results indicated metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. The patient's potassium level was low at 3.2, so it was repleted. 

The patient has allergies to morphine and sulfa medications. The last doses of antibiotics given were piperacillin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the ICU with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. She has a history of palliative chemotherapy and is currently on gemcitabine. The patient has multiple medical complications, including septic shock, febrile neutropenia, partial small bowel obstruction (SBO) vs. motility disorder, respiratory failure, pancytopenia, loculated right pleural effusion, low urine output, hypokalemia, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's source of sepsis is likely pulmonary given the positive gram stain, but a gastrointestinal source cannot be ruled out despite negative C. difficile results. The patient's lactate level is within normal range, indicating adequate tissue perfusion. Goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 is set, and the patient is on levophed briefly due to low blood pressure. Pressors have been discontinued since 11pm.
2. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient is at risk for further infections due to low white blood cell count (WBC). She has already received chemotherapy with gemcitabine and is on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Transfusion goals include hematocrit (HCT) >21 and platelets (Plt) >10. Cultures are pending, and the patient will be monitored closely.
3. Partial SBO vs. Motility Disorder: The patient may have a partial SBO or a motility disorder, possibly due to sepsis-induced gastroparesis. She is producing significant stool, and a computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis suggests partial obstruction vs. ileus. The patient will start low-rate tube feeds today, and stool culture will be sent. Surgery consultation is pending.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to fluid overload. She is being observed on pressure support ventilation (PSV). Diuretics may be considered if the patient does not improve.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which is not due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Blood cultures are pending, and a complete blood count (CBC) will be repeated. Transfusion goals remain HCT >21 and Plt >10.
6. Loculated Right Pleural Effusion: The patient had an IP drainage of 400 ccs of fluid on [date]. The fluid was negative for gram stain and cultures. The LDH eff/LDH serum ratio suggests an exudative process, likely secondary to malignancy. The patient will be drained 2-3 times weekly by IP, and cultures will be followed up.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the ICU with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. She has a history of palliative chemotherapy and was on gemcitabine. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80/48 mmHg to 154/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. The first is septic shock, likely due to a pulmonary source given the positive gram stain, but a gastrointestinal source cannot be completely ruled out. The patient's lactate level is 0.9 mmol/L, and she has been on levophed briefly yesterday. The goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) is greater than 65, and the patient should continue to receive vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime/flagyl, with pending blood and sputum cultures.

The second complication is febrile neutropenia, which occurred after the patient received gemcitabine. She is already receiving granulocyte"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presents with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. The patient has a history of chemotherapy with gemcitabine and is currently experiencing complications related to her underlying condition and treatment.

The patient's current medical issues include:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is suspected to have septic shock due to positive gram stain indicating a likely pulmonary source. However, a gastrointestinal source cannot be ruled out. Blood cultures have been negative for over 48 hours, and the patient is currently on Ciprofloxacin/Cefepime/Flagyl. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, and blood cultures are pending. The patient's condition has improved since stopping the use of pressors.

2. Neutropenia: The patient has neutropenia due to recent chemotherapy (day 8 post-chemo) with an expected nadir on day 9-21 and recovery around day 21. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) has been started on day 3, and the goal is to maintain a hematocrit (HCT) above 21% and platelets above 10,000. Daily monitoring of blood counts is recommended.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely due"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented from a nursing home with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock.

2. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80/48 mmHg to 154/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

3. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 32 cmH2O. Plateau pressure is 28 cmH2O, and compliance is 22.2 cmH2O/mL.

4. The patient has moderate bilateral pleural effusions, with no pneumothorax or new abnormality noted on chest X-ray (CXR).

5. Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.1 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 10. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for hypokalemia, which has been resolved with IV repletion.

6. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime, for suspected sepsis and febrile neutropenia. The source of infection is likely pulmonary, but a gastrointestinal source cannot be ruled out.

7. The patient has been transfused with packed red blood cells (pRBCs) due to low hemoglobin levels and is receiving granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to stimulate neutrophil production.

8. The patient is also experiencing partial small bowel obstruction (SBO) versus motility disorder, likely secondary to sepsis-induced gastroparesis. The patient is producing stool and has a CT abdomen/pelvis showing a potential partial obstruction versus ileus.

9. The patient has a loculated right pleural effusion, which was drained on [Date]. The fluid analysis suggests an exudative process, most likely due to malignancy.

10. The patient has low urine output (<30 cc/hr) since 2 pm yesterday, despite adequate IV fluid resuscitation. This may be related to chemotherapy or another underlying cause.

11. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is pending clinical improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. She has a history of chemotherapy treatment. The patient's current condition shows improvement, but her overall prognosis is poor due to her underlying health conditions and the severity of her illness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of febrile neutropenia and septic shock indicates a severe systemic infection. There is a risk of ongoing or recurrent sepsis, particularly if the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST. The presence of bilateral pleural effusions and underlying compressive atelectasis may further compromise her respiratory function. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilation settings are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia: The patient's low platelet count and pancytopenia are likely due to chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression. This increases the risk of bleeding and infection. Regular monitoring of blood counts and transfusion as needed are important.
4. Oliguria: The patient's initial urine output was low, but it improved with the initiation of lasix. However, ongoing oliguria may indicate renal dysfunction or"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on palliative chemotherapy, presenting with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. She is alert today and has a history of carcinoma with febrile neutropenia. The patient has several medical complications, including septic shock, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia/pancytopenia, respiratory failure, oliguria, partial small bowel obstruction vs. motility disorder, loculated right pleural effusion, hypokalemia, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and poor prognosis due to stage IV lung cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient has shown improvement but remains at risk due to ongoing positive gram stain results and the presence of infection. Source control and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial.
2. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient's white blood cell count remains low, and there is a risk of infection. Continued monitoring, administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), and appropriate antibiotic coverage are necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia: The patient's platelet count and overall blood cell counts are suppressed due to chemotherapy. Close monitoring and transfusion of platelets and red blood cells may be required.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fever and has had multiple blood cultures taken, indicating a possible infection. The ongoing evaluation of these cultures will help identify the causative organism and guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, which suggests respiratory failure. The need for mechanical ventilation indicates severe respiratory compromise. Monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial to assess the effectiveness of respiratory support.

3. Neutropenia: The patient has a history of febrile neutropenia, which is a serious complication commonly seen in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Neutropenia increases the risk of infections, and close monitoring of white blood cell count is essential.

4. Superior vena cava syndrome (SVC): The patient has a history of malignancy (lung carcinoma) and presents with symptoms consistent with SVC syndrome, such as engorgement of pulmonary vessels on chest X-ray. SVC syndrome can lead to significant symptoms like swelling of the face, neck, and upper extremities, as well as respiratory distress.

5. Small bowel obstruction: The patient has a history of small bowel obstruction, which may be related to adhesions or other causes. This condition can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and bowel dysfunction.

6. Septic shock: Given the patient"

   HCT>21, plts >10.
   - Transfuse platelets today
   - [**Hospital1 7**] CBC
   - Transfusion goals otherwise as above
   # Respiratory Failure: Acute, hypoxic, likely [**1-10**] volume overload &
   infection as patient 12L length of stay positive.  On CMV/AC at
   15/400/40/10.
   - PSV as tolerated.
   # Oliguria: Started lasix gtt yesterday with excellent response
   (-1200), though still positive given IV abx and TF. No elevation in
   Cr.  Given 1 U PRBC for volume yesterday also.
   - continue lasix gtt @ 4mg/hr, as patient still + 13L LOS
   # Partial SBO vs. Motility Disorder: Clinically patient producing
   significant stool with bowel sounds and CT abd/pel with ?partial
   obstruction vs ileus. Surgery consulted in ED and feel patient not a
   surgical candidate.  Patient at goal for tube feeds, making stool.  C.
   Diff negative.
   - Continue tube feeds, advancing to goal of 40cc/day as tolerates
   - F/U cultures
   # Loculated Right Pleural Effusion: s/p IP drainage of 400 ccs of fluid
   on [**2113-2-7**], drained again today. Gram stain negative and cultures
   negative to date. LDH eff/LDH serum = 0.72, suggestive of exudative
   process; most likely malignancy.  Cultures negative to date.
   - Drain 2-3x weekly by IP
   - F/U cultures
   #Hypokalemia: Resolved with IV repletion, likely secondary to
   diarrhea/stool output.
   -Check [**Hospital1 7**] lytes and replete as necessary.
   #Elevated LFTs: likely secondary to septic shock, improving.
   -Trend daily
   # Goals of care. Patient is not improving.  Given febrile neutropenia,
   length before anticipated recovery of WBCs, poor respiratory status,
   and general prognosis of stage IV lung CA, prognosis is extremely
   poor.  Will need to discuss goals of care with family.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on palliative chemotherapy who presented from a nursing home with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock.
- The patient's blood cultures from February 6th are pending, and she has been restarted on vancomycin. The patient's temperature spiked to 101.5 last night.
- The patient has been diagnosed with febrile neutropenia, which is a complication of chemotherapy characterized by fever and low white blood cell count. The patient's WBC count is still 0.1, and she is expected to reach a nadir on day 9 post-chemotherapy and recover around day 21. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) has been initiated, and the patient's blood counts will be monitored daily.
- The patient also has thrombocytopenia/pancytopenia due to chemotherapy, with a hemoglobin concentration of 22.9 yesterday, 27 by afternoon, and currently 26.3. The patient received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) yesterday, and her hemoglobin concentration increased to 26.
- The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to volume overload and infection, as she has been intubated and placed on continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) at 15"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented from a nursing home with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is suspected to have septic shock, likely caused by a pulmonary source given the positive gram stain. However, a gastrointestinal source cannot be ruled out despite negative Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test results. The patient's lactate level is within normal limits, and she has a fever of 101.8 degrees Celsius. Blood cultures are pending.

2. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient is experiencing febrile neutropenia, which is a serious complication of chemotherapy. She received gemcitabine on day 10 post-chemotherapy, and her expected nadir (lowest white blood cell count) is on day 9-21 with recovery around day 21. Her current white blood cell count is still very low at 0.1. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) has been initiated, and the patient will continue to receive it per oncology recommendations. Monitoring of daily counts is advised.

3. Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presents with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. She has been admitted to the ICU for management of her condition. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 97/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation. Her physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds throughout the chest, rhonchi at the right base, and no wheezes. She is intubated and sedated. Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 5, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 165/28). Imaging reveals a right pleural effusion, and microbiology is pending. The patient's medical history includes chemotherapy treatment for NSCLC and palliative care. The patient has multiple comorbidities including septic shock, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia/pancytopenia, respiratory failure, oliguria, partial small bowel obstruction versus motility disorder, loculated right pleural effusion, hypok"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient received a blood transfusion due to a low platelet count but experienced a further decrease in platelets.
- The patient's antibiotic therapy was restarted, and cultures are pending.
- Lasix was changed from a gel to an IV infusion.
- An ultrasound of the upper extremities did not show any deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- A chest X-ray revealed a tracheostomy tube positioned 5.5 cm above the carina, distended right mainstem bronchus, no change in pleural effusions, and left basal atelectasis. Right upper lobe atelectasis is present, likely due to post-obstruction.
- The patient's temperature is elevated at 101.8°F, and blood cultures were sent twice, pending results.
- Allergies include morphine and sulfa-based antibiotics.
- The last doses of antibiotics were administered on 02/10/2113 at 07:21 PM for vancomycin, 02/11/2113 at 12:00 AM for cefepime, 02/11/2113 at 12:00 AM for ciprofloxacin, and 02/11/2113 at 05:06 AM for metronidazole.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV NSCLC on palliative chemotherapy who presented from a nursing home with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. She has been in the ICU for 13 days and has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, oliguria, partial small bowel obstruction vs. motility disorder, loculated right pleural effusion, hypokalemia, elevated liver function tests, and thrombocytopenia/pancytopenia. The patient's prognosis is extremely poor due to her underlying cancer and current clinical condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CMV/AC settings, indicating acute respiratory failure. There is a concern for hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to volume overload and infection. The patient's lungs are coarse and rhonchi are heard at the right base, suggesting ongoing pulmonary issues.
2. Oliguria: The patient has been oliguric since admission, with a positive fluid balance. Despite this, her creatinine levels have not significantly increased. Lasix has been given to promote diuresis, but ongoing oliguria may indicate intrinsic renal dysfunction.
3. Partial Small Bowel Obstruction vs. Motility Disorder: The patient has evidence of bowel obstruction or a motility disorder, as indicated by the presence of significant stool production and abdominal distension. This could potentially lead to further complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with neutropenic fever, who received two units of platelets due to a low platelet count. He has been experiencing anxiety and requires higher doses of fentanyl for pain management. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a sinus tachycardia. His respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set Vt of 400 mL, RR set at 15, PEEP at 8 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and an RSBI of 160. His blood gases show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 218 and a pH of 7.43.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a WBC count below the normal range, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count below the normal range, anemia with a Hct of 23.7%, and elevated levels of lactate, LDH, and liver enzymes. Imaging shows an increased blunting of the diaphragm on the left side and increased basilar infiltrate on the right side. Blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has neutropenic fever, which increases the risk of infection. The presence of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia further compromises the immune system, making the patient more susceptible to infections.
2. Respir"

s & synthetic function worsen
   # Respiratory Failure: Acute, hypoxic, likely [**1-10**] volume overload &
   infection as patient nearly 14L length of stay positive.  No changes in
   ventilator settings over past 24 hours and unlikely to make
   improvements until significant diuresis.
   - Increase Lasix 40 mg IV to [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Wean as tolerates
   # Oliguria: Started lasix gtt [**2-9**] with excellent response (-1200), but
   held due to hypotension. Cr stable at 0.6.
   - Increase Lasix 40mg IV daily to 40mg [**Hospital1 7**]

   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes
   # Partial SBO vs. Motility Disorder: Clinically patient producing
   significant stool with bowel sounds and CT abd/pel with ?partial
   obstruction vs ileus. Surgery consulted in ED and feel patient not a
   surgical candidate.  Patient at goal for tube feeds, making stool.  C.
   Diff negative.
   - Continue tube feeds at goal rate today
   - F/U cultures
   - Repeat C. diff
   # Loculated Right Pleural Effusion: s/p IP drainage of 400 ccs of fluid
   on [**2113-2-7**], drained 350cc again [**2-10**]. Gram stain negative and cultures
   negative. LDH eff/LDH serum = 0.72, suggestive of exudative process;
   most likely malignancy.
   - Drain pleurex q3 days
   # Elevated LFTs: Improving. Likely secondary to septic shock.
   -Trend daily
   # Access: Has a femoral CVL and femoral A line.  Will have tunneled 3
   port catheter placed on [**2-13**] & will need PLTs>50 for procedure.
   - Transfuse 1u PLT

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presents from a nursing home with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. The patient's condition is critical, and there are multiple potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already in septic shock, which can progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure likely due to volume overload and infection. Improving respiratory function may be challenging without significant diuresis.
3. Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia secondary to chemotherapy-induced marrow suppression. Transfusion goals include HCT>21 and plts>10. Close monitoring of blood counts is essential.
4. Partial Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) vs. Motility Disorder: The patient has a partial SBO or motility disorder, which can lead to complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation if not managed appropriately.
5. Loculated Right Pleural Effusion: The patient has a loculated right pleural effusion likely secondary to malignancy. Repeated drainage may be necessary, and infection should be monitored.
6. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are elevated but improving. Trend"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of neutropenic fever. They have been receiving multiple units of platelets due to a very low platelet count. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/80 mmHg to 103/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. 

The patient's physical examination shows edematous sclera, supple neck, coarse lung sounds, regular heart rhythm, tense abdomen without distension, well-perfused extremities with significant anasarca, and normal neurologic function. 

The laboratory results show low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated temperature, normal sodium, potassium, and glucose levels. The platelet count has improved from 5 to 33 after receiving platelet transfusions. Other lab values include elevated lactate, low albumin, and slightly abnormal liver function tests.

Radiology imaging shows an increase in blunting of the diaphragm on the left and increased basilar infiltrate on the right. Microbiology results for blood cultures are pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient likely has sepsis with a suspected pulmonary source. Blood cultures are pending, and she is being treated with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and metronidazole. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65.

2. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count (WBC) due to chemotherapy. She has been responding well to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and her WBC count is increasing.

3. Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which is a result of chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression. She has received platelet transfusions and her platelet count is now 25.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload and infection. She is on mechanical ventilation and her ventilator settings will be adjusted as necessary.

5. Oliguria: The patient has been producing less urine, but this may be due to hypotension. Diuretics"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. She has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including sepsis, febrile neutropenia, respiratory failure, oliguria, partial small bowel obstruction vs. motility disorder, loculated right pleural effusion, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, receiving multiple intravenous medications including antibiotics, diuretics, and supportive care. She also has central venous and arterial lines in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock and was diagnosed with sepsis likely due to a pulmonary source. However, it cannot be ruled out that there may still be a gastrointestinal source of infection.
2. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient has febrile neutropenia, which is a medical emergency commonly seen in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. It is characterized by a fever in the presence of neutropenia (low white blood cell count).
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which may be due to volume overload and infection. She is currently on mechanical ventilation to support her breathing.
4. Oliguria: The patient has oliguria, which refers to decreased urine output. This"

   [**Doctor Last Name 293**]/gemcitabine last dose 2/25 presents from NH with
   nausea/vomiting/diarrhea and febrile neutropenia in septic shock, now
   with recovering WBC and no longer in shock.
   # Sepsis: Blood cultures from [**2113-2-6**] negative, but blood cultures 3/04
   & [**2-11**] pending.  Not requiring pressure support.
   - d/c antibiotics
   - F/U pending blood cultures
   - f/u U/A & Urine culture
   - Discuss Methylprednisolone dose with BMT, until then continue 50mg
   [**Hospital1 7**], day 7
   # Febrile Neutropenia: Last fever on [**2-10**] to 101. s/p [**Doctor Last Name **]/Gemcitabine
   [**2-2**] (day 11post-chemo), expect nadir on day [**9-21**] and recovery ~day
   21. On GSCF day 7. WBC 2.3 up from 0.1 since admission with left shift
   suggesting response to GCSF.
   - Continue GCSF per Onc recs, day 7
   - Monitor counts daily
   - F/U outstanding culture data
   - F/U Onc recs, consider d/c GSCF
   # Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia: [**1-10**] to marrow suppression from
   chemotherapy. Hct 25.6 yesterday. Transfusion goals HCT>21, plts >10.
   Platelets 18. Coagulation panel stable.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] CBC
   - Transfusion goals as above (except for procedure goals)
   - Check DIC panel if LFT
s & synthetic function worsen
   # Respiratory Failure: Acute, hypoxic, likely [**1-10**] volume overload &
   infection as patient nearly 14L length of stay positive.  No changes in
   ventilator settings over past 24 hours and unlikely to make
   improvements until significant diuresis.
   - restart lasix drip, gentle diuresis as BP tolerates
   - Wean as tolerates
   # Oliguria: Started lasix gtt [**2-9**] with excellent response. Cr stable at
   0.6.
   - Goal diuresis negative 1L today
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes
   # Partial SBO vs. Motility Disorder: Not tolerating tube feeds since
   yesterday with bilious leakage around g-tube site.  No feedings for >
   24 hours.
   - attempt restarting tube feeds this afternoon.
   - F/U stool culture, c.diff
   # Loculated Right Pleural Effusion: s/p IP drainage of 400 ccs of fluid
   on [**2113-2-7**], drained 350cc again [**2-10**]. Gram stain negative and cultures
   negative. LDH eff/LDH serum = 0.72, suggestive of exudative process;
   most likely malignancy.
   - Drain pleurex q3 days
   # Elevated LFTs: Improving. Likely secondary to septic shock.
   -Trend daily
   # Access: Has a femoral CVL and femoral A line.  Will need replacement
   at some point, may depend on goals of care discussion
   # Goals of care: Overall prognosis poor without demonstrable clinical
   improvement. Length before anticipated recovery of WBCs, respiratory
   status unknown, but patient not a candidate for further chemotherapy.
   Prognosis poor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented from a nursing home with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. She has been recovering from chemotherapy and is now experiencing several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient had blood cultures from 2/11 that are pending, and she is no longer in septic shock but still requires close monitoring.
2. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient had a fever on 2/10 and received chemotherapy on 2/2 (day 11 post-chemo). Her white blood cell count is expected to reach a nadir on day 9-21 and recover around day 21. She is receiving granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and her WBC count has improved from 0.1 to 2.3.
3. Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 18, and her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is 25.6. She has had marrow suppression due to chemotherapy. Her transfusion goals are HCT > 21% and platelets > 10.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to volume overload and infection. There have been no changes in ventilator settings over the"

   56 yo F with stage IV NSCLC, on palliative chemotherapy s/p
   [**Doctor Last Name 293**]/gemcitabine last dose 2/25 presents from NH with
   nausea/vomiting/diarrhea and febrile neutropenia in septic shock, now
   with recovering WBC and no longer in shock.
   # Sepsis: Blood cultures from [**2113-2-6**] negative, but blood cultures 3/04
   & [**2-11**] pending.  Not requiring pressure support.
   - d/cd most antibiotics  yesterday, continues on Ciprofloxacin 400
   mg IV Q12H, can likely discontinue this.
   - F/U pending blood cultures
   - Discuss methylprednisolone dose with BMT, until then continue 50mg
   [**Hospital1 7**], day 7
   # Febrile Neutropenia: Last fever on [**2-10**] to 101. s/p [**Doctor Last Name **]/Gemcitabine
   [**2-2**] (day 11post-chemo), expect nadir on day [**9-21**] and recovery ~day
   21. WBC 16.4 up from 0.1 since admission with left shift suggesting
   response to GCSF.
   - GCSF discontinued yesterday, suspect that leukocytosis is from
   overshoot of GCSF and not infectious etiology as pt is afebrile and
   without other signs of infection.
   - Monitor counts daily
   - F/U blood cultures
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia: [**1-10**] to marrow suppression from
   chemotherapy. Hct stable at 30.3. Platelets 41, lagging but this is to
   be expected. Coagulation panel stable.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] CBC
 QD given that counts are coming up.
   # Respiratory Failure: Acute, hypoxic, likely [**1-10**] volume overload as
   patient 10.8L LOS positive.  No changes in ventilator settings over
   past 24 hours and unlikely to make improvements until significant
   diuresis.
   - continues on lasix drip, gentle diuresis as BP tolerates
   - Wean as tolerates
   # Oliguria: Started lasix gtt [**2-9**] with excellent response. Cr stable at
   0.8.
   - Goal diuresis negative 1L today
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes
   # Partial SBO vs. Motility Disorder: Not tolerating tube feeds since
   [**2-12**] with bilious leakage around g-tube site.
   - restarted tube feeds yesterday without problems.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] negative.
   # Loculated Right Pleural Effusion: s/p IP drainage of 400 ccs of fluid
   on [**2113-2-7**], drained 350cc again [**2-10**]. Gram stain negative and cultures
   negative. LDH eff/LDH serum = 0.72, suggestive of exudative process;
   most likely malignancy.
   - Drain pleurex q3 days
   # Access: Has a femoral CVL and femoral A line.  Will need replacement
   at some point, may depend on goals of care discussion.
   # Goals of care: Overall prognosis poor without demonstrable clinical
   improvement. Length before anticipated recovery of WBCs, respiratory
   status unknown, but patient not a candidate for further chemotherapy.
   Prognosis poor.

   conversation this afternoon with daughter.
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on palliative chemotherapy. She presented to the hospital with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. She is now recovering with improving white blood cell count and no longer in shock. The patient's current conditions include sepsis, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia/pancytopenia, respiratory failure, oliguria, partial small bowel obstruction (SBO) vs. motility disorder, loculated right pleural effusion, and access issues with femoral central venous line (CVL) and arterial line (AL).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, and there is a possibility of recurrent infection if blood cultures are positive or if she develops a new infection.
2. Febrile Neutropenia: Although the patient's fever has resolved, she is still at risk for febrile neutropenia due to her low platelet count and recent chemotherapy treatment.
3. Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia: The patient's platelet count remains low, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure likely due to volume overload. She may require further interventions to manage her respiratory status.
5. Oliguria: The patient has oliguria,"

   daily
   # Febrile Neutropenia: Last fever on [**2-10**] to 101. s/p [**Doctor Last Name **]/Gemcitabine
   [**2-2**] (day 14 post-chemo), expect nadir on day [**9-21**] and recovery ~day
   21. WBC 27.3 today.  GCSF stopped [**2113-2-13**]. leukocytosis is likely from
   overshoot of GCSF and not infectious etiology as pt is afebrile and
   without other signs of infection.
   - Monitor counts daily
   - F/U blood cultures
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia: [**1-10**] to marrow suppression from
   chemotherapy. Hct stable. Platelets 61. Coagulation panel stable.
   - daily CBC.
   # Respiratory Failure: Acute, hypoxic, likely [**1-10**] volume overload as
   patient 10.8L LOS positive.  Excellent diuresis yesterday on lasix gtt.
   No changes in ventilator settings over past 24 hours.
   - continues on lasix drip, diurese as BP tolerates.
   - Wean sedation
   # Fluid Overload: Started lasix gtt [**2-9**] with excellent response. Cr
   stable at 0.9. With diuresis of > 3L, possible contraction alkalosis
   with bicarb of 40, K 3.1, Cl 90.
   - continue lasix gtt
   - follow I/Os
   - replete KCl
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes
   # Partial SBO vs. Motility Disorder: Restarted tube feeds [**2-13**] w/o
   problems, now at goal.  C. Diff negative. Restarted tube feeds
   yesterday without problems.
   - Continue TF at goal.
   # Loculated Right Pleural Effusion: s/p IP drainage of 400 ccs of fluid
   on [**2113-2-7**], drained 350cc again [**2-10**]. Gram stain negative and cultures
   negative. LDH eff/LDH serum = 0.72, suggestive of exudative process;
   most likely malignancy.
   - Drain pleurex q3 days
   # Access: Has a femoral CVL and femoral A line.  Planned replacement of
   femoral access by IR today.
   # Goals of care: Appreciate palliative care input. Per discussion with
   daughter (HCP) she is full code.  Appreciate palliative care input.
   - restart home medications, including opioids, benzodiazepenes.

","The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. She has since recovered from the shock and now has a recovering white blood cell count. The patient has been on palliative chemotherapy and received her last dose on February 25th. 

The patient's current condition includes:
- Sepsis: All blood cultures have been negative, and the patient is only on ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV Q12H. She may be able to discontinue this medication.
- Febrile Neutropenia: The patient's last fever was on February 10th at 101°F. She received gemcitabine on day 14 post-chemo, with an expected nadir on day 9-21 and recovery around day 21. Her WBC count is currently 27.3. G-CSF was stopped on February 13th, and leukocytosis is likely due to overshoot of G-CSF rather than an infectious etiology.

   Assessment and Plan
   56 yo F with stage IV NSCLC, on palliative chemotherapy s/p
   [**Doctor Last Name 293**]/gemcitabine last dose 2/25 presents from NH with
   nausea/vomiting/diarrhea and febrile neutropenia in septic shock, now
   with recovering WBC and no longer in shock, made full code yesterday by
   daughter [**Name (NI) **] is health care proxy
   # Sepsis: All blood cultures negative to date, most recent drawn
   [**2113-2-14**].  Only on cipro.  Urine cloudy.
   - d/cd most antibiotics  yesterday, continues on Ciprofloxacin 400
   mg IV Q12H, can likely discontinue this.
   - F/U pending blood cultures
   - Discuss methylprednisolone dose with BMT, until then continue 50mg
   daily
   # Febrile Neutropenia: Last fever on [**2-10**] to 101. s/p [**Doctor Last Name **]/Gemcitabine
   [**2-2**] (day 14 post-chemo), expect nadir on day [**9-21**] and recovery ~day
   21. WBC 27.3 today.  GCSF stopped [**2113-2-13**]. leukocytosis is likely from
   overshoot of GCSF and not infectious etiology as pt is afebrile and
   without other signs of infection.
   - Monitor counts daily
   - F/U blood cultures
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia: [**1-10**] to marrow suppression from
   chemotherapy. Hct stable. Platelets 61. Coagulation panel stable.
   - daily CBC.
   # Respiratory Failure: Acute, hypoxic, likely [**1-10**] volume overload as
   patient 10.8L LOS positive.  Excellent diuresis yesterday on lasix gtt.
   No changes in ventilator settings over past 24 hours and unlikely to
   make improvements until significant diuresis.
   - continues on lasix drip, gentle diuresis as BP tolerates
   - Wean as tolerates
   # Oliguria: Started lasix gtt [**2-9**] with excellent response. Cr stable at
   0.9. With diuresis of > 3L, possible contraction alkalosis with bicarb
   of 40.
   - Goal diuresis negative 1L today
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes
   # Partial SBO vs. Motility Disorder: Restarted tube feeds [**2-13**] w/o
   problems, now at goal.  C. Diff negative
   - restarted tube feeds yesterday without problems.
   # Loculated Right Pleural Effusion: s/p IP drainage of 400 ccs of fluid
   on [**2113-2-7**], drained 350cc again [**2-10**]. Gram stain negative and cultures
   negative. LDH eff/LDH serum = 0.72, suggestive of exudative process;
   most likely malignancy.
   - Drain pleurex q3 days
   # Access: Has a femoral CVL and femoral A line.  Planned replacement of
   femoral access by IR today.
   # Goals of care: Appreciate palliative care input. Per discussion with
   daughter (HCP) she is full code.

The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath. Due to the patient's inability to provide history, sedation was necessary. The patient has allergies to morphine, unknown sulfa medications, and experiences nausea/vomiting. Various antibiotics have been administered since admission. The patient is currently on furosemide, fentanyl, and midazolam infusions, as well as other ICU medications. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 98 bpm (88-113), blood pressure ranging from 89/58 mmHg to 169/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute (13-35), and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,694 mL, with 558 mL given through PO, 604 mL through TF, and 1,049 mL through IVF. Total output includes 5,625 mL of blood products, 1,390 mL of urine, and negative balances in NG, stool, and drains.

   nausea/vomiting/diarrhea and febrile neutropenia in septic shock, now
   with recovering WBC and no longer in shock, made full code yesterday by
   daughter who is health care proxy.
   # Sepsis: All blood cultures negative to date, most recent drawn
   [**2113-2-14**].  Only on cipro.  Urine cloudy.
   - d/c
ed most antibiotics yesterday, continues on Ciprofloxacin 400
   mg IV Q12H, can likely discontinue this.
   - F/U pending blood cultures
   - Discuss methylprednisolone dose with BMT, until then continue 50mg
   daily
   # Febrile Neutropenia: Last fever on [**2-10**] to 101. s/p [**Doctor Last Name **]/Gemcitabine
   [**2-2**] (day 14 post-chemo), expect nadir on day [**9-21**] and recovery ~day
   21. WBC 27.3 today.  GCSF stopped [**2113-2-13**]. leukocytosis is likely from
   overshoot of GCSF and not infectious etiology as pt is afebrile and
   without other signs of infection.
   - Monitor counts daily
   - F/U blood cultures
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia: [**1-10**] to marrow suppression from
   chemotherapy. Hct stable. Platelets 61. Coagulation panel stable.
   - daily CBC.
   # Respiratory Failure: Acute, hypoxic, likely [**1-10**] volume overload as
   patient 10.8L LOS positive.  Excellent diuresis yesterday on lasix gtt.
   No changes in ventilator settings over past 24 hours.
   - continues on lasix drip, diurese as BP tolerates.
   - Wean sedation
   # Fluid Overload: Started lasix gtt [**2-9**] with excellent response. Cr
   stable at 0.9. With diuresis of > 3L, possible contraction alkalosis
   with bicarb of 40, K 3.1, Cl 90.
   - continue lasix gtt
   - follow I/Os
   - replete KCl
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolytes
   # Partial SBO vs. Motility Disorder: Restarted tube feeds [**2-13**] w/o
   problems, now at goal.  C. Diff negative. Restarted tube feeds
   yesterday without problems.
   - Continue TF at goal.
   # Loculated Right Pleural Effusion: s/p IP drainage of 400 ccs of fluid
   on [**2113-2-7**], drained 350cc again [**2-10**]. Gram stain negative and cultures
   negative. LDH eff/LDH serum = 0.72, suggestive of exudative process;
   most likely malignancy.
   - Drain pleurex q3 days
   # Access: Has a femoral CVL and femoral A line.  Planned replacement of
   femoral access by IR today.
   # Goals of care: Appreciate palliative care input. Per discussion with
   daughter (HCP) she is full code.  Appreciate palliative care input.
   - restart home medications, including opioids, benzodiazepenes.

   nausea/vomiting/diarrhea and febrile neutropenia in septic shock, now
   with recovering WBC and resolution of shock.
   # Sepsis: Resolved. All blood cultures negative to date, most recent
   drawn [**2113-2-14**].  Cipro discontinued [**2-15**].
   - F/U pending blood cultures
   - Discuss methylprednisolone dose with BMT, until then continue 50mg
   daily
   # Febrile Neutropenia: Last fever on [**2-10**] to 101. s/p [**Doctor Last Name **]/Gemcitabine
   [**2-2**] (day 14 post-chemo), expect nadir on day [**9-21**] and recovery ~day
   21. WBC 41.8 today.  GCSF stopped [**2113-2-13**]. leukocytosis is likely from
   overshoot of GCSF and not infectious etiology as pt is afebrile and
   without other signs of infection.
   - Monitor counts daily
   - F/U blood cultures
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia: [**1-10**] to marrow suppression from
   chemotherapy. Hct stable. Platelets 104. Coagulation panel stable.
   - daily CBC.
   # Respiratory Failure: Acute, hypoxic, likely [**1-10**] volume overload as
   patient was 10.8L LOS positive.  Diuresed 7L on lasix gtt. No changes
   in ventilator settings over past 24 hours.
   - continues on lasix drip, diurese as BP tolerates.
   - Wean sedation; attempt trach collar trial today.
   # Fluid Overload: Started lasix gtt [**2-9**] with excellent response. Cr
   stable at 1.0. With diuresis of > 3L, possible contraction alkalosis
   with bicarb of 42, Cl 88.  K yesterday late evening was 2.8, given 40
   po K and 40 IV K. This AM, K 5.2, will recheck this in the afternooon
   to ensure it trends down.
   - continue lasix gtt

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the hospital with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. She has been recovering from sepsis, with all blood cultures negative to date. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count has improved, indicating a recovering condition. She is currently on palliative chemotherapy and experienced a nadir of WBC count after the last round of chemotherapy. 

The patient also has thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia due to chemotherapy-induced marrow suppression. Her hemoglobin (Hct) level is stable, and her platelet count is at 104. The coagulation panel is stable as well. 

The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly, with a reduction in ventilator support. She is now on a tracheostomy tube and receiving supplemental oxygen. 

The patient had fluid overload initially but responded well to lasix gtt, which resulted in a diuresis of more than 3 liters. Her creatinine (Cr) level remains stable at 1.0. 

The patient had a partial small bowel obstruction (SBO) but has restarted tube feeds without any issues. 

Additionally, the patient has a loculated right pleural effusion, which was drained previously. Cultures from the drained fluid were negative, suggesting an exudative process, likely related"

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected septic shock secondary to community-acquired pneumonia. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure of 130/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2.

The patient's recent events include discontinuing ciprofloxacin, restarting home medications, placement of a tunneled line (femoral Hickman), weaning from glycerol trinitrate (gtt's), drainage of 350cc from the pleurex catheter, and holding lasix gtt's due to an elevated potassium level of 2.8. The patient's electrolyte imbalances also show an increased bicarbonate level of 44 and a creatinine level of 1.0.

The patient's medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), and other ICU medications. The patient has allergies to morphine and sulfa (sulfonamide antibiotics), as well as nausea/vomiting.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who presented from a nursing home with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. She is now recovering from sepsis, with negative blood cultures to date. The patient's white blood cell count has recovered, and she is no longer in shock. 

The patient had febrile neutropenia after receiving chemotherapy on 2/25. Her fever resolved on 2/10, and her WBC count is currently 41.8. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was stopped on 2/13, and leukocytosis is likely due to overshoot of G-CSF rather than an infectious etiology. 

The patient also experienced thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia due to chemotherapy, which has now resolved. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable, and her platelet count is 104. The coagulation panel remains stable.

The patient was diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely secondary to volume overload, and was given lasix to help with diuresis. The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.0. 

The patient had fluid overload, but has responded well to lasix, resulting in the diuresis of >3L. There is a concern for contraction alkalosis with a bic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer who presented to the ICU with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and febrile neutropenia in septic shock. She has since recovered from sepsis and febrile neutropenia, with negative blood cultures. Her white blood cell count has increased to 41.8, indicating recovery. The patient is still experiencing thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia due to chemotherapy, with a platelet count of 104 and stable hematocrit. She is also dealing with respiratory failure, possibly caused by volume overload, and fluid overload, for which she is on lasix drip. The patient's potassium levels were initially low but have improved after repletion. She has a history of partial small bowel obstruction versus motility disorder, loculated right pleural effusion, and established access through a tunneled port catheter in the left femoral vein. The patient's goals of care include full code status, and her home medications have been restarted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may continue to experience respiratory failure due to underlying lung cancer and potential complications from chemotherapy.
2. Fluid Overload: There is a risk of fluid overload due to ongoing diuresis and the patient's current fluid status.
3. Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia: The patient may continue to experience low platelet"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a chief complaint of neutropenic fever and septic shock. The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) and lung, and presents with impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, hypotension (not in shock), superior vena cava syndrome (SVC), small bowel obstruction (SBO), respiratory failure, acute neutropenia, and septic shock. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including methylprednisolone,oxicet, ativan, fentanyl patch, standing reglan, and compazine. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 141/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 659 mL, output of 187 mL, and a balance of -3,136 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 400 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR set at 13, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and RSBI of 59. The patient's lab results show leukopenia with a WBC count of 2.3 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 18 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging and microbiology results are pending. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's neutropenic fever and septic shock indicate a high risk of infection. The pending blood cultures suggest a possible ongoing infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure, along with the need for mechanical ventilation, poses a risk for further respiratory complications.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and potential systemic complications.
4. Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVC): The patient's SVC syndrome can lead to complications such as edema, pulmonary congestion, and respiratory distress.
5. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient's small bowel obstruction may result in complications like bowel ischemia, perforation, and sepsis.
6. Acute Kidney Injury: The elevated creatinine levels indicate potential renal dysfunction, which could progress to acute kidney injury.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's alteration in nutrition due to impaired oral intake and potentially reduced absorptive surface area from SBO can lead to malnutrition and associated complications.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who presented to the ICU with neutropenic fever and septic shock. She has a history of palliative chemotherapy and was previously admitted to the hospital for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient's white blood cell count is currently recovering from a nadir of 42.7 K/uL after chemotherapy. She is on a fentanyl patch for pain control and has been tapered off other opioid medications per palliative care recommendations.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock, but her condition has resolved, and all blood cultures have been negative.
2. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient had febrile neutropenia, which was managed with antibiotics. Her fever resolved, and her WBC count is now recovering.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced acute respiratory failure due to hypoxia and likely volume overload. She was diuresed with Lasix and her fluid balance is now stable.
4. Partial Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) vs. Motility Disorder: The patient had a partial SBO, which was managed by restarting tube feeds without any problems. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) was negative.
5. Loculated Right Pleural Effusion: The patient had a loculated right pleural effusion that was drained twice. The fluid analysis"
