   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo M with ESLD from alcohol and hepatitis C on transplant list,
   pulmonary hypertension and hypothyroidism who presents with altered
   mental status.
   # altered mental status: likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.
   Per his mother, he has been taking his medications but only having
   about 2 bowel movements per day. DDx also includes infection (CXR clear
   and ascites fluid did not suggest infection and u/a was negative),
   medications (recently started medications for cramping including
   cyclobenzaprine, hyoscyamine and magnesium, some of which may
   contribute to confusion. Was given lactulose in the ED with bowel
   movement afterwards. His mental status seems improved currently.
   -lactulose titrated to [**3-25**] bowel movements per day
   -hold sedating medications
   -f/u cultures
   .
   # primary respiratory alkylosis: likely secondary to anxiety or pain
   and he is tachycardic which supports this idea. He denies pain
   currently. Would like to avoid sedating medications in a patient with
   end stage liver disease as I would like to extubate him tonight.
   -monitor ABGs for now. If alkylosis worsens, may need to lower his RR
   with sedation or try to lower pressure support.
   -will likely improve post extubation
   .
   # nausea and vomiting: likely gastroenteritis or could be from new
   medications for muscle spasms including magnesium which dose was
   recently increased.
   -no sign of currently nausea or emesis. Will monitor.
   .
   # ascites: no evidence of infection with WBC low in the ascites fluid.
   He is distended and will need paracentesis.
   -follow up ascites culture
   .
   # ESLD: secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C. Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1174**] on
   transplant list. Tbili is more elevated than his baseline of [**3-25**]
   (current 7)
   -continue rifaximine, lactulose
   -Hepatology aware and appreciate consult
   -u/s with doppler of the liver
   -continue lasix and spironolactone
   -paracentesis in AM
   .
   # pulmonary hypertension: continue iloprost and sildenafil.
   .
   # respiratory support: currently intubated for airway protection given
   altered mental status.
   -consider pressure support trial
   -would like to extubate tonight if mental status improves.
   .
   # hypothyroidism: continue levothyroxine
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now. Hope to extubate. Received IVF in ED.
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ for DVT ppx, omeprazole [**Hospital1 7**] for GI ppx per home
   regimen.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 41-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) from alcohol and hepatitis C, who is currently in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status. 

The patient received lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, which seems to have improved his mental status. His vital signs show tachycardia (heart rate of 118 bpm) and normal blood pressure (128/86 mmHg). He is slightly hyperventilating with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of bilirubin (total and direct), liver enzymes (ALT and AST), and a low white blood cell count. Other labs show normal potassium and sodium levels, but slightly elevated blood glucose.

The patient's physical examination reveals jaundice, scleral icterus, and distended abdomen. He is anxious and follows simple commands. There are no signs of cyanosis or clubbing in his extremities.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Altered mental status: likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose has been started, and the patient's mental status seems improved. It is recommended to continue lactulose and monitor for any worsening of symptoms.

2. Primary respiratory alkalosis: likely secondary to anxiety or pain. The patient is tachycardic, which supports this idea. It is advised"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) due to alcohol and hepatitis C. He is on the transplant list. He has pulmonary hypertension and hypothyroidism. The patient presents with altered mental status, which is likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. He was given lactulose in the emergency department, which resulted in bowel movements and an improvement in his mental status. His current vital signs are within normal range, with a heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 128/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is awake and alert but somewhat disoriented. He denies nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. He does not remember the events that led to his admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver disease. It is important to monitor his mental status and continue with lactulose therapy to reduce ammonia levels.
2. Infection: The patient has elevated white blood cell count with a left shift, suggesting a possible infection. However, the ascites fluid does not show signs of infection. It is important to continue monitoring his white blood cell count and follow up with cultures from the peritoneal fluid.
3. Volume overload: Despite being on diuretics,"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 41-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) from alcohol and hepatitis C, who is currently on the transplant list.
- He presents with altered mental status, likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. The patient was given lactulose, which resulted in an improvement in his mental status.
- The patient has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, but it has since resolved. This could be due to new medications for muscle spasms, including magnesium, which was recently increased.
- The patient has ascites and is distended. There is no evidence of infection in the ascitic fluid, but follow-up cultures are planned. Paracentesis is needed to relieve the distension.
- The patient has an elevated white blood cell count with a left shift, which is concerning for infection. However, the peritoneal fluid does not show more than 250 polymorphonuclear leukocytes and does not present a picture of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient is afebrile and asymptomatic, so antibiotics have been withheld for now.
- The patient has anemia with a hematocrit level of 29.0, which appears to be baseline and likely due to chronic liver disease. Monitoring and transfusion will be based on symptoms or hematocrit levels below 21.
- The patient also has thromboc"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) from alcohol and hepatitis C, who is listed for a transplant. He also has pulmonary hypertension and hypothyroidism. The patient presents with altered mental status, likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. He took an overdose of trazodone before the event and responded well to lactulose, which resulted in bowel movements and improved mental status. 

The patient's primary respiratory alkalosis has resolved, and he has been extubated. He has no signs of nausea or vomiting currently. However, he has ascites without evidence of infection and will require paracentesis. His elevated white blood cell count with left shift is concerning for infection, but peritoneal fluid does not show signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient is afebrile and asymptomatic, so antibiotics have been withheld for now. 

The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, both of which are likely due to chronic liver disease. He has been followed by a hepatologist and is on the transplant list. His total bilirubin is elevated compared to his baseline and will be monitored with fractionated bilirubin. 

The patient's other conditions include pulmonary hypertension, for which he is receiving iloprost and sildenafil, and hypothyroidism, for which he is taking levothyroxine.

   In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 3402**] is an 41 yo male with cirrhosis, pulm HTN,
   admitted for airway protection x 2 in setting of hepatic encephalopathy
   .
   .
   1.       Altered mental status.  Patient intubated after an unwitness
   event of unclear etiology on floor  (?worsening hepatic encephalopathy,
   large volume para, seizure).  Improved with aggressive lactulose with
   good effect overnight and minimizing sedation (boluses of versed and
   fentanyl).  Extubated this morning.
   -          continue lactulose for >4 BMs/day and improvement of mental
   status
   -          ngt placement to allow adequate lactulose intake
   -          hold all further mind altering meds
   -          monitor mental status
   -          r/o infections
   2.       RLE weakness.   Continues to have limited RLE weakness in
   spite of increased alertness.  Concern for embolic event.
   -          f/u MRI brain
   -          f/u neck mra
   -          neuro following
   3.       Airway.  Intubated for airway protection, now extubated.
   4.       Cirrhosis.  History of alcohol and Hep C cirrhosis with grade
   1 varices.  ON transplant list.  Singnificant abdominal ascites on
   exam, though was tapped for 4 L two days ago.
   -          consider para today
   -          continue lactulose, lasix, spironolactone
   -           continue cipro prophylaxis
   5.       Pulmonary hypertension.
   -          ntinue slidenafil
   -          hold iloprost for now
   5.   Anemia/thrombocytopenia: baseline hct ~27, plt 70-90..

   - trend Hct, platelets
   6.       Hypothyroidism.  TSH was elevated 6.6->4.9, since [**2-25**] on
   75mcg synthroid.  increased levothyroxine to 88mcg/qdaily earlier
   during admission.
   -          continue synthroid
   7.       ?degenerative disk disease of cervical spine.  Finding noted
   on head CT.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, pulmonary hypertension, admitted for airway protection in the setting of hepatic encephalopathy. 

The patient had an unwitnessed event of unclear etiology on the floor, which may have worsened his hepatic encephalopathy and potentially led to a seizure. He was intubated but improved with aggressive lactulose treatment and was extubated in the morning. 

The patient continues to have limited right lower extremity weakness, raising concerns for an embolic event. Further evaluation with MRI brain and neck MRA is recommended. 

The patient's airway is currently protected, but he may require further interventions to manage his condition. 

He has a history of alcohol and Hepatitis C cirrhosis with grade 1 varices and is on the transplant list. He also has significant abdominal ascites, which was tapped two days ago. 

The patient is being treated with lactulose, Lasix, spironolactone, and ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. 

He also has pulmonary hypertension and is being treated with sildenafil. 

The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, with a baseline hematocrit of approximately 27% and platelet count of 70-90. 

Additionally, the patient has hypothyroidism and is being treated with levothyroxine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and cirrhosis, originally admitted after being intubated for airway protection from acute on chronic liver failure (AMS) thought to be hepatic encephalopathy. He is now found unresponsive with hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of ESLD with cirrhosis, pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), and was recently started on cyclobenzaprine, magnesium, hyoscyamine, trazodone, which may have contributed to his current condition. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure, likely related to encephalopathy/delta MS. The etiology is unclear, but it could be hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient may have hepatic encephalopathy, as indicated by the symptoms of altered mental status. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-inch tall, 75.3 kg individual admitted to the ICU with an altered mental status and respiratory distress. They were evaluated by neurology due to right lower extremity weakness and underwent urgent brain MRI and neck MRA. The patient's heart rate has been progressively tachycardic, reaching 140s, and did not respond to versed but responded to fentanyl. Ammonia levels were found to be elevated at 286, and a head CT showed degenerative disk disease. The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin and adhesive bandage (topical). They have been on various infusions and other ICU medications.

Physical examination revealed the patient to be not well nourished, thin, tachycardic, and had symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds. The abdomen was soft, non-tender, with bowel sounds present, distended, and positive for ascites. Extremities showed positive edema bilaterally. Neurologic examination was not assessed due to the patient's altered mental status.

Laboratory results include elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, high ammonia, elevated potassium, low sodium, low magnesium, normal calcium, and elevated liver enzymes. Blood glucose levels were within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurological complications: The patient's symptoms of right lower extremity weakness and elevated ammonia levels suggest a possible neurological issue. Further assessment is needed to"

   41 yo male with cirrhosis (EtOH/HCV) and hepatic encephalopathy found
   down on the floor with pool of saliva intubated for mental status now
   improved, without clear explanation for why he declined.
    > Respiratory failure: unclear etiology to his decline in mental
   status. There was no clear precipitating event: infection, bleed (Hct
   stable), cardiac event (nl ECG) or addition of new sedating
   medications. At baseline he likely has impaired respiratory function
   from his ascites which causes a functional restrictive vent deficit.
   His acute decline could represent a worsening of his encephalopathy
   (NH3 286) evidence of head bleed on CT or  seizure on EEG. Marked
   improvement in mental status. Extubated [**2147-10-28**]. Sputum culture is
   likely to be oral flora base on appearance of CXR and clinical
   improvement, will defer treatment
   - Pulmonary toilet, HOB elevation
 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY / ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: no evidence of head
   bleed or seizure. Markedly improved with lactulose.  Notably EEG did
   not reveal seizure. There is no clear precipitant for his decline.
   - Cont lactulose and rifax (will likely need an NG tube)
   - Restart lasix and spironolactone
   - Will likely need a repeat paracentesis in the near future will confer
   with liver service.
   - Avoid sedation
   - Cont Cipro for SBP prophylaxis
   - Vitamin K for 3 day
   - F/[**Location 39**] read of the MRI
   > Right leg weakness: Neuro team concerned for right leg weakness, will
   f/u MRI/A still with decreased right leg .  Appreciate neurology input:
   he still has some right lower leg weakness
   > Thrombocytopenia: likely [**1-21**] underlying cirrhosis and sequestration.
    > Pulmonary Hyptertension: likely [**1-21**] underlying liver disease
   (?hepatopulmonary syndrome). The current presentation is not consistent
   with decompensated pulm hypertension. Can cont the sildenafil for now
   and restart illoprost when more awake.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy who was found down on the floor with a pool of saliva. He was intubated for mental status improvement, but the cause of his decline in mental status is unclear. There were no clear precipitating events such as infection, bleeding, cardiac event, or addition of new sedating medications. The patient's acute decline could represent a worsening of his encephalopathy or a seizure. However, marked improvement in mental status was observed, and the patient was extubated on 10/28. The sputum culture is likely to be oral flora based on the appearance of the chest X-ray and clinical improvement, so treatment will be deferred.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy who was found down on the floor with a pool of saliva. He was intubated for mental status decline. The cause of his respiratory failure is unclear, but it may be related to impaired respiratory function due to ascites. There is a concern for worsening encephalopathy, intracranial bleed, seizure, or progressive hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypertension. Laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and metabolic acidosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a potential complication of liver cirrhosis, characterized by altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction. It can lead to coma if not treated promptly.
2. Intracranial bleed: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and the acute decline in mental status, there is a concern for intracranial bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
3. Seizure: The patient's altered mental status may increase the risk of seizures, which can further worsen his condition if not managed appropriately.
4. Pulmonary hypertension: Chronic liver disease can lead to pulmonary hypertension, which can cause shortness of breath, fatigue, and other respiratory symptoms.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis (EtOH/HCV) and hepatic encephalopathy. He was found down on the floor with a pool of saliva and intubated for mental status improvement. The patient's respiratory failure has unclear etiology, and there is no clear precipitating event such as infection, bleed (stable Hct), cardiac event (nl ECG), or addition of new sedating medications. The patient's acute decline could represent worsening of his encephalopathy (NH3 286) or evidence of head bleed on CT or seizure on EEG. However, the patient's mental status has markedly improved after starting lactulose. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition is characterized by confusion, altered level of consciousness, and other neurological symptoms due to liver dysfunction. The patient's mental status improvement with lactulose suggests that hepatic encephalopathy may be a contributing factor.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is impaired due to ascites, which causes a functional restrictive vent deficit. This can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.

3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient may have underlying liver disease causing pulmonary hypertension, which can worsen over time if not treated.

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo male with cirrhosis (EtOH/HCV) and hepatic encephalopathy found
   down on the floor with pool of saliva intubated for mental status now
   improved, without clear explanation for why he declined.
    > Respiratory failure: unclear etiology to his decline in mental
   status. There was no clear precipitating event: infection, bleed (Hct
   stable), cardiac event (nl ECG) or addition of new sedating
   medications. At baseline he likely has impaired respiratory function
   from his ascites which causes a functional restrictive vent deficit.
   His acute decline could represent a worsening of his encephalopathy
   (NH3 286) evidence of head bleed on CT or  seizure on EEG. Marked
   improvement in mental status after starting lactulose. Extubated
   [**2147-10-28**]. Sputum culture is likely to be oral flora base on appearance
   of CXR and clinical improvement, will defer treatment
   - Pulmonary toilet, HOB elevation
   - cont lactulose as below
 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY / ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: no evidence of head
   bleed or seizure. Markedly improved with lactulose.  Notably EEG did
   not reveal seizure. There is no clear precipitant for his decline other
   then worsening hepatic encephalopathy. He is markedly improved this
   morning.
   - Cont lactulose and rifax (will likely need an NG tube)
   - Restart lasix and spironolactone
   - Will likely need a repeat paracentesis in the near future will confer
   with liver service.
   - Avoid sedation
   - Cont Cipro for SBP prophylaxis
   - Vitamin K for 3 day
   - F/[**Location 39**] read of the MRI
   > Right leg weakness: Neuro team concerned for right leg weakness, will
   f/u MRI/A still with decreased right leg .  Appreciate neurology input:
   he still has some right lower leg weakness
   > Thrombocytopenia: likely [**1-21**] underlying cirrhosis and sequestration.
    > Pulmonary Hyptertension: likely [**1-21**] underlying liver disease
   (?hepatopulmonary syndrome). The current presentation is not consistent
   with decompensated pulm hypertension. Can cont the sildenafil for now
   and restart illoprost when more awake.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. He was found down on the floor with a pool of saliva and intubated for mental status improvement. His respiratory function is impaired due to ascites, which causes a functional restrictive vent deficit. There is no clear precipitating event for his decline in mental status, but improvement is observed after starting lactulose. He is extubated now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is already impaired due to ascites. This can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver disease. It can cause altered mental status and neurological symptoms.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient may have underlying liver disease that can lead to pulmonary hypertension. This can cause right ventricular dysfunction and other cardiac complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Right leg weakness: The patient has right leg weakness, which may be due to neurological issues. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of infections, particularly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), given his cirrhosis and ascites.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's liver disease puts him at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially if there are varices present.
8. Seizures: The patient's history of hepatic encephalopathy increases the risk of seizures.

Please note that this is a summary of the progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 41-year-old male with cirrhosis, pulmonary hypertension, admitted for airway protection due to hepatic encephalopathy.
- He experienced an unwitnessed event of unclear etiology on the floor, leading to intubation. His mental status improved with aggressive lactulose therapy and minimizing sedation, and he was extubated the next morning.
- He continues to have limited right lower extremity weakness, raising concerns for an embolic event.
- He has a history of alcohol and Hepatitis C cirrhosis with grade 1 varices, significant abdominal ascites, and is on the transplant list.
- He is being treated with lactulose, lasix, spironolactone, ciprofloxacin, sildenafil, and levothyroxine.
- He has anemia and thrombocytopenia with a baseline hematocrit of 27% and platelets around 70-90K.
- He has hypothyroidism, which is being managed with synthroid.
- There are findings of degenerative disk disease in the cervical spine, but further imaging is pending improvement.
- In the ICU, he is receiving nutritional support through tube feeds, close monitoring of glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3402**] is an 41 yo male with cirrhosis, pulm HTN, admitted for
   airway protection x 2 in setting of hepatic encephalopathy .
   .
   1.       Altered mental status.  Patient intubated after an unwitness
   event of unclear etiology on floor  (?worsening hepatic encephalopathy,
   large volume para, seizure).  Improved with aggressive lactulose with
   good effect overnight and minimizing sedation (boluses of versed and
   fentanyl).  Extubated early yesterday.
   -          continue lactulose for >4 BMs/day and improvement of mental
   status. Change to PO.
   -          hold all further mind altering meds
   -          Infectious workup
   -          Guaiac stools.
   2.        ?RLE weakness.   Concern that was not withdrawing to pain;
   now that alert has full strength.  Did have MRI which was
   unremarkable.
   -          neuro following, appreciate recs.
   3.       Airway.  Intubated for airway protection, now extubated.
   4.       Cirrhosis.  History of alcohol and Hep C cirrhosis with grade
   1 varices.  ON transplant list.  Singnificant abdominal ascites on
   exam, though was tapped for 4 L two days ago.  Continues to drain from
   that site > 2 L overnight.
   -          continue lactulose, lasix, spironolactone
   -           continue cipro prophylaxis
   -          Consider suture to para site, will d/w liver.
   5.       Pulmonary hypertension.
   -          continue slidenafil and iloprost.
           6.   Anemia/thrombocytopenia: baseline hct ~27, plt 70-90..
   Drop in hct since yesterday, but was 29 the prior day.
                       - guaiac stools.
                        - trend Hct, platelets
   7.     Hypothyroidism.  TSH was elevated 6.6->4.9, since [**2-25**] on 75mcg
   synthroid.  increased levothyroxine to 88mcg/qdaily earlier during
   admission.
   -          continue synthroid

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with cirrhosis, pulmonary hypertension, and hepatic encephalopathy. He was admitted for airway protection and has shown improvement with lactulose treatment. He has been extubated and is now on a diet of Nutren Pulmonary. The patient's mental status is altered, and he has a history of alcohol and Hep C cirrhosis with grade 1 varices. He is on the transplant list. The patient has significant abdominal ascites, which continues to drain from the site overnight. He also has RLE weakness, but his strength has returned to normal. An MRI of the brain did not show any abnormalities. The patient has hypothyroidism and requires adjustment of levothyroxine dosage. He also has anemia and thrombocytopenia, with a drop in hemoglobin levels since yesterday. He is being monitored for potential complications such as DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and he is being considered for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a common complication of cirrhosis. It can lead to confusion, disorientation, and coma if not properly managed.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension, which can"

   CXR [**10-29**]: improved lung volumes.
   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo male with cirrhosis (EtOH/HCV) and hepatic encephalopathy found
   down on the floor with pool of saliva intubated for mental status now
   improved, without clear explanation for why he declined.
    > Respiratory failure: unclear etiology to his decline in mental
   status. There was no clear precipitating event: infection, bleed (Hct
   stable), cardiac event (nl ECG) or addition of new sedating
   medications. At baseline he likely has impaired respiratory function
   from his ascites which causes a functional restrictive vent deficit.
   His acute decline could represent a worsening of his encephalopathy
   (NH3 286) evidence of head bleed on CT or  seizure on EEG. Marked
   improvement in mental status after starting lactulose. Extubated
   [**2147-10-28**]. Sputum culture is likely to be oral flora base on appearance
   of CXR and clinical improvement, will defer treatment
   - Pulmonary toilet, HOB elevation
   - cont lactulose as below
 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY / ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: no evidence of head
   bleed or seizure. Markedly improved with lactulose.  Notably EEG did
   not reveal seizure. There is no clear precipitant for his decline other
   then worsening hepatic encephalopathy. He has now improved to his
   baseline.
   - Cont lactulose and rifax (will likely need an NG tube)
   - Lasix and spironolactone
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need a repeat paracentesis in the near future will confer with
   liver service.
   - Avoid sedation
   - Cont Cipro for SBP prophylaxis
   - Vitamin K (cont for now)
   - he may need a stitch at the paracentesis site (will d/w liver)
   > Anemia:  unexplained drop in Hct. No evidence of hemolysis (LDH
   trending down). Will recheck HCT now.  He has been guiace negative.
   There was a report of pink colored ascites yesterday, possibly
   contributing to lower Hct.
   - Recheck Hct (if conts low will need to more actively reverse INR)
   > Right leg weakness: Neuro team concerned for right leg weakness, the
   MRI/A has revealed chronic changes. The right lower weakness has
   resolved
    > Thrombocytopenia: likely [**1-21**] underlying cirrhosis and sequestration.
   Counts have been stable.
    > Pulmonary Hyptertension: likely [**1-21**] underlying liver disease
   (?hepatopulmonary syndrome). The current presentation is not consistent
   with decompensated pulm hypertension. Can cont the sildenafil for now
   and restart illoprost when more awake.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. He was found down on the floor with a pool of saliva and was intubated for mental status improvement. The patient's respiratory function is impaired due to his ascites, which causes a functional restrictive vent deficit. There was no clear precipitating event for his decline in mental status. The patient's mental status improved after starting lactulose, indicating hepatic encephalopathy. There is no evidence of head bleed or seizure. The patient has improved to his baseline and is now extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's impaired respiratory function from his ascites and the possibility of worsening hepatic encephalopathy could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status decline is consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, which can be worsened by the accumulation of ammonia and other toxins in the bloodstream due to liver dysfunction.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization. The presence of pink colored ascites suggests the possibility of an infection in the ascitic fluid.
4. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and prolonged prothrombin time increase his risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient may have underlying pulmonary hypertension secondary to liver"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo male with cirrhosis (EtOH/HCV) and hepatic encephalopathy found
   down on the floor with pool of saliva intubated for mental status now
   improved, without clear explanation for why he declined.
    > Respiratory failure: unclear etiology to his decline in mental
   status. There was no clear precipitating event: infection, bleed (Hct
   stable), cardiac event (nl ECG) or addition of new sedating
   medications. At baseline he likely has impaired respiratory function
   from his ascites which causes a functional restrictive vent deficit.
   His acute decline could represent a worsening of his encephalopathy
   (NH3 286) evidence of head bleed on CT or  seizure on EEG. Marked
   improvement in mental status after starting lactulose. Extubated
   [**2147-10-28**]. Sputum culture is likely to be oral flora base on appearance
   of CXR and clinical improvement, will defer treatment
   - Pulmonary toilet, HOB elevation
   - cont lactulose as below
 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY / ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: no evidence of head
   bleed or seizure. Markedly improved with lactulose.  Notably EEG did
   not reveal seizure. There is no clear precipitant for his decline other
   then worsening hepatic encephalopathy. He is markedly improved this
   morning.
   - Cont lactulose and rifax (will likely need an NG tube)
   - Restart lasix and spironolactone
   - [**Month (only) 51**] need a repeat paracentesis in the near future will confer with
   liver service.
   - Avoid sedation
   - Cont Cipro for SBP prophylaxis
   - Vitamin K for 3 day
   > Right leg weakness: Neuro team concerned for right leg weakness, will
   f/u MRI/A (no evidence of acute process) still with decreased right leg
   .  Appreciate neurology input: he still has some right lower leg
   weakness
   > Thrombocytopenia: likely [**1-21**] underlying cirrhosis and sequestration.
    > Pulmonary Hyptertension: likely [**1-21**] underlying liver disease
   (?hepatopulmonary syndrome). The current presentation is not consistent
   with decompensated pulm hypertension. Can cont the sildenafil for now
   and restart illoprost when more awake.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. He was found down on the floor with a pool of saliva and intubated for mental status improvement. The decline in mental status is unclear, but there were no clear precipitating events such as infection, bleeding, cardiac events, or the addition of new sedating medications. The patient's baseline likely includes impaired respiratory function due to ascites causing a functional restrictive vent deficit. Acute decline could represent worsening encephalopathy or evidence of head bleed or seizure. However, marked improvement was observed after starting lactulose. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: unclear etiology to his decline in mental status. The patient has impaired respiratory function from ascites, which can cause a functional restrictive vent deficit. This could worsen over time.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status improved with lactulose, indicating a possible diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition needs to be managed with lactulose and possibly rifaximin.
3. Right leg weakness: The patient has decreased right lower leg strength, and the neurology team is concerned for right leg weakness. Further evaluation with an MRI/A is recommended.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to underlying cirrhosis and sequestration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy who was found down on the floor with a pool of saliva and subsequently intubated for mental status improvement. The patient's respiratory function is impaired due to ascites, which causes a functional restrictive vent deficit. There is no clear precipitating event for his decline in mental status, but improvement is seen with the initiation of lactulose. The patient's sputum culture is likely to be oral flora based on the appearance of the chest X-ray and clinical improvement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's impaired respiratory function due to ascites may lead to respiratory failure. 
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's worsening hepatic encephalopathy could contribute to his decline in mental status.
3. Head bleed: There is evidence of a head bleed on CT, which could be a precipitating factor for the patient's decline.
4. Seizure: The patient had an EEG that did not reveal a seizure, but it is still a potential complication.
5. Anemia: The patient has an unexplained drop in hemoglobin concentration, indicating anemia.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be related to underlying cirrhosis and sequestration.
7. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient may have underlying liver disease-related pulmonary hypertension."

   Assessment and Plan
   41 yo male with cirrhosis (EtOH/HCV) and hepatic encephalopathy found
   down on the floor with pool of saliva intubated for mental status now
   improved, without clear explanation for why he declined.
    > Respiratory failure: unclear etiology to his decline in mental
   status. There was no clear precipitating event: infection, bleed (Hct
   stable), cardiac event (nl ECG) or addition of new sedating
   medications. At baseline he likely has impaired respiratory function
   from his ascites which causes a functional restrictive vent deficit.
   His acute decline could represent a worsening of his encephalopathy
   (NH3 286) evidence of head bleed on CT or  seizure on EEG. Marked
   improvement in mental status after starting lactulose. Extubated
   [**2147-10-28**]. Sputum culture is likely to be oral flora base on appearance
   of CXR and clinical improvement, will defer treatment
   - Pulmonary toilet, HOB elevation
   - cont lactulose as below
 HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY / ALTERED MENTAL STATUS: no evidence of head
   bleed or seizure. Markedly improved with lactulose.  Notably EEG did
   not reveal seizure. There is no clear precipitant for his decline other
   then worsening hepatic encephalopathy. He has now improved to his
   baseline.
   - Cont lactulose and rifax (will likely need an NG tube)
   - Lasix and spironolactone
   - Avoid sedation
   - Cont Cipro for SBP prophylaxis
   - Vitamin K (cont for now)
   - he may need a stitch at the paracentesis site (will d/w liver)
   > Anemia:  unexplained drop in Hct. No evidence of hemolysis (LDH
   trending down). Will recheck HCT now.  He has been guiace negative.
   There was a report of pink colored ascites yesterday, possibly
   contributing to lower Hct.
   - Recheck Hct (if conts low will need to more actively reverse INR)
   > Right leg weakness: Neuro team concerned for right leg weakness, the
   MRI/A has revealed chronic changes. The right lower weakness has
   resolved
    > Thrombocytopenia: likely [**1-21**] underlying cirrhosis and sequestration.
   Counts have been stable.
    > Pulmonary Hyptertension: likely [**1-21**] underlying liver disease
   (?hepatopulmonary syndrome). The current presentation is not consistent
   with decompensated pulm hypertension. Can cont the sildenafil for now
   and restart illoprost when more awake.
