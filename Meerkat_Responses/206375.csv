","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of asthma, who presented to the hospital with cough and shortness of breath. He became increasingly short of breath in the emergency room and was intubated due to hypercarbia. The patient has been sedated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He is currently febrile at 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 114 beats per minute, blood pressure of 83/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's EKG shows sinus tachycardia with no signs of ischemia. The physical examination reveals diffuse expiratory wheezes and scattered inspiratory rhonchi in the left lung. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.24, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (PaO2) of 462 on air. The chest X-ray shows subtle suprahilar infiltrates. The patient's assessment and plan include continuing ventilatory support, weaning as tolerated, continuing steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics. The patient is also being monitored for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and glycemic control."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of asthma who presented to the hospital with respiratory failure. He was intubated in the ER due to hypercarbia and given medications such as magnesium, prednisone, nebs, and avelox. The patient is currently stable on the ventilator and is febrile. 

24-hour events include an EKG, history obtained from housestaff, and no known drug allergies. The patient is unable to provide history as he is sedated. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for cough and dyspnea. 

Flowsheet data shows vital signs with a maximum temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.6 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate ranging from 114-116 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 83/46-115/54 mmHg, respiratory rate at 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,091 mL and output of 100 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 991 mL. 

Respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 486 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at 23 cmH2O, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 1,155. 

Physical examination findings include normal cardiovascular and peripheral vascular assessments, wheezing breath sounds in the respiratory/chest examination, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no edema in the extremities. Neurologic examination shows that the patient is sedated and not assessed for movement, tone, or response to stimuli. 

Labs show a white blood cell count of 162, hemoglobin of 23, and lactic acid level of 4.5. Imaging reveals a chest X-ray with subtle suprahilar infiltrates, and the ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no evidence of ischemia. 

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to an asthma exacerbation with possible pneumonia. Ventilatory support will continue, and weaning will be done as tolerated. Steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics will be continued. A follow-up with microbiology evaluation is also planned. 

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be dispositioned to the ICU. The total time spent with the patient is 37 minutes, and he is described as critically ill."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of asthma, who was admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient's influenza DFA returned negative, and oseltamivir and ramantidine were discontinued. Legionella Ag was also negative. The patient's lactate trended down from 5 to 2.3, and the PS was weaned to [**5-9**], with an ABG of 7.32/45/77. A CTA did not show PE but suggested relapsing polychondritis. The patient was consulted with a plan to evaluate before extubation. There was a spike overnight to 101.1, and panculture was done. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2186-10-24**] 05:00 AM (azithromycin) and [**2186-10-25**] 04:00 AM (ceftriaxone). Propofol infusion and other ICU medications are being administered. Heparin sodium prophylaxis was started on [**2186-10-25**] 04:00 AM. Other medications and medical history are noted. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Flow sheet data as of [**2186-10-25**] 07:35 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results. Physical examination findings are mentioned. Imaging and microbiology reports are provided. The assessment and plan include management of hypercarbic respiratory failure, community-acquired PNA coverage with ceftriaxone/azithro, solumedrol, repeat CXR, urine legionella antigen, and other interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's condition indicates difficulty in exhaling carbon dioxide, which can lead to respiratory acidosis and other complications if not managed properly.
2. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's history of asthma suggests a higher risk for further exacerbations, especially if the underlying triggers are not addressed.
3. Infection: The presence of gram-negative diplococci and GPC pairs/clusters on the sputum gram stain indicates a possible bacterial infection, which needs to be treated promptly to avoid complications.
4. Relapsing polychondritis: The suggestion of relapsing polychondritis on the CTA needs further evaluation and management to prevent complications associated with this condition.
5. Pulmonary embolism: Although the CTA did not show PE, there is still a possibility of a pulmonary embolism due to the risk factors present.
6. Nosocomial pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia, which can lead to worsening lung infection and other complications.
7. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to the ICU stay and mechanical ventilation, which can result in gastrointestinal bleeding if not prevented.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of asthma who was transferred for management of hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient presented with respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, and an acute asthma exacerbation. The CT scan showed findings consistent with relapsing polychondritis, and the patient has been bronched for further evaluation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1°F, blood pressure ranging from 110/54 to 125/65 mmHg, heart rate between 75 and 108 beats per minute, respiratory rate between 14 and 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 16.2 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin (Hct) of 38.1%, elevated platelet count (Plt) of 188 K/uL, and normal creatinine (Cr) level of 1.2 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Microbiology results show the presence of gram-negative diplococci in the sputum culture. The patient has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics covering gram-negative organisms.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 447"

   -  ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
   seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
   normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The

","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of asthma who was transferred for management of hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently sedated and intubated on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, possibly due to relapsing polychondritis over an asthma exacerbation or infection. The preliminary results of the sputum culture showed gram-negative diplococci and gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. The respiratory culture is pending further results.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure of 102/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 30%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose, and lactic acid levels. The imaging shows less perihilar fullness on the chest X-ray.

The patient's medications include propofol for sedation, heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, and an H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's nutritional support consists of repletion with fiber.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection (considering the presence of gram-negative diplococci in the sputum culture), and complications related to relapsing polychondritis."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old male admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of relapsing polychondritis, which is a suspected trigger for his current condition. The patient's sputum culture showed only rare oral flora, and the gram stain of the tracheal biopsy did not show any microorganisms. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has been weaned off propofol sedation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 66 beats per minute, blood pressure of 103/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 30% FiO2. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube and CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The patient's physical examination reveals wheezes in the chest, no peripheral edema, and normal heart sounds. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's imaging shows no abnormalities on the chest X-ray. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory failure, which required mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the underlying cause, presumed relapsing polychondritis, is not adequately managed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old male admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with relapsing polychondritis and is currently on PSV ventilation. The sputum culture has been negative, suggesting a possible viral infection as the trigger. The patient's laryngeal/airway edema seen on flex bronch makes a trial of extubation deferred for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the PSV ventilation is not properly managed or if there is an inability to wean off mechanical ventilation.
2. Infectious Trigger: The negative sputum culture indicates a possible viral infection as the trigger for the patient's respiratory failure. Further investigation is needed to identify the specific pathogen causing the infection.
3. Laryngeal/Airway Edema: The presence of laryngeal/airway edema seen on flex bronch makes a trial of extubation deferred. This could potentially lead to complications during the weaning process and may require additional interventions.
4. Relapsing Polychondritis: The patient's diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis may contribute to ongoing respiratory distress and could lead to recurrent episodes of respiratory failure.
5. Medication Effects: The use of prednisone and other medications may have side effects or interactions that need to be monitored closely to prevent any adverse complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The cause of this condition is attributed to a flare-up of relapsing polychondritis. The patient was initially placed on mechanical ventilation but has now been successfully extubated. The patient's vital signs are stable, and they are following simple commands. Physical examination shows wheezes during expiration and rhonchi in the chest, along with warm skin and no signs of edema or cyanosis. The patient's lab results indicate normal values for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. However, there are elevated levels of lactate acid and lactic dehydrogenase. The patient's respiratory support has been adjusted to PSV/SBT mode with a set tidal volume of 623 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 0 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, with a heart rate of 58 bpm and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient's blood cultures show growth of respiratory mucosa with mixed inflammation and fibrino-inflammatory exudates. The patient's condition is being managed with antibiotics, corticosteroids, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's family has been informed about the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The cause of the respiratory failure was attributed to a flare of relapsing polychondritis. The patient's current condition is stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV), but a trial of extubation has been deferred due to laryngeal/airway edema seen on flexible bronchoscopy. There is suspicion of an infectious trigger, likely viral, as the sputum culture only showed oral flora, and tissue gram stain did not reveal any PMNs or organisms. Antibiotics were discontinued on 10/26. The patient was successfully extubated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway edema: The presence of laryngeal/airway edema poses a risk for airway compromise if the patient were to be extubated. This could lead to respiratory distress or failure.
2. Respiratory infection: Although the current infectious trigger is suspected to be viral, there is still a possibility of developing a bacterial infection while in the ICU. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially require the reintubation of the patient.
3. Relapsing polychondritis flare: The patient's underlying condition, relapsing polychondritis, can cause recurrent episodes of inflammation and damage to cartilage throughout the body. A flare-up of this condition could lead to further respiratory complications."

","The patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of asthma and relapsing polychondritis, who presented with respiratory failure. The patient was intubated but has now been successfully extubated and is doing well on room air. The initial assessment suggests that the respiratory failure could be due to an exacerbation of asthma or relapsing polychondritis. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 108/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's neurological status is also within normal limits.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.2 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin level of 13.2 g/dL, platelet count of 179 thousand/mm³, and creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL. Other lab values, including liver function tests and electrolytes, are within normal ranges.

The patient has been receiving various medications such as prednisone, ranitidine, and vitamins, and has been monitored closely for any potential complications. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and further management will involve continued monitoring, nutrition advancement as tolerated, and follow-up in rheumatology and pulmonary clinics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory distress, infection (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia), bleeding due to anticoagulation"

   Assessment and Plan
   42M with prior diagnosis of asthma, but probably relapsing
   polychondritis, presented with respiratory failure of unclear etiology,
   asthma exacerbation (less likely) vs relapsing polychondritis, now
   extubated, on room air, doing well.
   Will continue to monitor out of ICU and define course of steroids, with
   followup in rheumatology and pulmonary clinics.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old male with a history of asthma and suspected relapsing polychondritis. He presented with respiratory failure and has been in the ICU. The patient was intubated but has now been extubated and is doing well on room air.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 108/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's neurological status is described as attentive and able to follow simple commands.

The patient's laboratory results show normal values for hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, creatinine, and electrolytes. His blood glucose levels are within normal range. The PT/PTT/INR values are slightly elevated, while the liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's condition is being monitored closely, and he will continue to receive nutrition as tolerated and maintain glycemic control. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers are also in place. The patient's code status is full code, and he will be transferred to the floor for further care.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case may include respiratory distress due to asthma exacerbation or relapsing polychondritis. The patient will need close monitoring for any signs of respiratory deterioration and appropriate interventions such as bronchodilators or corticoster"
