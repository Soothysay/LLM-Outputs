   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   53yoF with history of remote gastric bypass; presented with one day of
   nausea/emesis progressing to unresponsiveness.  She was intubated at
   [**Location (un) 9927**] Hospital; head CT with diffuse cerebral edema, febrile
   to 104; given vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir and transferred to [**Hospital1 1**]
   ED.  She had difficulty oxygenating and evidence of ARDS
   radiographically, because of hypoxemia her PEEP was increased to 20 and
   she subsequently developed hypotension.  Initiated on pressors.  Neuro
   consult obtained recommending LP, however with concern for possible
   herniation LP was not performed.
   24 Hour Events:
   She received aggressive fluid resucitation with improvement in her BP
   (now off pressors) and improvement in lactate.  She was continued on
   her broad antibiotics with addition of oseltamivir and ampicillin.  She
   was placed on ARDSnet ventilation.  Arterial line was placed.  Urine
   output approximately 100ml/hr.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass who presented with nausea and vomiting that progressed to unresponsiveness.
- She was intubated at another hospital due to respiratory failure and diagnosed with diffuse cerebral edema, febrile to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.
- The patient was given broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir) and transferred to the current hospital.
- She developed hypotension and difficulty oxygenating, leading to the diagnosis of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
- The patient's condition improved with aggressive fluid resuscitation, and she was placed on ARDSnet ventilation.
- She is currently off pressors, with stable vital signs, and has improved urine output.
- The patient remains critically ill with suspected meningoencephalitis, sepsis, and ARDS.
- She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including coverage for influenza and meningitis pathogens.
- Neurology consultation is pending to discuss the safety of performing a lumbar puncture (LP) and management of cerebral edema.
- The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she is awaiting further diagnostic tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningoencephalitis: The patient's altered mental status, fever, and possible inability to perform LP indicate a potential central nervous system infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the source of infection is"

   radiographically, because of hypoxemia her PEEP was increased to 20 and
   she subsequently developed hypotension.  Initiated on pressors.  Neuro
   consult obtained recommending LP, however with concern for possible
   herniation LP was not performed.
   24 Hour Events:
   She received aggressive fluid resucitation with improvement in her BP
   (now off pressors) and improvement in lactate.  She was continued on
   her broad antibiotics with addition of oseltamivir and ampicillin.  She
   was placed on ARDSnet ventilation.  Arterial line was placed.  Urine
   output approximately 100ml/hr.

   - covered broadly with
   vancomycin/ceftriaxone/ampicillin/oseltamivir/acyclovir.
   - Neuro to follow and discuss safety of LP as well as management of her
   cerebral edema.
   - Will discuss with neuro regarding possible ICP monitoring, possible
   neurosurgery consult.
   - await viral studies, cultures, etc.
   - replace central line
   2.  Hypoxemic respiratory failure from ARDS, suspect due to septic
   shock versus aspiration.  Ppl 31, Vt 7ml/kg, Rate 30; PEEP 18, FiO2 0.8
   - Limited ability to allow permissive hypercapnea in setting of
   cerebral edema.  Will follow ABG, consider decrease in Vt to 5 or
   6ml/kg if will tolerate from a CNS standpoint.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a Ventilator mode of CMV/AutoFlow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 430 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The RSBI deferred due to elevated ICP, PEEP > 10, and hemodynamic instability. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 26 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 355, and Ve of 12.9 L/min. These findings suggest adequate oxygenation but may require further adjustments in ventilator settings to optimize gas exchange.

2. Meningitis: The patient's CSF analysis shows high protein, low glucose, and turbid fluid, which are indicative of bacterial meningitis. The presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (3+ 5-10 per 1000X FIELD) without microorganisms seen on gram stain suggests a bacterial cause. Cryptococcal antigen was not detected, and influenza testing was negative."

   monitor.
   - HOB elevation, manatol,hypenatremia, and hyperventilation to keep ICP
   < 20, pressors for CPP > 60; as currently well controlled, will back
   off on ventilation, then hypernatremia
   - Vanc/CTX/ampicillin/acyclovir
   - follow cultures
   - D/C oseltamivir as Ag negative
   - Neuro recs
   # Hypotension: lactate elevated appears septic. Also contribution from
   PEEP. Will bolus to drive down lactate.
   - levophed as above.
   .
   #Hypoxia: Looks like ARDS on CXR. Could be secondary to AMS->aspiration
   vs. influenza vs. overwhelming sepsis w/ ARDS. Not getting worse at
   night.
   - influenza swab
   - follow cultures
   - ARDSnet ventilation as possible
   .
   #Elevated cardiac enzymes: No STEMI on EKG, most likely demand in the
   setting of sepsis.
   - Trend enzymes
   - TEE when possible
   - consider cath when stable

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension presenting with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, encephalitis, and hypotension.

The patient's medical complications and potential risks include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a high tidal volume (430 mL), which may lead to further lung injury. The respiratory support needs to be carefully managed to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Bacterial Meningitis: The patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis suggests bacterial meningitis. The patient is already receiving appropriate antibiotics for this condition.

3. Elevated Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The patient has a high ICP of 25 mmHg, indicating increased pressure within the skull. This can be managed by elevating the head of bed, administering mannitol, and adjusting ventilation parameters to maintain ICP below 20 mmHg.

4. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and septic, as indicated by elevated lactate levels. Pressors are being used to maintain adequate blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).

5. Possible ARDS: The patient's chest X-ray shows features consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is a serious condition that requires careful management of fluid balance and"

   and evidence of bacterial meningitis.  Neurosurgery placed bolt for ICP
   monitoring and originally ICP of 25.  Received mannitol and hypertonic
   saline given evidence of elevated ICP.  She had rapid improvement of
   ICP after mannitol.  CPP within acceptable range.  Also increased Vt to
   430ml to help prevent acidosis/compensation.  Esophageal balloon placed
   given high PEEP; but her oxygenation improved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese female admitted with evidence of meningitis. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir. The patient's condition initially showed improvement, but she developed increased intracranial pressure (ICP) requiring mannitol and hypertonic saline. An ICP bolt was placed, and her ICP was successfully reduced. The patient's cardiac markers have peaked, indicating possible cardiac involvement. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with controlled blood pressure and heart rate. However, she remains critically ill in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Edema: The patient's increased ICP indicates cerebral edema, which can lead to further neurological deterioration if not managed appropriately.
2. Meningitis: Although the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the causative organism has not been identified yet. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of deterioration or complications related to meningitis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's cardiac markers have peaked, suggesting possible cardiac involvement. Further evaluation with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is recommended to assess"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with morbid obesity, admitted with evidence of meningitis. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir. The patient's condition has improved with the administration of mannitol and hypertonic saline for elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Her ICP is currently within an acceptable range, and her cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is also within an acceptable range. The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure and is being ventilated with a volume-controlled mode. She has been given fentanyl and midazolam for sedation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 124/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated troponin T levels. Imaging shows evidence of cerebral edema. The patient is receiving nutrition through a tube and is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cerebral Edema: The patient's head CT scan shows evidence of cerebral edema, which can potentially lead to further increases in ICP and decreased CPP. Close monitoring of ICP and CPP is necessary to prevent further neurological complications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension who was admitted with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. The patient's condition has been complex and has involved multiple medical complications. 

1. The patient had an ultrasound and echo performed, but the results are not mentioned in the note. 
2. Blood cultures were taken on December 20th at 5:33 PM.
3. The patient has been experiencing fever, with a maximum temperature of 102.5°F on December 20th at 4:00 PM.
4. The patient's ICPs have been stable around 10 and the hypertonic saline and mannitol were stopped. CPP remains stable off pressors.
5. The patient's PEEP was weaned.
6. Vancomycin trough levels were supertherapeutic, so the evening dose was held and the patient was switched to another hospital's ID recommended Vanc goal of approximately 20.
7. A lumbar puncture is recommended by Neuro on Monday.
8. Sodium levels continued to climb, and normal saline (NS) at 125 mL/hour was started. Tube feeds were held.
9. An arterial line changeover was done.
10. Allergies: No known drug allergies.
11. The last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin on December 20th at 2:00 PM, Acyclovir on December 20th at 11:50 PM, Ceftriaxone on December 20th at 11:51 PM, and Ampicillin on December 21st at 5:52 AM.
12. Infusions included Fentanyl at 50 mcg/hour and Midazolam (Versed) at 10 mg/hour.
13. Other ICU medications included Famotidine (Pepcid) on December 20th at 8:00 AM and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) on December 20th at 4:00 PM.
14. Other medications are not mentioned in the note.
15. There were no changes to medical and family history.
16. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. The patient has been diagnosed with likely bacterial meningitis and is currently being treated with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.5°F (Tmax: 39.2°C), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/79 mmHg to 92/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's ICP is stable around 10 and has been weaned off hypertonic saline and mannitol. The CPP is stable off pressors. The patient's PEEP has been decreased, and Vancomycin trough levels are supertherapeutic. 

The patient's sodium levels continue to climb, so normal saline has been started at 125 mL/hour. Nutrition has been held due to the patient's condition. 

The patient's arterial blood gases show a pH of 7.47, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 332, and a respiratory system compliance of 28 mL/cmH2O.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with suspected bacterial meningitis leading to cerebral edema, intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include fever (hypothermia), encephalitis, hypotension (not in shock), increased intracranial pressure (ICP), respiratory failure (acute, not ARDS), presumed bacterial meningitis, hypernatremia, and cardiac dysfunction.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Cerebral edema: The patient has increased ICP due to cerebral edema. This condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further neurological deterioration.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a need for continued respiratory support, and adjustments may be required based on the patient's response to treatment.

3. Bacterial meningitis: The patient is suspected to have bacterial meningitis. It is crucial to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the infection effectively. Regular monitoring of cultures and follow-up with appropriate adjustments in antibiotic therapy will be necessary.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which can have multiple potential reasons such as mannitol, hypertonic saline, or developing central DI. Close monitoring of serum sodium levels and appropriate management will be required.

5. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac markers have peaked, and there is a suspicion of seps"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with respiratory failure and cerebral edema, suspected bacterial meningitis. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to altered mental status and instability. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir) and her ICP has improved after mannitol/hypertonic saline and hyperventilation. An ICP monitor is in place, and an EEG will be done today to evaluate for seizures. Repeat LP is planned for Monday. The patient's respiratory support is going well, with oxygenation and ability to liberalize respiratory rate/high MV given short-lived benefit from hyperventilation and improved ICP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Presumed bacterial meningitis/cerebral edema: The patient's primary issue is presumed bacterial meningitis with cerebral edema. It is crucial to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitor ICP closely. Steroids may not be indicated at this time. Follow-up cultures and HSV PCR are pending.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure. Continuing acv support, oxygenating well, and liberalizing respiratory rate/high MV should be maintained. The patient's altered mental status and instability require close monitoring.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which could be due to multiple potential causes such as mannitol,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including:

1. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient has been febrile on multiple occasions.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[Doctor Last Name 2]): The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.
3. Encephalitis: The patient has signs of inflammation in the brain, indicated by altered mental status and diffuse cerebral edema.
4. Hypotension (not shock): The patient experienced an episode of low blood pressure, but it has since resolved.
5. Hypoxia: The patient had low oxygen levels at one point, but it has also resolved.
6. Tachycardia: The patient has an elevated heart rate, which is likely due to the inflammatory response.
7. Elevated cardiac enzymes: The patient's heart enzymes are elevated, suggesting possible cardiac damage, most likely secondary to sepsis.
8. Possible sepsis: The combination of fever, altered mental status, and elevated cardiac enzymes suggests the possibility of sepsis.
9. Meningitis: The patient has meningitis, as indicated by the presence of increased white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the improvement of intrac"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with respiratory failure and cerebral edema in the setting of suspected bacterial meningitis. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and acyclovir. Her condition is critical, and she is being closely monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis-myocardial dysfunction: The patient's cardiac markers have peaked, and there is suspicion of sepsis-myocardial dysfunction. Close monitoring of heart function and hemodynamics is essential.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which has been normalized. It is important to maintain sodium levels within the desired range and monitor for any signs of electrolyte imbalance.
3. Transaminitis: The patient shows signs of transaminitis, likely due to shock liver from hypotension. Close monitoring of liver function is necessary.
4. NGMA (Non-Gastrointestinal Motility Abnormalities): The patient has NGMA, possibly related to NS resuscitation. Monitoring of gastrointestinal motility and function is important.
5. Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing tachycardia, likely due to an inflammatory process, fever, insensible losses, and possible intravascular dryness. Monitoring heart rate and fluid status is crucial.
6. Systolic"

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with respiratory failure and cerebral edema in the setting of suspected bacterial meningitis. The patient remains minimally responsive but is still on sedation. The primary issues include presumed bacterial meningitis, cerebral edema, and altered mental status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure, instability, hypoxemia, and altered mental status. Continuous assisted ventilation support and oxygenation are ongoing.

2. Cerebral edema: The patient has cerebral edema, which is being managed with ICP monitoring, mannitol/hypertonic saline administration, and hyperventilation. EEG evaluation is planned to assess for seizures.

3. Bacterial meningitis: The patient has suspected bacterial meningitis, and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir) are being continued. Cultures and HSV PCR are being followed up.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, and the aim is to maintain sodium levels in the range of 145-150. Free water intake is being decreased to correct this electrolyte imbalance.

5. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis, which is likely a component of shock liver from hypotension. Liver function is improving slowly.

6. NGMA (non-gastric mucosal bleeding): The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension, who presented with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She is currently admitted to the ICU and is being treated for meningitis, respiratory failure, encephalitis, and hypotension. The patient's condition has shown some improvement, but she remains critically ill with ongoing medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient is already being treated for meningitis with antibiotics. However, there is a risk of treatment failure or recurrence if the causative organism is resistant to the current antibiotics or if the patient develops antibiotic resistance.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma from the positive pressure ventilation.

3. Encephalitis: The patient has encephalitis, which can lead to further neurological deterioration. There is a risk of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral edema.

4. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension previously, but it has resolved. There is still a risk of recurrent hypotension, especially if the patient develops septic shock or experiences a cardiac event.

5. Elevated Cardiac Enzymes: The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes, indicating possible cardiac damage. There is a risk of further myocardial injury or heart failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old female with hypertension presenting with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema.
- She has been intubated and sedated, and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has been diagnosed with meningitis, as evidenced by leukocytosis and fevers.
- An intraventricular bolt was placed but subsequently removed by neurosurgery.
- The patient's ICP is improving, but she remains unable to assess mental status due to sedation.
- A head CT with contrast did not provide sufficient information to assess for intracranial infection or leptomeningial disease.
- The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, requiring increased sedation and adjustment of ventilator settings.
- She has developed new bilateral pneumonia, which is suspected to be ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's sodium levels are being carefully monitored, and hypertonic saline and mannitol are being used to manage her cerebral edema.
- She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc, CTX, ampicillin, acyclovir) and further cultures and tests are pending.
- The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled with the use of pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient's presentation and laboratory results indicate meningitis. The choice of antibiotics may need to be adjusted based on the results of the CSF and blood cultures. If the infection does"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with hypertension who presented with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions including fever, respiratory failure, encephalitis, hypotension, and elevated cardiac enzymes.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms of fever and altered mental status could be indicative of meningitis. If left untreated, meningitis can lead to further deterioration in mental status and potentially life-threatening complications.

2. Cerebral edema: The presence of diffuse cerebral edema is concerning as it can increase intracranial pressure (ICP) and potentially cause brain herniation. Monitoring and managing ICP through measures such as elevating the head of bed, dextrose restriction, and use of hypertonic saline may be necessary to prevent further complications.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and weaning trials when appropriate are essential to minimize these risks.

4. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which if not properly managed, can lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential organ damage. Continuous monitoring and appropriate use of vasopressors may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of obesity admitted to the ICU for meningitis and respiratory failure. The patient remains on broad-spectrum antibiotics and is awaiting HSV PCR results to determine if acyclovir can be discontinued. 

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation in the assist-control mode with a set tidal volume of 430 mL, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 31 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 383, and Ve of 12.1 L/min.

Physical examination reveals that the patient does not awaken to voice or sternal rub, has equal and round pupils that are reactive, diffuse rhonchi and scattered wheezing in the chest, regular rapid respirations, and minimal edema in the extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 18.6 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 27.7%, slightly elevated platelet count (Plt) of 75 K/uL, normal creatinine (Cr) of 0.6 mg/dL, and elevated troponin-T level of 1"

   Assessment and Plan
   53F here with altered mental status, fever; LP consistent with
   meningitis and head CT initially with cerebral edema. Now s/p ICP
   monitoring given normalization of ICP.
   1.       Meningitis:  Leukocytosis.  Awaiting cultures.
   -  Will discuss with ID regarding the utility of repeat LP; preference
   is not to obtain unless will change our current management.
   - remains on broad antibiotics, awaiting HSV pcr so can discontinue
   acyclovir.
   2.       Respiratory Failure:
   - Oxygenation improved, ventilation adequate.
   - As wean sedation today, will move towards PSV if dysnchronous.
   - GNR in sputum, evolving CXR infiltrate, increased secretions and
   persistent fever: will broaden gram-negative coverage to include
   cefipime and discuss with ID re: meningitis dosing.
   3.       Cerebral Edema: ICP monitoring discontinued with improvement.
   -  will maintain Na 145-150 with hypertonic as needed.
   - Try to wake up, discontinue versed and use propofol if needed for
   agitation.
   - Will discuss if there is any need for repeat head CT.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a chief complaint of meningitis. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes obesity, and she is unable to provide her own history as she is sedated. No known drug allergies have been reported.

The patient remains on broad antibiotics while awaiting HSV PCR results. Her ICP monitoring has been discontinued due to improvement, but she is still on hypertonic saline. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 94 bpm, and a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100%.

The patient's physical examination reveals equal and reactive pupils, diffuse rhonchi, scattered wheezing, regular heart sounds, soft abdomen, and minimal edema. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly low platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has a history of meningitis, respiratory failure, and cerebral edema. The plan is to continue broad antibiotics, discuss the utility of repeat LP, and await HSV PCR results. Oxygenation has improved, and ventilation is adequate. The patient's sedation will be decreased, and she will be re-evaluated for mental status.

   Assessment and Plan
   53F here with altered mental status, fever; LP consistent with
   meningitis and head CT initially with cerebral edema. Now s/p ICP
   monitoring given normalization of ICP.
   1.       Meningitis:  Leukocytosis.  Awaiting cultures.
   -  Will discuss with ID regarding the utility of repeat LP given
   difficulty of obtaining this diagnostic study.
   - remains on broad antibiotics, awaiting HSV pcr so can discontinue
   acyclovir.
   2.       Respiratory Failure:
   - Oxygenation improved, ventilation adequate.
   - As wean sedation today, will move towards PSV if dysnchronous.
   - Does have GNR in sputum, persistent fevers; possible VAP. Will repeat
   CXR and if any evidence of infiltrate likely to broaden gram-negative
   coverage with cefepime.
   3.       Cerebral Edema: ICP monitoring discontinued with improvement.
   -  will maintain Na 145-150 with hypertonic as needed.
   - Try to wake up, discontinue versed and use propofol if needed for
   agitation.
   - Will discuss if there is any need for repeat head CT today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension who is currently in the ICU due to fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. The patient has been experiencing episodes of ectopy overnight and has had her potassium and magnesium levels repleted. She was switched to propofol to lighten sedation in order to better assess her mental status. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 131/76 mmHg to 192/111 mmHg, heart rate of 100 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's head rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and her CVP is within normal limits. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows improved bilateral opacities on chest X-ray. Microbiology results indicate the presence of gram-negative rods in the sputum, but further incubation is required for identification. 

Assessment and plan:
The patient is being treated for fever, respiratory failure, encephalitis, and hypertension. The plan includes weaning off propofol to evaluate mental status, elevating the head of bed, discontinuing hypertonic saline and mannitol, maintaining sodium levels above 140"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension, presenting with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She has been diagnosed with meningitis, respiratory failure, encephalitis, and hypertension. The patient's medical history includes recent neurosurgery to remove a bolt, for which she was admitted to the ICU. She is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Her condition has been complicated by fever, hypotension, and new bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating pneumonia. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), blood pressure ranging from 131/76 mmHg to 192/111 mmHg, heart rate between 94-120 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's neurological status is described as sedated and encephalopathic, with an altered mental status. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and platelet count within normal limits. Other lab values, including electrolytes, liver function tests, kidney function tests, and cardiac markers, are within normal ranges or show nonspecific findings. Imaging studies reveal diffuse opacities on chest X-ray and negative findings on head CT with contrast.

The patient's current plan includes continued treatment for meningitis with vancomycin, cefepime, and ampicillin,"

   Assessment and Plan
   53yoF with HTN, obesity; here with suspected bacterial meningitis.
   1.  Neuro:  Primary issue at this time is her neurologic status.
   - Will try to awaken, off propofol and perform neuro exam
   - No benzos
   - F/u EEG report
   - Discuss with ID and neuro regarding utility of additional imaging.
   2.  Respiratory Failure:  Barriers to extubation include her mental
   status, obesity.
   - check ABG today.
   - Will need to SBT when sitting upright,
   - Aim for diuresis today with TBB goal negative 1L today; lasix if
   needed (but currently auto-diuresising)
   - Decrease PEEP and PSV today as tolerated.
   3.  Meningitis:  No pathogen identified.  Vancomycin level 14.6; goal
   level 20.
   - now off acyclovir with HSV negative
   - Continue vancomycin, ampicillin, cefipime
   - If sputum cultures negative tomorrow (48h) will change from cefipime
   back to ceftriaxone

   Plan:
   1)       Hold sedation and monitor to see if neuro status improves
   2)       Change to Cefepime for probable VAP.  Cultures pending
   3)       Continue to allow for auto-diuresis
   Addendum: Follow-up EEG with video reveals seizure activity and
   therefore will load with Dilantin, will sedate for the moment and will

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a chief complaint of altered mental status and suspected meningitis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, meningitis, and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's vital signs show a fever (Tmax: 38.3°C), tachycardia (HR: 112 bpm), hypertension (BP: 146/86 mmHg), tachypnea (RR: 22 breaths/min), and normal oxygen saturation (SpO2: 98%). The patient's neurological status is poor, as she is unresponsive and has a seizure on EEG.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC: 18.6 K/uL), slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct: 32.3%), normal platelet count (Plt: 180 K/uL), elevated creatinine (Cr: 0.6 mg/dL), elevated troponin T (TropT: 1.00 ng/mL), and normal glucose levels (Glucose: 137 mg/dL). Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT: 66 U/L, AST: 25 U/L), decreased albumin (Albumin: 2.6 g/dL), and elevated lactate acid (Lactic Acid: 1.3 mmol/L).

   53yoF with HTN, obesity; here with suspected bacterial meningitis.
   1.  Neuro:  Primary issue at this time is her neurologic status.
   - Will try to awaken, off propofol and perform neuro exam
   - No benzos
   - F/u EEG report
   - Discuss with ID and neuro regarding utility of additional imaging.
   2.  Respiratory Failure:  Barriers to extubation include her mental
   status, obesity.
   - check ABG today.
   - Will need to SBT when sitting upright,
   - Aim for diuresis today with TBB goal negative 1L today; lasix if
   needed (but currently auto-diuresising)
   - Decrease PEEP and PSV today as tolerated.
   3.  Meningitis:  No pathogen identified.  Vancomycin level 14.6; goal
   level 20.
   - now off acyclovir with HSV negative
   - Continue vancomycin, ampicillin, cefipime
   - If sputum cultures negative tomorrow (48h) will change from cefipime
   back to ceftriaxone

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension and obesity, currently in the ICU for suspected bacterial meningitis. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 146/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 40%. She has a central venous pressure of 6 mmHg and fluid balance showing an input of 3,307 mL and output of 3,410 mL since 12 AM.

Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 18.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, platelet count of 75 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 1.00 ng/mL. Imaging shows improving bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, and microbiology results are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of her neurologic status, respiratory failure, and meningitis. Neurologic status will be monitored through attempts to awaken the patient off propofol and performing a neuro exam. Respiratory failure barriers to extubation include mental status and obesity, with plans to check ABG today, perform spontaneous breathing trial when sitting upright, aim for diuresis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension, presenting with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She has been diagnosed with meningitis and is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and her respiratory status has been improving. She has been experiencing fevers and seizures, and continuous EEG showed possible seizure activity. The patient's sodium levels need to be maintained above 140, and she is receiving antibiotics for suspected bacterial meningitis. There are concerns about intracranial infection/leptomeningial disease, and a repeat head CT with contrast is needed to assess this. The patient's pneumonia appears to be improving with cefepime therapy, but there may be a need to change back to ceftriaxone. There is also a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's glycemic control is being managed with regular insulin sliding scale.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient is still experiencing fevers and altered mental status, indicating ongoing inflammation of the meninges. If left untreated, meningitis can lead to severe complications such as brain abscesses, hearing loss, vision loss, and even death.
2. Seizures: The patient has been having seizures, which can be a direct result of the meningitis or the underlying cause. Seizures can increase the risk of injury and may require ongoing management with antiepile"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension presenting with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She has been diagnosed with meningitis and is currently being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and ampicillin. The patient's seizures have been controlled with dilantin. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There are concerns about possible encephalitis and the need for further neurologic evaluation. The patient also has pneumonia, and her sputum culture is growing yeast. She is receiving regular insulin for glycemic control and has multiple lines, including an arterial line. The patient is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. Her code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma should be monitored and managed appropriately.
2. Meningitis: The patient's condition requires close monitoring for any signs of deterioration or worsening of meningitis symptoms. Antibiotics should be continued as prescribed, and regular CSF/blood cultures should be followed.
3. Encephalitis: Given the patient's altered mental status and diffuse cerebral edema, encephalitis needs to be considered. Regular neurologic checks and follow-up with neurology consultants are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   53F with meningitis but no pathogen identified.
   1.       Meningitis:  WBC improving, persistent fevers, mental status
   improving and now able to follow commands
   - currently vancomycin, ampicillin, cefipime; will change from cefipime
   to ceftriaxone
   - await pneumococcal antigen from CSF
   - vanco trough tomorrow
   - Hold on steroids for time being, will discuss with ID in setting of
   meningitis (current ID recommendation is to not do steroids).
   2.       Seizures:  EEG positive yesterday, mental status improving
   with dilantin
   - continue dilantin
   - continuous EEG
   - Will attempt to wean versed later today and keep EEG monitoring
   3.       Respiratory Failure:  Intubated in setting of hypoxemia and
   airway protection.  Primary barrier to extubation is her mental status
   which is improving and her persistent high PEEP.  Secretions minimal.
   - wean PEEP, FiO2 as tolerated
   - Plan to SBT later today or tomorrow
   - continue to allow auto-diuresis, goal TBB negative at least 2L today;
   lasix as needed.
   4.       Fevers:  All cultures negative to date
   - LENIs.
   - Discuss repeat imaging.

   53 year old female with meningitis now with sub-clinical seizures.

   Discussion: much improvement of mental status presumably with
   dilantin.  Thus, steroids not current warranted given improvement and
   time elapse from disease onset.
   Plan:
   1)       Continue Dilantin
   2)       Diuresis to help with weaning
   3)       Heparin for DVT
   4)       Continue EEG monitoring.

   Assessment and Plan
   53F with meningitis but no pathogen identified.
   1.       Meningitis:  WBC improving, persistent fevers, mental status
   improving and now able to follow commands
   - currently vancomycin, ampicillin, cefipime; will change from cefipime
   to ceftriaxone
   - await pneumococcal antigen from CSF
   - vanco trough tomorrow
   - Hold on steroids for time being, will discuss with ID in setting of
   meningitis (current ID recommendation is to not do steroids).
   2.       Seizures:  EEG positive yesterday, mental status improving
   with dilantin
   - continue dilantin
   - continuous EEG
   - Will attempt to wean versed later today and keep EEG monitoring
   3.       Respiratory Failure:  Intubated in setting of hypoxemia and
   airway protection.  Primary barrier to extubation is her mental status
   which is improving and her persistent high PEEP.  Secretions minimal.
   - wean PEEP, FiO2 as tolerated
   - Plan to SBT later today or tomorrow
   - continue to allow auto-diuresis, goal TBB negative at least 2L today;
   lasix as needed.
   4.       Fevers:  All cultures negative to date
   - LENIs.
   - Discuss repeat imaging.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old female with obesity and hypertension who has been admitted to the ICU with meningitis. The suspected etiology of meningitis is bacterial. The patient's course has been complicated by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), which has now improved. The patient experienced continuous seizures and was started on dilantin. She also autodiuresed and restarted on versed while discontinuing precidex due to seizures.

The patient has received various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, acyclovir, cefipime, vancomycin, and ampicillin. She is currently on midazolam (versed) infusion, dilantin, famotidine (pepcid), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include changes to medical and family history, review of systems, and flow sheet data.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/86 to 108/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's height is 64 inches, and central venous pressure (CVP) is 13 mmHg. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 3,295 mL and output of 5,355 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,060 mL.

   24 Hour Events:
   Weened to [**8-10**], failed SBT after that with tachypnea, tachycardia, and
   hypertension. Tried to ween to PEEP of 5 but low PaO2 in am, back up to
   8.
   PM Na 134, restarted hypertonic saline, then normalized in am so
   stopped.
   LENIS positive for DVT, started on heparin. Checked with NS later given
   bolt removal and made the SS much less agressive. Needs head CT soon
   (see below).
   ID recommended head/spine CT with contrast to eval for hidden focus of
   infection (abscess) given continued fevers. Ordered but then noticed
   that head CT would be worthless with EEG leads on. Readdress in am.
   Following commands well.
   Given 20mg IV lasix to help with diuresis, worked well.
   Restarted some home diltiazem (30 QID)
   Dilantin level still a little low, increased dose to 400mg

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a chief complaint of meningitis. She has been in the ICU for several days and is currently experiencing fevers, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. The patient has been on various antibiotics including acyclovir, cefepime, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin. She is also receiving continuous EEG monitoring due to possible seizure activity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with DVT in her left profunda femoral vein. This condition can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism or further clot propagation.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and has a low respiratory system compliance. This indicates difficulty in weaning off the ventilator, which may result in prolonged mechanical ventilation or respiratory distress syndrome.

3. Encephalitis: The patient's altered mental status and continuous EEG showing possible seizure activity suggest encephalitis as a potential complication. This condition can progress to coma or permanent neurological damage if not managed appropriately.

4. Hypotension: The patient has episodes of hypotension, which can be caused by sepsis secondary to meningitis or other underlying conditions. Persistent hypotension can lead to organ failure and shock.

5. Pneumonia: The patient has developed bilateral pneumonia, which may be a nosocomial"

   24 Hour Events:
   Weened to [**8-10**], failed SBT after that with tachypnea, tachycardia, and
   hypertension. Tried to ween to PEEP of 5 but low PaO2 in am, back up to
   8.
   PM Na 134, restarted hypertonic saline, then normalized in am so
   stopped.
   LENIS positive for DVT, started on heparin. Checked with NS later given
   bolt removal and made the SS much less agressive. Needs head CT soon
   (see below).
   ID recommended head/spine CT with contrast to eval for hidden focus of
   infection (abscess) given continued fevers. Ordered but then noticed
   that head CT would be worthless with EEG leads on. Readdress in am.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension who was admitted with meningitis. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's fever has been low-grade, and there are findings of fluid overload or possible early pneumonia on chest X-ray. There is also an increasing leukocytosis, which may indicate an evolving infection. Other possible etiologies include known DVT and meningitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable with oxygen saturation at 94% on FiO2 50%. However, there is mild hypoxemia, likely related to fluid or possible infection. There is a small possibility of hypertensive flash pulmonary edema. The plan includes restarting AC setting on vent, lasix 20 mg IV, and antibiotics.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with LLE DVT. She is now on heparin drip with approval from Neurosurgery, with the goal of achieving a PTT of 60-80. Considering the patient's weight, she cannot be given Lovenox.

3. Meningitis: The patient's mental status continues to improve, but she is febrile and leukocytosis may be related to a lung source or CNS source. A head CT with contrast is needed to assess for subtle intracranial infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU since [**2109-12-19**] and has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), lower extremity fever, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and encephalitis.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's condition has been monitored closely. They experienced tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypertension during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) attempt and were unable to wean off supplemental oxygen. The patient's sodium level was initially low but normalized after restarting hypertonic saline. A Doppler ultrasound of the lower extremities revealed a positive finding for DVT, for which the patient was started on heparin.

Other notable interventions include the administration of IV lasix to aid with diuresis, restarting home diltiazem, and increasing the dose of dilantin due to low levels. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were acyclovir, cefipime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 99-115 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 126/65 mmHg to 203/119 mmHg, respiratory rate between 16-40 breaths per minute, and oxygen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension, presenting with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure and encephalitis. The patient has been diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in her lower extremity and has shown signs of pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics. She also has a history of meningitis, for which she is receiving appropriate treatment. The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of hypertension, tachycardia, and hypotension. She requires continuous EEG monitoring due to possible seizure activity. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with DVT in her lower extremity. If left untreated, DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia, which if not adequately treated, can progress to severe respiratory distress and sepsis.
3. Meningitis: Although the patient's mental status is improving, there is still a risk of complications from meningitis, such as brain abscess or septic emboli.
4. Seizure Activity: The patient's continuous EEG showed possible seizure activity, which, if not controlled, can result in further neurological complications.
5. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's blood pressure fluctuations"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension, who presented with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She has been diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis (DVT), respiratory failure, encephalitis, and hypertension. The patient's current condition includes meningitis, seizure activity, pneumonia, and possible hidden focus of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure activity: The continuous EEG showed possible seizure activity, which needs to be closely monitored and managed with appropriate antiseizure medications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support and requires careful monitoring and weaning off sedation for possible extubation.
3. DVT: The patient has been diagnosed with DVT and is on heparin therapy. Regular monitoring of the clotting parameters is necessary to ensure proper anticoagulation.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has new bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Close monitoring of the response to treatment and potential changes in antibiotic regimen are needed.
5. Meningitis: The patient's mental status is improving, but she still has fevers. Continuous monitoring for any signs of deterioration and following up with neurology and infectious disease recommendations are essential.
6. Possible hidden focus of infection: A head/spine CT with contrast is recommended to evaluate for any hidden intracranial infection or leptomeningial disease, considering the continued"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), respiratory failure, encephalitis, and possible meningitis. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ampicillin. She is currently on a heparin drip for DVT and has shown improvement in her pneumonia with cefepime. However, she still has fevers and possible seizure activity, as indicated by the continuous EEG.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms of fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema suggest the possibility of meningitis. This condition can lead to severe complications such as brain abscesses, increased intracranial pressure, and septic shock if left untreated.
2. Seizure activity: The continuous EEG showing possible seizure activity indicates a risk of further seizures, which can cause additional neurological damage and pose a threat to the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure requires close monitoring and management. If not properly treated, it can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis, resulting in multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The presence of DVT increases the risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She was found to have meningitis, which is an infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The patient also has respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation, and a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her left lower extremity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection acquired during or after mechanical ventilation.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): With multiple central lines in place, such as the PICC line and multi-lumen line, there is a risk of developing a bloodstream infection.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's DVT increases the risk of a blood clot dislodging and traveling to the lungs, causing a potentially life-threatening PE.
4. Meningitis-related complications: Despite treatment, the patient may experience complications related to meningitis, such as neurological deficits or septic shock.
5. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypertension and current presentation may lead to episodes of low blood pressure, which can compromise organ perfusion.
6. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status and EEG findings suggest an increased risk of seizures, which can be managed with appropriate ant"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with hypertension, who presented with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She was diagnosed with meningitis complicated by respiratory failure, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuating vital signs and ongoing infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to endotracheal intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation. This can be indicated by increasing leukocytosis, fever, and worsening respiratory status.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has already been diagnosed with DVT in the left lower extremity. If left untreated, it can lead to pulmonary embolism, which is a life-threatening complication.
3. Meningitis: The patient is suffering from meningitis, which is an infection of the meninges, the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It can result in severe neurological complications if not appropriately managed.
4. Hypotension: The patient has episodes of hypotension, which can be caused by septic shock or fluid overload. Proper fluid management and hemodynamic support are crucial to maintain adequate blood pressure.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient experiences persistent hypoxemia, indicating impaired oxygenation. This can be due to underlying lung pathology or fluid accumulation.

   53 yo F w/ HTN p/w fever altered mental status and diffuse cerebral
   edema and found to have meningitis complicated by respiratory failure,
   possible VAP and DVT
   # Fever: Febrile yesterday to 102.8 despite broadened antibiotic
   coverage for VAP yesterday. Central line removed and sent for culture,
   and mini bal performed yesterday, however no organisms were seen on GS.
   Leukocytosis stable since yesterday. CXR findings could be consistent
   with early multilobar pneumonia. Increasing leukocytosis also
   concerning for evolving infection.
   - Continue Cefepime for VAP coverage
   - follow up minibal results
   - Appreciate ID input
   - CT head and C spine per ID to evaluate for abscess
   - Continue Vanco/ampillin as noted below. Hold vanco for now pending
   level tomorrow morning
   # Hypoxemia/Respiratory status: Hypoxemic after BAL yesterday, and
   continued hypoxemia on gas this morning. However, sats now improved.
   Likely related to some degree of fluid or possible infection. Did not
   meet I/O goal yesterday. - restart AC setting on vent
   - lasix 40 mg Ivx1 with goal I/o negative 2 L
   - Antibiotics as noted above
   #  Meningitis: Mental status continues to improve. Febrile and
   leukocoytosis may be related to lung source vs CNS source. Head CT with
   contrast from OSH not sufficient to assess for subtle intracranial
   infection/leptomeningial disease.  Continuous EEG showed possible
   seizure activity and completed today. Dilantin level approaching
   therapeutic with increase dose. Change phenytoin to fosphenytoin
   yesterday.
   - HOB elevation
   - Maintain Na>140
   - Vanc/Cefepime/ampicillin
   - follow CSF/blood cultures/sputum cultures
   - f/u Neuro and ID recs
   - neuro checks q2 H
   - Phenytoin changed to fosphenytoin
   # DVT: LLE DVT on LENI [**12-25**]. Possible source of fevers. Now on heparin
   drip with approval from Neurosurgery with goal PTT 60
80. Can not
   consider Lovenox given patient weight.
   # Hypertension: Blood pressure much better controlled over last 24
   hours after starting betablocker. Pattern consistent with repiratory
   issues cause hypertension, rather than vice versa. Restarted diltiazem
   yesterday. Home dose of atenolol 25 mg daily, and she may be having
   some beta blocker withdrawal given htn/tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol and diltiazem. Will restart home atenolol once
   more stable.
   - lasix as above

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension, presenting with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She was found to have meningitis complicated by respiratory failure, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

The patient's fever is persisting despite broadened antibiotic coverage for VAP, and she remains febrile. The central line has been removed and sent for culture, and a mini-balloon percutaneous aspiration was performed, but no organisms were seen on gram stain. Leukocytosis is stable since yesterday. Chest X-ray findings could be consistent with early multilobar pneumonia. Increasing leukocytosis is also concerning for evolving infection.

In terms of management, the patient will continue on cefepime for VAP coverage, and follow-up mini-bal results are expected. ID input is appreciated, along with a CT head and C spine to evaluate for abscess. Vancomycin and ampicillin will be continued as noted below, with vancomycin held for now pending level tomorrow morning.

The patient's respiratory status has shown improvement in oxygen saturation levels. However, she remains hypoxemic after the mini-BAL procedure yesterday. The restart AC setting on the ventilator, along with lasix 40 mg IV q1 with goal I/O negative 2 L, will be implemented.

Regarding the meningitis, the patient's mental status continues to improve. She"

   # Fever: Febrile yesterday to 102.8 despite broadened antibiotic
   coverage for VAP yesterday. Central line removed and sent for culture,
   and mini bal performed yesterday, however no organisms were seen on GS.
   Leukocytosis stable since yesterday. CXR findings could be consistent
   with early multilobar pneumonia. Increasing leukocytosis also
   concerning for evolving infection.
   - Continue Cefepime for VAP coverage
   - follow up minibal results
   - Appreciate ID input
   - CT head and C spine per ID to evaluate for abscess
   - Continue Vanco/ampillin as noted below. Hold vanco for now pending
   level tomorrow morning
   # Hypoxemia/Respiratory status: Hypoxemic after BAL yesterday, and
   continued hypoxemia on gas this morning. However, sats now improved.
   Likely related to some degree of fluid or possible infection. Did not
   meet I/O goal yesterday. - restart AC setting on vent
   - lasix 40 mg Ivx1 with goal I/o negative 2 L
   - Antibiotics as noted above
   #  Meningitis: Mental status continues to improve. Febrile and
   leukocoytosis may be related to lung source vs CNS source. Head CT with
   contrast from OSH not sufficient to assess for subtle intracranial
   infection/leptomeningial disease.  Continuous EEG showed possible
   seizure activity and completed today. Dilantin level approaching
   therapeutic with increase dose. Change phenytoin to fosphenytoin
   yesterday.
   - HOB elevation
   - Maintain Na>140
   - Vanc/Cefepime/ampicillin
   - follow CSF/blood cultures/sputum cultures

   # DVT: LLE DVT on LENI [**12-25**]. Possible source of fevers. Now on heparin
   drip with approval from Neurosurgery with goal PTT 60
80. Can not
   consider Lovenox given patient weight.
   # Hypertension: Blood pressure much better controlled over last 24
   hours after starting betablocker. Pattern consistent with repiratory
   issues cause hypertension, rather than vice versa. Restarted diltiazem
   yesterday. Home dose of atenolol 25 mg daily, and she may be having
   some beta blocker withdrawal given htn/tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol and diltiazem. Will restart home atenolol once
   more stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension, admitted to the ICU for fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She was diagnosed with meningitis and has developed respiratory failure, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's condition remains critical, and she requires ongoing intensive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and appropriate antibiotic therapy is essential to prevent and treat this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has already been diagnosed with DVT in the lower extremity. It is crucial to continue anticoagulation therapy and consider measures to prevent further clot formation, such as early ambulation and compression stockings.
3. Cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient's diffuse cerebral edema and altered mental status indicate the possibility of increased ICP. Monitoring for signs of neurological deterioration and managing cerebral edema through appropriate interventions, such as head elevation and osmotic therapy, is important.
4. Seizures: The patient had seizure activity detected on continuous EEG, suggesting the possibility of seizures. Prophylactic antiepileptic drugs may be necessary to prevent further seizures.
5. Nosocomial infections: Due to the patient's prolonged hospital stay and invasive"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension who was admitted to the ICU with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She was found to have meningitis complicated by respiratory failure, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's fever persists despite broadened antibiotic coverage for VAP. She remains hypoxemic and requires pressure support ventilation. Her mental status is improving, but she continues to be febrile and leukocytosis may be related to a lung source or central nervous system (CNS) source. The patient has a history of constipation, hypertension, and DVT. She is currently on multiple antibiotics and anticoagulant therapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory secretions are copious, and she has not met the I/O goal yesterday. This increases the risk of developing VAP. Continuing Cefepime for VAP coverage and following up mini-bal results are recommended.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with a lower extremity DVT. She is on heparin drip and will start low-dose coumadin. Regular monitoring of PTT levels is necessary to ensure appropriate anticoagulation.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is better controlled after starting a beta-blocker. Restarting"

   with fluid overload or possible early pneumonia. Increasing
   leukocytosis also concerning for evolving infection. Other possible
   etiologies include known DVT, meningitis.
   - Will broaden CTX to cefepime for VAP coverage
   - Mini bal for sputum gram stain and culture

   - CT head and C spine per ID to evaluate for abscess
   - Continue Vanco/ampillin as noted below
   # Hypoxemia/Respiratory status: Mild hypoxemia this morning on Fi02
   50%. Likely related to some degree of fluid or possible infection.
   Small possibility of hypertenive flash pulmonary edema (see below)
   - restart AC setting on vent
   - lasix 20 mg Ivx1 with goal I/o negative 2 L
   - Antibiotics as noted above
   - Htn ad discussed below
   #  Meningitis: Mental status continues to improve. Febrile and
   leukocoytosis may be related to lung source vs CNS source. Head CT with
   contrast from OSH not sufficient to assess for subtle intracranial
   infection/leptomeningial disease.  Continuous EEG showed possible
   seizure activity and completed today. Dilantin level approaching
   therapeutic with increase dose.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a chief complaint of meningitis. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple medications including cefepime, vancomycin, and ampicillin for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and meningitis coverage. The patient's vital signs show a fever of 102.8°F, tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress.

The patient's arterial line was stopped on 12/26/2109 at 11:08 AM and a multi-lumen line was started on 12/27/2109 at 01:16 AM. She has been receiving midazolam, fentanyl, and heparin infusions. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever.

The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her lower extremity, hypertension, and respiratory failure. The assessment and plan include broadening the CTX to cefepime for VAP coverage, performing a mini BAL for sputum gram stain and culture, appreciating ID input, obtaining a CT head and C spine to evaluate for abscess, continuing vancomycin and ampicillin as noted, restarting AC settings on the vent, administering lasix to achieve I/O negative 2 L, and providing antibiotics as mentioned above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a chief complaint of meningitis. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of hypertension and was found to have deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her lower extremity. She is febrile with a temperature of 102.8°F and leukocytosis, indicating a possible evolving infection. The patient's mental status is improving, but she still has fevers and leukocytosis, which may be related to a lung source or central nervous system (CNS) source. She is on multiple antibiotics for meningitis coverage, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ampicillin. Her blood cultures, sputum cultures, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures have been collected. The patient's DVT has been treated with heparin. Her blood pressure is being managed with diltiazem and metoprolol. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures are in place to prevent this, such as head-of-bed elevation, daily wake-up trials, and mouth care.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) progression: Although the patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin, there is still a risk of D"

   Assessment and Plan
   53F with meningitis but no pathogen identified, course c/b VAP,
   persistent fevers, and DVT.
   1.  Meningitis:  WBC improved initially, then back up yesterday,
   trending down again today. Has persistent fevers, mental status
   improving and now able to follow commands.
   - currently on vancomycin, ampicillin, cefipime (hold vanco till
   tomorrow, recheck trough tomorrow)
   - no steroids per d/w ID
   - f/up head/spine CT results re: ?abscess
   2.  Seizures:  EEG positive, mental status improving with dilantin,
   changed to phosphenytoin for central administration.
   - continue phosphenytoin
   - will check albumin today to adjust dilantin level
   - will clarify with NSG re: Na goal (138 today)
   3.  Respiratory Failure:  Intubated in setting of hypoxemia and airway
   protection.  Primary barrier to extubation was her mental status, which
   is improving slowly.  Now treating for VAP.  Secretions copious, but
   slightly improved from yesterday.
   - wean PEEP, FiO2 as tolerated
   - change to PS today
   - lasix 20 IV x 1 now with TBB goal even to slightly neg 500 ccs
   - f/up chest CT results today
   4.  Fevers:  All cultures negative to date, LENIs + DVT, on heparin
   now, still febrile. Line changed yest (new L SC CVC).
   - f/up final cultures (blood, mini BAL)
   - f/up CT results (head/spine/chest)
   5. DVT: heparin gtt, no lovenox given body habitus.  No major
   procedures anticipated in next few days.
   - start coumadin 5 mg today
   6. HTN: restarted BBL at low dose yest, on home dose of diltiazem
   7. Abdominal pain: diffuse mild TTP, nods to ? re

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old lady with morbid obesity admitted with obtundation, meningitis, course complicated by respiratory failure and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.8 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 102/65 mmHg to 159/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and sedated, but able to follow commands.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures have been negative so far, but a mini-balloon (BAL) showed no growth of microorganisms.

The patient's imaging studies reveal no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax, unchanged position of the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube, and better ventilation in the right lung base compared to the previous image.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese female with meningitis, respiratory failure, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She was admitted with obtundation and found to have meningitis. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently intubated. She has been receiving antibiotics for meningitis, including vancomycin, ampicillin, and cefipime. Her mental status has been improving, and she is now able to follow commands. She also has been experiencing fevers, seizures, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient has been diagnosed with meningitis, and it is important to continue the appropriate antibiotic therapy. There is a risk of complications such as brain abscess, hearing loss, or cognitive impairment if the infection is not adequately treated.

2. Seizures: The patient had an EEG positive for seizures yesterday, and she is currently on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. Continuous EEG monitoring will be continued, and the plan is to wean versed later today. There is a risk of recurrent seizures if the antiseizure medication is not properly managed.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure, primarily due to hypoxemia and airway protection. The primary barrier to extubation is her mental status, which is improving, and her persistent high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)."

   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the distal end of the

   subclavian catheter projects over the distal brachiocephalic vein. The
   right
   central venous access line, the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric
   tube are
   in unchanged position. No evidence of complication, notably no
   pneumothorax.
   Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged retrocardiac

   on the
   previous image.
   Assessment and Plan
   53F with meningitis but no pathogen identified, course c/b VAP,
   persistent fevers, and DVT.
   1.  Meningitis:  WBC improved initially, then back up yesterday,
   trending down again today. Has persistent fevers, mental status
   improving and now able to follow commands.
   - currently on vancomycin, ampicillin, cefipime (hold vanco till
   tomorrow, recheck trough tomorrow)
   - no steroids per d/w ID
   2.  Seizures:  EEG positive, mental status improving with dilantin,
   changed to phosphenytoin for central administration.
   - continue phosphenytoin
   - will check albumin today to adjust dilantin level
   - will clarify with NSG re: Na goal (138 today)
   3.  Respiratory Failure:  Intubated in setting of hypoxemia and airway
   protection.  Primary barrier to extubation was her mental status, which
   is improving slowly.  Now treating for VAP.  Secretions copious, but
   slightly improved from yesterday.
   - wean PEEP, FiO2 as tolerated
   - change to PS today
   - lasix 20 IV x 1 now with TBB goal even to slightly neg 500 ccs
   - continue to allow auto-diuresis, goal TBB negative at least 2L today;
   lasix as needed.
   4.  Fevers:  All cultures negative to date, LENIs + DVT, on heparin
   now, still febrile. Line changed yest (new L SC CVC).
   - f/up final cultures (blood, mini BAL)
   5. DVT: heparin gtt, no lovenox given body habitus
   - start coumadin 5 mg today
   6. HTN: restarted BBL at low dose yest, on home dose of diltiazem
   7. Abdominal pain: diffuse mild TTP, nods to ? re
 abd pain
, no BM
   since admission

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old lady with morbid obesity admitted to the ICU for meningitis, respiratory failure, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is currently sedated and intubated due to respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with meningitis but no pathogen has been identified yet. The patient's condition has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), persistent fevers, and DVT.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.8°F (39.3°C), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/65 mmHg to 159/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 3 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 3,239 mL and output of 3,410 mL.

The patient has received various medications, including vancomycin, ampicillin, cefepime, midazolam (versed), fentanyl, heparin sodium, dilantin, fosphenytoin, famotidine (pepcid), and metoprolol. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 291 K/uL and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Blood cultures have been negative so far. Imaging"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old lady with morbid obesity who was admitted with obtundation and found to have meningitis. The patient's course has been complicated by respiratory failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and fever.

The patient underwent a mini-balloon percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (mini-BAL) and had transient hypoxemia, which then resolved. She also developed a fever to 102.8 yesterday evening. A new subclavian central venous catheter (SC CVC) was placed in the right internal jugular vein (IJ).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.6°C (101.4°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/65 to 93/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on endotracheal tube ventilation. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is intubated and sedated, with supple neck and no palpable right IJ hematoma. Chest X-ray shows the distal end of the left subclavian catheter projecting over the distal brachiocephalic vein and no evidence of complications. The cardiac silhouette remains unchanged, and there is still retrocardiac opacity suggesting atelectasis.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese lady admitted with obtundation and diagnosed with meningitis. She has experienced respiratory failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and fever. The patient is intubated and sedated, and her mental status is improving slowly. She has been treated with antibiotics, antiepileptic medication, and anticoagulants. Several tests have been performed, including blood cultures, respiratory cultures, and imaging studies. The patient continues to have persistent fevers and is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient initially showed improvement in white blood cell count, but it increased again. She has persistent fevers, and no pathogen has been identified yet. There is a need to recheck trough levels of vancomycin and consider alternative treatment options if necessary.
2. Seizures: The patient's EEG is positive, indicating seizure activity. Her mental status is improving with the use of dilantin, but she has been switched to fosphenytoin for central administration. It is important to continue monitoring her seizure activity and adjust dilantin levels based on albumin levels.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to hypoxemia and airway protection. Her primary barrier to extubation is her improving mental status. She is being treated for VAP, and her secretions"

   - continuous EEG
   - Will attempt to wean versed later today and keep EEG monitoring
   3.  Respiratory Failure:  Intubated in setting of hypoxemia and airway
   protection.  Primary barrier to extubation is her mental status which
   is improving and her persistent high PEEP.  Secretions minimal.
   - wean PEEP, FiO2 as tolerated
   - Plan to SBT later today or tomorrow
   - continue to allow auto-diuresis, goal TBB negative at least 2L today;
   lasix as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 53-year-old lady with morbid obesity, admitted with obtundation and diagnosed with meningitis.
- The patient's course has been complicated by respiratory failure and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient is currently intubated due to hypoxemia and airway protection.
- She is receiving multiple antibiotics for meningitis, including vancomycin, ampicillin, and cefipime.
- Dilantin has been started for seizures, and the patient's mental status is improving.
- The patient has persistent fevers, and all cultures have been negative.
- She is on heparin for DVT and has a central venous catheter changed yesterday.
- The plan is to wean PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated, attempt spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and continue to allow auto-diuresis with Lasix as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient is still febrile, and no pathogen has been identified yet. There is a risk of worsening meningitis or development of complications such as brain edema or increased intracranial pressure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation and may face challenges during weaning due to persistent high PEEP and mental status impairment.
3. Seizures: The patient had an EEG positive for seizures yesterday, and there is a risk of recurrent seizures despite being on dilant"

   - Hold on steroids for time being, will discuss with ID in setting of
   meningitis (current ID recommendation is to not do steroids).
   2.  Seizures:  EEG positive yesterday, mental status improving with
   dilantin
   - continue dilantin
   - continuous EEG
   - Will attempt to wean versed later today and keep EEG monitoring
   3.  Respiratory Failure:  Intubated in setting of hypoxemia and airway
   protection.  Primary barrier to extubation is her mental status which
   is improving and her persistent high PEEP.  Secretions minimal.
   - wean PEEP, FiO2 as tolerated
   - Plan to SBT later today or tomorrow
   - continue to allow auto-diuresis, goal TBB negative at least 2L today;
   lasix as needed.

","The patient is a 53-year-old lady with morbid obesity, who was admitted with obtundation and found to have meningitis. The patient's course has been complicated by respiratory failure and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient underwent mini-balloon percutaneous aspiration of lung (mini-BAL) due to transient hypoxemia, which then resolved. Fever to 102.8 was noted yesterday evening. A new large-bore central venous catheter (L SC line) was placed in the right internal jugular vein (RIJ). A CT scan of the head and spine was performed this morning.

The patient has a history of obesity, and her allergies include no known drug allergies. She has received multiple doses of antibiotics since admission, including ceftriaxone, cefepime, ampicillin, and vancomycin. The patient is currently receiving midazolam (versed), fentanyl, heparin sodium, dilantin, furosemide (Lasix), famotidine (Pepcid), and fosphenytoin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C (101.4°F), heart rate of 92 bpm (87-119 bpm), blood pressure of 102/65 mmHg (73/64-159/112 mmHg), respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute (9-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of"

   possible VAP and DVT
   # Fever:  Now relatively afebrile x 24 hours after pulling RIJ central
   line and broadening antibiotics to cefepime. CT Head/spine without
   extra focus of infection. CT chest showing PNA.
   - Continue Cefepime for VAP coverage
   - follow up minibal results
   - Appreciate ID input
   - Continue Vanco/ampillin as noted below.
   # Hypoxemia/Respiratory status: Hypoxemic after BAL . However, sats now
   improved.  Likely related to some degree of fluid or possible
   infection. Did not meet I/O goal yesterday.
   - lasix 20 mg Ivx1 with goal I/o negative 1 L
   - PS ventilation, ween PEEP as tolerated, goal <10 today
   - Antibiotics as noted above
   #  Meningitis: Mental status continues to improve. Febrile and
   leukocoytosis may be related to lung source vs CNS source. Head CT with
   contrast from OSH not sufficient to assess for subtle intracranial
   infection/leptomeningial disease.  Continuous EEG showed possible
   seizure activity and completed today. Dilantin level approaching
   therapeutic with increase dose. Changed phenytoin to fosphenytoin. CT
   head showed slight improvement in edema
   - HOB elevation
   - no need for further hypertonic to keep Na >140
   - Vanc/Cefepime/ampicillin
   - follow CSF/blood cultures/sputum cultures
   - f/u Neuro and ID recs
   - neuro checks q2 H
   - Change fosphenytoin to PO dilanting
   # Constipation: Uptitrate bowel regimen
   # DVT: LLE DVT on LENI [**12-25**]. Now on heparin drip with approval from
   Neurosurgery with goal PTT 60
80. Started low dose coumadin given
   patient on several antibiotics.
   - Coumadin 5 mg daily
   - Continue heparin drip
   # Hypertension: Blood pressure much better controlled over last 24
   hours after starting betablocker. Pattern consistent with repiratory
   issues cause hypertension, rather than vice versa. Restarted diltiazem
   yesterday. Home dose of atenolol 25 mg daily, and she may be having
   some beta blocker withdrawal given htn/tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol and diltiazem. Will restart home atenolol once
   more stable.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She was found to have meningitis, complicated by respiratory failure, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The patient's fever has subsided after removing the right internal jugular (RIJ) central line and broadening antibiotics to cefepime. CT scans show no extra focus of infection.
- The patient's respiratory status is improving, with improved oxygen saturation (sats). However, she remains hypoxemic and may have fluid overload or infection contributing to this.
- The patient's mental status continues to improve, indicating a positive response to treatment.
- The patient has leukocytosis, which could be related to a lung source or central nervous system (CNS) source. Continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) showed possible seizure activity.
- The patient's blood pressure is better controlled with the use of beta-blockers.
- The patient has constipation, which is being treated with an uptitration of the bowel regimen.
- The patient has a lower extremity DVT and is on heparin drip with approval from neurosurgery. She has started low-dose Coumadin due to being on several antibiotics.

   # Fever:  Now relatively afebrile x 24 hours after pulling RIJ central
   line and broadening antibiotics to cefepime. CT Head/spine without
   extra focus of infection. CT chest showing PNA.
   - Continue Cefepime for VAP coverage
   - follow up minibal results
   - Appreciate ID input
   - Continue Vanco/ampillin as noted below.
   # Hypoxemia/Respiratory status: Hypoxemic after BAL . However, sats now
   improved.  Likely related to some degree of fluid or possible
   infection. Did not meet I/O goal yesterday.
   - lasix 20 mg Ivx1 with goal I/o negative 1 L
   - Restart Pressure support ventilation after radiographic studies
   - Antibiotics as noted above
   #  Meningitis: Mental status continues to improve. Febrile and
   leukocoytosis may be related to lung source vs CNS source. Head CT with
   contrast from OSH not sufficient to assess for subtle intracranial
   infection/leptomeningial disease.  Continuous EEG showed possible
   seizure activity and completed today. Dilantin level approaching
   therapeutic with increase dose. Changed phenytoin to fosphenytoin. CT
   head showed slight improvement in edema
   - HOB elevation

   # DVT: LLE DVT on LENI [**12-25**]. Now on heparin drip with approval from
   Neurosurgery with goal PTT 60
80. Started low dose coumadin given
   patient on several antibiotics.
   - Coumadin 5 mg daily
   - Continue heparin drip
   # Hypertension: Blood pressure much better controlled over last 24
   hours after starting betablocker. Pattern consistent with repiratory
   issues cause hypertension, rather than vice versa. Restarted diltiazem
   yesterday. Home dose of atenolol 25 mg daily, and she may be having
   some beta blocker withdrawal given htn/tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol and diltiazem. Will restart home atenolol once
   more stable.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She was found to have meningitis complicated by respiratory failure, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's current condition:
1. Fever: The patient is now relatively afebrile for 24 hours after pulling the right internal jugular (RIJ) central line and broadening antibiotics to cefepime. A fever can indicate an infection or inflammation in the body.
2. Respiratory status: The patient's oxygen saturation improved after a bronchoscopy and lavage (BAL) procedure. However, she remains hypoxemic and may be related to fluid overload or infection. The goal is to achieve adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Meningitis: The patient's mental status continues to improve, indicating a positive response to treatment. She is still febrile and leukocytosis may be related to a lung source or central nervous system (CNS) source. Further evaluation with head CT and continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) is planned to assess for possible seizures.
4. DVT: The patient has a left lower extremity DVT and is currently on heparin drip with approval from neurosurgery. The target PTT (partial thromboplastin time) is 60-80 seconds."

   Assessment and Plan
   53F with meningitis but no pathogen identified, course c/b VAP,
   persistent fevers, and DVT.
   1.  Meningitis:  WBC improved initially, then back up yesterday,
   trending down again today. Has persistent fevers, mental status
   improving and now able to follow commands.
   - currently on vancomycin, ampicillin, cefipime (hold vanco till
   tomorrow, recheck trough tomorrow)
   - no steroids per d/w ID
   - f/up head/spine CT results re: ?abscess
   2.  Seizures:  EEG positive, mental status improving with dilantin,
   changed to phosphenytoin for central administration.
   - continue phosphenytoin
   - will check albumin today to adjust dilantin level
   - will clarify with NSG re: Na goal (138 today)
   3.  Respiratory Failure:  Intubated in setting of hypoxemia and airway
   protection.  Primary barrier to extubation was her mental status, which
   is improving slowly.  Now treating for VAP.  Secretions copious, but
   slightly improved from yesterday.
   - wean PEEP, FiO2 as tolerated
   - change to PS today
   - lasix 20 IV x 1 now with TBB goal even to slightly neg 500 ccs
   - f/up chest CT results today
   4.  Fevers:  All cultures negative to date, LENIs + DVT, on heparin
   now, still febrile. Line changed yest (new L SC CVC).
   - f/up final cultures (blood, mini BAL)
   - f/up CT results (head/spine/chest)
   5. DVT: heparin gtt, no lovenox given body habitus.  No major
   procedures anticipated in next few days.
   - start coumadin 5 mg today
   6. HTN: restarted BBL at low dose yest, on home dose of diltiazem
   7. Abdominal pain: diffuse mild TTP, nods to ? re

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old lady with morbid obesity who was admitted with obtundation and found to have meningitis. The course of treatment has been complicated by respiratory failure and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/62 mmHg to 141/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (vancomycin, ampicillin, cefipime), anticoagulant (heparin), sedatives (midazolam, fentanyl), and antiepileptic (fosphenytoin). 

The lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges or not significantly abnormal.

Assessment and plan:
1. Meningitis: The patient's WBC count improved initially but increased again, indicating persistent infection. The patient has persistent fevers and mental status improvement. She is currently on vancomycin, ampicillin, and cefipime. Vancomycin will be held until tomorrow and the trough will be rechecked.
2. Seizures: The patient had an EEG"

   - no steroids per d/w ID
   2.  Seizures:  EEG positive, mental status improving with dilantin,
   changed to phosphenytoin for central administration.
   - change back to dilantin as trying to minimize IV meds with access
   problems
   - no more [**Name (NI) **] goals per NSG (s/p hypertonic saline)
   3.  Respiratory Failure:  Intubated in setting of hypoxemia and airway
   protection.  Primary barrier to extubation was her mental status, which
   is improving slowly.  Now treating for VAP.  Secretions copious, and
   increasing today.   Chest CT with bilateral atel vs. consolidation, esp
   in LLL.  Stable on PS, but with high PEEP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese female admitted with meningitis, respiratory failure, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's condition is summarized as follows:

- The patient's mental status is improving slowly, and she is now able to follow commands.
- She has persistent fevers, and her white blood cell count has initially improved but then increased again.
- No abscess was seen on the head/spine CT from yesterday.
- The patient is currently on vancomycin, ampicillin, and cefipime for a total of two weeks for meningitis treatment.
- The patient is also being treated for seizures with phenytoin.
- The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure and is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Secretions are copious, and there is a concern for increasing atelectasis, particularly in the left lower lobe.
- The patient's PEEP is being weaned today.
- The patient has resolved fevers, and all cultures are negative to date.
- She has a diagnosed DVT and is receiving heparin and coumadin.
- The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers.
- She experiences diffuse abdominal pain, which is thought to be related to her bowel regimen and may require further investigation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old morbidly obese female admitted with obtundation and diagnosed with meningitis. The patient's course has been complicated by respiratory failure and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's mental status has been improving slowly, and they are now able to follow commands. The patient is intubated due to hypoxemia and airway protection, and primary barriers to extubation include mental status and copious secretions. The patient is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's fevers persist despite negative cultures, and they have been placed on heparin for DVT. The patient's blood pressure is difficult to control, and they have a history of hypertension. The patient also experiences diffuse abdominal pain and has not had a bowel movement since admission. The patient is receiving various medications for their condition, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications for seizures and blood pressure management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient has been diagnosed with meningitis, which is an infection of the meninges, the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Complications of meningitis can include brain abscess, hearing loss, and long-term neurological deficits.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which may lead to further complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and decreased oxygenation.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 34-year-old male admitted to the ICU with meningitis and respiratory failure. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except where noted above and below. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, sedatives, and pain relief medication. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slightly elevated heart rate. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 550 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR set at 28, PEEP of 14 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and ABG results of pH 7.27, Ve of 7.4 L/min. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and platelet count, and normal glucose levels. The patient's neurological status is not assessed due to sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU. Regular assessment and prophylaxis should be implemented to prevent this complication.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not properly managed. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilator settings are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Constipation: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY: on heparin iv
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN):
   repeat sputum cultures, may be related to pancreatitis. f/u TG, obtain
   ultrasound of the abdomen to rule out cholelithiasis. Keep NPO. No
   clear drug offendors for pancreatitis.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):
   still wiht copious secretions, will wean FiO2 to 40%, and reattempt to
   wean peep to 5 later today if stable. Continue with pulmonary toilet.
   Repeat chest CT. continue lasix given LOS +10L and LE edema.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with morbid obesity admitted to the ICU for severe meningitis and acute respiratory failure. The patient's course is also notable for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/48 to 148/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, distant heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, diminished breath sounds, soft abdomen with tenderness in the right upper quadrant, and edema in both lower extremities. Neurological examination shows attentive behavior, purposeful movements, and normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.8 thousand/mm3, decreased hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, elevated platelet count of 415 thousand/mm3, increased creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, and elevated troponin-T level of 1.00 ng/mL. Imaging shows right lower lobe infiltrate and atelectasis versus pneumonia, and left lower lobe opacity worsened.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo F w/ HTN p/w fever altered mental status and diffuse cerebral
   edema and found to have meningitis complicated by respiratory failure,
   possible VAP and DVT
   # Hypoxemia/Respiratory status: Hypoxemic after BAL. However, sats now
   improved.  Likely related to some degree of fluid or possible
   infection.
   - lasix 20 mg Ivx1 with goal I/o negative 1 L
   - PS ventilation, wean PEEP as tolerated, goal <10 today
   - Antibiotics as noted below
   - SBT with possible extubation to CPAP
   # Fever:  Now relatively afebrile x 24 hours after pulling RIJ central
   line and broadening antibiotics to cefepime. CT Head/spine without
   extra focus of infection. CT chest showing PNA.  Could be related to
   new pancreatitis.
   - Continue Cefepime for VAP coverage (8 day course)
   - follow up minibal results
   - hold vanc dose, check trough tonight
   - Appreciate ID input
   - Continue Vanco/ampillin as noted below
   # Abd.pain/pancreatitis:  Improving after holding TF yesterday. Only
   possible drug cause is lasix.
   -NPO
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -trend lipase
   #  Meningitis: Mental status continues to improve. Febrile and
   leukocoytosis may be related to lung source vs CNS source. Head CT with
   contrast from OSH not sufficient to assess for subtle intracranial
   infection/leptomeningial disease.  Continuous EEG showed possible
   seizure activity and completed today. Dilantin level approaching
   therapeutic with increase dose. Changed phenytoin to fosphenytoin. CT
   head showed slight improvement in edema
   - HOB elevation
   - no need for further hypertonic to keep Na >140
   - Vanc/Cefepime/ampicillin x 2 weeks total
   - follow CSF/blood cultures/sputum cultures
   - f/u Neuro and ID recs
   - neuro checks q2 H
   - Change fosphenytoin to PO dilantin
   # Constipation: Uptitrated bowel regimen
   # DVT: LLE DVT on LENI [**12-25**]. Was on heparin drip with approval from
   Neurosurgery with goal PTT 60
80. Started low dose coumadin given
   patient on several antibiotics.
   - Coumadin 5 mg daily
   # Hypertension: Blood pressure much better controlled over last 24
   hours after starting betablocker. Pattern consistent with repiratory
   issues cause hypertension, rather than vice versa. Restarted diltiazem
   yesterday. Home dose of atenolol 25 mg daily, and she may be having
   some beta blocker withdrawal given htn/tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol and diltiazem. Will restart home atenolol once
   more stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a chief complaint of meningitis. She has been experiencing fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. The patient is also complicated by respiratory failure, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

24-hour events include continued right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain with rising lipase levels. The patient has heavy secretions and is still receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. She was attempted to be weaned off positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 8 but did not tolerate it, so she was put back on PEEP 10. The patient has been gagging on the endotracheal tube, and sedation has been increased. The patient may not be able to be extubated today.

Allergies: No known drug allergies.

   -Increase dose of vanc given low lvl today
   - Appreciate ID input
   - Continue Vanco/ampillin as noted below.
   # Hypoxemia/Respiratory status: Hypoxemic after BAL . However, sats now
   improved.  Likely related to some degree of fluid or possible
   infection. Did not meet I/O goal yesterday.
   - lasix 20 mg Ivx1 with goal I/o negative 1 L
   - PS ventilation, ween PEEP as tolerated, goal <10 today

   - Coumadin 5 mg daily
   - Continue heparin drip
   # Hypertension: Blood pressure much better controlled over last 24
   hours after starting betablocker. Pattern consistent with repiratory
   issues cause hypertension, rather than vice versa. Restarted diltiazem
   yesterday. Home dose of atenolol 25 mg daily, and she may be having
   some beta blocker withdrawal given htn/tachycardia.

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She was found to have meningitis complicated by respiratory failure, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Summary of Progress:
- The patient's fever has subsided after removing the right internal jugular (RIJ) central line and broadening antibiotics to cefepime.
- A CT scan of the head/spine showed no new focus of infection.
- The CT chest revealed pneumonia, which could be related to new pancreatitis.
- The patient's respiratory status improved with PS ventilation and weaning of PEEP.
- Her mental status continues to improve.
- The abdominal pain and worsening pancreatitis persisted despite holding total parenteral nutrition (TF) yesterday.
- The patient is still febrile and leukocytosis may be related to a lung source or central nervous system (CNS) source.
- Continuous EEG showed possible seizure activity and completed today.
- Dilantin level approached therapeutic with increased dose.
- Phenytoin was changed to fosphenytoin.
- CT head showed slight improvement in edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly related to meningitis and VAP. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilation settings are necessary.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension, who presented with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She was found to have meningitis, respiratory failure, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

24-hour events:
- The patient continued to experience right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and an increasing lipase level.
- She had heavy secretions, so a sputum culture was sent.
- The patient did not tolerate a decrease in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 8 cmH2O and was returned to 10 cmH2O.
- The patient gagged on the endotracheal tube, leading to an increase in sedation. Extubation may not be possible this morning.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's fever has subsided after removing the radial internal jugular (RIJ) central line and broadening antibiotics to cefepime. A CT scan of the head/spine without any new focus of infection was performed, along with a CT chest showing possible pneumonia, which could be related to new pancreatitis.
- Continue cefepime for VAP coverage.
- Follow up mini-bal results.
- Recheck sputum culture today due to increased secretions.
- Increase the dose of vancomycin given the low level today.
- Appreciate infectious disease (ID) input.
- Continue vancomycin/ampicillin as noted below.

The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory status improved after a bronchoscopy and alveolar lavage (BAL). The patient's oxygen saturation (sats) is now improved. The hypoxemia is likely related to some degree of fluid or possible infection. The patient did not meet the intake/output (I/O) goal yesterday.
- Lasix 20 mg IV q1 with a goal I/O negative 1 L.
- Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV), wean PEEP as tolerated, goal <10 today.
- Antibiotics as noted above.

The patient's abdominal pain/pancreatitis worsened despite holding the tube feeds (TF) yesterday. The only possible drug cause is Lasix.
- NPO (nothing by mouth).
- Pain control with fentanyl.
- Check triglycerides.
- RUQ ultrasound (US).

The patient's mental status continues to improve. Fever and leukocytosis may be related to a lung source or central nervous system (CNS) source. A head CT with contrast from outside the hospital (OSH) was not sufficient to assess for subtle intracranial infection/leptomeningeal disease. Continuous EEG showed possible seizure activity and was completed today. The dilantin level is approaching therapeutic with an increased dose. Phenytoin was changed to fosphenytoin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of meningitis. They have been experiencing right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and an increasing lipase level. The RUQ ultrasound is normal, as well as the triglyceride (TG) levels. The patient is experiencing heavy secretions and is awaiting culture results. They were initially placed on a lower level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) but did not tolerate it and was put back on PEEP 10. The patient has been gagging on the endotracheal tube, leading to increased sedation, which may prevent extubation this morning.

Allergies:
The patient has no known drug allergies.

Medications:
The patient has received various medications, including vancomycin, ampicillin, and cefepime. They are currently receiving midazolam, fentanyl, famotidine, and furosemide. Other medications include changes to medical and family history.

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the mentioned below.

Flow Sheet Data:
Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), current temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate (HR) between 86-122 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 100/47-149/80 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) between"

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity who underwent gastric bypass surgery. She was admitted to the ICU with meningitis and cerebral edema, requiring intracranial pressure monitoring and status epilepticus. The patient's chief complaint is vague right upper quadrant pain, with elevated amylase and lipase levels. She also experienced subjective dyspnea when weaned to PEEP 8, so her PEEP was increased back to 10. The patient became agitated overnight with increased cough and required increased sedation.

The patient has no known drug allergies. She received vancomycin, ampicillin, and cefepime on December 30th at different times. Her current infusions include midazolam and fentanyl. She was also on furosemide (Lasix) on December 29th and received fentanyl at a different time.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned symptoms. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/47 mmHg to 149/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with a total intake of 3,410 mL and output of 5,895 mL. Her respiratory support includes an"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity who underwent gastric bypass surgery. She was admitted to the ICU with meningitis and cerebral edema, requiring intracranial pressure monitoring and status epilepticus. The patient has been experiencing various complications since her admission, including right upper quadrant pain with elevated amylase and lipase, subjective dyspnea, agitation, increased cough, and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/47-149/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose levels, and electrolyte imbalances. However, there are some abnormal values such as elevated lactate levels, elevated troponin-T, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation for airway protection and subsequently for acute respiratory failure. She has been placed on CPAP 10 with 40% FiO2 and is being treated empirically for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's mild volume overload will be managed with gentle di"

","Summary:
The patient is an ICU admit with multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, encephalitis, hypertension, DVT, constipation, and fever of unknown origin. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and respiratory failure. They have a PICC line in place and are receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, cefepime, vancomycin, ampicillin, fosphenytoin, diltiazem, and metoprolol. The patient's labs show elevated WBC count, low platelet count, high creatinine, low total CO2, and abnormal electrolytes. The patient's vital signs show a fever, elevated heart rate, stable blood pressure, and decreased respiratory rate. The patient has been receiving ICU care with prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which is already being treated empirically with antibiotics. Continued monitoring and improvement of oxygenation and ventilation parameters are essential.

2. Encephalitis: The patient has signs of encephalitis, likely secondary to meningitis. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics should be continued, and close monitoring of neurological status is necessary.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a confirmed DVT. Antico"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity who underwent gastric bypass surgery in 2000. She was admitted on December 18, 2019, with meningitis and cerebral edema requiring intracranial pressure monitoring and status epilepticus. 

The patient has several medical conditions and complications. She has deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in her lower extremity, for which she is on coumadin. Her INR is supratherapeutic, so the dose has been decreased from 5 to 4 mg daily and will be held tonight. 

The patient also has fever (hypothermia, pyrexia), with an unclear etiology at this point. Her CT C/A/P/head is unremarkable. 

Additionally, the patient experienced acute respiratory failure initially intubated for airway protection and subsequently for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). However, her respiratory condition has improved and she is now on CPAP 10, able to pull in a TV of 1.11L. It is planned to extubate her to CPAP 10 once she is in an upright position, stop all sedation, and continue diuresis for a goal net out of 1 L daily while monitoring BUN/Cr. 

The patient is being treated for encephalitis/meningitis with vancomycin, cefepime, and ampicillin"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-inch tall individual who has been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics for meningitis, Lasix, vancomycin, midazolam, fentanyl, metoprolol, and others. 

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 135/59 mmHg to 160/92 mmHg, heart rate between 98 and 136 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's kidney function seems to be normal based on the creatinine level. 

Imaging studies reveal that the patient has an orogastric tube coiled in the stomach, a venous catheter in the superior vena cava, and an endotracheal tube placed 3.3 cm above the carina. The lungs appear clear without any acute cardiopulmonary process. 

Microbiology tests show no significant growth from a central venous culture, and the sputum gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper respiratory secretions, making the bacterial culture results invalid"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo F w/ HTN p/w fever altered mental status and diffuse cerebral
   edema and found to have meningitis complicated by respiratory failure,
   possible VAP and DVT
   # Hypoxemia/Respiratory status: Hypoxemic after BAL. However, sats now
   improved.  Likely related to some degree of fluid or possible
   infection.
   - lasix 20 mg Ivx1 with goal I/o negative 1 L
   - PS ventilation, wean PEEP as tolerated, goal <10 today
   - Antibiotics as noted below
   - SBT with possible extubation to CPAP
   # Fever:  Now relatively afebrile x 24 hours after pulling RIJ central
   line and broadening antibiotics to cefepime. CT Head/spine without
   extra focus of infection. CT chest showing PNA.  Could be related to
   new pancreatitis.
   - Continue Cefepime for VAP coverage (8 day course)
   - follow up minibal results
   - hold vanc dose, check trough tonight
   - Appreciate ID input
   - Continue Vanco/ampillin as noted below
   # Abd.pain/pancreatitis:  Improving after holding TF yesterday. Only
   possible drug cause is lasix.
   -NPO
   -Pain control with fentanyl
   -trend lipase
   #  Meningitis: Mental status continues to improve. Febrile and
   leukocoytosis may be related to lung source vs CNS source. Head CT with
   contrast from OSH not sufficient to assess for subtle intracranial
   infection/leptomeningial disease.  Continuous EEG showed possible
   seizure activity and completed today. Dilantin level approaching
   therapeutic with increase dose. Changed phenytoin to fosphenytoin. CT
   head showed slight improvement in edema
   - HOB elevation
   - no need for further hypertonic to keep Na >140
   - Vanc/Cefepime/ampicillin x 2 weeks total
   - follow CSF/blood cultures/sputum cultures
   - f/u Neuro and ID recs
   - neuro checks q2 H
   - Change fosphenytoin to PO dilantin
   # Constipation: Uptitrated bowel regimen
   # DVT: LLE DVT on LENI [**12-25**]. Was on heparin drip with approval from
   Neurosurgery with goal PTT 60
80. Started low dose coumadin given
   patient on several antibiotics.
   - Coumadin 5 mg daily
   # Hypertension: Blood pressure much better controlled over last 24
   hours after starting betablocker. Pattern consistent with repiratory
   issues cause hypertension, rather than vice versa. Restarted diltiazem
   yesterday. Home dose of atenolol 25 mg daily, and she may be having
   some beta blocker withdrawal given htn/tachycardia.
   - Continue metoprolol and diltiazem. Will restart home atenolol once
   more stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She was found to have meningitis complicated by respiratory failure, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

The patient's condition has improved over the past 24 hours. Her oxygen saturation has improved, and she is now relatively afebrile after pulling the right internal jugular (RIJ) central line and broadening antibiotics to cefepime. A CT scan of the head/spine did not show any new focus of infection, but a CT chest revealed possible pneumonia. 

The patient's abdominal pain and elevated lipase levels suggest pancreatitis, which is improving after holding tube feeds (TF) yesterday. Lasix may be the cause of the pancreatitis. 

The patient's mental status continues to improve, but she remains febrile and leukocytosis may be related to a lung source or central nervous system (CNS) source. Continuous EEG showed possible seizure activity, and the patient's phenytoin has been changed to fosphenytoin. A CT scan of the head showed slight improvement in edema. 

Other issues include constipation, which has been uptitrated, and DVT, which was confirmed on the left lower extremity on December 25th. The patient was on a heparin drip with approval"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She was found to have meningitis, respiratory failure, and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains intubated. She has received treatment for meningitis, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ampicillin. Her abdominal pain and pancreatitis symptoms have improved. The patient's mental status is close to normal, and her fevers have improved. She is currently on a bowel regimen for constipation and low-dose coumadin for DVT. Her blood pressure is well-controlled with the addition of metoprolol. The patient's condition requires ongoing monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory failure and prolonged intubation increase the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be important to prevent and treat this complication.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with a left lower extremity DVT. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin and low-dose coumadin has been initiated to prevent further clot formation. Regular monitoring of her INR levels is essential to ensure therapeutic anticoagulation without excessive bleeding risk"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension who was admitted with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She was found to have meningitis and respiratory failure, with possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient was initially intubated but did well on a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). She was extubated to CPAP and then to a nasal cannula. Her blood and urine cultures were sent, and she was given intravenous antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit in the afternoon, with a heart rate of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 124/68 to 164/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's labs indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 632 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 102 mg/dL, and an elevated lactate level of 1.0 mmol/L. The blood glucose level is within normal range at 123 mg/dL. Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes, elevated cardiac markers, and abnormal renal function tests.

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, possible VAP, DVT, constipation, encephalitis, and hypertension"

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension, presenting with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema. She was found to have meningitis complicated by respiratory failure and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Assessment and Plan:
- Constipation (obstipation, Fos)
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), lower extremity
- Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin)
- Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
- Encephalitis
- Hypotension (not shock)

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern as she is still fluid overloaded and may benefit from continued diuresis. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure or worsening hypoxemia.
2. VAP: The patient may be at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia due to her recent extubation. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
3. DVT: The patient has a confirmed lower extremity DVT. There is a risk of further clot propagation or embolization, which could lead to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism.
4. Meningitis: Although the patient's mental status has improved, she is still at risk for complications associated with meningitis, such as recurrent fever, seizures, or neurological deficits.
5. Hypertension: While the patient's blood pressure is well-controlled on beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, there is a risk of uncontrolled hypertension if the medications are not appropriately titrated or if there are adverse effects.
6. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation due to immobility and medications. Monitoring bowel movements and implementing appropriate interventions are necessary.
7. Hyperthermia: The patient's recurrent fevers suggest ongoing infection or inflammatory processes. Close monitoring and further investigation are needed to identify the underlying cause.

   -vanc/cefepime/amp for meningitis completes today day 14 of 14. Will
   d/c Amp today.
   # Abd.pain/pancreatitis:  Pain improved. RUQ u/s negative.
   -NPO, monitor clinically and advance diet as tolerated
   # Meningitis: Mental status normal  now. No blood reacted.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/ampicillin x 2 weeks total completes today.
   -dilantin level therapeutic- continue dilantin at current dose 400mg po
   tid until Neurology outpatient followup
   # DVT: LLE DVT on LENI [**12-25**]. Was on heparin drip with approval from
   Neurosurgery and now supratherapeutic on coumadin.
   -INR supratherapeutic, hold coumadin today
   - Since DVT was provoked would likely treat 3-6 months and not test for
   hypercoagulability
   # Hypertension: Blood pressure much better controlled well controlled
   on betablocker and diltiazem.
   - Continue metoprolol and diltiazem for now. Consider long acting dilt
   and change to atenolol on the floor

   Disposition: Call out to the floor today
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with fever, altered mental status, and diffuse cerebral edema, ultimately diagnosed with meningitis. The patient also has respiratory failure, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience further deterioration in lung function, leading to hypoxemia and respiratory distress.
2. VAP: The patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia, which can be a serious infection that requires prompt antibiotic treatment.
3. DVT: The patient has a lower extremity DVT, which could potentially lead to pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
4. Meningitis: Although the patient is currently improving, there is still a risk of complications associated with meningitis, such as sepsis or neurological deficits.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled on beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, but there is still a risk of hypotension, especially during transitions from the ICU to the floor.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, infection control measures, anticoagulation therapy, and blood pressure management to prevent these potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of meningitis. The patient has been extubated to CPAP and then weaned to a nasal cannula. They are taking sips of liquid and have had their vancomycin level changed due to scheduling issues. The patient's temperature was 101 degrees Fahrenheit in the afternoon, and blood and urine cultures were sent. 

The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (101 degrees Fahrenheit), current temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius (99.2 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate between 95 and 112 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 124/68 to 164/99 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15 and 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. 

The patient's fluid balance indicates an input of 1,978 mL, including 403 mL of IV fluids, and an output of 3,100 mL through various routes. The patient's blood products and urine output are also recorded. 

In terms of respiratory support, the patient is on CPAP mode with a tidal volume of 471 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a chief complaint of meningitis. The patient has been experiencing various medical complications throughout her ICU stay.

1. Invasive ventilation was stopped on 12/31/2109 at 11:15 AM and replaced with non-invasive ventilation. Blood cultures were taken twice, and urine culture was also conducted.

2. The patient was extubated to CPAP for 10 hours and then progressed to using a nasal cannula. She is currently taking sips of liquid. There was an issue with vancomycin scheduling, so the level was changed to 5 a.m. on 1/1. A reconsult with physical therapy was done, and the patient had a fever of 101 degrees in the afternoon with blood and urine cultures sent.

3. The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin at 10:00 PM on 12/31, ampicillin at 4:03 AM on 1/1, and cefepime at 4:03 AM on 1/1.

4. The patient is receiving various medications including famotidine (Pepcid), fentanyl, and furosemide (Lasix).

5. The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (101 degrees Fahrenheit) and a current temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius (99.2 degrees Fahrenheit). Her heart rate is 106 beats per minute, blood pressure ranges from 124/68 to 164/99 mmHg, respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

6. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1978 mL, including 403 mL of intravenous fluids. The total output is 3100 mL, consisting of 1220 mL of urine output. The patient's respiratory support includes using a nasal cannula with CPAP mode at 10 cmH2O, a spontaneous tidal volume (Vt) of 471 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%.

7. The patient's blood work reveals a white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 9.1 to 12.8 thousand/mL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 25.3 to 27.9%, and platelet count (Plt) ranging from 291 to 351 thousand/mL. Other lab results include creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 0.3 to 0.4 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) level of 30 mmHg, glucose levels ranging from 102 to 130 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal range.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity who underwent gastric bypass surgery. She was admitted to the ICU with meningitis and cerebral edema. The patient experienced status epilepticus and required invasive ventilation, which was later switched to non-invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/68 mmHg to 164/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula with CPAP mode. The patient's blood cultures were taken on December 31 at 01:05 PM, as well as a urine culture. She received antibiotics including vancomycin, ampicillin, and cefepime.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net intake of 1,978 mL with outputs totaling 3,100 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,122 mL. She is on non-invasive ventilation with FiO2 at 40%, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, and a spontaneous respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. The patient's ABG results are ///25, and her oxygen delivery device is a nasal cannula.

In terms of physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished and not in acute distress. Her cardiovascular examination reveals normal S1"
