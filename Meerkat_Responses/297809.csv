   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Axillary Aline placed
   -3sets of CE done; remained flat; cardiology consulted given ? evolving
   EKG changes and ECHO done with EF 20%
   -Evidence of pancreatitis Amylase 109, Lipase 374
   -Cards felt respiratory failure due to HTN causing flash pulmonary
   edema in setting of depressed EF and that hypotension not likely
   cardiogenic shock given HTN on initial admission and no evidence of RV
   dilation on TTE.  Suggested trial of diuresis if need to improve
   oxygenation.  Felt hypotension could be [**1-28**] pancreatitis vs hemorrhagic
   shock; did not feel ACS but did agree w/statin, aspirin. Did think
   patient may benefit from eventual cath vs stress AND may benefit from
   swan pending what other results return
   -Patient noted to have pulsatile mass and given 10pt Hct drop-->ordered
   CT torso to evalute for pancreatitis, dissecting aneurysm and PE; held
   heparin that was initially started given Hct drop
   -Prelim CT Read:
   Bilateral pleural effusions and associated bibasilar atelectasis.
   Diffuse ground glass opacification scattered throughout both lung
   fields, non-specific could relate to edema, infection or inflammation.
   No CT evidence of pancreatitis, can correlate with labs. No evidence of
   pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental levels and no evidence of
   abdominal aortic aneurysm. Status post gastric banding.
   -Looked through old records and clean cath [**2110**]
   -Sent TSH, thiamine for nutritional deficiencies given lap band and
   cardiomyopathy
   -D-dimer 1861
   -Repeat lactate 2.1-->1.0 this AM
   -Temp 100.1 at MN
   -Weaned off dobutamine, on Levo .08
   -On PSV 8/8
   -Hct 52->47->40->37.9

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with past medical history of morbid obesity (s/p
   gastric lap banding), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, presenting with
   acute respiratory distress and malignant hypertension.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Differential initially broad; including
   pulmonary edema (has low EF and pulmonary edema on CXR) vs pneumonia (?
   Infiltrates on exam, elevated WBC on admission/hypotension) vs PE
   (body  habitus, acute onset of presentation); CT Chest does not show
   any evidence of PE thus heparin gtt stopped; it does show ground glass
   opacifications which could represent edema vs infection vs inflammation
   plus b/l effusions. Pt was given initial dose of Lasix and covered
   broadly with vanc/zosyn on arrival. Respiratory status improving; pt
   was weaned overnight to PSV 8/8 and doing well
   .Continue PSV and repeat ABG; RSBI and ? able to extubate
   -Continue broad coverage with Vanc/Zosyn for possible pneumonia
   -F./u final CT read but no evidnece of PE on initial read
   # HYPOTENSION;Initial differential concerning for septic vs cardiogenic
   shock vs PE; however stat ECHO showed EF20% and pts initial
   presentation was hypertension; 3 sets of cardiac enzymes are negative
   and EKG not felt to be c/w ACS. Pt did have a fever/leukocytosis (now
   trending down) making  septic shock more likely.  Other possibilities
   include hemorrhagic given Hct drop (52 to 40) and pulsatile mass on
   exam; but CT chest did not show evidence of bleed or dissecting
   aneurysm to account for this.  LFTs do show evidence of pancreatitis
   although CT did not show any evidnece of this
   -- CVL in place
   --Continue to wean off pressors
   --Broad coverage with Vanc/Zosyn, day #2
   --IVF (gentle given low EF), NPO for pancreatitis, repeat
   amylase/lipase this AM
   -- Levophed for goal MAP>65
   #Cardiomyopathy- EF 20% on admission; unclear cause; cardiology
   consulted because of dynamic ekg changes seen and concern for
   cardiogenic shock. Felt pt unlikely having ACS
   -Consider swan
   -Continue aspirin, statin
   -
   .
   # DIABETES: Pt with very high glucose on presentation
   -- Continue Insulin drip with conservative goal 120 to 140
   ..
   # OBESITY: S/P Lap banding, pt at increased risk of DVT, will need to
   use Ideal body weight for ventilation
   .
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Intravenous heparin

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a past medical history of morbid obesity (status post gastric lap banding), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with acute respiratory distress and malignant hypertension. The patient's initial assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had a broad differential including pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism (PE). The CT chest ruled out PE, but there are ground glass opacifications which could represent edema, infection, or inflammation. The patient was given an initial dose of Lasix and covered broadly with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The respiratory status has improved, and the patient was weaned to pressure support ventilation (PSV) 8/8. The plan is to continue PSV and repeat arterial blood gas (ABG), respiratory system compliance index (RSBI), and reassess extubation ability.

2. Hypotension: The initial differential included septic shock, cardiogenic shock, and PE. However, the stat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, and the patient's initial presentation was hypertension. Three sets of cardiac enzymes are negative, and the electrocardiogram (EKG) is not consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, making septic shock more likely"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old woman with past medical history of morbid obesity (s/p
   gastric lap banding), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, presenting with
   acute respiratory distress and malignant hypertension.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Patient noted to be ""in extremus"" per ED report,
   intubated initially with ETT in right main stem. Patient with
   periprocedural hypotension (see below), however noted to be severely
   hypertensive on admission.
   Given question of cardiomyopathy on medical record, malignant
   hypertension on arrival and appearance of chest x-ray, ED staff
   suspected flash pulmonary edema as most likely culprit, however other
   etiologies would include pneumonia, aspiration, ARDS, PE, cardiogenic
   shock from ischemia, decompensated cor pulmonale.
   Given BMI, high risk of DVT and PE. Also given extensive family history
   and hyperacute presentation, cardiac ischemia seems very likely.
   -- Given high risk of PE, start heparin empirically (also given high
   suspicion of coronary ischemia)
   -- CTA Chest once stable for transport
   -- Will adjust heparin given pts high discrepancy between ideal and
   actual weight
   -- STAT ECHO, eval for RV strain vs focal wall motion abnormality.
   -- F/U Formal CXR read
   -- A line placement
   -- Wean FIO2 as tolerated, currently on 100%
   -- Given high concern for infection and given critical condition, will
   given one dose of Vancomycin and Zosyn while more data is obtained.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION; DDx nearly identical to above, with most concerning
   etiolgies remaining PE vs, Cardiogenic shock and early sepsis
   -- A line placement
   -- STAT ECHO
   -- Transduce CVP
   -- Would consider Vigileo for hemodynamic monitoring
   -- Vanc/ Zosyn
   -- CVL in place, Levophed gtt as necessary
   -- MAP goal > 55
   -- Cardiac enzymes q8H
   .
   # DIABETES: Pt with very high glucose on presentation
   -- Start Insulin drip with conservative goal 120 to 140
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia / CAD: Very strong family history of CAD, presentation
   and dynamic ECG changes now. DDx now includes demand ischemia vs early
   MI
   -- Atorvastatin loading dose
   -- Aspirin
   -- If enzymes turn positive, will load with Clopidogrel
   .
   # OBESITY: S/P Lap banding, pt at increased risk of DVT, will need to
   use Ideal body weight for ventilation

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with acute respiratory distress and malignant hypertension. The patient was intubated initially with an endotracheal tube in the right main stem due to being in extremis. She also experienced periprocedural hypotension but was found to be severely hypertensive on admission.

The patient's condition is complicated by several potential medical complications. These include respiratory failure, hypotension, pancreatitis, and possible cardiac issues such as coronary ischemia or myocardial infarction. Other potential causes of respiratory failure may include pneumonia, aspiration, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), PE (pulmonary embolism), or cardiogenic shock from ischemia or decompensated cor pulmonale.

Given the high risk of DVT (deep vein thrombosis) and PE, the healthcare team decided to start heparin empirically. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest was ordered once the patient was stable for transport. Additionally, a stat echo (echocardiogram) was recommended to evaluate for right ventricular strain or focal wall motion abnormality. 

The patient's blood work showed elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, with elevated levels of troponin T and CK-MB, suggesting possible cardiac injury. The Amylase and Lipase levels were also elevated"

   54 year old woman with past medical history of morbid obesity (s/p
   gastric lap banding), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, presenting with
   acute respiratory distress and malignant hypertension.

   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Differential initially broad; including
   pulmonary edema (has low EF and pulmonary edema on CXR) vs pneumonia (?
   Infiltrates on exam, elevated WBC on admission/hypotension); CT Chest
   does not show any evidence of PE thus heparin gtt stopped; it does show
   ground glass opacifications which could represent edema vs infection vs
   inflammation plus b/l effusions. Pt was given initial dose of Lasix and
   covered broadly with vanc/zosyn on arrival. Respiratory status
   improving; pt was weaned overnight to PSV 8/8 and doing well
   .Continue PSV and repeat ABG; RSBI and ? able to extubated
   - possible extubation
   -Continue broad coverage with Vanc/Zosyn for possible pneumonia
   - f/u sputum
   -F./u final CT read but no evidnece of PE on initial read
   -will plan to diurese, goal -1L today. CVP goal [**2-28**].   Will give lasix
   20mg IV x1 for now and monitor
   # HYPOTENSION;Initial differential concerning for septic vs cardiogenic
   shock vs PE; however stat ECHO showed EF20% and pts initial
   presentation was hypertension; 3 sets of cardiac enzymes are negative
   and EKG not felt to be c/w ACS. Pt did have a fever/leukocytosis (now
   trending down) making  septic shock more likely.  Other possibilities
   include hemorrhagic given Hct drop (52 to 40) and pulsatile mass on
   exam; but CT chest did not show evidence of bleed or dissecting
   aneurysm to account for this.  LFTs do show evidence of pancreatitis
   although CT did not show any evidnece of this. Pt weaned off pressors
   this AM
   -- CVL in place
   --Broad coverage with Vanc/Zosyn, day #2
   --IVF (gentle given low EF), NPO for pancreatitis, repeat
   amylase/lipase this AM
   --Goal MAP>65
   -- f/u final read of CT to r/o RP bleed
   .
   #. Acute Anemia: No evidence of active bleed on CT scan.  Hct has been
   stable overnight.
   - monitor Hct
   - f/u final CT to look for RP bleed
   - hemolysis labs
   #Cardiomyopathy- EF 20% on admission; unclear cause; cardiology
   consulted because of dynamic ekg changes seen and concern for
   cardiogenic shock. Felt pt unlikely having ACS
   -Consider swan
   -Continue aspirin, statin
   - TSH and thiamine

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with acute respiratory distress and malignant hypertension. The note mentions several potential medical complications that can arise from her condition.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but there is a possibility of pneumonia due to infiltrates on the exam and elevated WBC on admission. Broad coverage with Vanc/Zosyn has been initiated. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support has been provided, and the patient is now on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a goal of extubation.

2. Hypotension: The initial differential diagnosis included septic shock, cardiogenic shock, and pulmonary embolism (PE). However, an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, indicating reduced heart function, and the patient's initial presentation was hypertension rather than hypotension. Three sets of cardiac enzymes are negative, and the electrocardiogram (EKG) does not suggest acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's fever and leukocytosis (now trending down) suggest septic shock as the likely cause. Hemorrhagic shock is also a possibility due to a Hct drop from 52 to 40, but the CT chest did not show evidence of bleeding or a dissecting aneurysm. Liver function tests indicate evidence of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old morbidly obese woman admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and shock. She has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, and is currently on life support in the ICU. The patient's condition remains critical, and she is at risk for several potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress or recur, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Septic Shock: Although the patient's shock has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrent septic shock due to ongoing infection.
3. Acute Anemia: The patient has acute anemia, which can be caused by occult blood loss or hemolysis. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and further evaluation for the underlying cause are necessary.
4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) on echocardiogram, indicating cardiomyopathy. The cause of this condition is unclear, and further investigation is needed to determine the etiology. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy should be considered given the pattern of wall motion abnormalities on echo.
5. Psychiatric Issues: The patient has a history of depression and is currently on Celexa. It is important to resume her psychiatric medication once she is stable.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at increased risk for DVT due to immobility and critical"

The patient is a 54-year-old morbidly obese woman admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and shock. The patient's condition has been very active, and overnight, the infusions of dobutamine and FiO2 were weaned down. A CT torso was reviewed, showing no pulmonary embolism, aneurysm, or dissection. The patient has allergies to morphine and Percocet, and her last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. 

The patient is currently on several medications including fentanyl, norepinephrine, midazolam, insulin, heparin sodium, famotidine, ASA, and Lipitor. Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the events described above. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/66 to 140/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 14 mmHg, with fluid balance totaling 3,088 mL in and 2,888 mL out since 22 AM. Blood products totaling 1,435 mL have been given, and urine output is 635 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old morbidly obese woman with a history of cardiomyopathy, admitted to the ICU with sudden-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure and shock. She has been receiving treatment for acute respiratory failure, septic shock, acute anemia, cardiomyopathy, and other conditions. The patient is currently extubated and on CPAP support, with ongoing management of infection, fluid balance, and cardiac function. There are concerns regarding a thigh collection that may be a source of infection, and a surgery consult has been requested. The patient's code status is full, and she is expected to remain in the ICU with further evaluation and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia or cardiogenic edema/effusions.
2. Septic shock, which has resolved but may recur if infection is not effectively managed.
3. Acute anemia, possibly due to occult blood loss or hemolysis, requires further evaluation.
4. Cardiomyopathy with low ejection fraction, unclear etiology, and potential for Takotsubo physiology.
5. Thigh collection that may be a source of infection, requiring surgical evaluation.
6. OSA, for which nocturnal CPAP support may be initiated.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information or tests may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old morbidly obese woman admitted with sudden-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure and shock. She has been receiving invasive ventilation but it has been stopped. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 130/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 18 mmHg, total input of 2,673 mL and output of 3,671 mL, and a negative fluid balance of -998 mL.

The patient has undergone several tests and procedures including a sputum culture, ultrasound, nasal swab for flu, MRI for a suspected abscess/cellulitis in the right lower extremity, EKG, and various lab tests. The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, high lactate levels, elevated D-dimer levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has multiple medical issues including acute respiratory failure, shock (presumably septic), acute anemia, cardiomyopathy with low ejection fraction, psychosocial concerns, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The plan includes continuing antibiotics empirically, diuresis to target a total body water (T"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old morbidly obese woman admitted with sudden-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure and shock. She has a history of cardiomyopathy, although the extent is unknown. The patient's condition includes acute respiratory failure, shock, acute anemia, cardiomyopathy, and psychiatric issues. She is currently receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, and cardiac support. There are several potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions, such as pneumonia, cardiogenic edema/effusions, occult bleeding, hemolysis, and cardiac dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure, there is a risk of developing pneumonia due to the compromised lung function and potential aspiration.
2. Cardiogenic edema/effusions: The patient's history of cardiomyopathy and the presence of bibasilar rales on physical examination suggest the possibility of cardiogenic edema or effusions.
3. Occult bleeding: The patient's low hematocrit (Hct) levels and history of shock raise concerns about potential occult bleeding, which may be contributing to her anemia.
4. Hemolysis: The slightly elevated hemolysis labs and abnormal smear could indicate hemolysis, although it is not convincing in this case.
5. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's low ejection fraction (EF) and unclear etiology of cardiomyopathy necessitate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old morbidly obese woman admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and shock. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with invasive ventilation, but there is a plan to extubate her today if she passes a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). However, given her high likelihood for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), she may need to be directly transitioned to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.

2. Shock: The patient has resolved septic shock, which was presumed based on her clinical presentation and laboratory findings. It is important to continue monitoring her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) and managing any ongoing infection.

3. Acute Anemia: The patient is being evaluated for acute anemia, which could be due to occult blood loss or hemolysis. Serial Hct measurements and hemolysis labs are being ordered to determine the cause.

4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) with unclear etiology. There is no evidence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but the possibility of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is being considered given the pattern of wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography. Further evaluation of thiamine levels, low-dose beta-blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy is planned.

5. Psychiatric: The patient's psychiatric medication, Celexa, should be resumed.

6. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): Long-term management of OSA will involve initiating nocturnal BiPAP therapy and considering an outpatient sleep study/titration.

Potential complications that could arise include worsening respiratory failure if extubation fails, recurrent or persistent shock, progression of anemia, development of complications from cardiomyopathy, and potential psychiatric issues if medication is not resumed."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old morbidly obese woman admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and shock. She has been receiving treatment for acute respiratory failure, which includes continuous vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam empirically. The patient is also being diuresed to target a tidal volume of 1-2 liters per day and goal central venous pressure (CVP) around 5. She is expected to be extubated today if she passes a spontaneous breathing trial, and may need direct transition to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) due to the high likelihood of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

The patient's shock has resolved, presumed to be septic, with a notable 10-point hemoglobin (Hct) drop but no clinical correlate. Monitoring of Hct and management of infection will continue. The patient is also being evaluated for acute anemia, considering occult loss versus hemolysis, with serial Hct and hemolysis labs ordered.

There is a concern for cardiomyopathy with low ejection fraction (EF) of unclear etiology. No acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is present and an echocardiogram from [**2110**] showed regional wall motion abnormalities consistent with Takotsubo physiology. Thiamine levels should be followed up, and low-dose beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be considered.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old morbidly obese woman who was admitted with sudden-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure and shock. She has been receiving treatment for acute respiratory failure, presumed septic shock, acute anemia, cardiomyopathy with low ejection fraction, psychosocial issues, and obstructive sleep apnea.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially requiring advanced respiratory support such as invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

2. Septic Shock: Despite initial resolution of shock, the patient remains at risk for recurrent or worsening sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure. Continuous monitoring and aggressive management of infection are crucial.

3. Acute Anemia: The patient's drop in hemoglobin concentration may indicate acute blood loss or hemolysis. Serial hematocrit measurements and further investigation are needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

4. Cardiomyopathy: The low ejection fraction suggests impaired cardiac function. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause, such as ischemic heart disease, myocarditis, or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Appropriate cardiac support and optimization of cardiac function are essential.

5. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient has a high likelihood of OSA, which can contribute to respiratory failure"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 54-year-old morbidly obese woman admitted with sudden-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure and shock. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that can arise, including:

1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, which could be due to pneumonia or cardiogenic edema/effusions. The patient has already been started on empirical antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) but these have been stopped as no pneumonia was found. Diuretics are being used to target a daily fluid balance between -1 to -2 liters and maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) around 5. The patient is also being extubated and monitored for pleural effusions.

2. Shock: The patient experienced shock, which was presumed to be septic. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) dropped by 10 points, but there was no clinical correlate. The patient is being monitored closely for any signs of infection and anemia.

3. Acute anemia: The patient is being evaluated for acute anemia, possibly due to occult blood loss or hemolysis. Serial hematocrit measurements, guaiac stool tests, and hemolysis labs are being followed.

4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a low ejection fraction (EF) of unclear etiology. There is a possibility of Takotsubo"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   54 year old woman with past medical history of morbid obesity (s/p
   gastric lap banding), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, presenting with
   acute respiratory distress and malignant hypertension.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Differential initially broad; including
   pulmonary edema (has low EF and pulmonary edema on CXR) vs pneumonia (?
   Infiltrates on exam, elevated WBC on admission/hypotension); CT Chest
   does not show any evidence of PE thus heparin gtt stopped; it does show
   ground glass opacifications which could represent edema vs infection vs
   inflammation plus b/l effusions. Pt was given initial dose of Lasix and
   covered broadly with vanc/zosyn on arrival. Respiratory status
   improving; pt was weaned overnight to PSV 8/8 and doing well
   .Continue PSV and repeat ABG; RSBI and ? able to extubated
   - possible extubation
   -Continue broad coverage with Vanc/Zosyn for possible pneumonia
   - f/u sputum
   -F./u final CT read but no evidnece of PE on initial read
   -will plan to diurese, goal -1L today. CVP goal [**2-28**].   Will give lasix
   20mg IV x1 for now and monitor
   # HYPOTENSION;Initial differential concerning for septic vs cardiogenic
   shock vs PE; however stat ECHO showed EF20% and pts initial
   presentation was hypertension; 3 sets of cardiac enzymes are negative
   and EKG not felt to be c/w ACS. Pt did have a fever/leukocytosis (now
   trending down) making  septic shock more likely.  Other possibilities
   include hemorrhagic given Hct drop (52 to 40) and pulsatile mass on
   exam; but CT chest did not show evidence of bleed or dissecting
   aneurysm to account for this.  LFTs do show evidence of pancreatitis
   although CT did not show any evidnece of this. Pt weaned off pressors
   this AM
   -- CVL in place
   --Broad coverage with Vanc/Zosyn, day #2
   --IVF (gentle given low EF), NPO for pancreatitis, repeat
   amylase/lipase this AM
   --Goal MAP>65
   -- f/u final read of CT to r/o RP bleed
   .
   #. Acute Anemia: No evidence of active bleed on CT scan.  Hct has been
   stable overnight.
   - monitor Hct
   - f/u final CT to look for RP bleed
   - hemolysis labs
   #Cardiomyopathy- EF 20% on admission; unclear cause; cardiology
   consulted because of dynamic ekg changes seen and concern for
   cardiogenic shock. Felt pt unlikely having ACS
   -Consider swan
   -Continue aspirin, statin
   - TSH and thiamine
   .
   # DIABETES: Pt with very high glucose on presentation
   -- Continue Insulin drip with conservative goal 120 to 140
   -- will switch to sliding scale
   ..
   # OBESITY: S/P Lap banding, pt at increased risk of DVT, will need to
   use Ideal body weight for ventilation
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a past medical history of morbid obesity (s/p gastric lap banding), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with acute respiratory distress and malignant hypertension. She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure, possibly due to pulmonary edema or pneumonia. She was given Lasix and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) and her respiratory status has been improving. She may require continued respiratory support and further evaluation with a repeat ABG.
2. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which could be due to septic shock, cardiogenic shock, or pulmonary embolism. A stat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 20%, indicating reduced cardiac function. Cardiac enzymes were negative, making acute coronary syndrome less likely. The hypotension may continue to be managed with fluid administration and vasopressors.
3. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient's LFTs indicate pancreatitis, although the CT scan did not show evidence of this. She should be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) and have repeat amylase/lipase levels.
4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a low ejection fraction of 20%, suggesting cardiomyopathy. Cardiology has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, hypotension, and acute pancreatitis. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 136/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of abdominal pain. The patient has a history of allergies to morphine and Percocet, and he has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium, furosemide, famotidine, and hydromorphone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation support due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if proper care is not taken.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal range, but there is a risk of developing septic shock or other types of shock if the underlying cause of hypotension is not appropriately managed.
3. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. There is a risk of complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst formation, or infected pancreatic necrosis if the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a past medical history of morbid obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted with acute respiratory distress and malignant hypertension. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, hypotension (not shock), and acute pancreatitis.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and was intubated. She received initial doses of Lasix and broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn). Her respiratory status improved, and she was extubated overnight. However, she did not tolerate BiPAP, so it will be discontinued. The patient will continue to be monitored for respiratory viral screen and will be given Lasix 40mg. The goal is to diurese 1 liter today, and her CVP goal is set at 2-28.

2. Hypotension: The initial differential diagnosis included septic shock, cardiogenic shock, and pulmonary embolism. However, an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, indicating cardiogenic shock. The patient's initial presentation was hypertension, and three sets of cardiac enzymes are negative, ruling out acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Other possibilities such as hemorrhagic shock or a pulsatile mass on exam were considered, but CT chest did not show evidence of bleed or dissecting aneurysm. The patient's LFTs indicate evidence of pancreatitis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a medical history of morbid obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with acute respiratory distress and malignant hypertension. She was initially intubated but extubated overnight after her respiratory status improved. She is currently on room air and receiving diuretics. Her sputum culture showed Staphylococcus aureus, so she has been restarted on vancomycin. Her cardiac enzymes are negative, but she has a reduced ejection fraction of 20%. Cardiology was consulted due to dynamic EKG changes and concern for cardiogenic shock. The patient's other lab results indicate acute pancreatitis and elevated D-dimer levels. She has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics and will continue to receive IV fluids and monitoring. She has a history of gastric lap banding and is at increased risk for DVT. She is being weaned off insulin and will continue with a cardiac diabetic diet. Her code status is full code, and she is being considered for transfer to the floor.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory distress and required intubation. Although she was extubated overnight, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to underlying conditions such as pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
2. Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation was malignant hypertension, but her blood pressure has stabilized over the past 48 hours. However, she may still"

   pulmonary edema (has low EF and pulmonary edema on CXR) vs pneumonia (?
   Infiltrates on exam, elevated WBC on admission/hypotension); CT Chest
   does not show any evidence of PE thus heparin gtt stopped; it does show
   ground glass opacifications which could represent edema vs infection vs
   inflammation plus b/l effusions. Pt was given initial dose of Lasix and
   covered broadly with vanc/zosyn on arrival. Respiratory status improved
   and extubated overnight. Pt did not toelrate BiPAP overnight

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with acute respiratory distress and malignant hypertension. She was initially treated with Lasix and broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) due to suspected pulmonary edema or pneumonia. Her respiratory status improved, and she was extubated overnight. However, she did not tolerate bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and will have the antibiotics discontinued since there is no evidence of infection. The goal is to diurese 1 liter today with a target central venous pressure (CVP) of 2-8 mmHg. She will receive another dose of Lasix.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory distress. The initial differential diagnosis included pulmonary edema, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism (PE). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest did not show any evidence of PE, so heparin was stopped. Ground glass opacifications were observed on the CT scan, which could represent edema, infection, or inflammation. Bilateral effusions were also noted. The patient responded well to initial treatment with Lasix and broad-spectrum antibiotics, and her respiratory status improved. She was extubated overnight but did not tolerate BiPAP.

2. Hypotension: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old morbidly obese woman with a history of cardiomyopathy, admitted with sudden-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure and shock. She has been receiving treatment for acute respiratory failure, which includes antibiotics, diuretics, and respiratory support. The patient's shock has resolved, but she is still being monitored for infection and potential causes of acute anemia. She also has a history of cardiomyopathy with unclear etiology and low ejection fraction. Other issues include psychosocial concerns and a thigh collection that may be a source of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial condition of hypoxemic respiratory failure indicates a potential complication in her ability to breathe adequately. This could be due to pneumonia or cardiogenic edema/effusions related to her cardiomyopathy.
2. Shock: The patient experienced septic shock, which has since resolved. However, she is still at risk for further complications related to infection and the underlying cause of the shock.
3. Acute Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have dropped significantly, and there is an evaluation underway for occult blood loss or hemolysis. This could be due to various factors, including gastrointestinal bleeding or a transfusion reaction.
4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy with an unclear etiology. This condition can lead to heart failure and further complications if not properly managed.
5. Thigh Collection: The presence of a thigh collection, possibly an abscess, needs to be addressed as it could be a source of infection and should be evaluated by surgery.
6. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient has a history of OSA, and measures should be taken to manage this condition, including the initiation of nocturnal CPAP therapy."

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old morbidly obese woman who was admitted with sudden-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure and shock. She is now extubated and improving with diuresis. The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy, and her condition includes acute respiratory failure, shock, acute anemia, cardiomyopathy, psych issues, a known thigh lipoma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and hematuria. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is being managed for infection, fluid balance, and cardiac issues. She is scheduled to be transferred to the cardiology floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Shock: The patient experienced shock, likely secondary to sepsis, and required intensive care management. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and prompt treatment of any signs of recurrent shock are essential.
3. Acute anemia: The patient has acute anemia, possibly due to occult blood loss or hemolysis. Regular monitoring of hematocrit levels and evaluation for the cause of anemia are crucial to prevent complications related to low blood cell count.
4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy with an unknown etiology. Management of her cardiac condition is ongoing, including diuretics,"
