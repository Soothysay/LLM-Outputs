   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is an 84 year-old female with a history of mod-severe
   AS (valve area 0.8-1.0), mild COPD, pulm HTN, osteoporosis s/p repair
   of periprosthetic fracture of the right femur.
   .
   Plan:
   # Right periprosthetic femur fracture: s/p surgical repair today (R THA
   Femoral component w/ fixation R femur)
   - Lovenox initiated for DVT PPX
   - ABX for 24 hr - Ancef
   - Hip abduction pillow/brace
   - pain control
   - repeat hip/femur X-ray [**10-7**]
   - Monitor uop
   .
   #Respiratory Failure: pt intubated, but neurologically active.  Pt has
   been given >8L fluids intra-op and post-op.  Pt with history of severe
   AS and given volume status may be difficulty weaning from vent.
   However, CXR this AM did not show increasing pulmonary edema. RSBI was
   <100 today.  Pt was placed on 5/0 and tolerating.
   - will attempt to wean and extubate this AM
   - will have BiPap ready  at bedside
   - pull ET tube back 3-4 cm if not extubated today.
   .
   #Hypotension:  Pt with continued intermittent hypotension throughout
   the night and evening.  Given hx of AS ventilation could be
   contributing to decreased pre-load and hypotension.  Additionally, pt
   could be volume depleted post-op and sedation could contribute to
   hypotension.
   - Will monitor and bolus with IV fluids
   - will have dobutamine and neo ready at bedside if pt becomes pressor
   dependent
   .
   # Aortic Stenosis (Mod-severe - valve area 0.8-1.0cmsq): Seen by
   cardiology pre-op. Received pRBC transfusion prior to surgery,
   b-blocker continued perioperatively. Did well during surgery w/ CVP
   7-10 and SBP 100-110 without need for pressors. Will likely cont. to
   require volume. Long term plan for elective AV replacement.
   - Cont. to maintain CVP > 7, MAP > 65, bolus as needed
   - Per cards, if pressors needed would use phenylephrine
   - Cont. aspirin
   - F/u cards recs
   .
   # COPD - Mild by PFTs. Poor respiratory reserve felt to be secondary to
   AS/cardiac
   - cont. Flovent, prn albuterol
   .
   # Osteoporosis
   - VitD/Ca post-op and cont. bisphosphonate

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis (AS), mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, osteoporosis, and a recent periprosthetic fracture of the right femur which was surgically repaired.
- The patient experienced an episode of hypotension after initiation of sedation overnight, with a blood pressure dropping to 50 systolic. The patient was given a 500cc normal saline bolus and 0.4mg narcan, and the blood pressure responded.
- The central venous line was found to be in the vertebral vein, so it was decided to pull the line.
- The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been placed on 5/0 in preparation for possible extubation this morning.
- Allergies include hives from Bactrim DS (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim).
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 86/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

","The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of moderate-severe aortic stenosis, mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, osteoporosis, and a recent periprosthetic fracture of the right femur. She underwent surgical repair of the fracture today, which included replacement of the right total hip arthroplasty (THA) femoral component with fixation on the right femur.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 104 bpm with a normal range of 103-135 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 49/34 mmHg to 207/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with a set rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube ventilation.

The patient has been given fluids and may have difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to her history. The plan is to attempt weaning and extubation this morning.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values show a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 43 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 294 mmHg, and oxygen ventilation (Ve) of 6.6 L/min. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 50%, and the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 24 cmH2O with a plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O.

The patient has an indwelling urinary catheter (TF), multi-lumen central venous catheter, arterial line, and two peripheral intravenous lines. She is receiving infusions of midazolam and fentanyl for sedation and pain control, respectively.

The patient's laboratory results show a TCO2 level of 26. The plan includes monitoring for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with Lovenox, antibiotic coverage for 24 hours with Ancef, providing a hip abduction pillow and brace, controlling pain, repeating hip/femur X-ray, and monitoring urine output.

The potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure due to difficulty weaning from the ventilator, cardiovascular instability due to moderate-severe aortic stenosis, and infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of moderate-severe aortic stenosis, mild COPD, pulmonary hypertension, osteoporosis, and a recent repair of a periprosthetic fracture of the right femur. She underwent surgical repair of the fracture and received a transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) during the operation. The patient is currently in the ICU, where she has been experiencing hypotension and has required increased doses of norepinephrine (neo). Her urine output has been low, and she has leukocytosis post-op. The patient's respiratory status may be complicated by pulmonary edema due to severe AS, but she appears comfortable and is maintaining adequate oxygenation with the use of supplemental oxygen. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's continued hypotension and slightly increased neo requirement suggest that she may be volume depleted post-op. This could be further complicated by preload dependency due to severe AS. The patient's limited pain medications could also be contributing to hypotension. Plan: Attempt to wean neo, monitor and bolus with IV fluids, consider adding dobutamine if hypotensive, follow-up cardiology recommendations, and hold on any antibiotics for now.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of severe AS and given volume status may complicate respiratory status. However, the patient appears comfortable and is maintaining adequate oxygenation with the"

The patient underwent surgical repair of the fracture today, involving replacement of the right total hip arthroplasty (THA) femoral component with fixation on the right femur.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and had a tracheostomy placed. She was successfully extubated. The patient's respiratory status may be complicated by pulmonary edema due to her severe aortic stenosis and volume status. However, she appears comfortable and is maintaining adequate oxygen saturation. The plan is to attempt to wean off oxygen as tolerated and consider Lasix if she experiences shortness of breath or new oxygen requirements.

The patient continues to experience hypotension and has an increased need for vasopressor support with neoroleptin (neo) at 0.7 mcg/kg/min. She also has low urine output. There are no obvious signs of infection, and she has been afebrile with negative cultures. Her leukocytosis post-op is trending down and could be dilutional or reactive due to surgery. No evidence of myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram (EKG) and cardiac enzymes negative. The patient has limited pain medications, but it could"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of moderate-severe aortic stenosis (AS), mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, and osteoporosis. She underwent surgical repair of a periprosthetic fracture of the right femur and is currently in the ICU. The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, hypotension, anemia, COPD, osteoporosis, GERD, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: Given the patient's severe AS and volume status, respiratory status may be complicated by pulmonary edema. Monitoring and managing fluid balance will be important.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to experience hypotension despite increased neo requirement. Factors such as preload dependence due to AS, post-operative volume depletion, limited pain medication, and potential dilutional leukocytosis should be considered. Weaning of neo, blood transfusion, IV fluids, and possible addition of dobutamine may be necessary.
3. Anemia: The patient had approximately 2L estimated blood loss during surgery and received 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) in the operating room. Her current Hct is 23.1, indicating ongoing anemia. Transfusion of additional pRBCs with possible lasix administration will be planned to achieve a target Hct >25.
4. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD may worsen due to factors such as AS/cardiac-related poor respiratory reserve. Close monitoring and management of respiratory status will be essential.
5. Osteoporosis Fracture Risk: The patient's osteoporosis increases the risk of future fractures. Vitamin D/Ca supplementation post-op and continuation of bisphosphonate therapy will be important for long-term management.
6. GERD: Continuation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is recommended for GERD management.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving low molecular weight (LMW) heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
8. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): VAP prevention strategies should be implemented, including elevation of the head of the bed, peep, and appropriate antibiotic stewardship.
9. Cardiac Diet: A cardiac diet should be initiated, and the patient's volume status should be closely monitored given her AS.
10. Electrolyte Imbalance: Repletion of electrolytes as needed will be important to maintain electrolyte balance.
11. Code Status: The patient has full code status, and this should be confirmed with the family in the morning.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information from other sources may be necessary for a more comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of moderate-severe aortic stenosis, mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, and osteoporosis. She underwent surgical repair of a periprosthetic fracture of the right femur. The patient was successfully extubated and is currently on 2 liters of nasal cannula oxygen, which is her baseline requirement. She has a history of severe aortic stenosis and may have complications such as pulmonary edema due to volume status. However, she appears comfortable and is oxygenating well.

The patient was weaned off pressors yesterday and her blood pressure is stable in the range of 110-120 mmHg. She has a low urine output of around 30 cc/hr. There are no signs of infection, and she is afebrile with negative cultures. Her leukocytosis post-op has resolved, and there is no evidence of myocardial infarction on EKG and cardiac enzymes are negative. The patient could be contributing to hypotension due to limited pain medication use.

The patient received a blood transfusion prior to surgery and will receive another transfusion today. Her hematocrit (Hct) is currently at 24.3%. The long-term plan for her is elective aortic valve replacement. She will continue to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) >7, mean arterial pressure (MAP) >"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of moderate-severe aortic stenosis (AS), mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary hypertension, and osteoporosis. She underwent surgical repair of a periprosthetic fracture of the right femur. The patient's current condition is stable, with controlled pain and vital signs within normal ranges. However, there are several potential medical complications to consider:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of severe AS and may be at risk for pulmonary edema due to fluid balance. Close monitoring of respiratory status is necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite weaning off the pressors. Low urine output may be contributing to the hypotension. IV fluid bolus and hypertensive medications may be considered.

3. Anemia: The patient has an estimated blood loss of approximately 2L during surgery. Her hematocrit (Hct) is currently 24.3%, indicating anemia. A plan to transfuse 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) over 4 hours today has been made to maintain a post-transfusion Hct greater than 25%.

4. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has moderate-severe AS, which requires long-term planning for elective aortic valve replacement (AVR). Monitoring CVP, MAP, and maintaining them above certain thresholds is recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female who underwent orthopedic left hip fixation surgery and was admitted to the ICU for post-operative observation due to severe aortic stenosis (AS). She experienced hypotension that has since resolved. The patient has been hemodynamically stable overnight, with adequate pain control. Her pressors were weaned yesterday, and she is expected to be transferred to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: Although the patient's hypotension has resolved, there is a potential for it to recur, especially if cardiovascular medications are reduced or discontinued too quickly.
2. Orthopedic Complications: Immobilization of the hip post-surgery may lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of severe aortic stenosis (AS) puts her at risk for cardiac complications, including reduced cardiac output and heart failure.
4. Infection: As with any surgical procedure, there is a risk of infection at the surgical site or in other areas of the body.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's use of a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery may increase the risk of respiratory infections or aspiration pneumonia.
6. Medication Reactions: Given the patient's history of hives with Bactrim, there is a possibility of allergic reactions to certain medications.
7. Delirium: Elderly patients, especially those with significant medical histories and recent surgical procedures, are at risk for delirium.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based solely on the information provided in the progress note."
