   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo M, recently diagnosed with lymphoma, immunosupressed on Decadron
   x 3 weeks, p/w b/l LE cellulitis and CP several days with nonhealing
   ulcer on R foot x 7 years.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented to ED with tachycardia, elevated bands, and +GS
   on blood culture c/w sepsis; no evidence of organ hypoperfusion. Source
   of infection most likely related to patient
s chronic RLE ulcer with
   resulting cellulitis/polymyositis in setting of immunosupression on
   Decadron for past 3 weeks and given h/o MRSA infection in R foot. With
   involvement of scrotum, could be polymycrobial origin, though no e/o
   crepitus as this point to suspect Fournier's; UA neg. Does not have
   significant pain distally, but given neuropathy, may be poor indicator
   of disease severity. CVP about >10. MAP >65. Yet pt continues to be
   tachycardic. Afebrile.
   - Continue Vancomycin (slowly given RM syndrome), Unasyn and
   Clindamycin for potential polymicrobial infection
   - Continue IVF with NS (avoid LR given ceftriaxone) at 250cc/hr for 1L
   - Appreciate surgery, ID, and plastics c/s and will f/u recs
   - Wound care consult for R foot, podiatry c/s
   - Maintain adequate IV access for potential resuscitation, currently
   with 2 PIV x 18 and x20g; CVL in R SCL
   - Follow-up all cultures, CXR
   - Check lactate
   - Stress dose steroids if septic shock
   # Chest pain: Likely [**2-23**] pericarditis vs myositis.  With regards to
   pericarditis, etiology most likely infectious related but also consider
   neoplastic (metastatic lymphoma) or cardiovascular (CHF, MI). Does have
   elevated BNP which could be [**2-23**] myositic process.   Will also rule-out
   ACS, though EKG most consistent with diffuse process such as
   pericarditis. Bedside ECHO: normal LV fxn, LVEF>55%), mild MR, mod
   posterior pericardial effusion, no signs of tamponade).
   - ROMI
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Formal ECHO today?
   - Cardiology recs
   - Ibuprofen scheduled for pericarditis (could also use indomethacine or
   colcicine)
   - Will continue on Decadron PRN
   - Pain management with Darvocet, Morphine PRN
   # Tachycardia: Likely [**2-23**] multiple etiologies including systemic
   inflammatory response/sepsis, pain, anxiety, and pericarditis.  No
   evidence of tamponade on bedside Echo in ED.  No e/o ACS at this
   point.  Tox screen neg.  Not on beta blocker so unlikely to be having
   rebound.  Does have h/o hypothyroidism, will check TSH.
   - IVF, on 4L, will slow to 250cc
   - Ibuprofen for pericarditis
   - Darvocet for pain, Morphine PRN
   - f/u TSH
   # Bandemia: Likely from cellulitis vs polymyositis as above.  Other
   possible sources including urine, pleural effusion or pericardial
   effusion.
   - Follow-up urine/blood cultures &  Antibiotics as above
   # Decreased RR: Likely [**2-23**] over medication with dilaudid and Darvocet,
   though patient confirms these are both his home doses. Adequate RR O/N.
   - Discontinue further dilaudid use
   - Darvocet PRN with holding parameters
   - Narcan PRN
   # R foot ulcer: Appears clean at base with clear fluid.  VNA services
   at home.
   - Appreciate Plastics inputs
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Will obtain CT of foot to assess for OM.
   - Podiatry c/s
   - daily wet to dry dressing changes
   - wound culture
   # L-spine lymphoma: States to have been dx about 6 weeks prior.
   Unclear how dx, states followed by [**Doctor Last Name 1226**] (Neurology) at [**Hospital1 **].  On
   decadron x 6 weeks for ?stenosis or cord compression?.
   - Discuss with [**Doctor Last Name 1226**], obtain records
   - Will slightly wean steroids to 4mg TID given concern for diffuse
   infection
   - Hold stress dose steroids unless develops septic physiology
   # Neurogenic Bladder: Continue oxybutyin.  Foley catheter in place.
   # Diffuse rash: Back, anterior chest wall, forehead.  Most c/w
   folliculitis.  Likely [**2-23**] bacterial overgrowth since the decadron.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of lymphoma and immunosuppression due to steroid treatment. The patient presented to the emergency department with tachycardia, elevated bands, and positive gelatinous syndrome on blood culture, indicating sepsis. The source of infection is likely related to the patient's chronic right lower extremity ulcer, which has been present for 7 years and has resulted in cellulitis and polymyositis in the setting of immunosuppression.

The patient also has involvement of the scrotum, suggesting a polymicrobial origin. However, there is no evidence of crepitus, which would suggest Fournier's gangrene. The patient's urine analysis is negative, and he does not have significant pain in the lower extremities, although his neuropathy may make him a poor indicator of disease severity. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is less than 10, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) is greater than 65, but the patient continues to be tachycardic. He is afebrile.

The assessment and plan include continuing vancomycin, Unasyn, and Clindamycin for potential polymicrobial infection. The patient will receive intravenous fluids with normal saline at 250cc/hr for 1L. Adequate IV access will be maintained for potential resuscitation, and follow-up cultures, chest X-ray,"

The patient's condition is complicated by multiple medical issues including pericarditis, tachycardia, bandemia, decreased respiratory rate, and a diffuse rash.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has already presented with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic inflammatory response to an infection. The source of infection appears to be related to the chronic right foot ulcer with involvement of the scrotum. Continuous monitoring and prompt treatment are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Pericarditis: The patient is suspected to have pericarditis, which is inflammation of the pericardium (the sac surrounding the heart). This condition can lead to chest pain, difficulty breathing, and even cardiac tamponade if left untreated. Ibuprofen has been scheduled for pericarditis management.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may have multiple etiologies"

   ulcer on R foot x 7 years.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented to ED with tachycardia, elevated bands, and +GS
   on blood culture c/w sepsis; no evidence of organ hypoperfusion. Source
   of infection most likely related to patient
s chronic RLE ulcer with
   resulting cellulitis/polymyositis in setting of immunosupression on
   Decadron for past 3 weeks and given h/o MRSA infection in R foot. Also
   considering fungal infection. With involvement of scrotum, could be
   polymycrobial origin, though no e/o crepitus as this point to suspect
   Fournier's. UA neg. CVP about >10. MAP >65. Yet pt continues to be
   tachycardic. Afebrile.
   - Continue Vancomycin (slowly given RM syndrome), Unasyn and
   Clindamycin for potential polymicrobial infection

   - Follow-up all cultures, CXR
   - Check lactate
   - Stress dose steroids if septic shock
   # Chest pain: Likely [**2-23**] pericarditis vs myositis.  With regards to
   pericarditis, etiology most likely infectious related but also consider
   neoplastic (metastatic lymphoma) or cardiovascular (CHF, MI). Does have
   elevated BNP which could be [**2-23**] myositic process.   Will also rule-out
   ACS, though EKG most consistent with diffuse process such as
   pericarditis. Bedside ECHO: normal LV fxn, LVEF>55%), mild MR, mod
   posterior pericardial effusion, no signs of tamponade).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male diagnosed with lymphoma, who presented to the emergency department with tachycardia, elevated bands, and positive global signs on blood culture, indicating sepsis. The source of infection is believed to be related to the patient's chronic right lower extremity ulcer with resulting cellulitis and polymyositis in the setting of immunosuppression on Decadron for the past three weeks and a history of MRSA infection in the right foot. The patient also has involvement of the scrotum, which could be polymicrobial in origin, though no evidence of crepitus suggests Fournier's gangrene. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin, Unasyn, and Clindamycin for potential polymicrobial infection. He is also being given intravenous fluids and has multiple lines placed for potential resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing further complications related to sepsis, including organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Chronic right lower extremity ulcer with cellulitis and polymyositis: The patient's chronic ulcer may continue to pose a risk for recurrent infections and potential progression of the cellulitis and polymyositis.
3. Fournier's gangrene: Although there is currently no evidence of crepitus, the involvement of the scrotum raises concerns for this potentially life-threatening infection.
4. Right foot infection:"

The patient also has chest pain suggestive of pericarditis or myositis, elevated BNP, and diffuse rash on the back, anterior chest wall, and forehead, which could be folliculitis or bacterial overgrowth since starting Decadron.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cellulitis: The patient has extensive cellulitis involving the scrotum and lower abdomen, which could progress rapidly and potentially lead to necrotizing fasciitis or sepsis.
2. Chronic pressure ulcer: The patient has a nonhealing ulcer on the right foot for seven years, which may become infected and complicate further.
3. Polymicrobial infection: Given the involvement of the scrotum and immunosuppression, there is a concern for a polymicrobial origin of infection, which can be challenging to treat.
4. Fournier's gangrene: With involvement of the scrotum, there is a concern for Fournier's gangrene, a life-threatening infection requiring surgical intervention.
5. Myositis: The patient's chest pain and elevated BNP could indicate myositis, which needs to be ruled out and managed accordingly.
6. Pericarditis: The patient's chest"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo M, recently diagnosed with lymphoma, immunosupressed on Decadron
   x 3 weeks, p/w b/l LE cellulitis and CP several days with nonhealing
   ulcer on R foot x 7 years.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented to ED with tachycardia, elevated bands, and +GS
   on blood culture c/w sepsis; no evidence of organ hypoperfusion. Source
   of infection most likely related to patient
s chronic RLE ulcer with
   resulting cellulitis/polymyositis in setting of immunosupression on
   Decadron for past 3 weeks and given h/o MRSA infection in R foot. Also
   considering sinusitis and fungal infection (considering
   immunosuppression and skin impairment). With involvement of scrotum,
   could be polymycrobial origin, though no e/o crepitus as this point to
   suspect Fournier's. UA neg. CVP about >10. MAP >65. Yet pt continues to
   be tachycardic. Afebrile.
   - Continue Vancomycin (slowly given RM syndrome), Unasyn and
   Clindamycin for potential polymicrobial infection
   - Continue IVF with NS (avoid LR given ceftriaxone) at 250cc/hr for 1L
   - Appreciate surgery, ID, and plastics c/s and will f/u recs
   - Wound care consult for R foot, podiatry c/s
   - Maintain adequate IV access for potential resuscitation, currently
   with 2 PIV x 18 and x20g; CVL in R SCL
   - Follow-up all cultures, CXR
   - Check lactate
   - Stress dose steroids if septic shock
   - Warm pack to right arm
   # Chest pain: Likely [**2-23**] pericarditis vs myositis.  With regards to
   pericarditis, etiology most likely infectious related but also consider
   neoplastic (metastatic lymphoma) or cardiovascular (CHF, MI). Does have
   elevated BNP which could be [**2-23**] myositic process.   Will also rule-out
   ACS, though EKG most consistent with diffuse process such as
   pericarditis. Bedside ECHO: normal LV fxn, LVEF>55%), mild MR, mod
   posterior pericardial effusion, no signs of tamponade).
   - ROMI
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Formal ECHO today?
   - Cardiology recs
   - Ibuprofen scheduled for pericarditis (could also use indomethacine or
   colcicine)
   - Will continue on Decadron PRN
   - Pain management with Darvocet, Morphine PRN, percocet
   # Tachycardia: Likely [**2-23**] multiple etiologies including systemic
   inflammatory response/sepsis, pain, anxiety, and pericarditis.  No
   evidence of tamponade on bedside Echo in ED.  No e/o ACS at this
   point.  Tox screen neg.  Not on beta blocker so unlikely to be having
   rebound.  Does have h/o hypothyroidism, will check TSH.
   - IVF, on 4L, will slow to 250cc
   - Ibuprofen for pericarditis
   - Darvocet for pain, Morphine PRN
   - f/u TSH
   #Sinusitis:
   -[**Doctor First Name **]
   # Bandemia: Likely from cellulitis vs polymyositis as above.  Other
   possible sources including urine, pleural effusion or pericardial
   effusion.
   - Follow-up urine/blood cultures &  Antibiotics as above
   # Decreased RR: Likely [**2-23**] over medication with dilaudid and Darvocet,
   though patient confirms these are both his home doses. Adequate RR O/N.
   - Discontinue further dilaudid use
   - Darvocet PRN with holding parameters
   - Narcan PRN
   # R foot ulcer: Appears clean at base with clear fluid.  VNA services
   at home.
   - Appreciate Plastics inputs
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Will obtain CT of foot to assess for OM.
   - Podiatry c/s
   - daily wet to dry dressing changes
   - f/u wound culture/biopsy
   # L-spine lymphoma: States to have been dx about 6 weeks prior.
   Unclear how dx, states followed by [**Doctor Last Name 1226**] (Neurology) at [**Hospital1 **].  On
   decadron x 6 weeks for ?stenosis or cord compression?.
   - Discuss with [**Doctor Last Name 1226**], obtain records
   - Will slightly wean steroids to 4mg TID given concern for diffuse
   infection
   - Hold stress dose steroids unless develops septic physiology
   # Neurogenic Bladder: Continue oxybutyin.  Foley catheter in place.
   # Diffuse rash: Back, anterior chest wall, forehead.  Most c/w
   folliculitis.  Likely [**2-23**] bacterial overgrowth since the decadron
   although could be fungal related.
   -          Monitor
   -          Consult derm per plastics
   PPx: bowel regimen PRN, hold pneumboots, consider heparin SC in AM

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of lymphoma and immunosuppression due to steroid use. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of bilateral lower extremity cellulitis and chronic right foot ulcer. The patient has a history of MRSA infection in his right foot. He was found to have sepsis, likely originating from his chronic right foot ulcer, in addition to potential polymicrobial infection involving the scrotum. The patient's condition includes sinusitis, decreased respiratory rate, tachycardia with multiple possible etiologies, pericarditis, bandemia, and a diffuse rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presented with tachycardia, elevated bands, and positive growth on blood culture, indicating a severe infection that could lead to sepsis.
2. Polymicrobial infection: The patient has a chronic right foot ulcer with a history of MRSA infection, which increases the risk of a polymicrobial infection.
3. Sinusitis: The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with sinusitis, which may contribute to his overall infection and systemic inflammatory response.
4. Pericarditis: The patient is showing signs of pericarditis, an inflammation of the pericardium surrounding the heart, which can cause chest pain and other cardiac symptoms.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may be due to various factors including pain"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo M, recently diagnosed with lymphoma, immunosupressed on Decadron
   x 3 weeks, p/w b/l LE cellulitis and CP several days with nonhealing
   ulcer on R foot x 7 years.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented to ED with tachycardia, elevated bands, and +GS
   on blood culture c/w sepsis; no evidence of organ hypoperfusion. Source
   of infection most likely related to patient
s chronic RLE ulcer with
   resulting cellulitis/polymyositis in setting of immunosupression on
   Decadron for past 3 weeks and given h/o MRSA infection in R foot. Also
   considering sinusitis and fungal infection (considering
   immunosuppression and skin impairment). With involvement of scrotum,
   could be polymycrobial origin, though no e/o crepitus as this point to
   suspect Fournier's. UA neg. CVP about >10. MAP >65. Yet pt continues to
   be tachycardic. Afebrile.
   - Continue Vancomycin (slowly given RM syndrome), Unasyn and
   Clindamycin for potential polymicrobial infection
   - Continue IVF with NS (avoid LR given ceftriaxone) at 250cc/hr for 1L
   - Appreciate surgery, ID, and plastics c/s and will f/u recs
   - Wound care consult for R foot, podiatry c/s
   - Maintain adequate IV access for potential resuscitation, currently
   with 2 PIV x 18 and x20g; CVL in R SCL
   - Follow-up all cultures, CXR
   - Check lactate
   - Stress dose steroids if septic shock
   - Warm pack to right arm
   # Chest pain: Likely [**2-23**] pericarditis vs myositis.  With regards to
   pericarditis, etiology most likely infectious related but also consider
   neoplastic (metastatic lymphoma) or cardiovascular (CHF, MI). Does have
   elevated BNP which could be [**2-23**] myositic process.   Will also rule-out
   ACS, though EKG most consistent with diffuse process such as
   pericarditis. Bedside ECHO: normal LV fxn, LVEF>55%), mild MR, mod
   posterior pericardial effusion, no signs of tamponade).
   - ROMI
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Formal ECHO today?
   - Cardiology recs
   - Ibuprofen scheduled for pericarditis (could also use indomethacine or
   colcicine)
   - Will continue on Decadron PRN
   - Pain management with Darvocet, Morphine PRN, percocet
   # Tachycardia: Likely [**2-23**] multiple etiologies including systemic
   inflammatory response/sepsis, pain, anxiety, and pericarditis.  No
   evidence of tamponade on bedside Echo in ED.  No e/o ACS at this
   point.  Tox screen neg.  Not on beta blocker so unlikely to be having
   rebound.  Does have h/o hypothyroidism, will check TSH.
   - IVF, on 4L, will slow to 250cc
   - Ibuprofen for pericarditis
   - Darvocet for pain, Morphine PRN
   - f/u TSH
   #Sinusitis:
   -[**Doctor First Name **]
   # Bandemia: Likely from cellulitis vs polymyositis as above.  Other
   possible sources including urine, pleural effusion or pericardial
   effusion.
   - Follow-up urine/blood cultures &  Antibiotics as above
   # Decreased RR: Likely [**2-23**] over medication with dilaudid and Darvocet,
   though patient confirms these are both his home doses. Adequate RR O/N.
   - Discontinue further dilaudid use
   - Darvocet PRN with holding parameters
   - Narcan PRN

   - Discuss with [**Doctor Last Name 1226**], obtain records
   - Will slightly wean steroids to 4mg TID given concern for diffuse
   infection
   - Hold stress dose steroids unless develops septic physiology
   # Neurogenic Bladder: Continue oxybutyin.  Foley catheter in place.
   # Diffuse rash: Back, anterior chest wall, forehead.  Most c/w
   folliculitis.  Likely [**2-23**] bacterial overgrowth since the decadron
   although could be fungal related.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of lymphoma, who presented to the emergency department with tachycardia, elevated bands, and positive gold standards on blood culture consistent with sepsis. The source of infection is likely related to the patient's chronic right lower extremity ulcer with resulting cellulitis and polymyositis, especially considering his immunosuppressed state due to Decadron use for the past three weeks and a history of MRSA infection in the right foot. The patient also has involvement of the scrotum, which could be polymicrobial in origin, although no evidence of crepitus suggests Fournier's gangrene. The patient is afebrile.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: Continue Vancomycin (slowly given due to Reynolds' Migratory Syndrome), Unasyn, and Clindamycin for potential polymicrobial infection.
2. IV fluids with normal saline at 250cc/hr for 1L.
3. Maintain adequate IV access for potential resuscitation, currently with 2 PIV x 18 and x20g; CVL in right subclavian vein.
4. Follow-up all cultures, chest X-ray, and check lactate.
5. Stress dose steroids if septic shock.
6. Warm pack to right arm.

2. Chest pain: Likely pericarditis vs myositis. Etiology most likely"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo M, immunosupressed on Decadron x 3 weeks, p/w b/l LE cellulitis
   and CP several days with nonhealing ulcer on R foot x 7 years.
   # Cellulitis: Very concerning given extent and seemingly rapid
   progression over last 24 hours.  Does have h/o MRSA infection in R
   foot.  No h/o cellulitis.  Also concerning given immunosupression on
   Decadron x 3 weeks.  With involvement of scrotum, could be
   polymycrobial origin, though no e/o crepitus as this point to suspect
   Fournier's.  Does not have significant pain distally, but given
   neuropathy, may be poor indicator of disease severity.
   - Continue Vancomycin (slowly given RM syndrome), Unasyn and
   Clindamycin for potential polymicrobial infection
   - Continue IVF with NS (avoid LR given ceftriaxone)
   - Surgery consult given extent of cellulitis, ?polymyositis
   - Wound care consult for R foot
   - Maintain adequate IV access for potential resuscitation, currently
   with 2 PIV x 18g
   - Follow-up all cultures
   - ID consult in AM
   - Plastics consult for R foot
   # Chest pain: Likely [**2-23**] pericarditis vs myositis.  Does have elevated
   BNP which could be [**2-23**] myositic process.   Will also rule-out ACS,
   though EKG most consistent with diffuse process such as pericarditis.
   - ROMI
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Echo in AM
   - Cardiology recs
   - Ibuprofen scheduled for pericarditis (could also use indomethacine or
   colcicine)
   - Will continue on Decadron PRN
   - Pain management with Darvocet
   # Tachycardia: Likely [**2-23**] multiple etiologies including systemic
   inflammatory response, infection with signficant bandemia
   (?bacteremia), pain and pericarditis.  No evidence of tamponade on
   bedside Echo in ED.  No e/o ACS at this point.  Does have drug abuse
   h/o but none presently, will send tox screen anyway.  Not on beta
   blocker so unlikely to be having rebound.  Does have h/o
   hypothyroidism, will check TSH.
   - IVF, on 4L, will slow to 250cc
   - Obtain CVP s/p CVL placement
   - Ibuprofen for pericarditis
   - Darvocet for pain
   - Tox screen
   - TSH
   # Bandemia: Likely from cellulitis vs polymyositis as above.  Other
   possible sources including urine, pleural effusion or pericardial
   effusion.
   - Follow-up urine/blood cultures &  Antibiotics as above
   # Decreased RR: Likely [**2-23**] over medication with dilaudid and Darvocet,
   though patient confirms these are both his home doses.
   - Discontinue further dilaudid use
   - Darvocet PRN with holding parameters
   - Narcan PRN
   # R foot ulcer: Appears clean at base with clear fluid.  VNA services
   at home.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Plastics / wound consult
   - daily dressing changes & wound culture
   # L-spine lymphoma: States to have been dx about 6 weeks prior.
   Unclear how dx, states followed by [**Doctor Last Name 1226**] (Neurology) at [**Hospital1 **].  On
   decadron x 6 weeks for ?stenosis or cord compression?.
   - Discuss with [**Doctor Last Name 1226**], obtain records
   - Will slightly wean steroids to 4mg TID given concern for diffuse
   infection
   - Hold stress dose steroids unless develops septic physiology
   # Neurogenic Bladder: Continue oxybutyin.  Foley catheter in place.
   # Diffuse rash: Back, anterior chest wall, forehead.  Most c/w
   folliculitis.  Likely [**2-23**] bacterial overgrowth since the decadron.
   - Monitor
   PPx: bowel regimen PRN, hold pneumboots, consider heparin SC in AM
   FEN: IVF x 4L, replete PRN, clears
   Access: PIV x 2. will place CVL

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented with bilateral lower extremity cellulitis and chronic pressure ulcer on the right foot. He has a history of immunosuppression due to steroid use and previous MRSA infection. The patient is currently in the ICU with several ongoing medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cellulitis: The patient's extensive cellulitis with involvement of the scrotum raises concern for a polymicrobial infection. There is no history of cellulitis, and the patient's immunosuppressed state increases the risk of rapid progression. The lack of significant pain may indicate poor indicators of disease severity.
2. Polymyositis: Given the extent of the cellulitis, there is a possibility of polymyositis, which is a severe inflammatory muscle disease. A consult for surgery has been requested.
3. Chest pain: The patient presents with chest pain, which could be attributed to pericarditis or myositis. Elevated BNP levels may suggest a myositic process. It is important to rule out acute coronary syndrome (ACS) as well.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia could be due to multiple etiologies including systemic inflammatory response, infection with significant bandemia, pain, and pericarditis. No evidence of tamponade on bedside Echo in ED.
5. Bandemia: The patient has bandemia, likely from cellulitis or polym"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of lymphoma, who is immunosuppressed on Decadron for the past three weeks. He presented to the emergency department with tachycardia, elevated bands, and positive gold standard (GS) on blood culture consistent with sepsis. There is no evidence of organ hypoperfusion. The source of infection is likely related to the patient's chronic right lower extremity (RLE) ulcer with resulting cellulitis and polymyositis in the setting of immunosuppression on Decadron. Other possible sources of infection include sinusitis and fungal infection, considering the patient's immunosuppression and skin impairment. The patient also has involvement of the scrotum, which could be polymicrobial in origin, though no evidence of crepitus suggests Fournier's gangrene. Urine analysis is negative.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of tachycardia, elevated bands, and positive GS on blood culture indicate sepsis. The source of infection is most likely related to the chronic RLE ulcer with cellulitis and polymyositis in the setting of immunosuppression on Decadron for the past three weeks. Other possible sources include sinusitis and fungal infection due to immunosuppression and skin impairment. With involvement of the scrotum, it could be polymicrobial in origin, though no evidence of cre"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of lymphoma, who presented to the emergency department with tachycardia, elevated bands, and positive gold standard on blood culture consistent with sepsis. He has a history of chronic right lower extremity cellulitis and a non-healing ulcer on his right foot for the past 7 years. The patient has been immunosuppressed on Decadron for the past 3 weeks. The source of infection is likely related to his chronic right lower extremity ulcer, which has resulted in cellulitis and polymyositis in the setting of immunosuppression. There is also a possibility of sinusitis and fungal infection due to his immunosuppressed state and skin impairment. The patient's involvement of the scrotum raises the possibility of a polymicrobial origin, although there is no evidence of crepitus at this time to suspect Fournier's gangrene. The patient's urine toxicology screen is negative, and his serum toxicology is pending.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient will continue to receive Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Clindamycin. IV fluids will be given at a rate of 250cc/hr for 1L. The patient will be followed up with cultures, chest X-ray, and check lactate levels. Stress dose steroids may be given if septic shock develops.
2. Chest pain:"

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- related to narcotics use. Improved.  Monitor
   RR, SaO2.
   SEPSIS -- bacteremia; concerns include cellulitis (?[**Last Name (un) 2853**]), left
   foot ulcer infection (osteomyelitis), and myo- or pericarditis.
   BACTEREMIA -- likley skin source.  Empirical antimicrobials pending
   identification.  Multiple eschars on fingers and hands suggest embolic
   events (ex. endocarditis) as a possibility.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- concern for pericarditis or myocarditis.
   Concern for increased pericardial effusion.  Await final interpretation
   of cardiac echo to assess for tamponade.
   TACHYCARDIA -- likely due to pericaidial effution/tamponade, and
   component of hypovolemia, sepsis.  Consider component of thyroid
   replacement therapy.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS -- continue resussitation.  Monitor CVP (athough CVP elevation
   may be due to pericardial fluid).
   CHEST PAIN -- intermittent, with diffuse EKG changes (suspect
   pericarditis).  No evidence for acute MI.
   LEGS & SCROTAL ERYTHEMA -- concern for cellulitis --> empirical
   antimicrobials.  Plastic surgery consulted.
   LFT abnormalities -- Alk Phos WNL; monitor serial LFT, low threshold
   for check RUQ US.
   LYMPHOMA, spinal -- continue steroids
   SPINA BIFIDA -- no acute issues.
   RIGHT FOOT ULCER, chronic -- concern as source for sepsis.  Deep
   lesion.  Surgery to F/U.

","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of sepsis. They have multiple lumen placed, CV open at 5, and were somnolent but improved with Narcan. The patient was evaluated by surgery and plastic surgery for cellulitis of the legs and scrotum. ID evaluated, and the last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate 127 bpm, blood pressure 115/67 mmHg, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for noted changes above and below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. It can lead to organ failure if not treated promptly.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient has respiratory distress related to narcotics use, which has improved but needs monitoring of respiratory rate and oxygen saturation.

3. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, likely from a skin source, and empirical antimicrobials are pending identification. This increases the risk of further infections and sepsis.

4. Pericardial Effusion: There is a concern for pericarditis or myocarditis with potential increased"

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- related to narcotics use. Improved.  Monitor
   RR, SaO2.
   SEPSIS -- bacteremia; concerns include cellulitis (?[**Last Name (un) 2853**]), left
   foot ulcer infection (osteomyelitis), and myo- or pericarditis.
   BACTEREMIA -- likley skin source.  Empirical antimicrobials pending
   identification.  Multiple eschars on fingers and hands suggest embolic
   events (ex. endocarditis) as a possibility.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- concern for pericarditis or myocarditis.
   Concern for increased pericardial effusion.  Await final interpretation
   of cardiac echo to assess for tamponade.
   TACHYCARDIA -- likely due to pericaidial effusion/tamponade, and
   component of hypovolemia, sepsis.  Consider component of thyroid
   replacement therapy.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS -- continue resussitation.  Monitor CVP (athough CVP elevation
   may be due to pericardial fluid).
   CHEST PAIN -- intermittent, with diffuse EKG changes (suspect
   pericarditis).  No evidence for acute MI.
   LEGS & SCROTAL ERYTHEMA -- concern for cellulitis --> empirical
   antimicrobials.  Plastic surgery consulted.
   LFT abnormalities -- Alk Phos WNL; monitor serial LFT, low threshold
   for check RUQ US.
   LYMPHOMA, spinal -- continue steroids
   SPINA BIFIDA -- no acute issues.
   RIGHT FOOT ULCER, chronic -- concern as source for sepsis.  Deep
   lesion.  Surgery to F/U.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress related to narcotics use, bacteremia with a likely skin source, pericardial effusion possibly due to pericarditis or myocarditis, tachycardia likely caused by pericardial effusion/tamponade and hypovolemia, fluid resuscitation ongoing, chest pain with diffuse EKG changes suggesting pericarditis, erythema on legs and scrotum indicating cellulitis, and elevated liver function tests that require monitoring and evaluation for possible biliary obstruction. The patient also has a history of lymphoma, spinal issues, spina bifida, and a chronic ulcer on the right foot. The patient's condition is unstable, and they are currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to acute respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Pericardial Effusion/Tamponade: The accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac can compress the heart and impair its function, leading to cardiac tamponade. This can result in decreased cardiac output and potentially fatal outcomes.
4. Cellulitis: The presence of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 82-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation and management of sepsis secondary to a severe foot infection. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8 C (98.3 F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 118/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. He is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and pain management.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation suggests sepsis, likely due to a severe foot infection. The infection has led to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and organ dysfunction.
2. Osteomyelitis: The CT foot reveals a large ulcer with exposed bone, indicating a high likelihood of osteomyelitis.
3. Gas formation: The presence of gas extending along the fifth metatarsal shaft suggests gas formation, which can be associated with clostridium infections.
4. Diabetic foot infection: The patient's history of diabetes and the characteristics of the foot ulcer suggest a diabetic foot infection.
5. Candidal esophagitis: The patient is at risk for candidal esophagitis due to prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and immunosuppression.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo M, recently diagnosed with lymphoma, immunosupressed on Decadron
   x 3 weeks, p/w b/l LE cellulitis and CP several days with nonhealing
   ulcer on R foot x 7 years.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented to ED with tachycardia, elevated bands, and +GS
   on blood culture c/w sepsis; no evidence of organ hypoperfusion. Source
   of infection most likely related to patient
s chronic RLE ulcer with
   resulting cellulitis/polymyositis in setting of immunosupression on
   Decadron for past 3 weeks and given h/o MRSA infection in R foot. Also
   considering sinusitis and fungal infection (considering
   immunosuppression and skin impairment). With involvement of scrotum,
   could be polymycrobial origin, though no e/o crepitus as this point to
   suspect Fournier's. UA neg. CVP about >10. MAP >65. Yet pt continues to
   be tachycardic. Afebrile.
   - Continue Vancomycin (slowly given RM syndrome), Zosyn and Clindamycin
   - Continue IVF with NS (avoid LR given ceftriaxone) at 250cc/hr for 1L
   - Appreciate surgery, ID, and plastics c/s and will f/u recs
   - Wound care consult for R foot, podiatry c/s
   - Maintain adequate IV access for potential resuscitation, currently

   - Follow-up all cultures, CXR
   - Check lactate
   - Stress dose steroids if septic shock
   - Warm pack to right arm
   # Chest pain: Likely [**2-23**] pericarditis vs myositis.  With regards to
   pericarditis, etiology most likely infectious related but also consider
   neoplastic (metastatic lymphoma) or cardiovascular (CHF, MI). Does have
   elevated BNP which could be [**2-23**] myositic process.   Will also rule-out
   ACS, though EKG most consistent with diffuse process such as
   pericarditis. Bedside ECHO: normal LV fxn, LVEF>55%), mild MR, mod
   posterior pericardial effusion, no signs of tamponade).
   - ROMI by cardiac enzymes
   - Monitor on telemetry

   - Ibuprofen scheduled for pericarditis (could also use indomethacine or
   colcicine)
   - Pain management with [**Month/Day (2) **], Morphine PRN, percocet
   # Tachycardia: Likely [**2-23**] multiple etiologies including systemic
   inflammatory response/sepsis, pain, anxiety, and pericarditis.  No
   evidence of tamponade on bedside Echo in ED.  No e/o ACS at this
   point.  Tox screen neg.  Not on beta blocker so unlikely to be having
   rebound.  Does have h/o hypothyroidism, will check TSH.

   possible sources including urine, pleural effusion or pericardial
   effusion.
   - Follow-up urine/blood cultures &  Antibiotics as above
   # Decreased RR: Likely [**2-23**] over medication with dilaudid and [**Month/Day (2) **],
   though patient confirms these are both his home doses. Adequate RR O/N.
   - Discontinue further dilaudid use
   - [**Month/Day (2) **] PRN with holding parameters
   #Transaminitis: Moderate elevation c/w possible infection or decreased
   perfusion related to sepsis or medication induced.
   -Continue to trend LFTs
   #Hypothyroidism: TSH <0.02. Reports taking high dose of levothyroxine
   (175mcg) qday which could exacerbate tachycardia.
   -Clarify home doses of thyroid medication
   -check free T4 and total T3.

   - Will slightly wean steroids to 4mg TID given concern for diffuse
   infection
   - Hold stress dose steroids unless develops septic physiology
   # Neurogenic Bladder: Continue oxybutyin.  Foley catheter in place.
   # Diffuse rash: Back, anterior chest wall, forehead.  Most c/w
   folliculitis.  Likely [**2-23**] bacterial overgrowth since the decadron
   although could be fungal related.
   -          Monitor

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of lymphoma, who is immunosuppressed on Decadron for the past three weeks. He presented to the emergency department with tachycardia, elevated bands, and positive blood culture consistent with sepsis. He has a history of MRSA infection in his right foot, chronic right lower extremity cellulitis, and a non-healing ulcer on his right foot for seven years. He also has a history of sinusitis and fungal infection. The source of infection is likely related to his chronic right lower extremity ulcer with resulting cellulitis and polymyositis in the setting of immunosuppression on Decadron. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and clindamycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presented with tachycardia, elevated bands, and positive blood culture consistent with sepsis. He is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but ongoing monitoring and management are required.
2. Chronic right lower extremity cellulitis: The patient has a history of chronic right lower extremity cellulitis with a non-healing ulcer. This could potentially lead to further complications such as osteomyelitis or Fournier's gangrene if not managed appropriately.
3. Pericarditis: The patient has symptoms suggestive of pericarditis, including"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of spina bifida and peripheral neuropathy, presenting with a chronic right lower extremity ulcer, recent diagnosis of a left lumbar spine lipoma, and immunosuppression due to Decadron use. The patient was admitted for sepsis, which was likely secondary to the chronic right lower extremity ulcer. Other potential complications include osteomyelitis, herpes simplex virus infection, and possible candida esophagitis. The patient has also been diagnosed with tachycardia, bandemia, transaminitis, hypothyroidism, and a neurogenic bladder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a chronic right lower extremity ulcer with exposed bone, indicating a high likelihood of osteomyelitis.
2. Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection: The patient has ulcerations on the hand and upper lip, which are consistent with HSV infection. 
3. Candida esophagitis: The patient presents with odynophagia, which may be indicative of candida esophagitis, especially considering the recent use of immunosuppressive medication.
4. Sepsis: The patient was admitted for sepsis, likely secondary to the chronic right lower extremity ulcer.
5. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia, which may be attributed to multiple factors"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of spina bifida, peripheral neuropathy, chronic right lower extremity ulcer, and recent diagnosis of lipoma on the lumbar spine. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of sepsis, including tachycardia, elevated bands, and positive Group G Streptococcal bacteremia. The source of infection is believed to be related to his chronic right lower extremity ulcer. The patient has multiple medical complications, including osteomyelitis of the foot, herpes simplex virus infection, possible candida esophagitis, knee pain with possible septic arthritis, chest pain likely due to pericarditis, and tachycardia with multiple potential causes.

The patient is currently receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and clindamycin. He is also being treated for herpes simplex virus infection with acyclovir. Additional treatments and consultations are planned for his various conditions, including wound care for the chronic right lower extremity ulcer, follow-up cultures, and consideration for a lumbar puncture. The patient's medications include fluconazole, ibuprofen, and pain management with morphine PRN."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo M, recently diagnosed with lymphoma, immunosupressed on Decadron
   x 3 weeks, p/w b/l LE cellulitis and CP several days with nonhealing
   ulcer on R foot x 7 years.
   # Sepsis: Pt presented to ED with tachycardia, elevated bands, and +GS
   on blood culture c/w sepsis; no evidence of organ hypoperfusion. Source
   of infection most likely related to patient
s chronic RLE ulcer with
   resulting cellulitis/polymyositis in setting of immunosupression on
   Decadron for past 3 weeks and given h/o MRSA infection in R foot. Also
   considering sinusitis and fungal infection (considering
   immunosuppression and skin impairment). With involvement of scrotum,
   could be polymycrobial origin, though no e/o crepitus as this point to
   suspect Fournier's. UA neg. CVP about >10. MAP >65. Yet pt continues to
   be tachycardic. Afebrile.
   - Continue Vancomycin (slowly given RM syndrome), Zosyn and Clindamycin
   - Continue IVF with NS (avoid LR given ceftriaxone) at 250cc/hr for 1L
   - Appreciate surgery, ID, and plastics c/s and will f/u recs
   - Wound care consult for R foot, podiatry c/s
   - Maintain adequate IV access for potential resuscitation, currently
   with 2 PIV x 18 and x20g; CVL in R SCL
   - Follow-up all cultures, CXR
   - Check lactate
   - Stress dose steroids if septic shock
   - Warm pack to right arm
   # Chest pain: Likely [**2-23**] pericarditis vs myositis.  With regards to
   pericarditis, etiology most likely infectious related but also consider
   neoplastic (metastatic lymphoma) or cardiovascular (CHF, MI). Does have
   elevated BNP which could be [**2-23**] myositic process.   Will also rule-out
   ACS, though EKG most consistent with diffuse process such as
   pericarditis. Bedside ECHO: normal LV fxn, LVEF>55%), mild MR, mod
   posterior pericardial effusion, no signs of tamponade).
   - ROMI by cardiac enzymes
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Formal ECHO today
   - Cardiology recs
   - Ibuprofen scheduled for pericarditis (could also use indomethacine or
   colcicine)
   - Pain management with [**Month/Day (2) **], Morphine PRN, percocet
   # Tachycardia: Likely [**2-23**] multiple etiologies including systemic
   inflammatory response/sepsis, pain, anxiety, and pericarditis.  No
   evidence of tamponade on bedside Echo in ED.  No e/o ACS at this
   point.  Tox screen neg.  Not on beta blocker so unlikely to be having
   rebound.  Does have h/o hypothyroidism, will check TSH.
   - IVF, on 4L, will slow to 250cc
   - Ibuprofen for pericarditis
   - [**Month/Day (2) **] for pain, Morphine PRN
   - f/u TSH
   # Bandemia: Likely from cellulitis vs polymyositis as above.  Other
   possible sources including urine, pleural effusion or pericardial
   effusion.
   - Follow-up urine/blood cultures &  Antibiotics as above
   # Decreased RR: Likely [**2-23**] over medication with dilaudid and [**Month/Day (2) **],
   though patient confirms these are both his home doses. Adequate RR O/N.
   - Discontinue further dilaudid use
   - [**Month/Day (2) **] PRN with holding parameters
   #Transaminitis: Moderate elevation c/w possible infection or decreased
   perfusion related to sepsis or medication induced.
   -Continue to trend LFTs
   #Hypothyroidism: TSH <0.02. Reports taking high dose of levothyroxine
   (175mcg) qday which could exacerbate tachycardia.
   -Clarify home doses of thyroid medication
   -check free T4 and total T3.
   # R foot ulcer: Chronic issue over past 7yrs. Well known to
   plastics/surgery. Appears clean at base with clear fluid.  VNA services
   at home.
   - Appreciate Plastics inputs
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Will obtain CT of foot to assess for OM.
   - Podiatry c/s
   - daily wet to dry dressing changes
   - f/u wound culture/biopsy
   # L-spine lymphoma: States to have been dx about 6 weeks prior.
   Followed by [**Doctor Last Name 1226**] (Neurology) at [**Hospital1 **].  On decadron x 6 weeks for
   ?stenosis or cord compression?.
   - Discuss with [**Doctor Last Name 1226**], obtain records
   - Will slightly wean steroids to 4mg TID given concern for diffuse
   infection
   - Hold stress dose steroids unless develops septic physiology
   # Neurogenic Bladder: Continue oxybutyin.  Foley catheter in place.
   # Diffuse rash: Back, anterior chest wall, forehead.  Most c/w
   folliculitis.  Likely [**2-23**] bacterial overgrowth since the decadron
   although could be fungal related.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of lymphoma, who is immunosuppressed due to steroid treatment. He presented to the emergency department with tachycardia, elevated bands on blood culture, and positive GBS on blood culture, consistent with sepsis. The source of infection is likely related to his chronic right lower extremity ulcer with resulting cellulitis and polymyositis, in the setting of immunosuppression from steroids. Other possible sources include sinusitis and fungal infection. He also has involvement of the scrotum, which could be polymicrobial in origin. The patient's condition has not improved despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, and there is concern for MRSA infection in his right foot. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with tachycardia, elevated bands on blood culture, and positive GBS suggests sepsis. Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, his condition has not improved, indicating a potential complication.
2. Chronic right lower extremity ulcer with cellulitis and polymyositis: The patient's chronic right foot ulcer has led to cellulitis and polymyositis, which may require surgical intervention.
3. Possible MRSA infection: There is concern for MRSA infection in the patient's right foot, which could complicate the treatment and management of his condition.
4. Sinusitis: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with sepsis. They have cellulitis and osteomyelitis of the right foot, along with a truck rash attributed to steroids, and oral and right hand rash attributed to HSV type 1. There is evidence of subcutaneous air in the right foot, indicating a possible surgical or podiatric intervention. The patient also has lip and hand lesions/ulcers, which are attributed to a herpetic eruption and may extend to the esophagus. Acyclovir has been prescribed. The patient is hypovolemic, and efforts are being made to replete fluids and monitor vital signs. There has been an improvement in renal function, and fluid balance is being closely monitored. Dysphagia/odynophagia is present, possibly due to HSV or [Female First Name (un)] infection, and an EGD will be performed to confirm. Pain control has been improved, and there is a history of substance abuse. The patient has serositis, including pericardial effusion and joint effusions, which may be related to an infectious etiology. A repeat echo is planned to assess the pericardial effusion in greater detail. Tachycardia is present and may be related to volume, thyroid replacement therapy, or pericardial effusion. There are concerns about the current dose of thyroid replacement therapy being excessive and contributing to tachycardia. The patient is on ICU"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is sepsis. The patient has a history of cellulitis in the thighs and scrotum, flanks, and osteomyelitis of the right foot. There are also rashes on the lips and hand attributed to a Herpetic eruption, as well as possible extension to the esophagus. The patient is hypovolemic and has renal dysfunction. There is a concern for hypothyroidism and the current dose may be excessive. The patient has pericardial effusion and joint effusions in the knees. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient already has sepsis due to cellulitis and osteomyelitis. This condition can worsen if not properly managed.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient has shown improvement in respiratory distress, but it is still being monitored. If left untreated, it can lead to respiratory failure.

3. Possible HSV infection: The patient has lip and hand lesions/ulcers attributed to a Herpetic eruption, with a possible extension to the esophagus. If not treated, this can progress and cause further complications.

4. Hypovolemia: The patient is hypovolemic and requires fluid repletion. If fluids are not administered adequately, it can lead to shock and organ failure.

5. Renal dysfunction: The patient has renal dysfunction, and if not managed properly,"
