","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, hypotension, respiratory failure, and complete heart block. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension and low blood pressure, particularly during cleaning and when transitioning from one mode of ventilation to another. His MAPs dropped significantly during these episodes, but improved after resuming dopamine infusion. He also had a large watery bowel movement during one of the hypotensive episodes. The patient's Cr level has risen from baseline, indicating possible acute kidney injury. His respiratory status has been stable with current ventilator settings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's episodes of hypotension indicate a potential risk for inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and prompt intervention with pressor agents such as dopamine are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The rise in creatinine levels suggests potential acute kidney injury, which can be attributed to factors like hypotension, sepsis, or medications. Regular monitoring of renal function and adjustment of fluid and medication regimens will be crucial in managing this complication.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Adequate lung secretion clearance, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and minimizing ventilator days will help reduce the risk of"

   physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently in slow atrial
   flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously declined pacer placement.
   Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his
   underlying conduction disease. Pt was found to be hyperkalemic on
   presentation (8 hemolyzed) 6.0 on repeat here. Required urgent
   transvenous pacer and intubation for bradycardia and hypotension
   - Transvenous pacer in place - will confirm placement with CXR,
   currently pacing at 60 bpm
   - Plan for permanent pacemaker today per EP
   - Monitor K - recheck and given additional kayexelate if needed. K 6.0
   in ED, received 30g kayexelate.
   - Continue supportive management with intubation, BP support
   .
   #. Severe Biventricular Heart Failure - per report EF 15-20% with

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a medical history of biventricular congestive heart failure (CHF) and an ejection fraction of 15%, who presented with complete heart block. The patient had previously declined pacemaker placement. He was found to be hyperkalemic on presentation (K 6.0) and required urgent transvenous pacing and intubation for bradycardia and hypotension. A transvenous pacer has been placed, currently pacing at 60 bpm. The plan is to proceed with permanent pacemaker placement today, per electrophysiologist consultation. The patient's serum potassium level should be monitored, and additional Kayexelate may be given if needed. Supportive management with intubation, blood pressure support, and IV diuretics will continue.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Complete Heart Block - The patient's underlying conduction disease has likely progressed, leading to complete heart block. This can result in bradycardia and hypotension, which the patient is currently experiencing.
2. Severe Biventricular Heart Failure - The patient's CHF with an ejection fraction of 15% indicates severe biventricular heart failure. This condition can lead to volume overload, as evidenced by pleural effusions, lower extremity edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure.
3. Hyperkalemia - The patient presented with hyperkalemia (K 6.0), which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated. Worsening renal function and hypotension may contribute to this electrolyte imbalance.
4. Pleural Effusion - The patient has evidence of pleural effusion, which may be secondary to pulmonary edema related to severe CHF. This can compromise respiratory function if not managed appropriately.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) - The patient has a history of CKD with creatinine levels ranging from 2.5-3. Renal function should be closely monitored, and medications should be adjusted accordingly.
6. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) - The patient underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) previously. Aspirin and statin therapy should continue to manage CAD.
7. Hypertension - The patient's blood pressure needs to be carefully managed, especially considering the current hypotension/bradycardia episode. Holding coreg, a medication for hypertension, may be appropriate for now.
8. Hyperlipidemia - Statin therapy should be continued to manage hyperlipidemia.
9. Feeding Intolerance - The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) pending possible pacemaker placement. Nutritional support may need to be considered once the patient is stable.
10. Central Venous Access - The patient currently has left subclavian and left arm lines for central venous access.

Please note that the patient's condition requires"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 86y/o M with a PMH of biventricular CHF with EF 15%, s/p
   CABG [**2167**] presenting with complete heart block.
   .
   #. Complete Heart Block -  The patient has a history of brady/tachy
   physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently in slow atrial
   flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously declined pacer placement.
   Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his
   underlying conduction disease. Pt was found to be hyperkalemic on
   presentation (8 hemolyzed) 6.0 on repeat here. Required urgent
   transvenous pacer and intubation for bradycardia and hypotension
   - Transvenous pacer in place - will confirm placement with CXR,
   currently pacing at 60 bpm
   - Plan for permanent pacemaker today per EP
   - Monitor K - recheck and given additional kayexelate if needed. K 6.0
   in ED, received 30g kayexelate.
   - Continue supportive management with intubation, BP support
   .
   #. Severe Biventricular Heart Failure - per report EF 15-20% with
   moderate MR and AS. Per outpatient cardiologist reports the patient has
   had progressive volume overload with ascities, pleural effusion and
   distended neck veins despite increase in lasix
   - repeat [**Name (NI) **]
   - Pt with evidence of volume overload on exam with pleural effusions,
   LE edema and elevated JVP
   - Will stabalize hemodynamic with pacer and then restart diuresis (60mg
   lasix + metolazone QOD outpatient regimen) given volume overload will
   need IV diuresis
   - Holding coreg, for now given bradycardia, restart post pacemaker
   placement
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - K 6.0 on arrival, likely in setting of worsening
   renal failure and hypotension, kayexelate 30gm given in ED
   - will repeat now and give additional kayexelate in needed
   .
   #. Pleural Effusion - no clear evidence of PNA on CXR, likely pulmonary
   edema related to severe CHF, no elevated WBC or fever, recently treated
   for PNA with levaquin/azithro
   - Will diurese when hemodynamically stable
   - Follow CXR for improvement of effusion, evidence of PNA
   .
   #. CAD - s/p CABG (4Vd in [**2167**]) - continue aspirin 81mg daily, continue
   lipitor 10mg daily
   - trend biomarkers
   .
   #. CKD - Cr 3.2 on admission, history of CKD with Cr ranging from 2.5-3
   - continue to trend
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #. HTN - holding coreg given hypotension/bradycardia

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a medical history of biventricular congestive heart failure (CHF) and a low ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, who presented with complete heart block (CHB). The patient was found to be hyperkalemic and required urgent transvenous pacing. He also had severe biventricular heart failure with evidence of volume overload, including pleural effusions and lower extremity edema. The patient was intubated and stabilized hemodynamically with pacing. Diuretics were held due to hypotension, but will be restarted once the patient is stable. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a creatinine level of 3.2, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and is currently on renal replacement therapy (RRT) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD)."

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of severe biventricular heart failure, complete heart block, and coronary artery disease (s/p CABG). He presented with complete heart block and was found to have an EF of 15%. A permanent pacer was placed yesterday. The patient continues to require low-dose dopamine for BP support. He is currently intubated and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe Biventricular Heart Failure: The patient has a history of severe biventricular heart failure with an EF of 15-20%. This condition can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusions.
2. Complete Heart Block: The patient's complete heart block may progress further, leading to a dependence on the permanent pacer for maintaining adequate cardiac output.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which increases the risk of recurrent angina or myocardial infarction.
4. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient's Cr level is elevated at 3.2, indicating CKD. This can contribute to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
5. Pleural Effusion: The patient has evidence of pleural effusion likely related to severe CHF. If not managed properly, it can lead to respiratory compromise.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient previously had hyperkalemia, which needs to be monitored"

   physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently in slow atrial
   flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously declined pacer placement.
   Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his
   underlying conduction disease.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of biventricular congestive heart failure (CHF) and an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, who presented with complete heart block (CHB). He has been intubated and sedated. The patient previously declined pacemaker placement but now requires a permanent pacemaker due to the progression of his underlying conduction disease.

The patient continues to require low-dose dopamine for blood pressure support. He also has severe biventricular heart failure with moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) and aortic stenosis (AS). The patient has had progressive volume overload with ascites, pleural effusion, and distended neck veins despite increased lasix.

The patient's recent medical history includes treatment for pneumonia (PNA) with levaquin/azithromycin. His current laboratory values show elevated serum potassium levels but have resolved since admission. He also has chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a creatinine level of 3.2 on admission.

The patient is currently on aspirin and lipitor for his coronary artery disease (CAD), which was previously treated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). His other medical issues include hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and fluid/electrolyte imbalance.

The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles in the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, and 2"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 86y/o M with a PMH of biventricular CHF with EF 15%, s/p
   CABG [**2167**] presenting with complete heart block.
   .
   #. Complete Heart Block -  The patient has a history of brady/tachy
   physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently in slow atrial
   flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously declined pacer placement.
   Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his
   underlying conduction disease.  Patient is s/p permanent pacemaker now
   off all pressor support.  PPM set at a rate of 60 currently.
   - Day [**12-27**] clindamycin
   .
   # Respiratory failure now resolved
 patient was intubated in the
   setting of complete heart block episode.  Major initial barrio to
   extubation was patient
s mental status.  ? PNA given increased sputum
   production.
   - Sputum culture today.
   - f/u PA/Lat CXR
   .
   #. Acute on chronic Severe Biventricular Systolic Heart Failure - per
   report EF 15-20% with moderate MR and AS. Per outpatient cardiologist
   reports the patient has had progressive volume overload with ascities,
   pleural effusion and distended neck veins despite increase in lasix.
   Echo repeated on admission demonstrates asymmetric septal hypertrophy
   with mild resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Severe
   regional systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and
   inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of the septum. Marked right
   ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Patient still with evidence of volume overload on exam with pleural
   effusions, elevated JVP.
   - now that extubated will try for gentle diuresis with goal -500 cc per
   day however will be careful given severe dysfunction of right ventricle
   making patient very preload dependent.  Given 20mg IV lasix this AM.
   Follow Is/Os.
   - Will need to restart diuresis (60mg lasix + metolazone QOD outpatient
   regimen) on discharge
   .
   #. Pleural Effusion - no clear evidence of PNA on CXR, likely pulmonary
   edema related to severe CHF, no elevated WBC or fever, recently treated
   for PNA with levaquin/azithromycin.  As patient now extubated will
   check PA/Lateral to assess.
   -          f/u chest x-ray
   -          gentle diuesis as above
   .
   #. CAD - s/p CABG (4Vd in [**2167**]) - continue aspirin 81mg daily, continue
   lipitor 10mg daily. Troponins on admission mildly elevated but flat in
   the setting of renal failure.
   .
   #. CKD - Cr 3.2 on admission, history of CKD with Cr ranging from
   2.5-3. Cr improved today to 2.7.
   - continue to trend
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Dementia- patient with underlying dementia as per his son.
   -          avoid benzodiazepines
   -          avoid anti-cholinergic medications
   -          Did well with Haldol 0.5mg yesterday.  Continue PRN.
   .
   # Hematuria: Pt with pain at site.  Foley irrigates ok.
   - Monitor foley output.  Bladder scan.
   .
   #. HTN
 patient now with hypertension to 140s after being extubated
   - restart coreg today at half outpatient dose.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia - continue statin
   .
   #. FEN
 speech and swallow consult in place, would advance diet as per
   recommendations
   - NG tube if fails speech and swallow.
   .
   #. Access: L art line
 d/c, PIV X3
   .
   #. PPx:  Heparin SC, PPI, bowel regimen

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of biventricular congestive heart failure, ejection fraction of 15%, and previous CABG surgery. He presented with complete heart block and was placed on a permanent pacemaker. The patient also has severe biventricular systolic heart failure with marked right ventricular dilation and dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and evidence of volume overload. He was intubated due to complete heart block but is now extubated. The patient has mild resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient, asymmetric septal hypertrophy, severe regional systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls, hypokinesis of the septum, and pleural effusions. The patient's current medications include aspirin, lipitor, lasix, metolazone, heparin sodium, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Complete Heart Block - The patient has a history of brady/tachy physiology and was recently in slow atrial flutter at a 3:1 AV block. Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his underlying conduction disease. The patient is s/p permanent pacemaker now off all pressor support. PPM set at a rate of 60 currently.
2. Respiratory Failure - The patient was intubated in the setting of complete heart block episode. Major initial barrier to extubation was patient's mental status. Increased sputum"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a CCU resident with a chief complaint of complete heart block, now post pacemaker placement. The patient's 24-hour events include an echo that showed asymmetric septal hypertrophy with mild resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Severe regional systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of the septum. Marked right ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

The patient was off sedation but not responding to commands, indicating that they may not be okay to extubate today. However, later in the note, it is mentioned that the patient was successfully extubated. The patient's urine culture showed no growth, and a sputum culture was placed due to yellow sputum mixed with blood. The patient has allergies to penicillins, an unknown rash, and Vasotec (enalapril maleate), which caused angioedema.

The patient received antibiotics including Vancomycin and Clindamycin. They are currently on several infusions including heparin sodium (prophylaxis) and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F) with a maximum temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), a current heart rate of 60 bpm within normal limits, a blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 86y/o M with a PMH of biventricular CHF with EF 15%, s/p
   CABG [**2167**] presenting with complete heart block.
   .
   #. Complete Heart Block -  The patient has a history of brady/tachy
   physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently in slow atrial
   flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously declined pacer placement.
   Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his
   underlying conduction disease.  Patient is s/p permanent pacemaker now
   off all pressor support.
   .
   # Respiratory failure now resolved
 patient was intubated in the
   setting of complete heart block episode.  Major initial barrio to
   extubation was patient
s mental status.
   .
   #. Acute on chronic Severe Biventricular Systolic Heart Failure - per
   report EF 15-20% with moderate MR and AS. Per outpatient cardiologist
   reports the patient has had progressive volume overload with ascities,
   pleural effusion and distended neck veins despite increase in lasix.
   Echo repeated on admission demonstrates asymmetric septal hypertrophy
   with mild resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Severe
   regional systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and
   inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of the septum. Marked right
   ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Patient still with evidence of volume overload on exam with pleural
   effusions, elevated JVP.
   - now that extubated will try for gentle diuresis with goal -500 cc per
   day however will be careful given severe dysfunction of right ventricle
   making patient very preload dependent
   - Will need to restart diuresis (60mg lasix + metolazone QOD outpatient
   regimen) on discharge
   - restart coreg today
   .
   #. Pleural Effusion - no clear evidence of PNA on CXR, likely pulmonary
   edema related to severe CHF, no elevated WBC or fever, recently treated
   for PNA with levaquin/azithromycin.  As patient now extubated will
   check PA/Lateral to assess.
   -          f/u chest x-ray
   -          gentle diuesis as above
   .
   #. CAD - s/p CABG (4Vd in [**2167**]) - continue aspirin 81mg daily, continue
   lipitor 10mg daily. Troponins on admission mildly elevated but flat in
   the setting of renal failure.
   .
   #. CKD - Cr 3.2 on admission, history of CKD with Cr ranging from
   2.5-3. Cr improved today to 2.7.
   - continue to trend
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Dementia- patient with underlying dementia as per his son.
   -          avoid benzodiazepines
   -          avoid anti-cholinergic medications
   .
   #. HTN
 patient now with hypertension to 140s after being extubated
   - restart coreg today
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia - continue statin
   .
   #. FEN
 speech and swallow consult in place, would advance diet as per

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a medical history of biventricular congestive heart failure (CHF) and an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, who presented with complete heart block. He has previously declined pacemaker placement but now requires a permanent pacemaker due to the progression of his underlying conduction disease.

The patient was intubated in the setting of complete heart block and respiratory failure. The initial barrier to extubation was the patient's mental status. The patient's severe biventricular systolic heart failure is chronic, with an EF of 15-20% and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) and aortic stenosis (AS). He has had progressive volume overload with ascites, pleural effusion, and distended neck veins despite increased lasix.

The patient's recent echocardiogram showed asymmetric septal hypertrophy with mild resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Severe regional systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of the septum was observed. There was also marked right ventricular dilation and dysfunction, as well as moderate pulmonary hypertension.

The patient still exhibits evidence of volume overload on examination, including pleural effusions and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). The plan is to try for gentle diuresis with a goal of -500 cc per day, being cautious due to severe right"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 86y/o M with a PMH of biventricular CHF with EF 15%, s/p
   CABG [**2167**] presenting with complete heart block. He is not s/p PMP doing
   well from a cardiac standpoint with ongoing delirium s/p intubation.
   .
   #. Complete Heart Block -  The patient has a history of brady/tachy
   physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently in slow atrial
   flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously declined pacer placement.
   Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his
   underlying conduction disease.  Patient is s/p permanent pacemaker now
   off all pressor support.  PPM set at a rate of 60 currently.
   - Day [**1-24**] clindamycin
   .
   # Respiratory failure now resolved
 patient was intubated in the
   setting of complete heart block episode.  Major initial barrio to
   extubation was patient
s mental status.  ? PNA given increased sputum
   production.
   - Resp status stable
   - Pt with ongoing sputum production.
   - Sputum culture today.
   .
   #. Acute on chronic Severe Biventricular Systolic Heart Failure
   - restart home diuretic regimen tomorrow.
   .
   #. Pleural Effusion - no clear evidence of PNA on CXR, likely pulmonary
   edema related to severe CHF, no elevated WBC or fever, recently treated
   for PNA with levaquin/azithromycin.  As patient now extubated will
   check PA/Lateral to assess.
   -          CXR seems stable, not clinically acting infected.
   -          gentle diuesis as above
   .
   #. CAD - s/p CABG (4Vd in [**2167**]) - continue aspirin 81mg daily, continue
   lipitor 10mg daily. Troponins on admission mildly elevated but flat in
   the setting of renal failure.
   .
   #. CKD - Cr 3.2 on admission, history of CKD with Cr ranging from
   2.5-3. Cr improved today to 2.7.
   - continue to trend
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Dementia- patient with underlying dementia as per his son.
   -          avoid benzodiazepines
   -          avoid anti-cholinergic medications
   -          Did well with Haldol 0.5mg yesterday.  Continue PRN.
   .
   # Hematuria: Pt with pain at site.  Foley discontinued.
   - Started tamsulosin 0.4mg PO HS for BPH
   .
   #. HTN
 patient now with hypertension to 140s after being extubated
   - restarted coreg today at half outpatient dose.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia - continue statin

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a medical history of biventricular congestive heart failure, an ejection fraction of 15%, and a recent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure. He presented with complete heart block and was not previously on a permanent pacemaker. The patient has now been placed on a permanent pacemaker and is off all pressor support. His respiratory failure has resolved, but he still has ongoing sputum production. He also has acute-on-chronic severe biventricular systolic heart failure and a pleural effusion, which is likely related to the severe CHF. The patient underwent CABG surgery and continues his medications for CAD. He also has chronic kidney disease with a creatinine level of 3.2, which improved to 2.7 today. The patient has underlying dementia and is experiencing hematuria at the Foley catheter site, so it has been discontinued. His hypertension needs to be managed, and he has hyperlipidemia. The patient requires speech and swallow therapy, and a consult has been placed. He has multiple lines and prophylactic treatments in place. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Complete Heart Block: The patient's history of brady/tachy physiology and progression of conduction disease may lead to further complications if the permanent pacemaker fails or becomes malfunctioning.
2. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's respiratory failure has resolved, ongoing sput"
