   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, pneumonia presumably in context of new CNS process
   (presumed intracranial hemorrhage).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- hypoxemic; likely attributed to pneumonia.  Need
   to assess preparedness for extubation trial --> check RSBI.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- LLL, likely pneumonia, suspect aspiration.
   Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   CNS EVENT -- presumed intracranial hemorrhage (reportedly hemorrhage
   into CNS tumor) --> images not available from OSH.  Monitor
   neurological exam.  Neurosurgical consultation.  Will discuss with
   Neurosurgical service regarding optimal imaging study to pursue
   currently.
   h/o DVT -- repeat imaging to evaluate for recurrent DVT.  Doubt
   pulmonary embolism as acute event for hypoxemia.
   A-FIB -- rate controlled currently.
   FLUIDS -- intravascularly depleted.  Provide iv fluid boluses, monitor
   BP, HR and urine output.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- transfuse to plts > 50 as per Neurosurgery.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure and pneumonia, presumably due to a new CNS process (presumed intracranial hemorrhage). The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's respiratory failure and pneumonia, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or worsening hypoxemia.

2. Neurological Complications: The presumed intracranial hemorrhage poses a significant risk of neurological complications, including increased intracranial pressure, brain herniation, or neurological deficits.

3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and previous CABG surgery puts them at risk for cardiovascular complications like myocardial infarction or heart failure.

4. Thromboembolic Complications: The presence of thrombocytopenia and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) increases the risk of thromboembolic events, such as pulmonary embolism or recurrent DVT.

5. Infection: Prolonged mechanical ventilation and the use of invasive lines and tubes can increase the risk of healthcare-associated infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

6. Metabolic Complications: The patient's electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypercalcemia and hypomagnesemia, need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent metabolic complications like"

1. Pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia, which is likely due to aspiration. It is important to continue empirical antimicrobials to treat the infection and monitor for any worsening of symptoms.

2. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient is suspected to have a hemorrhage into a CNS tumor. This is a serious condition that requires close monitoring of the neurological exam and consultation with a neurosurgeon.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet levels (thrombocytopenia). This may require transfusion of platelets to maintain a safe level for surgical procedures, as advised by the neurosurgery team.

4. Fluid depletion: The patient is intravascularly depleted, indicating a need for fluid resuscitation to correct the fluid imbalance.

5. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (A-FIB) and requires rate control. Monitoring and management of this condition should continue.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, and repeat imaging should be done to evaluate for recurrent DVT.

7. Pulmonary embolism: Although less likely, the patient's hypoxemia could be attributed"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, pneumonia presumably in context of new CNS process
   (presumed intracranial hemorrhage).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- hypoxemic; likely attributed to pneumonia.  Need
   to assess preparedness for extubation trial --> check RSBI.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATE -- LLL, likely pneumonia, suspect aspiration.
   Continue empirical antimicrobials.
   CNS EVENT -- presumed intracranial hemorrhage (reportedly hemorrhage
   into CNS tumor) --> images not available from OSH.  Monitor
   neurological exam.  Neurosurgical consultation.  Will discuss with
   Neurosurgical service regarding optimal imaging study to pursue
   currently.
   h/o DVT -- repeat imaging to evaluate for recurrent DVT.  Doubt
   pulmonary embolism as acute event for hypoxemia.
   A-FIB -- rate controlled currently.
   FLUIDS -- intravascularly depleted.  Provide iv fluid boluses, monitor
   BP, HR and urine output.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- transfuse to plts > 50 as per Neurosurgery.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure and pneumonia. The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should ensure proper ventilation techniques, maintain a high level of hygiene, and regularly assess respiratory status.

2. Pneumonia progression: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to increased respiratory distress. Monitoring of vital signs, oxygen saturation, and chest X-rays will be crucial to track the progression and adjust treatment accordingly.

3. Barotrauma: The use of positive pressure ventilation can cause barotrauma, which is damage to the lung tissue due to excessive pressure. Monitoring lung sounds, oxygenation levels, and chest imaging can help detect any signs of barotrauma.

4. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Overdistension of the lungs during mechanical ventilation can lead to VILI. Adjusting ventilator settings and using lung-protective strategies can minimize this risk.

5. Sepsis: Pneumonia can potentially lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs, inflammatory markers, and prompt management of infection are essential.

6. Neurological deterioration: The patient has a history of CNS involvement (presumed intracranial hemorrhage), which could lead"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor. He was transferred to the ICU due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site. The patient presented with fever and hypoxia upon admission.

The patient's neuro exam has been stable compared to the signout from the other hospital. Neurosurgery input has been requested, and the patient's platelets should be kept above 50. The neuro exam should be monitored every 4 hours.

The patient is experiencing severe hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to derecruitment during transport. The PEEP should be increased and rechecked ABG. Addressing pneumonia has also been discussed, along with the patient's history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). An LE ultrasound should be done, and an IVC filter may be considered if the patient is not a candidate for anticoagulation.

The patient has leukocytosis and fevers, suspecting nosocomial pneumonia. He may also have Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, and his urine looks dirty per nursing. Coverage for nosocomial VAP with vanc/zosyn/cipro has been initiated, starting from [**10-7**]. Vanc PO has been prescribed for possible C. diff, and sputum, blood,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of thrombocytopenia. The patient has a history of allergies to Univasc and Celexa, as well as lightheadedness. The patient has been receiving antibiotics including Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. Vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 44 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/58 to 148/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 23 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. Laboratory results indicate thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 43 K/uL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 25.4 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, and elevated troponin T levels at 0.06 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding or thrombosis.
2. Infection: The presence of elevated white blood cell count and"

   Assessment and Plan
   80yo gentleman with h/o MDS and known brain tumor transferred to [**Hospital1 54**]
   in the setting of recent hemorrhage near tumor site, found to be
   febrile and hypoxic.
   # Brain tumor with hemorrhagic lesion in parietal lobe:
   Neuro exam has been stable as compared to signout from OSH.
   - Contact patient's PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 5976**] ([**Doctor Last Name 540**])
   - Neurosurgery input
   1.       No acute indication for surgery.
   2.       Would like plt >100K prior to OR, consult heme-onc to eval
   possible etiologies of thrombocytopenia worse to suggest ways to
   increase plt count and possible BM biopsy.
   3.       Had head CT (interval resolution of hemorrhagic mass) and MRI
   (result pending).
   4.       Final reads pending transfused plt counts and vent status.
   - transfuse to keep platelets > 50
   - monitor Q4H neuro exam
   # Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   No evidence of mucous plugging.  Suspect he has derecruited during
   transport.  Note that he has been intubated since [**9-25**].
   - Repeat ABG
   - Address pneumonia as discussed below
   - Potential fluid overload with a CXR demonstrating a new left sided
   effusion and fluid in the left fissure.  Yesterday
s FENa was 0.6
   will rpt FENa based upon current urine and serum electrolytes, and
   attempt soft diuresis with 20 mg of IV Lasix.  Will use ultrasound of
   left lung to help determine whether LLL CXR opacity is fluid overload
   vs. atelectasis.
   - note that pt has h/o DVT
   - LE ultrasounds were negative for DVTs.
   # Leukocytosis and Fevers:
   Suspect patient has nosocomial pneumonia.  Also may have C diff
 1 of
   3 cultures is negative.  Of note, his R-sided PICC was placed at OSH.
   - cover nosocomial VAP with vanc/zosyn/cipro (day [**2-6**])
   - cover possible C diff with vanc PO until third stool culture is
   negative.
   - obtain sputum, blood, urine, stool Cx (for C diff)'
   # Metabolic Alkalosis/Volume status:
   - Likely due to diuresis or suctioning.
   - Holding fluids for possible fluid overload.  Will reassess once serum
   and urine electrolytes have been collected.
   - Rpt urine electrolytes to better assess volume status.
   # h/o DVT:
   - pneumoboots
   - no anticoagulation given intracranial bleeding.
   # MDS:
   - transfuse for Hct < 25 or Platelets < 50
   - type and screen
   - consented for blood
   # CAD s/p CABG; HTN; Dyslipidemia:
   - hold ASA given head bleed
   - Statin
   - Holding beta blocker as heart rate is now controlled.
   - Has not tolerated ACE I in past due to hyperkalemia
   # AFib:
   - Rate control with beta blocker
   - No ASA or coumadin
   # Hyperglycemia:
   Was on SSI at OSH but does not carry Dx of diabetes.
   - cover with SSI but discontinue if sugars are low
   # Sacral Wound:
   - Wound care consult
 following recommendations.
   - Nystatin as it appears to have fungal component
   # Gout:
   - Allopurinol
   # ? GERD:  on PPI at home, will continue
   # Episode of brown liquid from PEG concerning for old blood:
   ? [**1-26**] gastritis.
   - PPI
   - type and screen
   - Hcts have been stable.
   # FEN:
   - Held fluids due to ? fluid overload.
   - Nutrition recs: TF HN @ 15mL/hr, check TF tolerance, daily chem10,
   add multivitamins and supplements.
   # PPx:  pneumoboots, PPI
   # Access:  R PICC
   # Code:  Presumed FULL, will address with family when possible.
   # Comm:  with wife [**Name (NI) 5977**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5978**]; [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5979**] (consented for blood
   products over phone)
   # Dispo:  MICU for now

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persisitent.  Multifactorial including
   pneumonia, perhaps CHF (volume overload), new right plerual effusion.
   Continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Hope to work towards
   repeat SBT, and hopefully extubation once volume status and pneumonia
   improved.  Adjust mechanical ventilation, aim for Po2 >60 mmHg, SaO2
   >90%.
   PNEUMONIA -- LLL.  Probable aspiration.  Continue antimicrobials.
   CNS TUMOR -- s/p hemorrhage.  Awaiting Neurosurgical evacuation in near
   future.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF
   LEFT HEMIPLEGIA  --  chronic, stable.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- continues to require plts.  Desire for >100k at
   time of surgery.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.
   MDS -- chronic.  [**Month (only) 60**] require reevaluation.
   CAD -- evidence for mild heart failure.  Perhaps related to diastolic
   dysfunction.  Monitor exam.
   BRADYCARDIA -- probable pharmacological (beta-blockers).  Monitor.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient tolerated intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) mode for more than 6 hours yesterday but experienced an increased respiratory rate. An episode of bradycardia occurred but was asymptomatic and resolved spontaneously.

The patient has a history of respiratory failure, pneumonia, possibly congestive heart failure (CHF), and a new right pleural effusion. The patient is being continued on mechanical ventilation, with monitoring of arterial blood gas (ABG) levels. The goal is to work towards repeating a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and eventually extubation once the patient's volume status and pneumonia improve. Adjustments are being made to mechanical ventilation, aiming for a PaO2 >60 mmHg and SaO2 >90%.

The patient also has a CNS tumor with a recent hemorrhage, awaiting neurosurgical evacuation in the near future. The patient is receiving nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient has left hemiplegia, chronic and stable, as well as thrombocytopenia, requiring platelet transfusion. The desire is for platelet levels to be above 100,000 at the time of surgery. The patient's fluids are being managed to achieve a net negative fluid balance.

Other medical conditions include chronic myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) requiring reevaluation, evidence of mild heart failure possibly related to diast"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persisitent.  Multifactorial including
   pneumonia, perhaps CHF (volume overload), new right plerual effusion.
   Continue mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Hope to work towards
   repeat SBT, and hopefully extubation once volume status and pneumonia
   improved.  Adjust mechanical ventilation, aim for Po2 >60 mmHg, SaO2
   >90%.
   PNEUMONIA -- LLL.  Probable aspiration.  Continue antimicrobials.
   CNS TUMOR -- s/p hemorrhage.  Awaiting Neurosurgical evacuation in near
   future.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF
   LEFT HEMIPLEGIA  --  chronic, stable.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- continues to require plts.  Desire for >100k at
   time of surgery.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.
   MDS -- chronic.  [**Month (only) 60**] require reevaluation.
   CAD -- evidence for mild heart failure.  Perhaps related to diastolic
   dysfunction.  Monitor exam.
   BRADYCARDIA -- probable pharmacological (beta-blockers).
   Asymptomatic.  Monitor.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia and possible CHF with volume overload, as well as a new right pleural effusion. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and monitor ABG, aiming for Po2 >60 mmHg and SaO2 >90%. The patient also has pneumonia in the left lower lobe, likely due to aspiration, and will continue receiving antimicrobials. A CNS tumor has been identified and the patient is awaiting neurosurgical evacuation. Nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TF) has been initiated. The patient has chronic left hemiplegia and thrombocytopenia, requiring platelet transfusion. The desire is for a net negative fluid balance, and the patient requires reevaluation for chronic myelodysplasia syndrome (MDS). There is evidence of mild heart failure, possibly related to diastolic dysfunction, which will be monitored. The patient experienced an episode of bradycardia, which is likely pharmacological in origin due to beta-blockers and is asymptomatic. Overall, the patient's condition remains critical, and ICU care will continue with various interventions for prophylaxis, glycemic control, and nutritional support."

   febrile and hypoxic.
   # Brain tumor with hemorrhagic lesion in parietal lobe:
   Neuro exam has been stable as compared to signout from OSH.
   - Contact patient's PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 5976**] ([**Doctor Last Name 540**])
   - Neurosurgery input
   1.       No acute indication for surgery.
   2.       Would like plt >100K prior to OR, consult heme-onc and Neuro
   onc
   3.       Had head CT (interval resolution of hemorrhagic mass) and MRI
   (result pending).
   4.       Final reads pending transfused plt counts and vent status.
   5.       Neuro-onc to see today.
   - transfuse to keep platelets > 50
   - monitor Q4H neuro exam
   # Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   No evidence of mucous plugging.  Suspect he has derecruited during
   transport.  Note that he has been intubated since [**9-25**].
   - Repeat ABG
   - Address pneumonia as discussed below
   - Potential fluid overload remains a component of his respiratory
   failure.  CXR demonstrated a worsening left sided consolidation.
   Yesterday
s FENa was 1.6
 will rpt FENa based upon current urine and
   serum electrolytes
   - Will continue to diurese with lasix and KCl.
   - note that pt has h/o DVT, though no DVTs on this admission.
   # Leukocytosis and Fevers:
   Suspect patient has nosocomial pneumonia.  Also may have C diff
 2 of
   3 cultures is negative.  Of note, his R-sided PICC was placed at OSH.
   - cover nosocomial VAP with vanc/zosyn/cipro (day [**3-7**])
   - OSH records positive for Cdiff and will continue to treat with vanc
   PO until one week after antibiotics are complete.
   - Following sputum, blood, urine
   # Metabolic Alkalosis/Volume status:
   - Likely due to diuresis or suctioning.
   - Holding fluids for possible fluid overload.  Will reassess once serum
   and urine electrolytes have been collected.
   - Rpt urine electrolytes to better assess volume status.
   # h/o DVT:
   - pneumoboots
   - no anticoagulation given intracranial bleeding.
   # MDS:
   - transfuse for Hct < 25 or Platelets < 50
   - type and screen
   - consented for blood

   - hold ASA given head bleed
   - Statin
   - Holding beta blocker as heart rate is now controlled.
   - Has not tolerated ACE I in past due to hyperkalemia
   # AFib:
   - Rate control with beta blocker
   - No ASA or coumadin
   # Hyperglycemia:
   Was on SSI at OSH but does not carry Dx of diabetes.
   - cover with SSI but discontinue if sugars are low
   # Sacral Wound:

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor. He was transferred to the hospital due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site, and upon admission, he was found to be febrile and hypoxic. The patient has been intubated since September 25th. He has multiple medical complications including severe hypoxic respiratory failure, leukocytosis and fevers, metabolic alkalosis/volume status, history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CAD/CABG), atrial fibrillation (AFib), hyperglycemia, sacral wound, gout, possible gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and an episode of brown liquid from percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube concerning for old blood.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Brain Tumor with Hemorrhagic Lesion in Parietal Lobe: The patient's neurologic status is stable compared to the signout from the previous hospital. Contact patient's primary care physician and neuro-oncologist for further evaluation. The patient's platelet count needs to be maintained above 100K prior to any surgery, and consultation with hematology-oncology and neurosurgery is required. Head CT and MRI results are pending.
2. Severe Hypoxic"

   Neuro exam has been stable as compared to signout from OSH.
   - Contact patient's PCP and [**Name9 (PRE) 5976**] ([**Doctor Last Name 540**])
   - Neurosurgery input
   1.       No acute indication for surgery.
   2.       Would like plt >100K prior to OR, consult heme-onc to eval
   possible etiologies of thrombocytopenia worse to suggest ways to
   increase plt count and possible BM biopsy.
   3.       Had head CT (interval resolution of hemorrhagic mass) and MRI
   (result pending).
   4.       Final reads pending transfused plt counts and vent status.
   - transfuse to keep platelets > 50
   - monitor Q4H neuro exam
   # Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   No evidence of mucous plugging.  Suspect he has derecruited during
   transport.  Note that he has been intubated since [**9-25**].
   - Repeat ABG
   - Address pneumonia as discussed below
   - Potential fluid overload with a CXR demonstrating a new left sided
   effusion and fluid in the left fissure.  Yesterday
s FENa was 0.6
   will rpt FENa based upon current urine and serum electrolytes, and
   attempt soft diuresis with 20 mg of IV Lasix.  Will use ultrasound of
   left lung to help determine whether LLL CXR opacity is fluid overload
   vs. atelectasis.
   - note that pt has h/o DVT
   - LE ultrasounds were negative for DVTs.
   # Leukocytosis and Fevers:
   Suspect patient has nosocomial pneumonia.  Also may have C diff
 1 of
   3 cultures is negative.  Of note, his R-sided PICC was placed at OSH.
   - cover nosocomial VAP with vanc/zosyn/cipro (day [**2-6**])
   - cover possible C diff with vanc PO until third stool culture is
   negative.
   - obtain sputum, blood, urine, stool Cx (for C diff)'
   # Metabolic Alkalosis/Volume status:
   - Likely due to diuresis or suctioning.
   - Holding fluids for possible fluid overload.  Will reassess once serum
   and urine electrolytes have been collected.
   - Rpt urine electrolytes to better assess volume status.
   # h/o DVT:
   - pneumoboots
   - no anticoagulation given intracranial bleeding.
   # MDS:
   - transfuse for Hct < 25 or Platelets < 50
   - type and screen
   - consented for blood
   # CAD s/p CABG; HTN; Dyslipidemia:
   - hold ASA given head bleed
   - Statin
   - Holding beta blocker as heart rate is now controlled.
   - Has not tolerated ACE I in past due to hyperkalemia
   # AFib:
   - Rate control with beta blocker
   - No ASA or coumadin
   # Hyperglycemia:
   Was on SSI at OSH but does not carry Dx of diabetes.
   - cover with SSI but discontinue if sugars are low
   # Sacral Wound:
   - Wound care consult
 following recommendations.
   - Nystatin as it appears to have fungal component
   # Gout:
   - Allopurinol
   # ? GERD:  on PPI at home, will continue
   # Episode of brown liquid from PEG concerning for old blood:
   ? [**1-26**] gastritis.
   - PPI
   - type and screen
   - Hcts have been stable.
   # FEN:
   - Held fluids due to ? fluid overload.
   - Nutrition recs: TF HN @ 15mL/hr, check TF tolerance, daily chem10,
   add multivitamins and supplements.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor. He was transferred to the ICU due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site, along with fever and hypoxia. The patient has been intubated since September 25th. His current condition includes severe hypoxic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, fevers, metabolic alkalosis/volume status, history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), nosocomial pneumonia, and other medical conditions such as coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, sacral wound, gout, possible gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and an episode of brown liquid from percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube concerning for old blood.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Brain Tumor with Hemorrhage: The patient has a known brain tumor with a recent hemorrhage near the tumor site. This condition requires close monitoring, and further neurosurgical input is needed to evaluate possible etiologies of thrombocytopenia and suggest ways to increase platelet count. A brain MRI is pending.

2. Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing severe hypoxic respiratory failure, which may be due to derecruitment during transport. Intub"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. They are awake, interactive, and able to communicate through writing. The patient has a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and there are concerns about a CNS mass, which has shown some improvement. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/55 mmHg to 97/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 36 mEq/L, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 142. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 19.0 to 25.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level ranging from 24.8% to 25.7 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 49 to 61 K/uL, and creatinine level ranging from 1.0 to 1.1 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal range or do not have significant abnormalities.

Plan:
The patient's condition is being managed in the ICU with various interventions including nutrition support, glycemic control, prophylaxis against deep vein throm"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, which is attributed to pneumonia and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The vital signs show a heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 137/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's blood cultures were obtained on 10/9 and 10/10. They have received multiple antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin.

The patient has a history of allergies to Univasc and Celexa. The medical history includes coronary artery disease with remote CABG, congestive heart failure, renal function preservation, previous cerebrovascular accident with left hemiplegia, malnutrition, and myelodysplastic syndrome.

The physical examination reveals an overweight/obese patient who appears comfortable without any signs of distress. The cardiovascular examination shows normal sinus rhythm, no murmurs, and no signs of fluid overload. The respiratory system examination is clear with no wheezes or crackles. The abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. The neurologic examination shows attentive behavior, purposeful movements, and normal tone on the right side, but flaccid and left hemiplegia on the left side.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, normal electrolytes"

   - cover nosocomial VAP with vanc/zosyn/cipro (day [**3-7**])
   - OSH records positive for Cdiff and will continue to treat with vanc
   PO until one week after antibiotics are complete.
   - Following sputum, blood, urine
   # Metabolic Alkalosis/Volume status:
   - Likely due to diuresis or suctioning.
   - Holding fluids for possible fluid overload.  Will reassess once serum
   and urine electrolytes have been collected.
   - Rpt urine electrolytes to better assess volume status.
   # h/o DVT:

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and known brain tumor. He was transferred to the hospital due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient's medical conditions include severe hypoxic respiratory failure, leukocytosis and fevers, metabolic alkalosis/volume status, h/o deep vein thrombosis (DVT), MDS, CAD with CABG, hypertension, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation (AFib), hyperglycemia, sacral wound, gout, possible gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and an episode of brown liquid from percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube concerning for old blood.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a significant concern. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and there is suspicion of derecruitment during transport. The CXR showed worsening left-sided consolidation, indicating pneumonia. The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2) and ABG results indicate hypoxemia. Monitoring and addressing the underlying cause of respiratory failure are crucial.

2. Nosocomial Pneumonia: The patient has leukocytosis and fevers, suggesting an infection. Given the worsening consolidation on CXR, nosocomial pneumonia is suspected. Antibiotic coverage should be provided"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of MDS and brain tumor who was admitted to the ICU due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site. He presented with febrile and hypoxic conditions. The patient has been intubated since September 25th, and his current ventilator settings include FiO2 60, rate 20, Vt (set) 500 mL, RR (set) 18, PEEP 10 cmH2O, and SpO2 96%. The patient's platelet count is 40,000/uL, and he has received a total of 5 units of platelets during his admission. His electrolyte levels show a slight imbalance, with high sodium and low potassium levels. His arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 53 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 168. The patient's physical examination reveals left-sided facial droop and ptosis, along with intact strength in his right arm and leg, but no strength in his left arm and leg. There is also evidence of sacral ulcers, and his right-sided PICC line was placed at OSH.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Surgical complications related to the brain tumor and hemorrhage.
2. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or fluid overload.
3. Metabolic alkalosis and volume status imbalance.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor. He was transferred to the ICU due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site and presented with fever and hypoxia. The patient has been intubated since September 25th and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass graft (CAD s/p CABG), hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation (AFib), hyperglycemia, gout, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The patient's current condition includes severe hypoxic respiratory failure, leukocytosis and fevers, metabolic alkalosis/volume status, history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and brain tumor with hemorrhagic lesion in the parietal lobe.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient has leukocytosis and fevers, which may indicate an infection. Given his prolonged stay in the ICU, he is at risk for developing nosocomial pneumonia.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating the possibility of fluid overload, which can contribute to respiratory failure.
3. Sacral wound infection: The patient has stage 2 sacral ulcers, which may be infected, especially"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor. He was transferred to the hospital due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site and presented with fever and hypoxia. The patient has been intubated since September 25th and is currently on mechanical ventilation. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 58 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 125/52 to 137/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His neurological examination has been stable compared to the previous day, with no new changes.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.0 x 10^9/L, platelet count of 49 x 10^9/L, and elevated lactate acid levels at 1.5 mmol/L. His renal function tests indicate a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 24.8 g/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. Imaging studies reveal bilateral pleural effusions, which appear to be improved from the previous day. An MRI of the brain is pending for further evaluation of the tumor and hemorrhagic"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and adjust antimicrobials accordingly.

2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 597 mL since 12 AM, indicating potential fluid overload. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low at 49, indicating thrombocytopenia. Transfusion of platelets may be required to maintain an adequate platelet count and prevent bleeding complications.

4. Brain lesion: The patient is awaiting surgical biopsy/resection for a brain lesion. This suggests the possibility of a central nervous system infection or tumor, which could lead to neurological complications if not managed appropriately.

5. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds (TF), indicating a need for nutritional support. Malnutrition can weaken the immune system and impair healing, so it is important to monitor the patient's nutritional status and ensure adequate intake.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has systemic"

The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and congestive heart failure (CHF). They remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 128/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.7°C. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function. The patient has been receiving appropriate treatment for pneumonia and CHF, including antibiotics, diuretics, and nutritional support. Fluid balance is being closely monitored, with a goal of achieving a net negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters per 24 hours. The patient's thrombocytopenia is being managed with platelet transfusion. The patient's brain lesion is awaiting surgical biopsy/resection, and bleeding has been stabilized. There are no acute issues with the patient's medical devices or nutritional support. The patient's code status remains as full code, and their disposition remains in the ICU. The patient's overall condition is improving gradually."

   Assessment and Plan
   80yo gentleman with h/o MDS and known brain tumor transferred to [**Hospital1 54**]
   in the setting of recent hemorrhage near tumor site, found to be
   febrile and hypoxic.
   # Brain tumor with hemorrhagic lesion in parietal lobe: Neuro exam has
   been stable as compared to signout from OSH. No changes from previous
   day.
   - Contact patient's PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) **] ([**Doctor Last Name 540**]) saw pt [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] contact for further
   input
   - Initial Neurosurgery input as follows. Possible surgery next
   Thursday.
   1.       No acute indication for surgery.
   2.       Would like plt >100K prior to OR,
   3.       Had head CT (interval resolution of hemorrhagic mass) and MRI
   (result pending).
   4.       Final reads pending transfused plt counts and vent status.
   - transfuse to keep platelets > 50 (s/p 5 units platelets total during
   admission).
   - monitor Q4H neuro exam
   # Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Most likely etiology includes
   resolving infection (eg: PNA) vs CHF/fluid overload. No evidence of
   mucous plugging.  Patient has been intubated since [**9-25**]. Current
   settings AC 50%/500/18/10 with no significant changes in ABG. Volume
   status: about -600cc on [**10-10**] and +666cc LOS.
   - Will plan to wean PEEP from 10
8 and follow ABGs               .
   consider RISB if weaning trial is tolerated.
   - Address pneumonia as discussed below
   - Potential fluid overload remains a component of his respiratory
   failure.  Will f/u ECHO results
   - Will continue to diurese with lasix and KCl with a goal daily diurese
   of -1-2L.
   - note that pt has h/o DVT, though no DVTs on this admission.
   # Leukocytosis and Fevers: Afebrile O/N, leukocytosis resolving.
   Etiologies include nosocomial VAP, C.dif colitis (although [**1-27**] cultures
   are negative).  Of note, his R-sided PICC was placed at OSH.
   - cover nosocomial VAP with vanc/zosyn/cipro (day 1=[**10-7**]; day #4;
   continue for [**8-4**] as clinical presentation allows)
   - OSH records positive for Cdiff and will continue to treat with vanc
   PO until one week after antibiotics are complete.
   - Following sputum, blood, urine
   # Metabolic Alkalosis/Volume status: Metabolic alkalosis most likely
   [**1-26**] contraction alkalosis (eg: diuresis or suctioning). Borderline
   FeUrea and BUN/Cr ratio >20 suggests pre-renal etiology.  However,
   considering volume overload resulting in respiratory compromise and
   have been diuresing. -597cc on [**10-10**] and +666cc LOS.
   - Holding fluids for possible fluid overload.  With goal diurese of
   -1-2L/day with Lasix 40mg IV BID; adjust as needed to meet goal.
   Continue to provide KCl 40mEq IV doses (including dosing TID?) to
   encourage further secretion of bicarbonate from kidneys.
   - TF Free water flushes-50cc
   -Check lytes at 3pm.
   # h/o DVT:
   - pneumoboots. no anticoagulation given intracranial bleeding.
   # MDS: s/p 5units platelets during admission. Platelets 40 this am with
   order given to transfuse #5
   - transfuse for Hct < 25 or Platelets < 50
   - type and screen, consented for blood
   # CAD s/p CABG; HTN; Dyslipidemia:
   - ECHO today for re-evaluation of heart function (Last ECHO: [**8-31**]-Mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global
   biventricular systolic function EF>55%; TEE [**9-30**]-No thrombus in LA)
   - hold ASA given head bleed
   - Statin
   - Holding beta blocker as heart rate is now controlled.
   - Has not tolerated ACE I in past due to hyperkalemia
   # AFib:
   - Rate control with beta blocker
   - No ASA or coumadin
   # Hyperglycemia: Was on SSI at OSH but does not carry Dx of diabetes.
   - cover with SSI but discontinue if sugars are low
   # Sacral Wound:
   - Wound care consult
 following recommendations.
   - Nystatin as it appears to have fungal component
   # Gout:
   - Allopurinol
   # ? GERD:  on PPI at home, will continue
   # Episode of brown liquid from PEG concerning for old blood: ? [**1-26**]
   gastritis. Hcts have been stable.
   - PPI, type and screen

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor who was transferred to the ICU for recent hemorrhage near the tumor site. He presented with febrile and hypoxic conditions. The patient has been intubated since September 25th and is currently on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 50%. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112-135 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's neuro exam has been stable compared to the signout from OSH, with no changes from the previous day. He has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous CABG, hypertension, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation (AFib), hyperglycemia, sacral wound, gout, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.8K/uL and a platelet count of 61K/uL. He has metabolic alkalosis and volume status, with a goal diuresis of -1-2L/day. The patient's abdominal examination shows a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in place. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Fluid overload and respiratory failure
3. Possible need for surgery due to the brain tumor with hemorrhagic lesion
4. Risk of thromboembolic events due to history of DVT and immobilization
5. Infection related to the PEG tube
6. Poor glycemic control
7. Possible bleeding complications due to low platelet count and anticoagulation
8. Complications related to hypertension and dyslipidemia
9. Potential cardiac issues due to history of CAD and previous CABG
10. Continued monitoring and management of the brain tumor and its associated complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   80yo gentleman with h/o MDS and known brain tumor transferred to [**Hospital1 54**]
   in the setting of recent hemorrhage near tumor site, found to be
   febrile and hypoxic.
   # Brain tumor with hemorrhagic lesion in parietal lobe: Neuro exam has
   been stable as compared to signout from OSH. No changes from previous
   day.
   - Contact patient's PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) **] ([**Doctor Last Name 540**]) saw pt [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] contact for further
   input
   - Initial Neurosurgery input as follows. Possible surgery next
   Thursday.
   1.       No acute indication for surgery.
   2.       Would like plt >100K prior to OR,
   3.       Had head CT (interval resolution of hemorrhagic mass) and MRI
   (result pending).
   4.       Final reads pending transfused plt counts and vent status.
   - transfuse to keep platelets > 50 (s/p 5 units platelets total during
   admission).
   - monitor Q4H neuro exam
   # Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Most likely etiology includes
   resolving infection (eg: PNA) vs CHF/fluid overload. No evidence of
   mucous plugging.  Patient has been intubated since [**9-25**]. Current
   settings AC 50%/500/18/10 with no significant changes in ABG. Volume
   status: about -600cc on [**10-10**] and +666cc LOS.
   - Will plan to wean PEEP from 10
8 and follow ABGs               .
   consider RISB if weaning trial is tolerated.
   - Address pneumonia as discussed below
   - Potential fluid overload remains a component of his respiratory
   failure.  Will f/u ECHO results
   - Will continue to diurese with lasix and KCl with a goal daily diurese
   of -1-2L.
   - note that pt has h/o DVT, though no DVTs on this admission.
   # Leukocytosis and Fevers: Afebrile O/N, leukocytosis resolving.
   Etiologies include nosocomial VAP, C.dif colitis (although [**1-27**] cultures
   are negative).  Of note, his R-sided PICC was placed at OSH.
   - cover nosocomial VAP with vanc/zosyn/cipro (day 1=[**10-7**]; day #4;
   continue for [**8-4**] as clinical presentation allows)
   - OSH records positive for Cdiff and will continue to treat with vanc
   PO until one week after antibiotics are complete.
   - Following sputum, blood, urine
   # Metabolic Alkalosis/Volume status: Metabolic alkalosis most likely
   [**1-26**] contraction alkalosis (eg: diuresis or suctioning). Borderline
   FeUrea and BUN/Cr ratio >20 suggests pre-renal etiology.  However,
   considering volume overload resulting in respiratory compromise and
   have been diuresing. -597cc on [**10-10**] and +666cc LOS.
   - Holding fluids for possible fluid overload.  With goal diurese of
   -1-2L/day with Lasix 40mg IV BID; adjust as needed to meet goal.
   Continue to provide KCl 40mEq IV doses (including dosing TID?) to
   encourage further secretion of bicarbonate from kidneys.
   - TF Free water flushes-50cc
   -Check lytes at 3pm.
   # h/o DVT:
   - pneumoboots. no anticoagulation given intracranial bleeding.
   # MDS: s/p 5units platelets during admission. Platelets 40 this am with
   order given to transfuse #5
   - transfuse for Hct < 25 or Platelets < 50
   - type and screen, consented for blood
   # CAD s/p CABG; HTN; Dyslipidemia:
   - ECHO today for re-evaluation of heart function (Last ECHO: [**8-31**]-Mild
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global
   biventricular systolic function EF>55%; TEE [**9-30**]-No thrombus in LA)
   - hold ASA given head bleed
   - Statin
   - Holding beta blocker as heart rate is now controlled.
   - Has not tolerated ACE I in past due to hyperkalemia
   # AFib:
   - Rate control with beta blocker
   - No ASA or coumadin
   # Hyperglycemia: Was on SSI at OSH but does not carry Dx of diabetes.
   - cover with SSI but discontinue if sugars are low
   # Sacral Wound:
   - Wound care consult
 following recommendations.
   - Nystatin as it appears to have fungal component
   # Gout:
   - Allopurinol
   # ? GERD:  on PPI at home, will continue
   # Episode of brown liquid from PEG concerning for old blood: ? [**1-26**]
   gastritis. Hcts have been stable.
   - PPI, type and screen
   # FEN:
   - F: Held fluids due to ? fluid overload.
   - E: daily chem10, replete PRN,

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor who was admitted to the ICU due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site. He presented with febrile and hypoxic conditions.

Key findings from the progress note include:

1. The patient has a brain tumor with hemorrhagic lesions in the parietal lobe. Neurological examination has been stable compared to the previous day, and there are no new changes.

2. The patient has severe hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely due to resolving infection (e.g., pneumonia) versus congestive heart failure (CHF) or fluid overload. He has been intubated since September 25th, and his current ventilator settings are AC 50%/500/18/10 with no significant changes in arterial blood gas (ABG). The patient's volume status shows a deficit of about -600cc on October 10th and a positive fluid balance of +666cc since admission.

3. The patient has leukocytosis and fevers, which could be attributed to nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile colitis, or a right-sided peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line infection. The patient is being covered with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin.

4. The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and known brain tumor who was transferred to the hospital due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site. He presented with fever and hypoxia. The patient has several medical conditions including brain tumor with parietal hemorrhagic lesion, severe hypoxic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, metabolic alkalosis/volume status, h/o deep vein thrombosis (DVT), MDS, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, sacral wound, gout, possible gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and familial endometriosis (FEN). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Neurosurgery: The patient may require neurosurgery later this week due to the brain tumor with parietal hemorrhagic lesion. This procedure carries potential risks such as bleeding, infection, and neurological complications.
2. Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may complicate further, leading to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation. This could result in multi-organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Infection: The patient is at high risk of developing nosocomial infections, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to his"

   metabolic alkalosis with underlying respiratory acidosis. Etiologies of
   respiratory failure include resolving infection vs fluid overload vs
   atelectasis.  LVEF 60%. Diuresed 2.8L negative yesterday.
   - Continue to wean vent with trial of CPAP/PSV today; if tolerates,
   will adjust vent settings tonight to attempt SBT/extubation tomorrow.
   - Continue tx of PNA as discussed below
   - Will diurese with lasix and KCl PRN, will keep patient
s fluid status
   even.
   - note that pt has h/o DVT, though no DVTs on this admission.
   #Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium during admission; Most likely etiology
   includes malignancy.
   -Will check ionized calcium to further assess calcium level.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC mildly elevated from yesterday (19K from 18K).
   Afebrile O/N.  Resp Culture:  MRSA. Elevated vanc level. Blood and
   urine Cx negative for growth.
   - Covering nosocomial VAP with vanc; will hold Vanc as levels are
   elevated, will follow levels.
   - Continue cipro (day #6; continue for 8-10d)
   - OSH records positive for Cdiff and will continue to treat with vanc
   PO until one week after antibiotics are complete.
   # Metabolic Alkalosis/Volume status: Likely [**1-26**] contraction alkalosis
   (eg: diuresis or suctioning). Good diuresis with negative 2.8L
   yesterday. Holding fluids.

The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor who was transferred to the hospital due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site. He presented with fever, hypoxia, and respiratory failure. The patient has had seizures, severe hypoxic respiratory failure, hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, metabolic alkalosis, and volume status issues. He also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and gout. Additionally, he has sacral wound, possible gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and no known history of diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure/Brain Tumor: The patient experienced a seizure likely related to the brain tumor. Phenytoin has been given for seizure control, and further evaluation is planned with an EEG. Possible neurosurgery is being considered for biopsy and evaluation of the intracranial tumor.
2. Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial yesterday. Weaning off the ventilator with a trial of CPAP/PSV today will be attempted, followed by extubation tomorrow if tolerated.

   # Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Failed SBT yesterday. On CMV
   Fi02, PEEP 10, RR 12, Vt 500 O2 Sat in 90
s with ABG suggestive of
   metabolic alkalosis with underlying respiratory acidosis. Etiologies of
   respiratory failure include resolving infection vs fluid overload vs
   atelectasis.  LVEF 60%. Diuresed 2.8L negative yesterday.
   - Continue to wean vent with trial of CPAP/PSV today; if tolerates,
   will adjust vent settings tonight to attempt SBT/extubation tomorrow.
   - Continue tx of PNA as discussed below
   - Will diurese with lasix and KCl PRN, will keep patient
s fluid status
   even.
   - note that pt has h/o DVT, though no DVTs on this admission.
   #Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium during admission; Most likely etiology
   includes malignancy.
   -Will check ionized calcium to further assess calcium level.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC mildly elevated from yesterday (19K from 18K).
   Afebrile O/N.  Resp Culture:  MRSA. Elevated vanc level. Blood and
   urine Cx negative for growth.
   - Covering nosocomial VAP with vanc; will hold Vanc as levels are
   elevated, will follow levels.
   - Continue cipro (day #6; continue for 8-10d)
   - OSH records positive for Cdiff and will continue to treat with vanc
   PO until one week after antibiotics are complete.
   # Metabolic Alkalosis/Volume status: Likely [**1-26**] contraction alkalosis
   (eg: diuresis or suctioning). Good diuresis with negative 2.8L
   yesterday. Holding fluids.
   - D/c lasix standing and will dose PRN; will keep I/Os even.
   - KCl 40mEq IV doses as needed to encourage further secretion of
   bicarbonate from kidneys.
   - TF Free water flushes-50cc
   # MDS: s/p 6units platelets during admission. Low HCT today.
   - will transfuse 1u pRBC now; goal to transfuse for Hct < 25 or
   Platelets < 50
   - type and screen, consented for blood
   - Holding all Heparin Products given pt it HIT +
   - Follow-up Serotonin Release Antibody
   # CAD s/p CABG; HTN; Dyslipidemia: LVEF 60%
   - hold ASA given head bleed
   - Statin
   - Holding beta blocker as heart rate is now controlled.
   - Has not tolerated ACE I in past due to hyperkalemia
   # h/o DVT:
   - pneumoboots. no anticoagulation given intracranial bleeding.
   # AFib:
   - Rate controled with beta blocker
   - No ASA or coumadin
   # Hyperglycemia: Was on SSI at OSH but does not carry Dx of diabetes.
   - cover with SSI but discontinue if sugars are low
   # Sacral Wound:
   - Wound care consult

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and known brain tumor who was transferred to the ICU for recent hemorrhage near the tumor site. He presented with fever, hypoxia, and respiratory failure. The patient experienced a seizure overnight, likely related to the brain tumor, and received Ativan, Dexamethasone, and Phenytoin. His CT scan showed no progression or interval change in the tumor size. The patient's fluid balance has been positive with a total intake of 1865 mL and output of 4680 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2815 mL. He received a 500NS bolus, which resolved his low blood pressure. The patient's vancomycin level is elevated at 53, so the dose was held. His WBC count is mildly elevated at 19K. The patient's ABG results indicate metabolic alkalosis with underlying respiratory acidosis. The patient's electrolytes show hypercalcemia, and his blood cultures are negative for growth. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but no DVTs on this admission. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous CABG surgery. The patient's medical complications include severe hypoxic respiratory failure, seizure, hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, metabolic alkalosis, and potential nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is being treated with various medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, antiepileptic drugs, and anticoagulants. His current vital signs are stable, but he remains intubated and sedated. Further evaluation and management are planned, including a neurosurgical consultation for possible tumor biopsy, seizure management, weaning off the ventilator, and addressing other comorbidities."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and known brain tumor who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient had a hemorrhage near the tumor site and was found to be febrile and hypoxic. The patient's mental status has improved since yesterday, and an EEG has been ordered. The patient will start on Keppra 500mg PO BID and is being considered for neurosurgery this week to biopsy/evaluate the intracranial tumor. The patient's platelet count is low, and he will receive a transfusion to keep platelets above 50K. 

The patient's respiratory failure is due to resolving infection, fluid overload, or atelectasis. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV with PS 10, PEEP 8, FiO2 50%, and RSBI at 64. No new ABG results are available. 

The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 20K. The respiratory culture showed MRSA, but blood and urine cultures are negative. 

The patient's calcium levels are elevated, likely due to humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. 

The patient has metabolic alkalosis/volume status, possibly due to diuresis or suctioning. 

The patient has MDS with low HCT and low platelets. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and known brain tumor who was transferred to the ICU for recent hemorrhage near the tumor site, febrile respiratory failure, and hypoxia. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission and had a seizure. He has been diagnosed with hypercalcemia, metabolic alkalosis, leukocytosis, and low hemoglobin and platelet counts. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, gout, and hyperglycemia. He is currently being treated for pneumonia and has a sacral wound that requires wound care consult. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 97/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe hypoxic respiratory failure, which may lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Seizure Activity: The patient had a seizure, and there is a possibility of recurrent seizure episodes due to the brain tumor and associated hemorrhage.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis/Volume Status: The patient has metabolic alkalosis likely secondary to diuresis or suctioning. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to complications such"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor. He was transferred to the ICU due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site, fever, and hypoxia leading to respiratory failure. The patient has had seizures overnight, likely related to the brain tumor, and is being treated with phenytoin and keppra. Neurosurgery is being considered for biopsy/evaluation of the intracranial tumor. The patient's platelet count is low, and he has received a total of 5 units of platelets during admission. He also has severe hypoxic respiratory failure and has failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). The patient's blood culture shows MRSA, and he has elevated vancomycin levels. He has hypercalcemia, which is likely due to malignancy, and his white blood cell count is mildly elevated. The patient's metabolic alkalosis is believed to be caused by diuresis or suctioning. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV and is being weaned off the ventilator. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous CABG, hypertension, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation (AFib), hyperglycemia, sacral wound infection, gout, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He is also being treated for potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure recurrence or progression due to the brain tumor.
2. Respiratory failure or worsening of the current condition.
3. Infection, particularly pneumonia or bloodstream infection due to the presence of MRSA.
4. Bleeding complications due to low platelet count and history of hemorrhage.
5. Electrolyte imbalances, especially hypercalcemia.
6. Metabolic alkalosis or acidosis due to fluid management.
7. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and history of DVT.
8. Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
9. Wound infection or breakdown of the sacral wound.
10. Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers due to stress ulcer prophylaxis."

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. He had a recent hemorrhage near the tumor site and was found to be febrile and hypoxic. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation, and his condition has improved since yesterday. He is also being treated for an infection with piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure, which is likely related to the brain tumor and the hemorrhage. He has been started on Dilantin and Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) two days ago and was switched from conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) to CPAP/PSV. His RSBI is at 64, and he is still dependent on the ventilator.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has a mildly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 20K, which could indicate an ongoing infection.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated calcium levels, likely due to humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy.
5. Metabolic Alkalosis/Volume Status: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to diuresis or suctioning. His fluid status"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU for postoperative care after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia and requires respiratory support. He has been on CPAP/PSV with O2 delivery through an endotracheal tube. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/46 to 110/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for seizure activity, which prompted an EEG.

The patient has received transfusions of one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for a hematocrit (HCT) of 21 and has been started on Keppra for seizure management. Additionally, the patient has an elevated ionized calcium level, and a follow-up parathyroid hormone (PTH) test has been ordered. An arterial line has been placed and subsequently stopped. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3,361 mL and a total output of 3,600 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 239 mL. The patient's respiratory support settings include a tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi"

   in the setting of recent hemorrhage near tumor site, found to be
   febrile and hypoxic with respiratory failure.
   # Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: Seizure most
   likely related to brain tumor and hemorrhage as blood can act as an
   acute irritant, CT showed no progression or interval change of tumor.
   D/c
ed phenytoin as drug can suppress bone marrow.  Improved mental
   status since yesterday.
   - will get an EEG
   - Keppra 500mg PO BID starting this am
   - Possible Neurosurgery this week (Thursday) for biopsy/evaluation of
   intracranial tumor.
   - Neuro-oncologist ([**Doctor Last Name 540**]) following
   - Will keep Plts > 100K for surgery
   - transfuse to keep platelets > 50 (s/p 6 units platelets total during
   admission)
   - monitor Q4H neuro exam
   # Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Failed SBT two days ago. Switched
   from CMV
CPAP/PSV yesterday. Current settings: CPAP/PSV PS 10 PEEP 8
   FiO2 50%; RSBI at 0400 of 64; sat
ing in low-mid 90
s. No new ABG.
   Etiologies of respiratory failure include resolving infection vs fluid
   overload vs atelectasis.  LVEF 60%. Diuresed .238L negative yesterday.
   Neg 4 Liters during LOS.
   - Continue to wean vent with trial of SBT today. Follow up ABG.
   - Continue tx of PNA as discussed below
   - Will diurese with lasix and KCl PRN, will keep patient
s fluid status
   even.
   - note that pt has h/o DVT, though no DVTs on this admission.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC mildly elevated from yesterday (20K from 19K).
   Afebrile O/N. Resp Culture:  MRSA. Elevated vanc level. Blood and urine
   Cx negative for growth.
   - Covering nosocomial VAP with vanc; will hold Vanc as levels are
   elevated, will follow levels.
   - Continue cipro (day #7; continue for 8-10d); f/u vanco levels daily
   and give when level is within therapeutic range.
   - OSH records positive for Cdiff and will continue to treat with vanc
   PO until one week after antibiotics are complete
   #Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium during admission; PTH WNL. Most likely
   etiology includes humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy as involvement of
   bone is unlikely.
   -f/u with daily calcium. .
   # Metabolic Alkalosis/Volume status: Likely [**1-26**] contraction alkalosis
   (eg: diuresis or suctioning). Diuresed with negative .240L yesterday.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor. He was transferred to the ICU due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site, febrile and hypoxic respiratory failure, and severe hypoxic respiratory failure. 

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: The patient had a seizure, likely related to the brain tumor and hemorrhage. Phenytoin was discontinued as it can suppress bone marrow, and the patient's mental status improved. An EEG is planned, and Keppra has been started. Possible neurosurgery this week for biopsy/evaluation of the intracranial tumor is being considered.

2. Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient failed spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) two days ago and was switched from conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) to continuous positive airway pressure/pressure support ventilation (CPAP/PSV). The current settings are PS 10, PEEP 8, FiO2 50%, and RSBI at 64. No new arterial blood gas (ABG) results are available. Etiologies of respiratory failure include resolving infection, fluid overload, and atelectasis. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 60%.

","The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and known brain tumor who was transferred to the ICU in the setting of recent hemorrhage near the tumor site. The patient presented with fever and hypoxia, leading to respiratory failure. He experienced a seizure overnight, likely related to the brain tumor. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 97/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on CPAP/PSV.

The patient's lab results show an elevated ionized calcium level, which may be due to malignancy. His white blood cell count is mildly elevated at 19K, indicating leukocytosis. The patient has a positive result for MRSA on respiratory culture, but blood and urine cultures are negative for growth. His electrolytes reveal metabolic alkalosis, likely secondary to diuresis or suctioning. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, gout, possible gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and a sacral wound.

The patient's plan includes continuing phenytoin for seizure control, initiating keppra for seizure prevention, and considering neurosurgery this week for biopsy/evaluation of the"

   Assessment and Plan
   80yo gentleman with h/o MDS and known brain tumor transferred to [**Hospital1 54**]
   in the setting of recent hemorrhage near tumor site, found to be
   febrile and hypoxic with respiratory failure.
   # Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: Seizure most
   likely related to brain tumor and hemorrhage as blood can act as an
   acute irritant, CT showed no progression or interval change of tumor.
   D/c
ed phenytoin as drug can suppress bone marrow.  Improved mental
   status since yesterday.
   - will get an EEG
   - Keppra 500mg PO BID starting this am
   - Possible Neurosurgery this week (Thursday) for biopsy/evaluation of
   intracranial tumor.
   - Neuro-oncologist ([**Doctor Last Name 540**]) following
   - Will keep Plts > 100K for surgery
   - transfuse to keep platelets > 50 (s/p 6 units platelets total during
   admission)
   - monitor Q4H neuro exam
   # Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Failed SBT two days ago. Switched
   from CMV
CPAP/PSV yesterday. Current settings: CPAP/PSV PS 10 PEEP 8
   FiO2 50%. Recent ABG suggestive of metabolic alkalosis with underlying
   respiratory acidosis. Etiologies of respiratory failure include
   resolving infection vs fluid overload vs atelectasis.  LVEF 60%.
   Diuresed .238L negative yesterday.
   - Continue to wean vent with trial of SBT today.
   - Continue tx of PNA as discussed below
   - Will diurese with lasix and KCl PRN, will keep patient
s fluid status
   even.
   - note that pt has h/o DVT, though no DVTs on this admission.
   #Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium during admission; Most likely etiology
   includes malignancy.
   -f/u with PTH
   # Leukocytosis: WBC mildly elevated from yesterday (19K from 18K).
   Afebrile O/N.  Resp Culture:  MRSA. Elevated vanc level. Blood and
   urine Cx negative for growth.
   - Covering nosocomial VAP with vanc; will hold Vanc as levels are
   elevated, will follow levels.
   - Continue cipro (day #7; continue for 8-10d)
   - OSH records positive for Cdiff and will continue to treat with vanc
   PO until one week after antibiotics are complete.
   # Metabolic Alkalosis/Volume status: Likely [**1-26**] contraction alkalosis
   (eg: diuresis or suctioning). Good diuresis with negative .240L
   yesterday. Holding fluids.
   - D/c lasix standing and will dose PRN; will keep I/Os even.
   - KCl 40mEq IV doses as needed to encourage further secretion of
   bicarbonate from kidneys.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He has been experiencing hypoxemia and requires respiratory support. The patient has had an arterial line stopped, received a trial of CPAP/PSV, and tolerated it well. He was also transfused one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to increase his hemoglobin concentration to 24.7%. The patient had a seizure episode, for which an EEG was ordered and Dilantin was discontinued while starting Keppra. There are concerns about elevated ionized calcium levels, and a follow-up PTH test to AM labs has been ordered. The patient's allergies include Univas (moexipril HCl), Celexa (citalopram HBr), and heparin agents. He has a history of light-headedness and unknown allergies to heparin agents. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 10/11/2171 at 06:00 PM and Vancomycin on 10/12/2171 at 08:00 PM.

Physical examination findings include a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/46 mmHg to 110/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on CPAP/"

   in the setting of recent hemorrhage near tumor site, found to be
   febrile and hypoxic with respiratory failure.
   # Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: Seizure
   overnight most likely related to brain tumor, CT showed no progression
   or interval change of tumor. Given extra Phenytoin this am for
   decreased level.  Decreased interaction compared to previous days.
   - F/u final CT read; will get an EEG
   - Continue Phenytoin 100mg IV q8 for one more dose and then d/c; will
   begin Keppra 500mg PO BID starting this pm
   - Possible Neurosurgery this week (Thursday) for biopsy/evaluation of
   intracranial tumor.
   - Neuro-oncologist ([**Doctor Last Name 540**]), will contact for further input re
   seizure and plan
   - Will keep Plts > 100K for surgery
   - transfuse to keep platelets > 50 (s/p 5 units platelets total during
   admission)
   - monitor Q4H neuro exam
   # Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Failed SBT yesterday. On CMV
   Fi02, PEEP 10, RR 12, Vt 500 O2 Sat in 90
s with ABG suggestive of
   metabolic alkalosis with underlying respiratory acidosis. Etiologies of
   respiratory failure include resolving infection vs fluid overload vs
   atelectasis.  LVEF 60%. Diuresed 2.8L negative yesterday.
   - Continue to wean vent with trial of CPAP/PSV today; if tolerates,
   will adjust vent settings tonight to attempt SBT/extubation tomorrow.
   - Continue tx of PNA as discussed below
   - Will diurese with lasix and KCl PRN, will keep patient
s fluid status
   even.
   - note that pt has h/o DVT, though no DVTs on this admission.
   #Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium during admission; Most likely etiology
   includes malignancy.
   -Will check ionized calcium to further assess calcium level.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC mildly elevated from yesterday (19K from 18K).
   Afebrile O/N.  Resp Culture:  MRSA. Elevated vanc level. Blood and
   urine Cx negative for growth.
   - Covering nosocomial VAP with vanc; will hold Vanc as levels are
   elevated, will follow levels.
   - Continue cipro (day #6; continue for 8-10d)
   - OSH records positive for Cdiff and will continue to treat with vanc
   PO until one week after antibiotics are complete.
   # Metabolic Alkalosis/Volume status: Likely [**1-26**] contraction alkalosis
   (eg: diuresis or suctioning). Good diuresis with negative 2.8L
   yesterday. Holding fluids.
   - D/c lasix standing and will dose PRN; will keep I/Os even.
   - KCl 40mEq IV doses as needed to encourage further secretion of
   bicarbonate from kidneys.
   - TF Free water flushes-50cc
   # MDS: s/p 6units platelets during admission. Low HCT today.
   - will transfuse 1u pRBC now; goal to transfuse for Hct < 25 or
   Platelets < 50
   - type and screen, consented for blood
   - Holding all Heparin Products given pt it HIT +
   - Follow-up Serotonin Release Antibody
   # CAD s/p CABG; HTN; Dyslipidemia: LVEF 60%
   - hold ASA given head bleed
   - Statin
   - Holding beta blocker as heart rate is now controlled.

   # h/o DVT:
   - pneumoboots. no anticoagulation given intracranial bleeding.
   # AFib:
   - Rate controled with beta blocker
   - No ASA or coumadin
   # Hyperglycemia: Was on SSI at OSH but does not carry Dx of diabetes.
   - cover with SSI but discontinue if sugars are low

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor who was admitted to the ICU for severe hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing seizures, likely related to the brain tumor, and has shown decreased interaction compared to previous days. He has also been diagnosed with hypercalcemia, possibly due to malignancy, and leukocytosis with an elevated white blood cell count.

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 97/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

Physical examination findings include left eye ptosis and left-sided facial droop, minimal response to voice/touch, flaccid left upper and lower extremities, and moving right upper and lower extremities. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no signs of infection or bowel sounds. The extremities show no edema, and pulses are 2+ distal.

Laboratory results show elevated ionized calcium levels, decreased hemoglobin concentration, and prolonged PT/INR. The patient has received blood transfusions, antibiotics, and antiepileptic medication.

   Respriatory failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, including pneumonia (resolving),
   ?underlying COPD, CNS lesion.  Continue mechanical ventilation, attempt
   SBT.
   SEIZURE -- new onset, likley due to CNS lesion/mass.  Controlled on
   anticonvulsant (cepra).
   CNS MASS -- planned Neurosurgical bx, possibly on Thursday.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF via PEG.
   FLUIDS -- desire to continue net negative balance.
   HYPERCALCEMIA -- likely related to mass and/or MDS.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- underlying MDS and now HIT(+) positive --> avoid

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure. They remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) early this weekend and has been experiencing generalized seizures, likely due to a CNS lesion or mass. They have been receiving red blood cells (PRBCs) and platelets for low values, but no overt clinical evidence of active bleeding has been observed.

The patient has a history of allergies to Univasc (Oral) and Celexa (Oral). They are also allergic to an unknown heparin agent. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 10/11/2171 at 06:00 PM and Vancomycin on 10/12/2171 at 08:00 PM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the seizure episode. Their vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) at 37.1°C, current temperature at 36.2°C, heart rate (HR) at 56 bpm with a range of 52-73 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 120/59 mmHg to 123/59 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 20 breaths per minute with a range of 14-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 95%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) admitted to the ICU.
- Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/59 to 123/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set respiratory rate of 300, tidal volume of 376 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
- Arterial blood gas (ABG) results show pH 7.44, pCO2 57 mmHg, pO2 66 mmHg, HCO3 40 mEq/L, base excess (BE) 11 mEq/L, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 132.
- The patient has electrolyte abnormalities including low potassium (K+ 3.9 mEq/L), low magnesium (Mg++ 1.1 mg/dL), and normal calcium (Ca++ 10.9 mg/dL).
- Complete blood count (CBC) shows leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 18.9-20.7 thousand/mm3 and thrombocytopenia with a platelet (Plt) count of 40-68 thousand/mm3.
- Renal function tests reveal a creatinine (Cr) level of 1.1 mg/dL.
- Other lab results include elevated troponin-T, increased CK, and prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR).
- The patient has a history of allergies to Univasc (moexipril HCl) and Celexa (citalopram hydrobromide).
- The patient's medical history includes CABG, hypoxemia, and unknown heparin agent allergy.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission.
- The patient has not been diuresed since a negative 750 at 10 pm.
- The patient's family history is not mentioned.
- The patient's code status is full code.
- The patient's disposition is not mentioned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility, along with the presence of central venous catheters, increases the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness and mechanical ventilation can predispose the patient to stress ulcers, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor. He was transferred to the ICU due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site, accompanied by fever and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His mental status has improved since yesterday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: The patient is at risk for recurrent seizures due to the presence of a brain tumor and associated hemorrhage. Phenytoin was discontinued as it can suppress bone marrow function.
2. Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced low oxygen levels during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday. He is currently on CPAP/PSV with PS 5, PEEP 5, and FiO2 50%. The RSBI is 109, and the patient's saturation is in the low-mid 90s. Etiologies of respiratory failure include resolving infection, fluid overload, and atelectasis.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has a mildly elevated white blood cell count (20K). He is afebrile overnight, and cultures are negative for growth.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor. He was transferred to the ICU due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site, along with febrile and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes seizure activity related to the brain tumor, severe hypoxic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, hypercalcemia, metabolic alkalosis, MDS, and a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, and gout.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: The patient is at risk for recurrent seizures due to the presence of a brain tumor and hemorrhage.
2. Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience further deterioration in respiratory function if not properly managed and weaned off the ventilator.
3. Leukocytosis: There is a possibility of infection due to elevated white blood cell count, despite being afebrile.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient may continue to have elevated calcium levels, which can lead to complications such as renal dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Metabolic Alkalosis/Volume status: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may persist or worsen if fluid and electrolyte imbalances are not corrected.
6. MDS: The patient's underlying MDS may lead to"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor. He was admitted to the ICU due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site, fever, and hypoxia resulting in respiratory failure. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory support: The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a PS of 10, PEEP of 8, FiO2 of 50%, and RSBI at 64. His oxygen saturation is in the low-mid 90s.
- Neurological status: The patient's mental status has improved since yesterday, and he is expected to undergo an EEG soon. He will be started on Keppra 500mg PO BID and may require neurosurgery this week for biopsy/evaluation of intracranial tumor.
- Hematology: The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 20K. He also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 40. There is a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and the patient is HIT positive, so all heparin products have been held.
- Metabolic alkalosis/volume status: The patient is suspected to have metabolic alkalosis, possibly due to diuresis or suctioning. Fluids are being held, and KCl 40mEq IV"

   Assessment and Plan
   80yo gentleman with h/o MDS and known brain tumor transferred to [**Hospital1 54**]
   in the setting of recent hemorrhage near tumor site, found to be
   febrile and hypoxic with respiratory failure.
   # Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: Seizure most
   likely related to brain tumor and hemorrhage as blood can act as an
   acute irritant, CT showed no progression or interval change of tumor.
   No seizures since episode two days ago. D/c
ed phenytoin as drug can
   suppress bone marrow.  Mental status improving although slightly
   somnolent likely due to Keppra.
   - f/u EEG read
   - Keppra 500mg PO BID. Will increase 250mg per day in divided doses to
   reach a goal of 1000mg. Will increase to 625mg PO BID today.  And to
   750mg PO BID tomorrow.
   - Possible Neurosurgery this week (Thursday) for biopsy/evaluation of
   intracranial tumor. Will f/u with Neurosurg.
   - Neuro-oncologist ([**Doctor Last Name 540**]) following
   - Will keep Plts > 100K for surgery
   - transfuse to keep platelets > 50 (s/p 8 units platelets total during
   admission)
   - monitor Q4H neuro exam
   # Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Low O2 on SBT yesterday. Current
   settings: CPAP/PSV PS 5 PEEP5 FiO2 50%; RSBI at 0400 of 109; sat
ing in
   low-mid 90
s. No new ABG. Etiologies of respiratory failure include
   resolving infection vs fluid overload vs atelectasis.  LVEF 60%.
   Diuresed .210L negative yesterday. Neg 4.7 Liters during LOS. Original
   intubation date per OSH records appears to be [**9-25**] although still
   remains unclear.
   - Continue to wean vent with trial of SBT today. Will obtain post ABG.
   - Continue tx of PNA as discussed below
   - F/u OSH records with regards to intubation date. Will consider Trach
   if fails SBT.
   - Will diurese with lasix and KCl PRN, will keep patient
s fluid status
   even.
   - note that pt has h/o DVT, though no DVTs on this admission.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC mildly elevated (20K). Afebrile O/N. Resp Culture:
   MRSA. Elevated vanc level. Blood and urine Cx negative for growth.
   - D/c
ed vanc IV as levels are elevated, will follow levels. f/u vanco
   levels daily and give when level is within therapeutic range.
   - Continue cipro (day #8; continue for 8-10d); will d/c today
   - OSH records positive for Cdiff and will continue to treat with vanc
   PO until one week after antibiotics are complete
   #Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium during admission; PTH WNL. Most likely
   etiology includes humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy as involvement of
   bone is unlikely.
   -f/u with daily calcium.
   # Acid Base Status/Volume status: ABG c/w metabolic alkalosis with
   respiratory acidosis. Alkalosis likely [**1-26**] contraction alkalosis (eg:
   diuresis or suctioning). Diuresed with negative .210L yesterday.
   Holding fluids.
   - D/c
ed lasix standing and will dose PRN; will keep I/Os negative to
   1L.
   - KCl 40mEq IV doses as needed to encourage further secretion of
   bicarbonate from kidneys.
   - TF Free water flushes-30cc
   # MDS: low plt this am. Ordered for 1u platelets. s/p 8 units platelets
   during admission.
   - goal to transfuse for Hct < 25 or Platelets < 50; follow up plt this
   am after transfusion.
   - type and screen, consented for blood
   - Holding all Heparin Products given pt it HIT +
   - Follow-up Serotonin Release Antibody
   # CAD s/p CABG; HTN; Dyslipidemia: LVEF 60%
   - hold ASA given head bleed
   - Statin
   - Holding beta blocker as heart rate is now controlled.
   - Has not tolerated ACE I in past due to hyperkalemia
   # h/o DVT:
   - pneumoboots. no anticoagulation given intracranial bleeding.
   # AFib:
   - Rate controled with beta blocker
   - No ASA or coumadin
   # Hyperglycemia: Was on SSI at OSH but does not carry Dx of diabetes.
   - cover with SSI but discontinue if sugars are low
   # Sacral Wound:
   - Wound care consult
 following recommendations.
   - Nystatin as it appears to have fungal component
   # Gout: Stable
   - Cont Allopurinol

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor who was transferred to the hospital due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site. The patient presented with fever and hypoxia, resulting in respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has also been diagnosed with seizures, leukocytosis, hypercalcemia, metabolic alkalosis, and a sacral wound infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: The patient's seizure activity is likely related to the brain tumor and the associated hemorrhage. If the hemorrhage worsens or if there is further tumor progression, it could lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological deterioration.
2. Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a critical concern. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to the risk of further hypoxia and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count indicates an ongoing infection. Failure to control the infection could result in sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient's high calcium levels can lead to various complications, including renal dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, and increased risk of infections.
5. Metabolic Alkalosis/Volume status"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and known brain tumor who was admitted to the ICU due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site. The patient presented with fever and hypoxia, resulting in respiratory failure.

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions including seizure/brain tumor with parietal hemorrhagic lesion, severe hypoxic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, hypercalcemia, metabolic alkalosis/volume status, MDS, CAD s/p CABG; HTN; Dyslipidemia, h/o DVT, AFib, hyperglycemia, sacral wound, gout, GERD, and FEN.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: Phenytoin was discontinued as it can suppress bone marrow. The patient's mental status has improved since yesterday. An EEG will be obtained, and Keppra will be started at 500mg PO BID. Possible neurosurgery this week for biopsy/evaluation of intracranial tumor is planned.

2. Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) two days ago. The ventilator settings were changed to CPAP/PSV mode. RSBI was 64 at 0400, and the patient was saturating in the"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, pneumonia, seizures, PVC (presumably premature ventricular contractions), CVA (cerebrovascular accident), CNS mass, and fluid balance issues. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been intubated. If there is a deterioration in respiratory function, it may be necessary to consider tracheostomy if extubation is not possible.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. It is important to complete the course of antimicrobials to treat the infection.
3. Seizures: Although no further evidence of seizures was found, the patient is currently on anticonvulsants. Monitoring and evaluating the need for continued seizure prophylaxis will be essential.
4. PVCs: The presence of new PVCs indicates arrhythmias. Close monitoring and management of electrolyte imbalances (particularly calcium and magnesium) are necessary to maintain potassium levels above 4.0.
5. CVA/Cerebral event: The patient has experienced a cerebrovascular accident, and ongoing neurological monitoring is crucial. Physical therapy and rehabilitation may be required post-ICU stay.
6. CNS mass: A CNS mass has been identified, and biopsy results are pending. Further evaluation and management will depend on the pathology report.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. They have been diagnosed with respiratory failure and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 112/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, sedatives, and anticonvulsants. The medical team is closely monitoring the patient's fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and laboratory results. The patient's condition remains unstable, and the healthcare team is working towards weaning the patient off mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. The healthcare team is implementing measures such as elevating the head of the bed, performing regular mouth care, and monitoring the respiratory system's breathing index to reduce the risk of VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of blood clots. The healthcare team is providing prophylactic measures, including the use of compression stockings and systemic anticoagulation.
3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures can increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections. The healthcare team is taking appropriate precautions to"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known brain tumor. He was transferred to the hospital due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site, and upon admission, he was found to be febrile and hypoxic with respiratory failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in mental status.

Medical Complications:
1. Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: The patient had a seizure likely related to the brain tumor and hemorrhage. Phenytoin was discontinued as it can suppress bone marrow. Keppra (levetiracetam) was started and the dosage will be increased gradually.

2. Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced low oxygen saturation during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday. Current settings on the ventilator include CPAP/PSV, PS 5, PEEP 5, FiO2 50%. RSBI is at 109, and the patient's oxygen saturation is in the low-mid 90s. No new arterial blood gas (ABG) results are available. Possible etiologies of respiratory failure include resolving infection, fluid overload, or atelectasis.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has a mildly elevated white blood cell count (20K). He is afebrile overnight, and cultures are negative for growth."

   Assessment and Plan
   80yo gentleman with h/o MDS and known unspecified brain tumor
   transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] in the setting of recent hemorrhage near tumor
   site, found to be febrile and hypoxic with respiratory failure.
   # Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: Seizure most
   likely related to brain tumor and hemorrhage as blood can act as an
   acute irritant, CT post-seizure showed no progression or interval
   change of tumor. No seizures since episode three days ago. Mental
   status improving although slightly somnolent likely due to Keppra.
   Titrated up Keppra yest.
   - f/u EEG read

   Etiologies of respiratory failure include resolving infection vs fluid
   overload vs atelectasis.  LVEF 60%. Diuresed .860L negative yesterday.
   Neg 6.4 Liters during LOS. Original intubation date per OSH records
   appears to be [**9-25**] although still remains unclear.

   - OSH records positive for Cdiff and will continue to treat with vanc
   PO until next Monday (one week after end of IV antibiotics) after
   antibiotics are complete
   #Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium during admission; PTH WNL. Most likely
   etiology includes humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy as involvement of
   bone is unlikely.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxic respiratory failure. There is a concern about weaning off the ventilator, and tracheostomy may be considered after neurosurgery.

2. Infection: The patient has been febrile and has shown signs of infection, including leukocytosis and a positive MRSA culture. Antibiotics have been initiated, but there is a borderline elevated vancomycin level, which requires close monitoring.

3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated calcium levels, most likely due to humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Daily calcium follow-up is recommended.

4. Acid-Base Status/Volume Status: The patient has metabolic alkalosis with respiratory acidosis. This could be related to diuresis or suctioning. Fluid balance needs to be managed carefully.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 147. A free water deficit of 2.5L is present, and aggressive rehydration is necessary, especially after surgery.

6. MDS (Myelodysplastic Syndrome): The patient has a history of MDS and has received platelet transfusions during admission. Goal is to keep platelets above 100K for surgery.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and an unspecified brain tumor. He was transferred to the hospital due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site and presented with fever and respiratory failure. The patient's mental status has been improving, although he is still slightly somnolent. He is currently on Keppra, which is being titrated up. He is scheduled for neurosurgery today at 9:30 am for a biopsy/decompression of intracranial tumor. His platelet count is low, and he will receive two units of platelets before the surgery. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and previous failed weaning attempts indicate a potential risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and consideration for tracheostomy after neurosurgery may be necessary.
2. Leukocytosis: Although the white blood cell count has improved, the presence of leukocytosis suggests an ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is crucial.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient's elevated calcium levels require further evaluation and management. A follow-up with daily calcium levels is advised.
4. Acid-Base Status/Volume Status: The patient's ABG results indicate metabolic alkalosis with respiratory acidosis. Frequent assessment of electrolytes and fluid balance is necessary to prevent complications.

   R2 ADDENDUM:
   Patient is an 80 yo M with known brain mass, s/p hemorrhage, now
   intubated since [**2171-9-25**].  Today will go to OR with NS for biopsy and
   potential evacuation of hematoma.  Also plan on consulting IP for
   potential trache at bedside given ongoing vent dependence.
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxic respiratory failure. There is a concern for ongoing respiratory failure, especially considering the patient's history of infection, fluid overload, and atelectasis. Weaning attempts have failed so far.

2. Intracranial Bleeding: The patient has a known brain tumor and recent hemorrhage near the tumor site. There is a risk of further bleeding, especially during the planned neurosurgery for biopsy and decompression of the intracranial tumor.

3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia (high sodium levels) and hypercalcemia (high calcium levels). These imbalances need to be carefully managed, especially during and after surgery.

4. Infection: The patient has shown improvement in leukocytosis (high white blood cell count) and is no longer febrile. However, there is still a risk of infection, particularly with the presence of MRSA in the respiratory culture. Antibiotic treatment needs to be continued appropriately.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is positive for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). This means that heparin products should be avoided, and alternative anticoagulation strategies may be required.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They have a history of respiratory failure, pneumonia, and a CNS mass. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/59 mmHg to 126/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 498 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 47 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 186, and a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 100.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, and normal pupils without scleral edema or conjunctival pallor. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI) and heart sounds with no murmurs or abnormal splits. The patient's extremities are warm and without cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, oriented, and responding appropriately"

 HYPOXEMIA
   ICU Care
   Lines:
   PICC Line - [**2171-10-7**] 09:49 PM
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy and is currently in the ICU. The patient has a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and is experiencing hypoxemia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 107/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's physical examination reveals left-sided facial droop, ptosis, and flaccid left upper and lower extremities. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for pneumonia due to being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and frequent cultures should be done to detect any early signs of infection.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility, along with central venous catheters, increases the risk of developing DVT. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and surveillance duplex ultrasonography may be necessary to detect any thrombus formation.
3. Pressure Ulcers: Due to the patient's immobility, pressure ulcers can develop. Frequent"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known unspecified brain tumor. He was admitted to the hospital with recent hemorrhage near the tumor site. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxic respiratory failure. He also has an infection, which has been treated with antibiotics. The patient underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy with minimal decompression yesterday, and the post-operative CT scan showed no new changes in the lesion or new hemorrhaging. The patient's mental status is improving, and he is able to move his left lower extremity (LLE) and left upper extremity (LUE), compared to hemiplegia upon admission. 

Medical Complications:
1. Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation, requiring mechanical ventilation.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated calcium levels, likely due to humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy.
4. Acid-Base Status/Volume Status: The patient has metabolic alkalosis with respiratory acidosis.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels, indicating dehydration.
6. MDS: The patient has a history of myelodysplastic syndrome and has received platelet and red blood cell transfusions"

He was transferred to the hospital due to a hemorrhage near the tumor site and presented with severe hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 at 50%. He has failed spontaneous breathing trials three times. The patient's recent platelet count is 61, and he will receive a transfusion of platelets prior to surgery to maintain a level above 100,000. His electrolytes are within normal limits, but he has hypercalcemia, which is most likely caused by humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. The patient's acid-base status indicates metabolic alkalosis with respiratory acidosis. He has hypernatremia and will be given free water flushes post-surgery. The patient also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and hypertension (HTN). He is currently being treated for leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, and possible sacral wound infection. The patient's family has consented for the surgical placement of a tracheostomy due to the short neck preventing percutaneous tracheostomy.

   site, found to be febrile and hypoxic with respiratory failure.
   # Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: Seizure most
   likely related to brain tumor and hemorrhage as blood can act as an
   acute irritant, CT post-seizure showed no progression or interval
   change of tumor. No seizures since episode three days ago. Mental
   status improving although slightly somnolent likely due to Keppra.
   Titrated up Keppra yest.
   - f/u EEG read
   - Keppra 625mg PO BID. Will increase 250mg per day in divided doses to
   reach a goal of 1000mg. Will increase to 750mg PO BID today.
   - Neurosurgery today at 9:30am for biopsy/decompression of intracranial
   tumor; holding hep SC, NPO at MN, 2x6u plts ordered
   - Neuro-oncologist ([**Doctor Last Name 540**]) following
   - Will attempt to keep Plts > 100K for surgery
   - transfuse to keep platelets > 50 (s/p 8 units platelets total during
   admission)
   - monitor Q4H neuro exam
   # Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Low O2 on SBT yesterday. Current
   settings: CPAP/PSV PS 10 PEEP5 FiO2 50%; RSBI at 0400 of 109; sat
   in low-mid 90
s. ABG: metabolic alkalosis with respiratory acidosis.
   Etiologies of respiratory failure include resolving infection vs fluid
   overload vs atelectasis.  LVEF 60%. Diuresed .860L negative yesterday.
   Neg 6.4 Liters during LOS. Original intubation date per OSH records
   appears to be [**9-25**] although still remains unclear.
   - Wean attempts failed, consider trach after neurosurgery operation
   today.  D/w patient and family
   - D/c

   - Will diurese with lasix and KCl PRN, will keep patient
s fluid status
   neg 1L.
   - note that pt has h/o DVT, though no DVTs on this admission.
   # Leukocytosis: WBC improved from yest (20
17K). Afebrile O/N. Resp
   Culture:  MRSA. Borderline elevated vanc level at 23.4. Blood and urine
   Cx negative for growth.
   -  D/c
ed vanc IV as levels are elevated, will follow levels. Cipro
   d/c

   - OSH records positive for Cdiff and will continue to treat with vanc
   PO until next Monday (one week after end of IV antibiotics) after
   antibiotics are complete
   #Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium during admission; PTH WNL. Most likely
   etiology includes humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy as involvement of
   bone is unlikely.
   -f/u with daily calcium.
   # Acid Base Status/Volume status: ABG c/w metabolic alkalosis with
   respiratory acidosis. Alkalosis likely [**1-26**] contraction alkalosis (eg:
   diuresis or suctioning). Diuresed with negative .860L yesterday.
   Holding fluids.
   - D/c

   bicarbonate from kidneys.
   - TF Free water flushes-now at 30cc
   #Hypernatremia: Sodium at 147 today. Free water deficit 2.5L
   -          Increase TF free water flushes to 50cc? Will recheck lytes
   in pm and provide free water based on post-op lytes.
   # MDS: s/p 8 units platelets during admission.
   - goal to transfuse for Hct < 25 or Platelets < 50;
   - Will receive plts pre-operation today

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 24-year-old male who presented with a chief complaint of lightheadedness. He underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy and is currently in the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient has a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and is currently on multiple medications including Univasc, Celexa, and Heparin agents. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 107/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, but there is an abnormality in platelet count with a value of 61 K/uL.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 17.8 K/uL and slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) at 25.7%. The platelet count is also elevated at 61 K/uL. Other lab values including creatinine (Cr), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), glucose, and various electrolytes are within normal ranges.

The patient has been receiving multiple doses of antibiotics, specifically Ancef, and is also on furosemide (Lasix) infusion. 

The patient's physical examination reveals sinus bradycardia and an endotracheal tube in place for respiratory support"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a known unspecified brain tumor. He was transferred to the hospital due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site and presented with severe hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient is intubated since September 25th and failed spontaneous breathing trial three times. Current ventilator settings include CPAP/PSV with PS 10, PEEP 5, FiO2 50%. The patient has a positive fluid balance of 220cc yesterday, negative 5.2 liters during his LOS, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient underwent stereotactic brain biopsy with minimal decompression yesterday, and the post-operative CT shows no new changes in the lesion or new hemorrhaging. The patient experienced a seizure four days ago, likely related to the brain tumor and hemorrhage, but no seizures since then. He is currently on Keppra, and the dose will be increased to reach a goal of 1000mg.

The patient's white blood cell count improved from yesterday (17K/16). He is afebrile overnight, and the respiratory culture is positive for MRSA. Blood and urine cultures are negative for growth. Vancomycin was discontinued due to elevated levels, and the patient will continue to treat with oral vancomycin until next Monday.

   site, found to be febrile and hypoxic with respiratory failure.
   # Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: Seizure most
   likely related to brain tumor and hemorrhage as blood can act as an
   acute irritant, CT post-seizure showed no progression or interval
   change of tumor. No seizures since episode three days ago. Mental
   status improving although slightly somnolent likely due to Keppra.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and an unspecified brain tumor who was transferred to the hospital due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site. He presented with fever and respiratory failure. The patient has been treated for seizures, severe hypoxic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, hypercalcemia, acid-base status/volume status, hypernatremia, MDS, CAD with CABG, hypertension, dyslipidemia, h/o DVT, atrial fibrillation, hyperglycemia, sacral wound, gout, GERD, and FEN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: There is a risk of recurrent seizures due to the brain tumor and hemorrhage. Monitoring for any changes in mental status or neurological symptoms is essential.
2. Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress, leading to further compromise in oxygenation and ventilation. Close monitoring of vital signs and respiratory parameters is necessary.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection. Continuous monitoring for signs of infection and adjustment of antibiotic therapy may be required.
4. Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium levels can lead to renal dysfunction and cardiac complications. Regular monitoring of calcium levels and appropriate management are crucial.
5. Acid-Base Status/"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient underwent neurosurgery for a brain biopsy and unsuccessful evacuation of a brain hematoma. There has been some improvement since admission, with the ability to move the left arm and somewhat the left leg. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, pneumonia, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and thrombocytopenia. The patient is also overweight, obese, and has a PEG tube in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 120/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, and anticoagulants. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation. Tracheostomy tube placement and slow weaning from the ventilator are planned to address this issue.
2. Brain Mass/Glioma: The presence of a brain mass or glioma could potentially lead to increased intracranial pressure, seizures, or neurological deficits.
3. Pneumonia: Although the patient has completed an antimicrobial course, there is still a risk of pneumonia recurrence due to the patient's immunocompromised state and"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. They have undergone neurosurgery for a brain biopsy and unsuccessful evacuation of a brain hematoma. There has been some improvement in their condition since admission, as they are now able to move their left arm and leg somewhat. The patient has a history of allergies to Univasc (moexipril Hcl) and Celexa (citalopram hydrobromide). They also have unknown heparin agents and light-headedness. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including furosemide (Lasix) and other ICU medications. 

The patient's medical history, social history, review of systems, and physical examination findings are all documented in the note. They have several comorbidities and have experienced various medical events since admission. The patient's vital signs and flowsheet data, including hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results, are also provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is experiencing persistent respiratory failure and requires ongoing mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory infections due to their critically ill state and prolonged intubation.
2. Neurological Complications: The patient has a brain tumor (glioma) and has undergone neurosurgical intervention"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a brain tumor, who was admitted to the ICU due to severe hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent a tracheostomy with mild bleeding and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has had multiple medical complications including seizures, hypercalcemia, C. difficile infection, hypernatremia, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient's current medications include lasix, KCl, Keppra, and vanc PO. He also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous CABG, atrial fibrillation (AFib), hyperglycemia, gout, GERD, and potential familial hypertriglyceridemia (FEN). The patient's family has consented for blood product transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures related to his brain tumor. It is important to monitor for any signs of seizure activity and continue antiepileptic medication as prescribed.
2. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated calcium levels, which may be due to humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. It is important to monitor calcium levels and provide appropriate treatment.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient has tested positive for C. difficile. Treatment should continue with vancom"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a brain tumor, possibly a low-grade glioma. He was transferred to the ICU due to a recent hemorrhage near the tumor site. The patient has been febrile and hypoxic with respiratory failure. He underwent a tracheostomy with mild bleeding and is currently tolerating it well. His respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV with PS 10, PEEP 5, and FiO2 50%. The patient's blood pressure is low, and he has a negative fluid balance. He has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but no DVTs during this admission.

Medical Complications:
1. Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to resolving infection, fluid overload, or atelectasis. The findings on the chest X-ray from yesterday support this.
2. Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: The patient had a stereotactic brain biopsy with minimal decompression, and the post-op CT showed no new changes in the lesion or new hemorrhaging. Preliminary findings indicate a low-grade glioma. The patient has not had any seizures since the episode five days ago, and his mental status is improving along with his motor exam.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, pneumonia, CNS mass, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nutritional support, hypernatremia, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, VAP, CVA, and a history of CABG. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation via a tracheostomy tube. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient already has respiratory failure, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory function if not properly managed.

2. Pneumonia: Although the patient has completed a course of antibiotics, there is still a risk of complications such as infection spread, sepsis, or development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

3. CNS mass: The presence of a CNS mass indicates a risk of neurological deterioration or seizures.

4. Thrombocytopenia: With low platelet counts, there is a risk of bleeding or bruising.

5. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels may lead to fatigue, weakness, or difficulty in oxygen delivery to tissues.

6. Nutritional support: Poor nutritional status can impact overall recovery and increase the risk of infections and delayed wound healing.

7. Hypernatremia: High sodium levels can cause dehydration, neurological symptoms, or cardiac arrhythmias.

8. Impaired skin integrity: Pressure ulcers or skin breakdown"

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient was admitted with pneumonia and is now tolerating mechanical ventilation via a new tracheostomy. 

The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a central nervous system mass. The anemia and thrombocytopenia are attributed to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The patient has completed an antibiotic course for pneumonia and is currently being monitored for any seizures due to the CNS mass. 

The patient also has a history of HIT+ (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), so they are avoiding heparin. Nutritional support is being provided through total parenteral nutrition (TF) via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/56 to 124/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's lab results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. However, their creatinine level is slightly elevated at 1.3 mg/dL. Other lab values, including electrolytes and liver function tests, are within normal ranges. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress or signs of abuse. The cardiovascular and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and brain tumor, who was transferred to the ICU for severe hypoxic respiratory failure. He underwent a tracheostomy with mild bleeding, and his respiratory support is currently set to CPAP/PSV mode with PS 10, PEEP 5, FiO2 50%. The patient's mental status is improving, and he can move both lower extremities and upper extremities, showing improvement from being hemiplegic upon admission. The patient's blood work shows elevated calcium levels, metabolic alkalosis with respiratory acidosis, hypernatremia, and mild anemia. He also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), gout, and possible gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to an infection, and there is a risk of developing pneumonia, especially with the use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has a negative fluid balance, but there is still a risk of fluid overload due to ongoing losses and the need for careful fluid management.
3. Atelectasis: The patient's current ventilator settings and previous chest X-ray findings suggest the possibility of atelectasis, which could contribute to respiratory failure.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a brain tumor, admitted to the ICU for severe hypoxic respiratory failure. He underwent a tracheostomy and is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation with FiO2 50%. The patient also had a seizure/brain tumor with a parietal hemorrhagic lesion, for which he underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy with minimal decompression. His mental status has improved, and he is able to move his left upper and lower extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial admission was due to severe hypoxic respiratory failure. There is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure, especially if the underlying cause such as infection, fluid overload, or atelectasis is not adequately addressed.
2. C. difficile Infection: The patient's OSH records show positive results for C. difficile, indicating a potential ongoing infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or complications related to C. difficile.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated calcium levels, which may be due to humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Regular monitoring of calcium levels is necessary to prevent complications such as kidney stones, bone demineralization, and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Acid-Base Imbalance: The patient has metabolic alkalosis with respiratory acidosis, likely due to diuresis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of chronic respiratory failure, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and thrombocytopenia. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and other medical conditions. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/42 mmHg to 122/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,215 mL, including 602 mL of PO, 885 mL of TF, 534 mL of IVF, and 426 mL of blood products. The output consists of 3,245 mL of urine and 570 mL of NG. The patient's labs reveal hyponatremia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is also diagnosed with pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, and hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia acquired through mechanical ventilation (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia or VAP) increases the risk of respiratory complications, such as worsening hypoxemia and sepsis.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity puts him at risk for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a brain tumor (possible low-grade glioma) who was transferred to the hospital due to a recent hemorrhage near the tumor site. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which may be due to resolving infection, fluid overload, or atelectasis as indicated by findings on the chest X-ray. The patient has had a tracheostomy and is tolerating it well.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a brain tumor, who was admitted to the ICU for severe hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy and decompression of a parietal hemorrhagic lesion, which was found to be a low-grade glioma. The patient's mental status has improved, and there is improvement in motor exam as well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has received a total of 13 units of platelets during admission. Neurosurgery has requested to keep the platelet count above 50 for three days post-procedure. The patient's platelet count remains low.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient's stool culture tested positive for C. difficile, and he is being treated with vancomycin orally until next Monday.
3. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium level is elevated, and the likely etiology is humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. The patient will be followed up with daily calcium levels and outpatient treatment.
4. Acid-base status/volume status: The patient has metabolic alkalosis with respiratory acidosis. The alkalosis is likely due to diuresis or suctioning. The patient's fluid status is negative 1 liter.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated at 147, with a free water deficit of"

   stereotactic brain biopsy with minimal decompression, post-op CT shows
   no new changes in lesion and no new hemorrhage prelim finding of low
   grade glioma. No seizures since episode approx. 1 week ago, now on
   Keppra. Mental status improving with improvement in his motor exam as
   patient is able to move LLE and LUE compared to hemiplegia upon
   admission.
   - Keppra 1000mg PO BID.
   - D/C
d dressing today; remove suture in 10days from op ([**10-26**]) in

   # C.Diff: OSH records positive for Cdiff WBC trending down. Afebrile.
   No abdominal pain. Rectal tube in place.
   Stopped PO Vanco [**10-20**]. C. diff negative and off Abx x 5 days
   #Hypercalcemia: Elevated calcium during admission; PTH WNL. Most likely
   etiology includes humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy as involvement of
   bone is unlikely.
   -f/u with daily calcium.
   -Will defer to outpatient treatment.
   # Acid Base Status/Volume status: Pt negative 9 liters during LOS with
   bump in creatinine and increase bicarb. Clinically hypovolemic this am
   - will keep even for now, avoid diuresis today.
   #Hypernatremia: Sodium at 150 today.
   -          Increased free water flushes to 150cc

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a brain tumor (possible low-grade glioma). He was transferred to the ICU due to recent hemorrhage near the tumor site, along with fever and respiratory failure. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be managed:

1. Severe Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is on CPAP/PSV support and tolerating it well. He has completed an antibiotic course for pneumonia and is being weaned off the tracheostomy collar.

2. Seizure/Brain Tumor with Parietal Hemorrhagic Lesion: The patient underwent stereotactic brain biopsy with minimal decompression, and the post-op CT showed no new changes in the lesion or hemorrhage. He is now on Keppra for seizure management, and his mental status and motor exam have improved.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff): The patient has tested positive for C. diff, but is afebrile and not experiencing abdominal pain. The rectal tube is in place, and the patient was previously on vancomycin but has now stopped due to being C. diff negative and off antibiotics for 5 days.

4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated calcium levels, most likely due to humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Outpatient treatment will be deferred.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a brain tumor, who was admitted to the ICU due to severe hypoxic respiratory failure. He underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy and decompression for a parietal hemorrhagic lesion, which was found to be a low-grade glioma. The patient's mental status and motor exam have improved, and he is now able to move his left lower extremity. He is currently on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis. Other medical issues include hypercalcemia, possible C. difficile infection, hypernatremia, acid-base status/volume status imbalance, MDS with low platelets and hematocrit, suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), history of coronary artery disease with previous CABG, hypertension, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT), gout, GERD, and potential sacral wound infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has had severe hypoxic respiratory failure in the past and may be at risk for further respiratory complications.
2. Seizures: Although the patient's seizures have been controlled with Keppra, there is still a risk of seizure recurrence.
3. Infection: The patient has shown signs of possible C. difficile infection and may be prone to other infections due to his"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), chronic thrombocytopenia, chronic respiratory failure, and pneumonia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and hemorrhagic stroke. The patient is currently being treated for hypernatremia, hypoxemia, and other conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have an elevated heart rate and low oxygen saturation. The patient's lab results show elevated levels of sodium, potassium, and white blood cell count. The patient is receiving nutrition through an impact tube and has multiple IV lines. The patient's disposition is planned for rehabilitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure and is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). This indicates an increased risk for developing pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Stroke: The patient has a history of hemorrhagic stroke, which increases the risk for further neurological complications.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has chronic thrombocytopenia, which increases the risk for bleeding complications.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's lab results show elevated levels of sodium and potassium. Electrolyte imbalances can lead to various complications such as cardiac arrhythmias"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a brain tumor (possible low-grade glioma). He was transferred to the ICU in the setting of recent hemorrhage near the tumor site, and was found to be febrile and hypoxic with respiratory failure. The patient has undergone several procedures and interventions, including tracheostomy, stereotactic brain biopsy with minimal decompression, and removal of rectal tube.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- He is awake, alert, and non-verbal as intubated, following commands, and lying in bed.
- He has left eye ptosis and left-sided facial droop.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 121/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.
- He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 467 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
- His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, and hypercalcemia.
