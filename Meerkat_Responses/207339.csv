","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name 8194] is a 54-year-old female with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from upper GI arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), extensive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, diabetes mellitus (DM), asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypertension (HTN), chronic pain, delayed gastric emptying, and hypercholesterolemia. She presents with dark stools, lightheadedness, and decreased hematocrit, indicating recurrent GIB. She has received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K to reverse her Coumadin/INR. A gastrointestinal consult is requested, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) will be performed today. She is to be maintained with adequate access and active total body sodium (T+S) at all times. Lasix, beta-blockers (BB), isosorbide, and lisinopril are to be held. She is to be counseled to floor post-EGD.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute on Chronic Blood Loss Anemia: likely due to repeat upper GI bleeding from AVMs.
2. Hx DVT: Coumadin reversed, IVC filter in place, no anticoagulation for now.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from upper gastrointestinal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), diabetes mellitus (DM), asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypertension (HTN), chronic pain, delayed gastric emptying, and hypercholesterolemia. The patient presents with dark stools, lightheadedness, and decreased hematocrit, concerning for recurrent GIB. She has received one unit fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K in the emergency department to reverse her Coumadin/INR. The plan includes consulting with gastroenterology, transfusing 2 units packed red blood cells (pRBCs) tonight, checking hemoglobin concentration every 8 hours, maintaining adequate access and active temperature surveillance, reversing Coumadin in the emergency department, and holding specific medications. The patient also has a history of DVT, asthma, OSA, DM, HTN, chronic pain, delayed gastric emptying, and hypercholesterolemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Rebleeding: The patient's history of recurrent GIB indicates a high risk for rebleeding, which can lead to further anemia and instability.
2. Thromboembolic events: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently receiving Coumadin for anticoagulation. Dis"

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of multiple upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to arteriovenous malformations in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum. She also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has been treated with coumadin and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient presents today with dark stool and lightheadedness, which could be indicative of orthostatic hypotension. Her hemoglobin level was 7.3 in the physician's office, and her INR was 2.5. The patient's blood pressure was 110/60 while sitting. In the emergency department, her blood pressure was normal, and her heart rate was 56 beats per minute. Her oxygen saturation was 97% with supplemental oxygen. The patient's stools were guaiac positive, indicating the presence of blood. A nasogastric (NG) tube and lavage were performed, and the results were clear. The patient received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K. An abdominal CT scan was negative, showing no acute process. The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU).

During her stay in the MICU, the patient required 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to ongoing bleeding. Her hemoglobin level increased from 23% to 29%, and her INR decreased from 2."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8194**] is a 54 year old female with hx GIB from Upper GI AVM's,
   w/ multiple GI studies, on coumadin for extensive DVT s/p IVC filter,
   DM, Asthma, OSA who presents with 2 days of dark stools,
   lightheadedness, decreased HCT concerning for recurrent GIB.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Blood Loss anemia: likely due to repeat upper GI
   bleeding from AVMs as has had recurrent GIB from AVM's in the past. BP
   stable, HR stable but on BB at home. She has now received one unit FFP
   and Vit K 10mg in the ED to reverse her coumadin/INR. Concern for
   hereditary telangiectasias are raised such as Osler-[**Doctor Last Name 643**]-Rendu
   syndrome.
   -- appreciate GI consult
   -- pt is s/p 2u pRBC w appropriate rise in HCT
   -- plan for EGD today
   -- maintain adequte access (2 PIVs) and active T+S at all times
   -- coumadin reversed in ED, INR now 1.6
   -- hold lasix, BB, isosorbide, lisinopril
   -- c/o to floor s/p EGD
   .
   # Hx DVT:
   -- coumadin reversed in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] be difficult to anticoagulate in near

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old female with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) from upper GI arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), diabetes mellitus (DM), asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypertension (HTN), chronic pain, delayed gastric emptying, and hypercholesterolemia. She presents with dark stools, lightheadedness, and decreased hematocrit, concerning for recurrent GIB. The patient has received one unit fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K to reverse her Coumadin/INR. She has also undergone two units packed red blood cells (pRBCs) transfusion with an appropriate rise in hematocrit. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) has been planned for today. The patient's Coumadin has been reversed in the emergency department, and her INR is now 1.6. Lasix, beta-blockers, isosorbide, and lisinopril have been held. The patient is to be sent to the floor post-EGD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to upper GI AVMs.
2. Risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to her history of DVT and the presence of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter.
3. Hypotension"
