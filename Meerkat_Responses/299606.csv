   STEMI without intervention now transferred to ICU for hypotension.
   Hypotension:
   Hypotensive on the floor. Mentating well. Etiology is likely
   hypovolemia given hct hemoconcentrated on admission and JVP is down
   even when lying flat. Less likely are medication effect (got metoprolol
   and lisinopril), sepsis (low grade fever/leukocytosis), cardiogenic
   shock given likely anterior MI on EKG and apical akinesis.
   - discontinue dopamine and switch to neosynephrine
   - start low dose metoprolol 25mg lopressor
   - continue maintainence fluids at 150cc/hour. Patient s/p fluid
   resucitation
   - continue to hold lisinoprol
   - continue levofloxacin for presumed UTI (day 1: [**3-7**]),
   - f/u urine and blood cultures
   - PICC line for central access
   STEMI/CAD:
   Patient had STE in anterior distribution V2-V4 now with evolution to
   TWI in same distribution likely of distal LAD. No reciprical changes.
   Positive Troponins and CK peak 1500 in setting of being down which
   could represent mild element of rhabdomyolysis.
   - continue telemetry
   - patient does not want cardiac catherization.
   - continue full strength asa, high dose statin
   - restart metoprolol
   - will consider adding back ACEI once BP improves
   Leukocytosis: resolved
   WBC of 14 on admit, 10.5 today, no localizing signs of infection. most
   likely related to MI and hemoconcentration on admission
   - f/i urine and blood cultures

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension following a STEMI. She has a history of hypertension and is being treated with dopamine for hypotension. Her vital signs show a low blood pressure and normal heart rate. She has a decreased hemoglobin level, likely due to hemoconcentration on admission. The patient's EKG indicates an anterior MI, and she has apical akinesis. She is also experiencing leukocytosis, which is resolving, and anemia with a decreased hemoglobin level. The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40-50% and is on outpatient lasix. She has a history of GERD and macular degeneration in her left eye. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is currently on cardiac diet with repletion of electrolytes as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Anemia: The patient's decreased hemoglobin level may result in reduced oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia.
3. STEMI/CAD: The patient's anterior MI with evolution to TWI suggests ongoing myocardial ischemia, which can lead to further damage to the heart muscle if not promptly treated.
4. Leukocytosis: Although resolving, the elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation, which needs to be closely monitored.
5. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's ejection fraction of 40-50% indicates impaired cardiac function, which can lead to fluid overload and pulmonary congestion if not managed properly.
6. Macular degeneration: The patient's existing macular degeneration in her left eye may worsen or progress, potentially affecting her vision.
7. GERD: The patient's GERD symptoms may be exacerbated due to the ICU environment and medications, leading to complications such as aspiration pneumonia.
8. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization in the ICU, and appropriate prophylaxis should be continued.
9. VAP: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a potential complication in mechanically ventilated patients, and the patient's risk should be minimized through proper oral hygiene and weaning from the ventilator when appropriate."

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   [**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o HTN presented to after being found down admitted with
   STEMI without intervention now transferred to ICU for hypotension.
   .
   1. Hypotension:
   Patient had low blood pressures on the floor, although she continues to
   mentate appropriately. Etiology of her hypotension is unclear.
   Differential diagnosis includes medication effect, cardiogenic shock,
   sepsis, and dehydration. Regarding medication effect, patient did
   receive 12.5mg metoprolol which is a new medication, in addition to
   lisinopril 20mg daily this morning. It is somewhat unlikely that 12.5mg
   metoprolol is the primary cause of her hypotension, given that 12.5mg
   metoprolol is a relatively small dose and patient is not bradycardic.
   Regarding cardiogenic shock, it does appear that patient had an
   anterior MI given the dynamic changes on her electrocardiogram and
   evidence of apical akinesis, although her extremities are warm and she
   continues to mentate well. Regarding sepsis, patient has no localizing
   evidence of infection and recent UA was consistent with hematuria and
   had no bacteria. Regarding dehydration, patient has had decreased PO
   intake over the last 48-72 hours in the setting of being found down.
   She also had a recent fall, although we have no evidence of bleeding at
   this time. No evidence of tamponade on recent echocardiogram.
   - hold antihypertensive medications for now
   - will follow-up with cardiology regarding need for cardiac
   catheterization; given that she has no symptoms at this time, would
   hold off on cardiac catheterization at this time
   - will follow-up with patient and son regarding aggressive
   interventions at this time and code status
   - 1L NS bolus
   - send UA and urine cultures
   - send blood cultures
   - will treat presumptively for UTI with levofloxacin

   Patient had STE in anterior distribution V2-V4 now with evolution to
   TWI in same distribution likely of distal LAD. No reciprical changes.
   Positive Troponins and CK peak 1500 in setting of being down which
   could represent mild element of rhabdomyolysis.
   - continue to monitor on tele
   - consider cath if patient is amenable
   - continue full strength asa, high dose statin
   - will consider adding back ACEI and beta blocker once BP improves
   .
   3. Pump:
   Patient is slightly hypovolemic. EF 40-50%. On 20mg lasix as
   outpatient.
   - continue IVF to bolus of 1L
   - monitor on daily I/Os, daily weights
   - hold diuresis
   .
   4. Rhythm:
   Patient is in NSR with a normal rate.
   - monitor on tele
   - monitor daily EKGs or based on changing clinical status
   .
   5. Leukocytosis:
   Patient admitted with WBC of 14, now down to 11 but she is afebrile
   without localizing signs of infection. Etiology is most likely related
   to MI.
   - send urine and blood cultures
   - f/u CXR

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital after being found down. She was admitted with a STEMI and is now in the ICU for hypotension. The patient's blood pressure is low, but she remains alert and oriented. She has received medications including metoprolol and lisinopril, which may contribute to her hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure needs to be addressed promptly to ensure adequate organ perfusion. The underlying cause of her hypotension requires further investigation.
2. STEMI/CAD: The patient had a STEMI in the anterior distribution of V2-V4, which evolved into TWI in the same distribution likely due to distal LAD involvement. Positive troponins and a peak CK level of 1500 indicate myocardial injury. Continuous monitoring and consideration for cardiac catheterization are necessary.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Doing better o/n.  Dopamine weaned down. Afebrile, feels well
   Physical Examination
   JVP 6-7
   syst ejection murmur
   clear lungs
   no pedal edema
   Medical Decision Making
   #anterior STEMI: medical management according with the patient's
   wishes.  Continue ASA, Plavix, statin
   # hypotension: dehydration+probable slight LVOT obstruction from
   hyperdynamic basal segments.  Will stop dopamine, hydrate, give beta
   blockade and low-dose phenylephrine if needed, to keep MAP>55 mmHg.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital after being found down and was admitted with a STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction). She is now in the ICU due to hypotension. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 88/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40-50%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential inadequate blood flow to vital organs. Immediate management includes fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
2. STEMI/CAD: The patient had a STEMI in the anterior distribution of V2-V4 leads, which suggests involvement of the left anterior descending artery. This can lead to complications such as myocardial ischemia, ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's peak CK level of 1500 indicates a possible element of rhabdomyolysis, especially considering she was found down. This condition can lead to acute kidney injury if not managed promptly.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient initially had leukocytosis, which has now"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   [**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o HTN presented to after being found down admitted with
   STEMI without intervention now transferred to ICU for hypotension.
   Hypotension:
   Hypotensive on the floor. Mentating well. Etiology is likely
   hypovolemia given hct hemoconcentrated on admission and JVP is down
   even when lying flat. Less likely are medication effect (got metoprolol
   and lisinopril), sepsis (low grade fever/leukocytosis), cardiogenic
   shock given likely anterior MI on EKG and apical akinesis. Hypotesion
   improved with IVf and she was weaned off pressors, now off x 15 hours.
   - IVF bolus prn symptomatic hypotension, but currently asymptomatic and
   normotensive
   - continue to hold lisinopril
   - f/u urine and blood cultures, all NGTD
   STEMI/CAD:
   Patient had STE in anterior distribution V2-V4 now with evolution to
   TWI in same distribution likely of distal LAD. No reciprical changes.
   Positive Troponins and CK peak 1500 in setting of being down which
   could represent mild element of rhabdomyolysis.
   - continue telemetry
   - patient does not want cardiac catherization.
   - continue full strength asa, high dose statin
   - could consider restart low dose metoprolol but HR controlled in
   50s-60s, 40s when sleeping
   - will consider adding back ACEI once BP improves
   Leukocytosis: resolved
   WBC of 14 on admit, 10.5 today, no localizing signs of infection. most
   likely related to MI and hemoconcentration on admission
   - f/i urine and blood cultures
   - levofloxacin discontinued since no s/s infection and cx no growth
   - f/u final cx data
   Chronic systolic heart failure:
   Patient is hypovolemic. EF 40-50%. On 20mg lasix as outpatient.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented with a STEMI and was found to be hypotensive. The patient's hypotension is likely due to hypovolemia, as indicated by a concentrated hemoglobin level on admission and a low jugular venous pressure (JVP). Other possible causes such as medication effect, sepsis, or cardiogenic shock have been ruled out. The patient's blood pressure has improved with intravenous fluids and she has been weaned off the pressors. 

The patient also had a STEMI in the anterior distribution of the heart, specifically in the V2-V4 leads, with subsequent involvement of the TWI in the same distribution, likely due to distal left anterior descending artery (LAD) involvement. The patient's troponin levels are positive and the peak creatine kinase (CK) is 1500, which could indicate mild rhabdomyolysis. 

The patient does not want cardiac catheterization, so the plan is to continue with full-strength aspirin and a high-dose statin. Low-dose metoprolol will be considered but the patient's heart rate is currently controlled in the 50s-60s, especially while sleeping. Once the blood pressure improves, an ACE inhibitor may be added back in. 

Leukocytosis has resolved and there are no localizing signs of infection. This is most likely related to the recent myocard"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension who was initially admitted for a STEMI without intervention. She was transferred to the ICU due to hypotension, which has now resolved. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/43 mmHg to 125/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the addition of hypotension and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which was likely due to hypovolemia and outflow tract obstruction. However, her blood pressure has improved with IV fluids and she is currently asymptomatic and normotensive. Close monitoring will be necessary to ensure that hypotension does not recur.
2. STEMI/CAD: The patient had a STEMI in the anterior distribution of V2-V4, with evolution to TWI in the same distribution, likely due to distal LAD. Positive Troponins and a peak CK of 1500 suggest myocardial injury. Telemetry should be continued, and the patient has declined cardiac catheterization. Full-strength aspirin and high-dose statin therapy should be continued, and consideration should be given to adding back an ACE inhibitor once"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o HTN initially admitted with STEMI without intervention
   was  transferred to ICU for hypotension now resolved.
   Hypotension:
   Patient was hypotensive on the floor but mentating well. Etiology is
   likely hypovolemia in the setting of being found down and outflow tract
   obstruction in the setting of dopamine.  Hypotension improved with IVF
   and she was weaned off pressors, now off x 15 hours.
   - IVF bolus prn symptomatic hypotension, but currently asymptomatic and
   normotensive
   - continue to hold lisinopril
   - start atenolol 12.5mg daily to maintain heart rate control
   - f/u urine and blood cultures, all NGTD
   STEMI/CAD:
   Patient had STE in anterior distribution V2-V4 now with evolution to
   TWI in same distribution likely of distal LAD. No reciprical changes.
   Positive Troponins and CK peak 1500 in setting of being down which
   could represent mild element of rhabdomyolysis.
   - continue telemetry
   - patient does not want cardiac catherization.
   - continue full strength asa, high dose statin
   - will transition from metoprolol to atenolol 12.5mg daily
   - will consider adding back ACEI once BP improves
   Leukocytosis: resolved
   WBC of 14 on admit, 10.5 today, no localizing signs of infection. most
   likely related to MI and hemoconcentration on admission
   - f/i urine and blood cultures
   - levofloxacin discontinued since no s/s infection and cx no growth
   - f/u final cx data
   Chronic systolic heart failure:
   Patient is hypovolemic. EF 40-50%. On 20mg lasix as outpatient.
   - monitor on daily I/Os, daily weights
   - hold diuresis
   Anemia:
   Patient hct decrease overnight baseline appears to be 39, down to 35
   with hypotension. No gross evidence of bleeding. Irone studies c/w iron
   deficiency. HCT stable
   - maintain active T+S
   - trend hct
   - iron supplements
   GERD:
   Stable, continue PPI
   Macular degeneration: stable left eye blindless
   - continue Xalatan 0.005% Eye drops
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Follow and replete electrolytes. Cardiac diet. No IVF at
   present.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of hypertension who was initially admitted for a STEMI without intervention. She was transferred to the ICU for hypotension, which has since resolved. The patient's vitals are stable, and she feels well with no complaints of dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, or lightheadedness. Her allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the hypotension that has improved.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), as well as other ICU medications. Her last dose of antibiotics was on [**2160-3-8**] at 05:33 AM. The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 10.5, hemoglobin of 31.2, platelet count of 212, creatinine of 0.5, troponin-T of 0.11, and glucose of 93. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's hypotension is likely due to hypovolemia and outflow tract obstruction, both of which have improved with intravenous fluids. She is now off pressors and asymptomatic. The patient's STEMI involved the anterior distribution of V2-V4 and has evolved into TWI in the same distribution, likely due to distal LAD involvement. There are no reciprocal changes"
