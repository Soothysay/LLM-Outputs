   Assessment and Plan
   A 54 year-ol woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Differential includes distributive (sepsis) vs cardiac
   vs adrenal insufficiency vs volume depletion.  No hypoxia to suggest
   PE, and had a negative CTA in the ED.  CVP zero currently argues
   against cardiogenic shock.  She did recently finish her steroid taper
   and could be adrenally insufficient.  Fortunately she received
   dexamethasone [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim could be evaluated.  Another possibility is
   volume depletion, possibly secondary to blood loss into her thigh.
   Most likely this is sepsis.  Most likely source is urine given positive
   urine culture and indwelling Foley.   Recently had a UTI as an
   outpatient but no culture data or information about abx course.  Last
   positive UA here [**9-30**] and [**7-31**] with resistant klebsiella (ESBL) which
   was treated with Bactrim, and enterococcus (VRE) respectively.
   - Trend lactate
   - SvO2 as she comes off pressors
   - Antibiotics: vanc + zosyn for now pending cultures
   - trend lactate
   - [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   - Source localization (pan-culture)
   - Continue levophed MAP >60
   - IVF to keep CVP >8 ([**9-3**])
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - change Foley
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:  Attributed to seizures by her husband and apparently
   by her neuro-oncologist, who recently increased her Keppra dosing to
   control this.  Another possibility is that she is simply
   orthostatic(given that episodes are reproducible with positional
   changes) and in the setting of worsening baseline hypotension recently
   has become more symptomatic.  CT head negative for acute change.
   - discuss with neuro-oncology if EEG monitorring might be helpful
   - check orthostatic vital signs once off pressors
   .
   # R thigh hematoma:  concerning given that she is currently on lovenox
   and hct dropped.
   - stop anticoagulation
   - follow Hct, repeat now
   - T&S
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  currently anticoagulated with lovenox.  Currently has
   evidence of R thigh bleed on CT.
   - stop anticoagulation for now
   - consider LENIs, as she may be a candidate for IVC filter if LE clots
   are present and anticoagulation contraindicated
   .
   #) Anion gap:  AG 21 on admission, improved to 14 after fluids and
   resuscitation. Likely secondary to elevated lactate (8.0).
   - continue to trend
   - IV fluids as above
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  likely secondary to demand and
   hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST depressions laterally new since
   [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Reportedly with good response.  Although
   patient attributes her episodes to seizures, these are quite possibly
   just orthostatic symptoms.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (recently increased)
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - stress dose steroids as above
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management
   <br>
   .
   #) F/E/N:  NPO for now, advance diet in AM
   <br>
   #) Prophylaxis:  SC heparin, bowel regimen as needed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma who presents with hypotension. The differential diagnosis includes distributive (sepsis), cardiac, adrenal insufficiency, and volume depletion. The most likely cause seems to be sepsis, possibly secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by resistant klebsiella (ESBL) and enterococcus (VRE). 

The patient also has a thigh hematoma, which is concerning given her current anticoagulation therapy. There is a history of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE) and she is currently on low molecular weight heparin (lovenox). 

Additionally, the patient has an elevated troponin level, possibly due to demand and hypotension. There are ST depressions laterally on the EKG since [**9-30**].

The patient is being treated with adjuvant Temodar after whole brain radiation for CNS lymphoma. She is experiencing episodic loss of consciousness (LOC), which could be attributed to seizures, orthostatic changes, or other causes. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypotension, sepsis, development of compartment syndrome due to the thigh hematoma, and further thromboembolic events. 

The plan includes continuing stress dose steroids, antibiotics, monitoring for source localization, and stopping anticoagulation."

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 98/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. Her physical examination reveals mild suprapubic tenderness and no peripheral edema. Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, elevated CRP, elevated troponin T, and abnormal coagulation parameters. Blood cultures are pending.

Potential Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate septic shock or adrenal insufficiency. Continuous monitoring and IV fluids are being administered to maintain adequate perfusion.
2. Thigh hematoma: The patient has a history of a right thigh hematoma, which could potentially be a source of infection. Close monitoring for signs of compartment syndrome is necessary.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of DVT and PE, and her current presentation may suggest a recurrence. Anticoagulation therapy"

   Assessment and Plan
   A 54 year-ol woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Differential includes distributive (sepsis) vs cardiac
   vs adrenal insufficiency vs volume depletion.  No hypoxia to suggest
   PE, and had a negative CTA in the ED.  CVP zero currently argues
   against cardiogenic shock.  She did recently finish her steroid taper
   and could be adrenally insufficient.  Fortunately she received
   dexamethasone [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim could be evaluated.  Another possibility is
   volume depletion, possibly secondary to blood loss into her thigh.
   Most likely this is sepsis.  Most likely source is urine given positive
   urine culture and indwelling Foley.   Recently had a UTI as an
   outpatient but no culture data or information about abx course.  Last
   positive UA here [**9-30**] and [**7-31**] with resistant klebsiella (ESBL) which
   was treated with Bactrim, and enterococcus (VRE) respectively.
   - Trend lactate
   - SvO2 as she comes off pressors
   - Antibiotics: vanc + zosyn for now pending cultures
   - trend lactate
   - [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   - Source localization (pan-culture)
   - Continue levophed MAP >60
   - IVF to keep CVP >8 ([**9-3**])
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - change Foley
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:  Attributed to seizures by her husband and apparently
   by her neuro-oncologist, who recently increased her Keppra dosing to
   control this.  Another possibility is that she is simply
   orthostatic(given that episodes are reproducible with positional
   changes) and in the setting of worsening baseline hypotension recently
   has become more symptomatic.  CT head negative for acute change.
   - discuss with neuro-oncology if EEG monitorring might be helpful
   - check orthostatic vital signs once off pressors
   .
   # R thigh hematoma:  concerning given that she is currently on lovenox
   and hct dropped.
   - stop anticoagulation
   - follow Hct, repeat now
   - T&S
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  currently anticoagulated with lovenox.  Currently has
   evidence of R thigh bleed on CT.
   - stop anticoagulation for now
   - consider LENIs, as she may be a candidate for IVC filter if LE clots
   are present and anticoagulation contraindicated
   .
   #) Anion gap:  AG 21 on admission, improved to 14 after fluids and
   resuscitation. Likely secondary to elevated lactate (8.0).
   - continue to trend
   - IV fluids as above
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  likely secondary to demand and
   hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST depressions laterally new since
   [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Reportedly with good response.  Although
   patient attributes her episodes to seizures, these are quite possibly
   just orthostatic symptoms.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (recently increased)
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - stress dose steroids as above
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management

   .
   #) F/E/N:  NPO for now, advance diet in AM

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presenting with hypotension.
- She has been experiencing episodes of loss of consciousness (LOC) attributed to seizures.
- The patient has a thigh hematoma and is currently on anticoagulation therapy.
- She has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The patient's anion gap has improved after fluids and resuscitation.
- Her troponin levels are elevated, likely secondary to demand and hypotension.
- She is being treated with adjuvant Temodar after whole brain radiation for CNS lymphoma.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is receiving appropriate treatments for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and positive urine culture suggest a possible infection, leading to sepsis.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient recently finished her steroid taper and could be adrenally insufficient, which can cause hypotension.
3. Cardiogenic shock: Although the central venous pressure (CVP) zero argues against this, it should still be monitored and evaluated.
4. Thigh hematoma: The patient has a thigh hematoma, and stopping anticoagulation is recommended to prevent further bleeding.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary embolism (PE):"

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   A 54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Now off levophed and maintaining MAP >65 with IVF
   boluses.  Lactate trending down.  Differential remains broad.  Cardiac
   seems less likely given persistently low CVPs, clear lungs.
   Possible sources:  proctitis, effusion, thigh
   However, relatively low [**Name (NI) 9144**] argues toward cardiac.   Adrenal
   insufficiency still possible given recent completion of steroid taper.
   CTA negative for PE.  Sepsis still most likely given that leukocytosis
   with left shift improved with antibiotics, urine is one obvious
   culprit, but R thigh hematoma could also be a source.  In [**2196**] had ESBL
   klebsiella and [**Last Name (LF) 1591**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] would be concerned for these pathogens again.
   Foley has been changed.  Regarding management, we have fallen behind
   this morning in that CVP and UOP are less than ideal.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for now pending cultures (would not
   broaden to cover above-mentioned pathogens unless clinically unstable
   or positive culture data; could consider Bactrim if klebsiella, as ESBL
   klebsiella previously treated with this)
   - re-send urine culture although unlikely to be posibitve
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 45**] stim; stress-dose steroids if adrenally insufficient.
   - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >30 cc/h:
   bolus 2L now
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma:   Seen on CT in the ED.  Patient intermittently
   endorses pain in the area.  Appears small, but hct lower on admission
   than recent baseline and she has been anticoagulated.  Now s/p 1 unit
   pRBC, Hct bumped appropriately.  concerning given that she is currently
   on lovenox and hct dropped.   Could potentially be a source of

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   A 54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Falling hematocrit:  Concerning for bleed.  She has been
   anticoagulated with lovenox for hx DVT/PE, and anticoagulation was
   re-started yesterday.  Possible source would be R thigh given known
   hematoma. Also she complains of mild abdominal pain so we would be
   concerned for GI source.
   - 1 unit pRBC this morning
   - stop anticoagulation
   - q6h Hct
   - repeat CT without contrast to evaluate for interval progression of
   hematoma
   - guaiac stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Remains off pressors, able to maintain MAP mostly >70
   with IVF boluses.  Unable to raise CVP despite multiple boluses and
   good UOP.  Regarding cause,  no evidence of adrenal insufficiency by
   [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim yesterday.  Sepsis remains most likely but blood loss also
   high on the differential for her hypotension.  Regarding source of
   sepsis, urine culture was contaminated but probably still the most
   likely source given indwelling Foley and positive UA on admission.
   Repeat UA will likely be negative given antibiotics.  Her proctitis
   visualized on CT could also potentially be a source if infectious.
   Finally, her R obturator hematoma could be infected, or the
   questionable mass could be a source.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - re-send urine culture although unlikely to be positive
   - no need for further steroids
    - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >50 cc/h
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma/mass:   Seen on CT in the ED.  We are concerned
   that this may be a source of bleeding and/or infection.
   - monitor hct, stop anticoagulation, repeat CT as above
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - stop anticoagulation as above
   - LENIs
   - if persistent clot, may consider IVC filter given contraindication to
   anticoagulation and history of PE
   .
   #) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  more than expected as
   compensation for mild respiratory alkalosis.  Most likely secondary to
   large volume of NS resuscitation.
   - change to LR boluses rather than NS
   - urine lytes if persists
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM.
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Recently completed decadron taper.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - no further steroids
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma who presents with hypotension. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has multiple medical conditions and complications, including a hematoma in the right buttock and right obturator externus muscle, diffuse osteopenia with generalized body wall atrophy, a small left pleural effusion, fatty liver, and a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 95.9°F, heart rate 89 bpm, blood pressure 105/68 mmHg, respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. Her physical examination reveals mild epigastric tenderness, mild suprapubic tenderness, and no rebound or guarding. Neurological examination shows intact sensation and strength of bilateral lower extremities.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 13.1 thousand/mm³, hematocrit of 22.1%, platelet count of 110 thousand/mm³, blood glucose of 120 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.13 ng/mL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam), morphine sulfate, and anticoagulation therapy with lovenox.

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   potential for bleeding from hematoma
   54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Now off pressors x 3 days and able to maintain MAP
   mostly >70 with IVF boluses.  Unable to raise CVP despite multiple
   boluses and good UOP.  Regarding cause, no evidence of adrenal
   insufficiency by [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim yesterday.  Sepsis remains most likely but
   blood loss also high on the differential for her hypotension.
   Regarding source of sepsis, urine culture was contaminated but probably
   still the most likely source given indwelling Foley and positive UA on
   admission.  Repeat UA has expectedly  been negative given antibiotics.
   Her proctitis visualized on CT could also potentially be a source if
   infectious.  Finally, her R obturator hematoma could be infected, or
   the questionable mass could be a source.  She has been on vancomycin
   and zosyn and improving, so it would be difficult to stop abx at this
   time, although unclear exactly what we
re treating.  Furthermore, Zosyn
   may be contributing to thrombocytopenia.
   - continue vancomycin
   - change Zosyn to meropenem
   - f/u all pending cultures
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >35 cc/h
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma/mass:  On repeat CT yesterday, mass has not
   enlarged.  However, it is substantial in size.
   - monitor hct
   - no anticoagulation for now
   - discuss with radiology whether this is a true bleed (vs underlying
   mass?)  and how significant it is
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   #) Falling hematocrit:  Anticoagulation stopped yesterday out of
   concern for bleed.  Hct bumped appropriately to 1 unit pRBC and has
   remained stable.   Also complains of mild abdominal pain (? Upper GI
   source).
   - hold anticoagulation
   - q6h Hct
   - guaiac stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia:  concerning for DIC vs HIT.  Fibrinogen on admit
   slightly low.   She has been getting heparin since admit (on and off)
   but had been on lovenox chronically, so HIT less likely.  Fibrinogen
   was somewhat low last time it was checked 2 days ago.
   - check DIC labs
   - replete fibrinogen with cryo PRN
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - no anticoagulation for now
   - LENIs
   - discuss re-challenge with heparin vs possible IVC filter given
   ongoing risk for VTE and possible contra-indication to anticoagulation
   .
   #) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  more than expected as
   compensation for mild respiratory alkalosis.  Most likely secondary to
   large volume of NS resuscitation.
   - LR boluses
   - urine lytes if persists
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - echo today to evaluate cardiac function
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Recently completed decadron taper.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma.
- She presents with hypotension and is now off pressors.
- The patient has a significant R thigh hematoma, which may be infected or have the potential for bleeding.
- She also has thrombocytopenia, possibly due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
- The patient has a history of DVT/PE and is currently not on anticoagulation due to the R thigh hematoma.
- She has non-anion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to large volume of normal saline (NS) resuscitation.
- The patient's troponin levels are elevated, possibly due to demand and hypotension.
- She is being treated for CNS lymphoma with adjuvant Temodar after whole brain radiation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding from the R thigh hematoma: The hematoma is substantial in size and may continue to bleed, especially if it is infected.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding. It could be due to DIC or HIT. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.

","The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presenting with hypotension. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, potential for bleeding from hematoma, and other medical complications. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.6 C (96.1 F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/67 mmHg to 109/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   potential for bleeding from hematoma
   54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Falling hematocrit:  Concerning for bleed.  She has been
   anticoagulated with lovenox for hx DVT/PE, and anticoagulation was
   re-started yesterday.  Possible source would be R thigh given known
   hematoma. Also she complains of mild abdominal pain so we would be
   concerned for GI source.
   - 1 unit pRBC this morning
   - stop anticoagulation
   - q6h Hct
   - repeat CT without contrast to evaluate for interval progression of
   hematoma
   - guaiac stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Remains off pressors, able to maintain MAP mostly >70
   with IVF boluses.  Unable to raise CVP despite multiple boluses and
   good UOP.  Regarding cause,  no evidence of adrenal insufficiency by
   [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim yesterday.  Sepsis remains most likely but blood loss also
   high on the differential for her hypotension.  Regarding source of
   sepsis, urine culture was contaminated but probably still the most
   likely source given indwelling Foley and positive UA on admission.
   Repeat UA will likely be negative given antibiotics.  Her proctitis
   visualized on CT could also potentially be a source if infectious.
   Finally, her R obturator hematoma could be infected, or the
   questionable mass could be a source.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - re-send urine culture although unlikely to be positive
   - no need for further steroids
    - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >50 cc/h
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia:
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma/mass:   Seen on CT in the ED.  We are concerned
   that this may be a source of bleeding and/or infection.
   - monitor hct, stop anticoagulation, repeat CT as above
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - stop anticoagulation as above
   - LENIs
   - if persistent clot, may consider IVC filter given contraindication to
   anticoagulation and history of PE
   .
   #) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  more than expected as
   compensation for mild respiratory alkalosis.  Most likely secondary to
   large volume of NS resuscitation.
   - change to LR boluses rather than NS
   - urine lytes if persists
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM.
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Recently completed decadron taper.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - no further steroids
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presenting with hypotension. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and potential bleeding from a hematoma in her right thigh. The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics, blood transfusion, and anticoagulation management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a known hematoma in her right thigh, which may be a source of bleeding. Additionally, she has been anticoagulated with lovenox for her history of DVT/PE, and anticoagulation was restarted yesterday. This increases the risk of further bleeding.

2. Infection: The patient's sepsis suggests a possible infectious source. The urine culture was contaminated, but the Foley catheter and positive urine analysis on admission indicate a potential urinary tract infection. There is also concern for infection in the right obturator hematoma or the questionable mass seen on CT.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding. This may be related to her anticoagulation therapy or another underlying cause.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT/PE and currently exhibits signs of recurrent DVT, particularly in the left lower extremity. This poses a risk of further clot formation and potential pulmonary"

 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   potential for bleeding from hematoma
   54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Falling hematocrit:  Concerning for bleed.  She has been
   anticoagulated with lovenox for hx DVT/PE, and anticoagulation was
   re-started yesterday.  Possible source would be R thigh given known
   hematoma. Also she complains of mild abdominal pain so we would be
   concerned for GI source.
   - 1 unit pRBC this morning
   - stop anticoagulation
   - q6h Hct
   - repeat CT without contrast to evaluate for interval progression of
   hematoma
   - guaiac stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Remains off pressors, able to maintain MAP mostly >70
   with IVF boluses.  Unable to raise CVP despite multiple boluses and
   good UOP.  Regarding cause,  no evidence of adrenal insufficiency by
   [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim yesterday.  Sepsis remains most likely but blood loss also
   high on the differential for her hypotension.  Regarding source of
   sepsis, urine culture was contaminated but probably still the most
   likely source given indwelling Foley and positive UA on admission.
   Repeat UA will likely be negative given antibiotics.  Her proctitis
   visualized on CT could also potentially be a source if infectious.
   Finally, her R obturator hematoma could be infected, or the
   questionable mass could be a source.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - re-send urine culture although unlikely to be positive
   - no need for further steroids
    - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >50 cc/h
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia:  concerning for DIC vs HIT.  Fibrinogen on admit
   slightly low.   She has been getting heparin intermittently.
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma/mass:   Seen on CT in the ED.  We are concerned
   that this may be a source of bleeding and/or infection.
   - monitor hct, stop anticoagulation, repeat CT as above
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - stop anticoagulation as above
   - LENIs
   - if persistent clot, may consider IVC filter given contraindication to
   anticoagulation and history of PE
   .
   #) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  more than expected as
   compensation for mild respiratory alkalosis.  Most likely secondary to
   large volume of NS resuscitation.
   - change to LR boluses rather than NS
   - urine lytes if persists
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM.
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Recently completed decadron taper.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - no further steroids
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma who presented with hypotension. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction and potential for bleeding from a hematoma in her right thigh. Other potential complications that can arise include:

1. GI bleeding: The patient complains of mild abdominal pain, which raises concern for a gastrointestinal source of bleeding.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.

3. Renal dysfunction: The patient has received large volumes of normal saline resuscitation, which may have led to non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Monitoring renal function and adjusting fluid management accordingly is important.

4. Cardiac issues: The patient has elevated troponin levels with flat CK levels, suggesting possible cardiac stress or ischemia. Trending cardiac enzymes and repeating EKG in the morning would help assess the cardiac status.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of DVT/PE, and anticoagulation was held due to the right thigh hematoma. Monitoring for signs of recurrent DVT and considering an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter if ant"
