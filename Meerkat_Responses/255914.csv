","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male who was admitted with chronic left pleural effusion and underwent VATS (Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) with pleurectomy. The patient's course was complicated by mucus plugging, aspiration pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and a G-tube placement. He was previously transferred to rehab but has now returned with a decline in mental status, chest congestion, anemia, and swelling in the left lower extremity (LLE). The patient is currently stable in the ICU with an increased respiratory rate (RR) of 30's. A head CT scan was performed, which showed no abnormalities. An ultrasound of the LLE revealed a cyst that was aspirated, resulting in serosanguinous fluid, and antibiotics were given.

Medical History:
The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), mitral valve replacement (MVR), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40%, possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and chronic atrial fibrillation (AF).

Review of Systems:
The patient's respiratory review of systems is significant for tachypnea. The rest of the systems remain unchanged from admission.

Flowsheet Data:
- Vital signs: The patient's temperature (Tmax: 35.8°C or 96.5°F, Tcurrent: 35.8°C or 96.5°F), heart rate (HR: 109 bpm), blood pressure (BP: 142/71 mmHg), respiratory rate (RR: 29-36 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation (SpO2: 99%) are within normal limits.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is on hemodynamic monitoring with total in and out fluids, including IV fluids, blood products, and urine output.
- Fluid balance: The patient has a negative fluid balance of 496 mL since midnight.
- Respiratory support: The patient is on supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula and mechanical ventilation mode 4L, maintaining an SpO2 of 99%.
- ABG results: The patient's arterial blood gas shows pH 7.37, PaCO2 48 mmHg, PaO2 116 mmHg, and HCO3- 24.5 mEq/L.
- Physical examination: The patient appears thin and is experiencing mild respiratory distress. There are no abnormalities in the cardiovascular or neurological examinations. The patient has 1+ edema in the LLE and a tense collection over the left calf.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Decline in mental status - likely due to medical complications, such as delirium.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of chronic left pleural effusion, who underwent VATS, pleurectomy, and decortication. He previously had mucus plugging, aspiration, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and was placed on a G-tube. The patient presented with a decline in mental status, chest congestion, respiratory distress, anemia, and swelling in the left lower extremity (LLE). A head CT showed no abnormalities, and an ultrasound of the LLE revealed a cyst that was aspirated, yielding serosanguinous fluid. Antibiotics were administered. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease (CAD), mitral valve regurgitation (MVR), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40%, possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and chronic atrial fibrillation (AF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing a decline in mental status, likely due to medical complications.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's tachypnea and respiratory distress may be caused by mucus plugging, as indicated by the improvement in CXR findings.
3. Left Lower Extremity Edema and Cyst: The patient has swelling in the LLE and a cyst that was aspirated, yielding serosanguinous fluid. Further"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of tachypnea and anemia. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was previously on warfarin. The patient's medical history includes dry mouth, tachypnea, anemia, and coagulopathy. The patient is currently on multiple IV medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and pantoprazole.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 105/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,247 mL, including 701 mL through the PO, 2,912 mL through IV fluids, 1,025 mL of blood products, and 40 mL through TF. The total output is 1,679 mL, including 200 mL through urine, 240 mL through NG, 368 mL through blood products, and 200 mL through stool.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 13.9, hematocrit of 20.5, platelet count of 199, creatinine of 2.6, blood glucose of 135, and potassium of 4.9 mEq/L. The PT/PTT/INR is elevated, indicating a coagulation issue.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several problems including acute anemia secondary to blood loss, inability to protect airway, hypotension, impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status.

The patient is receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube, glycemic control is being monitored, and prophylaxis measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia are in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. The patient's acute anemia may lead to complications such as hypoxia and organ dysfunction.
2. The inability to protect the airway increases the risk of aspiration and potential respiratory complications.
3. Hypotension can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and shock.
4. Impaired skin integrity can increase the risk of pressure ulcers and infection.
5. Altered mental status may indicate a neurological compromise and requires further evaluation.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent admission for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)/decortication/pleurectomy for left hemothorax. The patient presents with altered mental status and left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient has a baseline hemoglobin level of 28, presumed to be from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), inflammation, and now with gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with inadequate bump and has guaiac positive stool. Further evaluation is needed, including monitoring LLE, GI consultation, IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and non-contrast CT torso and leg.
2. Tachypnea/Presumed Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient continues to have persistent findings on chest X-ray, although right lower lobe (RLL) findings have improved. The patient is tachypneic, has copious upper airway secretions, and is on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Mild leukocytosis has improved. The patient"

","The patient's chief complaints are tachypnea and anemia. The 24-hour events include a trans-thoracic echo, PICC line stop, aspiration of fluid from the right fluid collection, transfusion of 3 units of blood, heme+ stools, and initiation of IV protonix. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with previous CABG surgery, mitral valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7 C (98.1 F)
- Heart rate: 84 bpm (normal range: 76-94 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 105/74 mmHg (normal range: 83-139/81-89 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 38 breaths per minute (normal range: 15-41 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse bilateral basal crackles, wet upper airway sounds, and 2+ edema on the left lower extremity. The neurologic examination shows intermittent moaning, awake and alert with good strength in the upper extremities.

Laboratory results include:
- Hemoglobin: 8.1 g/dL (low)
- Hematocrit: 20.5% (low)
- White blood cell count: 13.9 K/uL"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), mitral valve replacement (MVR), and atrial fibrillation (AFib). He also has COPD and was recently admitted for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), decortication, and pleurectomy due to left hemothorax.

The patient presented with altered mental status and left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection. He was found to have guaiac positive stool, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. He received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with an inadequate response, suggesting ongoing blood loss.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 105/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 38 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. His heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient has several medical problems, including anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding), inability to protect airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough), hypotension (not in shock), impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status (not delirium).

The patient has a history of anemia, other airway problems, and altered mental status. His current laboratory results show"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent admission for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)/decortication/pleurectomy for left hemothorax. He presents with altered mental status, left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection, and guaiac positive stool.

The patient has multiple medical problems including anemia, acute secondary to blood loss, hypotension (not in shock), impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. He is also at risk for aspiration due to inability to protect airway.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status: Delirium is more consistent with stroke. No signs of meningitis. LLE fluid collection/infection may be precipitant vs. underlying pneumonia/aspiration. Improved with IV fluids.
2. Anemia: Baseline 28, presumed to be from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), inflammation. Now Hct below baseline and falling. s/p 4 units packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with inadequate response. Now with guaiac positive stool. LLE fluid also serosanguinous. Multifactorial bleeding given coagulopathy and enoxaparin use.
3. Tachypnea/pneumonia: Presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Will follow up with chest CT today.
4. LLE Fluid Collection: Ultrasound suggestive of [**Hospital Ward Name 5060**] cyst with hemorrhage/clot. Aspiration with serosanguinous fluid. Surrounding area with erythema. Unclear if patient has underlying infection. Also had mild leukocytosis, but no fever currently.
5. CAD s/p CABG: No symptoms of ischemia currently, or on EKG.
6. Afib: Afib on EKG.
7. CHF: Per OSH Echo in [**2115**], EF 40%. Echo here with EF 45% so stable. Likely ischemic in origin given CAD. Currently no signs of gross fluid overload. No history of valve repair.
8. Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr 2 with Cr 2.6 increasing today.
9. Thrombocytopenia: Prior Plt count 50-70s. Per recent hematology evaluation likely multifactorial to include MDS, inflammation, CKD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: Delirium is a common complication in hospitalized patients, especially in older adults. It is characterized by an acute change in mental status and cognitive impairment.
2. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect the airway puts him at risk for aspiration, which"

   aortic aneurysm is again identified, unchanged, measuring approximately
   3.9 cm
   in maximal diameter. There is no retroperitoneal hematoma. There is no
   abdominal lymphadenopathy.
   PELVIS: Evaluation of the pelvis is limited due to extensive streak
   artifact
   from patient's bilateral hip arthroplasties. Allowing for this
   limitation,
   there is no gross fluid collection or abnormality within the pelvis.
   LOWER EXTREMITIES: There is a large hematoma within the left calf,
   starting
   at the level of the popliteal fossa, extending for approximately 20 cm
   craniocaudad. There is extensive soft tissue edema and thickening of
   the
   facial planes superior to the hematoma.
   Extensive arterial calcifications are noted in the lower extremities
   bilaterally.
   OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is diffuse osteopenia. There is extensive
   degenerative change. Bilateral hip arthroplasties are noted. There are
   no
   destructive osseous lesions.
   IMPRESSION:

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and previous admission for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)/decortication/pleurectomy for left hemothorax. He presents with altered mental status and left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to infection and pain, which should be treated with appropriate antibiotics for presumed pneumonia (PNA) and supportive care.
2. Anemia: The patient has a baseline anemia likely related to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and inflammation. His hematocrit (Hct) is below baseline, and he has received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with inadequate bump. There is also guaiac positive stool indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation is needed, including monitoring of Hct, transfusion to goal 26-28, active treatment for bleeding, and consultation with a gastroenterologist.
3. Tachypnea/Presumed Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient continues to have persistent findings on chest X-ray, suggesting ongoing respiratory issues despite treatment for HAP. He is likely"

   CHEST: There is consolidation within the right lower lobe. There is
   consolidation/collapse of the left lower lobe, with a small amount of
   pleural
   effusion on the left. There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar
   lymphadenopathy by size criteria. Coronary calcifications are noted.
   Post-CABG
   changes are noted.
   ABDOMEN: A nasogastric tube is in place. The evaluation of the solid
   organs
   is limited by non-contrast technique. Allowing for this limitation,
   there is
   no gross contour abnormality associated with the liver, spleen,
   pancreas, or
   adrenals. The kidneys are atrophic bilaterally, and contain punctate
   non-
   obstructing calculi. There are bilateral exophytic renal lesions which
   cannot
   be characterized as simple cysts. There is no hydronephrosis. Abdominal
   aortic aneurysm is again identified, unchanged, measuring approximately
   3.9 cm
   in maximal diameter. There is no retroperitoneal hematoma. There is no
   abdominal lymphadenopathy.
   PELVIS: Evaluation of the pelvis is limited due to extensive streak
   artifact
   from patient's bilateral hip arthroplasties. Allowing for this
   limitation,
   there is no gross fluid collection or abnormality within the pelvis.
   LOWER EXTREMITIES: There is a large hematoma within the left calf,
   starting
   at the level of the popliteal fossa, extending for approximately 20 cm
   craniocaudad. There is extensive soft tissue edema and thickening of
   the
   facial planes superior to the hematoma.
   Extensive arterial calcifications are noted in the lower extremities
   bilaterally.
   OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is diffuse osteopenia. There is extensive
   degenerative change. Bilateral hip arthroplasties are noted. There are
   no
   destructive osseous lesions.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Large left calf hematoma. No retroperitoneal bleed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a male with delirium, left lower lobe atelectasis, and a large hematoma in the left calf. He has a history of anemia, airway protection issues, hypotension, and impaired skin integrity. The patient received blood products and fluid resuscitation for his anemia and hypotension. He also received antibiotics for suspected infections, including catheter tip and tissue cultures. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and low blood pressure. His respiratory rate is within normal limits. The patient has atrial fibrillation. The physical examination revealed no peripheral pulses in the upper and lower extremities, and the neurologic examination was not assessed. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and other abnormal values. The imaging studies show consolidation in the right and left lower lobes of the lungs, a small pleural effusion on the left, atrophic kidneys with punctate calculi, bilateral exophytic renal lesions, an abdominal aortic aneurysm, and a large hematoma in the left calf. The patient's medical history includes post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) changes, hip arthroplasties, and abdominal aortic aneurysm.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 5934**] has needed 4 units pRBC
s and 1 unit FFP so far. He remains
   intermittently confused but cough is stronger. He denies pain and his
   leg is to be evaluated by the Orthopedic staff today. He will need free
   water repletion, possible one more unit of blood ( with hydration) and
   institution of low dose haldol to help with agitation. He still
   warrants ICU level nursing care on account of his mental status for
   now. Nastracheal suctioning is to be avoided on account of epistaxis
   overnight.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent admission for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) decompression/pleurectomy for left hemothorax. He presents with altered mental status, left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection, and right nasal bleed.

The patient has received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), with his hematocrit (Hct) still below baseline. He has a history of anemia, presumed to be from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and inflammation. He also has a history of thrombocytopenia, likely related to MDS, which is currently well above baseline.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia (presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia or HAP), and his breathing has improved with the use of antibiotics and supportive care. He has a large left calf hematoma, no retroperitoneal bleed, and evidence of bilateral lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis on chest imaging. The patient's hypernatremia is attributed to free water loss.

The patient's medical conditions include acute on chronic renal failure, congestive heart failure (CHF),"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with several medical conditions and complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status and delirium. This could be due to infection, pain, or electrolyte disturbances. It is important to treat the underlying causes, monitor the patient frequently, reorient them, and manage any psychoactive medications.

2. Epistaxis (nosebleed): The patient had a nosebleed that was controlled with pressure, Afrin, and ddAVP. Continuous monitoring is necessary, and if the bleeding recurs, an ENT evaluation may be required.

3. Anemia: The patient has a baseline anemia likely due to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and inflammation. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is below the baseline in the setting of bleeding, which is exacerbated by low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with inadequate bump, and now there is evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's Hct levels, transfuse to a goal of 26-28, and consult a gastroenterologist for endoscopy.

4. Tachypnea/presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient's breathing has improved, and they are currently on room air. No new microbiological data is available."

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent admission for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)/decortication/pleurectomy for left hemothorax. The patient presents with altered mental status and left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient has a baseline hemoglobin concentration of 28, presumed to be from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and inflammation. The Hct is below baseline in the setting of bleeding, likely due to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The patient has received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with inadequate bump. There is also guaiac positive stool and recent epistaxis, indicating ongoing bleeding. The Hct is currently at 23.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has multiple ecchymoses and erythema surrounding an LLE fluid collection suggestive of a hematoma or cyst. This could be due to infection or underlying skin damage.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level was initially elevated but has since resolved. It is important to monitor for any electrolyte imbalances.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent admission for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with decortication and pleurectomy due to left hemothorax. The patient presents with altered mental status and left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's altered mental status may be due to infection, as indicated by the presence of delirium likely caused by infection, pain, and nearing baseline per family.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has an increase in left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis, which could lead to respiratory distress or further infection.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is below normal, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, and there are signs of acute renal failure, which may worsen if not managed appropriately.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, indicating an imbalance in sodium levels, which can lead to dehydration or neurological complications.
6. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of CAD and previous CAB"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), mitral valve repair, atrial fibrillation (afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent admission for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) decortication/pleurectomy for left hemothorax. He presents with altered mental status and left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection. 

The patient has been receiving various medications, including metoprolol, pantoprazole, trazodone, vancomycin, cefepime, and others. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1 C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/37 mmHg to 147/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient has been diagnosed with delirium likely due to infection, pain, and nearing baseline according to the family. He also has epistaxis, dry mucosa, bleeding controlled with pressure and medication, and anemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, MVR, afib, COPD, s/p recent admission for
   VATS/decortication/pleurectomy for L hemothorax was admitted with
   altered mental status, LLE fluid collection, and newly developed left
   sided pleural effusion.
   1. Altered Mental Status:
   Continued waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] c/w intermittent delirium. Etiology was
   most likely due to infection and pain.
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin
   - pain control
   - follow-up blood, urine cultures
   - hold sedating medications
   - haldol prn
   2. Left sided pleural effusion
   Pleural effusion was diagnosed on CXR for evaluation of tachypnea.
   Etiology is unclear, although patient is certainly at risk for
   reaccumulation of hemothorax (although hct stable). Thoracics was
   consulted and do not recommend [**Female First Name (un) 231**] at this point.
   - appreciate thoracics input
   - CT chest w/o contrast to eval effusion
   3. LLE hematoma
   Ultrasound suggestive of [**Hospital Ward Name 5060**] cyst with hemorrhage/clot.  He
   underwent aspiration with serosanguinous fluid withimprovement in
   symptoms.
   - follow-up joint fluid culture
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct
   - appreciate ortho input
   4. Epistaxis
   Resolved.  Dry mucosa. Bleed controlled with pressure, Afrin, ddAVP
   - Continue to monitor
   - Ent eval if recurs
   - Hold on NT suction
   - Vit K supplement
   5. Anemia:
   Etiology thought likely related to MDS and inflammation with baseline
   hct 28. Hct is slightly low in the setting of bleeding, although has
   been stable.
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] hct checks
   - transfuse if evidence of further bleeding
   - maintain active T/S
   - GI consult given guaiac + stool
> outpt endoscopy, unless opens up
   from a GI source
   - change to PO PPI
   6. Tachypnea
   Thought likely related to hospital-acquired pneumonia and pleural
   effusion.
   - continue vancomycin and cefepime to complete an 8 day course
   - appreciate thoracics input and plan for thoracentesis today
   - Check vanco level Sunday [**5-9**] AM

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted for altered mental status, left lower extremity fluid collection, and a newly developed left-sided pleural effusion.

Current Assessment and Plan:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's intermittent delirium is likely due to infection and pain. Continue cefepime and vancomycin, provide pain control, follow-up blood and urine cultures, hold sedating medications, and administer haldol as needed.

2. Left-sided Pleural Effusion: The etiology of the pleural effusion is unclear, but the patient is at risk for reaccumulation of hemothorax. Consult thoracics and perform a CT chest without contrast to evaluate the effusion.

3. LLE Hematoma: An ultrasound suggests a possible joint cyst with hemorrhage/clot. The patient underwent aspiration with serosanguinous fluid and showed improvement in symptoms. Follow-up joint fluid culture and appreciate orthopedic input.

4. Epistaxis: The patient's nosebleed has resolved. Monitor the situation, consider an ENT evaluation if the bleeding recurs, hold on NT suction, and provide vitamin K supplementation.

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, MVR, afib, COPD, s/p recent admission for
   VATS/decortication/pleurectomy for L hemothorax was admitted with
   altered mental status, LLE fluid collection, and newly developed left
   sided pleural effusion.
   1. Altered Mental Status:
   Altered mental status has now completely improved to his baseline.
   Etiology was most likely due to infection and pain.
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin
   - pain control
   - follow-up blood, urine cultures
   - hold sedating medications
   - haldol prn
   2. Left sided pleural effusion
   Pleural effusion was diagnosed on CXR for evaluation of tachypnea.
   Etiology is unclear, although patient is certainly at risk for
   reaccumulation of hemothorax. Thoracics was consulted and are planning
   to do thoracentesis today.
   - follow-up CXR
   - appreciate thoracics input
   - thoracentesis today
   3. LLE hematoma
   Ultrasound suggestive of [**Hospital Ward Name 5060**] cyst with hemorrhage/clot.  He
   underwent aspiration with serosanguinous fluid withimprovement in
   symptoms.
   - follow-up joint fluid culture
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct
   - appreciate ortho input
   4. Epistaxis
   Resolved.  Dry mucosa. Bleed controlled with pressure, Afrin, ddAVP
   - Continue to monitor
   - Ent eval if recurs
   - Hold on NT suction
   - Vit K supplement
   5. Anemia:
   Etiology thought likely related to MDS and inflammation with baseline
   hct 28. Hct is slightly low in the setting of bleeding, although has
   been stable.
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] hct checks
   - transfuse if evidence of further bleeding
   - maintain active T/S
   - GI consult given guaiac + stool
> outpt endoscopy, unless opens up
   from a GI source
   - change to PO PPI
   6. Tachypnea
   Thought likely related to hospital-acquired pneumonia and pleural
   effusion.
   - continue vancomycin and cefepime to complete an 8 day course
   - appreciate thoracics input and plan for thoracentesis today
   - Check vanco level Sunday [**5-9**] AM
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine culture
   - Supportive care with 02, nebulizers
   - Chest PT, frequent suctioning
   7. Hypernatremia
   Resolved
   8. CAD s/p CABG:
   No symptoms of ischemia currently, or on EKG
   - Cont Metoprolol
   - ? not on ASA, statin
   9. Afib: Afib on EKG.
   - Cont metoprolol
   - Hold anticoag given bleed
   10. CHF:
   Per OSH Echo in [**2115**], EF 40%.  Echo here with EF 45% so stable.  Likely
   ischemic in origin given CAD.  Currently no signs of gross fluid
   overload
   - Cont BB
   11. COPD: Unclear degree of COPD.  No PFTs available
   - Albuterol, ipratropium prn
   - 02 as needed
   12.Acute on chronic renal failure:
   Baseline Cr 2.  FE Na is 1.5%. Currently slightly above.  Differential
   includes pre-renal physiology given underlying infection or decreased
   in setting of bleeding.
   - f/u urine cx
   - Cont to trend
   - send urine lytes, eos to assess today
   13. Thrombocytopenia: Prior Plt count 50-70s.  Per recent hematology
   eval likely multifactorial to include MDS, inflammation, CKD.
   Thrombocytopenia likely related to MDS.  Well above baseline currently.
   - Active T/S, consent
   - Xfuse Plt <10
   14. HTN: Tolerating home metoprolol

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and mitral valve replacement (MVR), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (afib), and recent admission for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with decortication and pleurectomy for left hemothorax. The patient was admitted with altered mental status, left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection, and newly developed left-sided pleural effusion.

24-hour events include increased left pleural effusion, which was detected on a chest X-ray. Thoracics were consulted and planned an ultrasound-guided thoracentesis at the bedside. The patient received multiple antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, cefepime, and vancomycin. Pantoprazole (Protonix) was also administered. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106/52 to 134/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.

Physical examination findings include an irregular heartbeat without obvious murmurs, coarse bilateral breath sounds with decreased breath sounds at the left base, wet upper airway sounds, soft abdomen with slightly tender lower extrem"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, recent left hemothorax post VATS decortication, admitted with altered mental status possibly related to pain versus presumed pneumonia, as well as left lower extremity hematoma presumably related to ruptured Baker's cyst. The patient has shown improvement overall, but yesterday had left-sided white-out on chest X-ray.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 67 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 132/59 mmHg to 148/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,941 mL with total output of 1,195 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the left base, and the extremities show a wrapped left lower extremity in a boot. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 143 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 20 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.6 mg/dL, glucose of 118 mg/dL, and sodium of 134 mEq/L. Other lab values are within normal range. The imaging shows slightly increased aeration of the left lung, with effusion similar to the previous day's X-ray.

Assessment and plan include delirium resolved due to infection and pain, complete short course of antibiotics for presumed pneumonia, prn Haldol for agitation, and half dose trazodone at night to assess for better mental status in the morning. The patient is also being monitored for presumed left lower extremity hematoma, left-sided effusion versus mucous plugging, acute on chronic renal failure, MDS/anemia, CAD status post CABG and ICM, and COPD.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pneumonia, development of new lung pathology such as atelectasis or pneumothorax, worsening of renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobilization, and worsening of COPD symptoms. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions should be implemented to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of COPD, coronary artery disease, and recent left hemothorax following VATS decortication. He was admitted with altered mental status possibly related to pain or presumed pneumonia, as well as a left lower extremity (LLE) hematoma presumably related to a ruptured Baker's cyst. The patient's overall clinical improvement was observed, but yesterday he had left-sided white-out on chest X-ray (CXR).

The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/59 mmHg to 148/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm was atrial fibrillation (AF).

Physical examination findings included diminished breath sounds on the left base, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and attentive neurologic status. The patient's extremities were wrapped in a boot on the left leg.

Laboratory results showed a white blood cell (WBC) count within normal range, slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) levels, normal platelet count (Plt), and normal glucose levels. Other lab values including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T"

   Imaging: [**5-9**] Chest CT wet read: LLL collapse
   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, MVR, afib, COPD, s/p recent admission for
   VATS/decortication/pleurectomy for L hemothorax was admitted with
   altered mental status, LLE fluid collection, and newly developed left
   sided pleural effusion.
   1. Altered Mental Status:
   Continued waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] c/w intermittent delirium. Etiology was
   most likely due to infection and pain.
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin
   - pain control
   - follow-up blood, urine cultures
   - hold sedating medications
   - haldol prn
   2. Left sided pleural effusion/Collapse
   Pleural effusion was diagnosed on CXR for evaluation of tachypnea.
   Etiology is unclear, although patient is certainly at risk for
   reaccumulation of hemothorax (although hct stable). Thoracics was
   consulted and do not recommend [**Female First Name (un) 231**] at this point.
   - appreciate thoracics input
   - CT chest w/o contrast to eval effusion -> shows persistent collapse
   - Stable for now, hold on procedures
   - RT -> MIE
   3. LLE hematoma
   Ultrasound suggestive of [**Hospital Ward Name 5060**] cyst with hemorrhage/clot.  He
   underwent aspiration with serosanguinous fluid withimprovement in
   symptoms.
   - follow-up joint fluid culture -> NTGD
   - Hct daily
   - appreciate ortho input
   4. Epistaxis
   Resolved.  Dry mucosa. Bleed controlled with pressure, Afrin, ddAVP
   - Continue to monitor
   - Ent eval if recurs
   - Hold on NT suction
   - Vit K supplement
   5. Anemia:
   Etiology thought likely related to MDS and inflammation with baseline
   hct 28. Hct is slightly low in the setting of bleeding, although has
   been stable.
   - continue daily hct checks
   - transfuse if evidence of further bleeding
   - maintain active T/S
   - GI consult given guaiac + stool
> outpt endoscopy, unless opens up
   from a GI source
   - change to PO PPI
   6. Tachypnea
   Thought likely related to hospital-acquired pneumonia and pleural
   effusion.
   - continue vancomycin and cefepime to complete an 8 day course
   - appreciate thoracics input and plan for thoracentesis today
   - Check vanco level Sunday [**5-9**] AM
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine culture
   - Supportive care with 02, nebulizers
   - Chest PT, frequent suctioning
   7. Hypernatremia: Na trending up again
   - Increase free water flushes in PEG
   8. CAD s/p CABG:
   No symptoms of ischemia currently, or on EKG
   - Cont Metoprolol
   - ? not on ASA (given bleeding), statin
   9. Afib: Afib on EKG.
   - Cont metoprolol
   - Hold anticoag given bleed
   10. CHF:
   Per OSH Echo in [**2115**], EF 40%.  Echo here with EF 45% so stable.  Likely
   ischemic in origin given CAD.  Currently no signs of gross fluid
   overload
   - Cont BB
   11. COPD: Unclear degree of COPD.  No PFTs available
   - Albuterol, ipratropium prn
   - 02 as needed
   12.Acute on chronic renal failure:
   Baseline Cr 2.  FE Na is 1.5%. Currently slightly above.  Differential
   includes pre-renal physiology given underlying infection or decreased
   in setting of bleeding.
   - f/u urine cx
   - Cont to trend
   - send urine lytes, eos to assess today
   13. Thrombocytopenia: Prior Plt count 50-70s.  Per recent hematology
   eval likely multifactorial to include MDS, inflammation, CKD.
   Currently at baseline.
   - Active T/S, consent
   - Xfuse Plt <10
   14. HTN: Tolerating home metoprolol
   .
   15. Goals of care: Will consult palliative care to help discussion with
   goals of care and coordinating with family

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent admission for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) / decortication / pleurectomy for left hemothorax.
- The patient was admitted with altered mental status, left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection, and newly developed left-sided pleural effusion.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues, including delirium, left lower extremity hematoma, epistaxis, anemia, tachypnea, hypernatremia, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), thrombocytopenia, hypertension (HTN), and acute on chronic renal failure.
- The patient underwent various interventions, such as aspiration of the LLE hematoma, administration of antibiotics, adjustment of medications, and consultation with different specialists.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he remains critically ill and requires ongoing monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been treated with antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and pleural effusion. Close monitoring of blood cultures and sputum cultures is essential to prevent further infections"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, MVR, afib, COPD, s/p recent admission for
   VATS/decortication/pleurectomy for L hemothorax was admitted with
   altered mental status, LLE fluid collection, and newly developed left
   sided pleural effusion.
   1. Altered Mental Status:
   Continued waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] c/w intermittent delirium. Etiology was
   most likely due to infection and pain.
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin
   - pain control
   - follow-up blood, urine cultures
   - hold sedating medications
   - haldol prn
   2. Left sided pleural effusion
   Pleural effusion was diagnosed on CXR for evaluation of tachypnea.
   Etiology is unclear, although patient is certainly at risk for
   reaccumulation of hemothorax (although hct stable). Thoracics was
   consulted and do not recommend [**Female First Name (un) 231**] at this point.
   - appreciate thoracics input
   - CT chest w/o contrast to eval effusion
   3. LLE hematoma
   Ultrasound suggestive of [**Hospital Ward Name 5060**] cyst with hemorrhage/clot.  He
   underwent aspiration with serosanguinous fluid withimprovement in
   symptoms.
   - follow-up joint fluid culture
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct
   - appreciate ortho input
   4. Epistaxis
   Resolved.  Dry mucosa. Bleed controlled with pressure, Afrin, ddAVP
   - Continue to monitor
   - Ent eval if recurs
   - Hold on NT suction
   - Vit K supplement
   5. Anemia:
   Etiology thought likely related to MDS and inflammation with baseline
   hct 28. Hct is slightly low in the setting of bleeding, although has
   been stable.
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] hct checks
   - transfuse if evidence of further bleeding
   - maintain active T/S
   - GI consult given guaiac + stool
> outpt endoscopy, unless opens up
   from a GI source
   - change to PO PPI
   6. Tachypnea
   Thought likely related to hospital-acquired pneumonia and pleural
   effusion.
   - continue vancomycin and cefepime to complete an 8 day course
   - appreciate thoracics input and plan for thoracentesis today
   - Check vanco level Sunday [**5-9**] AM
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine culture
   - Supportive care with 02, nebulizers
   - Chest PT, frequent suctioning
   7. Hypernatremia
   Resolved
   8. CAD s/p CABG:
   No symptoms of ischemia currently, or on EKG
   - Cont Metoprolol
   - ? not on ASA (given bleeding), statin
   9. Afib: Afib on EKG.
   - Cont metoprolol
   - Hold anticoag given bleed
   10. CHF:
   Per OSH Echo in [**2115**], EF 40%.  Echo here with EF 45% so stable.  Likely
   ischemic in origin given CAD.  Currently no signs of gross fluid
   overload
   - Cont BB
   11. COPD: Unclear degree of COPD.  No PFTs available
   - Albuterol, ipratropium prn
   - 02 as needed
   12.Acute on chronic renal failure:
   Baseline Cr 2.  FE Na is 1.5%. Currently slightly above.  Differential
   includes pre-renal physiology given underlying infection or decreased
   in setting of bleeding.
   - f/u urine cx
   - Cont to trend
   - send urine lytes, eos to assess today
   13. Thrombocytopenia: Prior Plt count 50-70s.  Per recent hematology
   eval likely multifactorial to include MDS, inflammation, CKD.
   Currently at baseline.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (Afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and previous admission for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)/decortication/pleurectomy for left hemothorax. The patient was admitted with altered mental status, left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection, and newly developed left-sided pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the assessment and plan include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient continues to experience intermittent delirium, likely due to infection and pain. It is important to continue the antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin), manage pain, follow-up blood and urine cultures, hold sedating medications, and use haloperidol as needed.

2. Left-sided Pleural Effusion: The etiology of the pleural effusion is unclear, although the patient is at risk for reaccumulation of hemothorax. A thoracic consultation has recommended against thoracentesis at this point. It is important to appreciate the thoracic input, perform a CT chest without contrast to evaluate the effusion, and consider further interventions if necessary.

3. LLE Hematoma: An ultrasound suggests a possible joint cyst with hemorrhage/clot"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, MVR, afib, COPD, s/p recent admission for
   VATS/decortication/pleurectomy for L hemothorax was admitted with
   altered mental status, LLE fluid collection, and newly developed left
   sided pleural effusion.
   1. Altered Mental Status:
   Continued waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] c/w intermittent delirium. Etiology was
   most likely due to infection and pain.
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin
   - pain control
   - follow-up blood, urine cultures
   - hold sedating medications
   - haldol prn
   2. Left sided pleural effusion
   Pleural effusion was diagnosed on CXR for evaluation of tachypnea.
   Etiology is unclear, although patient is certainly at risk for
   reaccumulation of hemothorax (although hct stable). Thoracics was
   consulted and do not recommend [**Female First Name (un) 231**] at this point.
   - appreciate thoracics input
   - CT chest w/o contrast to eval effusion
   3. LLE hematoma
   Ultrasound suggestive of [**Hospital Ward Name 5060**] cyst with hemorrhage/clot.  He
   underwent aspiration with serosanguinous fluid withimprovement in
   symptoms.
   - follow-up joint fluid culture
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct
   - appreciate ortho input
   4. Epistaxis
   Resolved.  Dry mucosa. Bleed controlled with pressure, Afrin, ddAVP
   - Continue to monitor
   - Ent eval if recurs
   - Hold on NT suction
   - Vit K supplement
   5. Anemia:
   Etiology thought likely related to MDS and inflammation with baseline
   hct 28. Hct is slightly low in the setting of bleeding, although has
   been stable.
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] hct checks
   - transfuse if evidence of further bleeding
   - maintain active T/S
   - GI consult given guaiac + stool
> outpt endoscopy, unless opens up
   from a GI source
   - change to PO PPI
   6. Tachypnea
   Thought likely related to hospital-acquired pneumonia and pleural
   effusion.
   - continue vancomycin and cefepime to complete an 8 day course
   - appreciate thoracics input and plan for thoracentesis today
   - Check vanco level Sunday [**5-9**] AM
   - f/u sputum, blood, urine culture
   - Supportive care with 02, nebulizers
   - Chest PT, frequent suctioning
   7. Hypernatremia
   Resolved
   8. CAD s/p CABG:
   No symptoms of ischemia currently, or on EKG
   - Cont Metoprolol
   - ? not on ASA (given bleeding), statin
   9. Afib: Afib on EKG.
   - Cont metoprolol
   - Hold anticoag given bleed
   10. CHF:
   Per OSH Echo in [**2115**], EF 40%.  Echo here with EF 45% so stable.  Likely
   ischemic in origin given CAD.  Currently no signs of gross fluid
   overload
   - Cont BB
   11. COPD: Unclear degree of COPD.  No PFTs available
   - Albuterol, ipratropium prn
   - 02 as needed

   includes pre-renal physiology given underlying infection or decreased
   in setting of bleeding.
   - f/u urine cx
   - Cont to trend
   - send urine lytes, eos to assess today
   13. Thrombocytopenia: Prior Plt count 50-70s.  Per recent hematology
   eval likely multifactorial to include MDS, inflammation, CKD.
   Currently at baseline.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG and MVR, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. He was admitted with altered mental status, left leg edema, and a new left-sided pleural effusion. The patient underwent VATS/decortication/pleurectomy for a left hemothorax. He has been receiving cefepime and vancomycin for infection, pain control, and follow-up cultures. The patient has intermittent delirium, which is likely due to infection and pain. The pleural effusion etiology is unclear, and a CT chest without contrast has been ordered to evaluate the effusion. The patient also has a left lower extremity hematoma that was aspirated and showed improvement. He has resolved epistaxis and anemia, which is thought to be related to MDS and inflammation. The patient's tachypnea is likely related to hospital-acquired pneumonia and the pleural effusion. Hypernatremia has resolved, and there are no current symptoms of ischemia in the context of CAD. The patient has atrial fibrillation on EKG and stable CHF with an EF of 45%. The patient's COPD is unclear without available PFTs. He has acute on chronic renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and hypertension.

   GOALS OF CARE-  family meeting yesterday btw team and pulmonary fellow
   Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 6181**] and pt
s  son and daughter to discuss care options.
   This addressed patient's prognosis, and that given his prolonged
   bedrest and numerous complications, any recovery will be very slow and
   [**Male First Name (un) **] and  that the likelihood of his returning to independent quality
   is very low. Additionally given the recurrent mucous plugging and prior
   history of recurrent plug, aggressive care might entail a tracheostomy
   to facilitate clearance, though this would not necessarily change his
   overall poor prognosis. The team noted significant resistance from the
   son accepting this assessment, but some element of understanding/
   acceptance from patient and wife. In addition the patient has made
   repeated statements about NOT wanting aggressive care when talking to
   nursing/medical team.
   Pall Care c/s.
   Plan to hold another family mtg this pm, possibly w/ Pall Care svce.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including COPD, coronary artery disease (CAD), recent left hemothorax following video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) decortication, and other comorbidities. The patient was admitted with altered mental status possibly related to pain versus presumed pneumonia, as well as left lower extremity (LLE) hematoma presumably related to a ruptured Baker's cyst.

The patient has shown improvement clinically but now presents with left-sided white-out on chest X-rays. Overnight, the patient pulled out his central line and received trazodone and lorazepam for delirium. He has no known drug allergies.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/54 to 145/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,556 mL and output of 1,670 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery but no invasive mechanical ventilation. The patient is also on multiple medications including lorazepam, Tylenol, lansoprazole, and multivitamins.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.3 K"

   GOALS OF CARE- spoke to family (son and daughter) yesterday extensively
   about care options. I discussed patient's prognosis, and that given his
   prolonged bedrest and numerous complications, any recovery will be very
   slow and [**Male First Name (un) **]. I commented that the likelihood of returning to
   independent quality is very very low. Additionally given the recurrent
   mucous plugging and prior history of recurrent plug, aggressive care
   would entail a tracheostomy to facilitate clearance. I noted, however,
   that this would not necessarily change his overall poor prognosis. I
   noted significant resistance from the son accepting this assessment,
   but some element of understanding/ acceptance from patient and wife.
   [**Name (NI) **] made repeated statements about NOT wanting aggressive care.
   Will ask Pall Care svce to get involved. Will start SSRI as well for
   possible depresssion.
   Plan to hold another family mtg this pm, possibly w/ Pall Care svce.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, recent left hemothorax after VATS decortication, admitted with altered mental status possibly related to pain or presumed pneumonia, as well as left lower extremity hematoma presumably related to a ruptured Baker's cyst. The patient has shown overall improvement but had a left-sided white-out on chest X-ray. The patient pulled out the central line overnight and received trazodone and lorazepam for agitation.

Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is delirious and agitated, likely due to infection, pain, or medication.
2. Mucous plugging: The patient is still somewhat tachypneic and has recurrent issues with mucous plugging, which may be due to poor cough.
3. Presumed pneumonia: The patient has a right lower lobe infiltrate and is on complete antibiotics for 8 days.
4. Left lower extremity hematoma: The patient has a stable hematoma in the left leg, presumably due to a ruptured Baker's cyst.
5. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient may have prerenal vs intrinsic renal acute tubular necrosis from now-resolving infection.
6. MDS/anemia: The patient has stable anemia.
7. CAD s/p CABG, ICM: The patient's coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting is stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including pneumonia, chronic renal failure, MDS/anemia, CAD post CABG, ICM, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. He is currently admitted to the ICU with acute mental status changes, presumed pneumonia, and other comorbidities. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight elevation in temperature. He is on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving antibiotics for his pneumonia. The patient's recent lab results show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine, and slightly elevated liver enzymes.

Potential medical complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to prerenal or intrinsic renal ATN from infection.
2. Pneumonia with worsening respiratory support needed.
3. Hematoma in the left leg, possibly related to a ruptured Baker's cyst.
4. Potential bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy.
5. Chronic renal failure with potential need for dialysis.
6. MDS/anemia requiring further management.
7. History of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).
8. Atrial fibrillation requiring rate control and anticoagulation management.
9. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with respiratory support needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   DELIRIUM- slightly less oriented this am due, perhaps due to overnight
   benzo and trazodone
   - resolved, likely due to infection, pain
   -complete short course ABX for pna as below
   -prn Haldol for agitation, optimize sleep wake as much as possible
   -will dc trazodone and avoid future benzo use
   MUCOUS PLUGGING- still somewhat tachypneic, has been a recurrent issue
   due to poor cough and is s/p 3 bronchs in [**Month (only) 11**] for recurrent plugging.
   -will try aggressive chest PT, nebs bd and mucomyst, cough assist
   device/ MIE
   --he would poorly tolerate bronch/conscious sedation and would require
   intubation for procedure.  Also unlikely to tolerate nippv mask given
   delirium
   -appreciate thoracics input
   PRESUMED PNEUMONIA
   - RLL infiltrate
   - Cont Vanco, Cefepime complete 8d (day 6) course
   LLE HEMATOMA
   -stable presumably d/t ruptured Bakers cyst
   -trend Hct
   -Ortho, Vascular following --> wrapping LE
   -question when PT/OT appropriate for pt?
   VASCULAR ACCESS- pulled out central line yest
   -will plan for PICC placement tomorrow
   ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE- prerenal vs intrinsic renal ATN from
   now-resolving infxn
   -continue to monitor
   MDS/ANEMIA- stable
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **] for guaiac + stools
   CAD s/p CABG, ICM- stable
   - Cont Metoprolol
   - hold on adding ASA for now given bleeding; can start statin prior to
   dc
   AFIB- stable

   GOALS OF CARE-  family meeting yesterday btw team and pulmonary fellow
   Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 6181**] and pt
s  son and daughter to discuss care options.
   This addressed patient's prognosis, and that given his prolonged
   bedrest and numerous complications, any recovery will be very slow and
   [**Male First Name (un) **] and  that the likelihood of his returning to independent quality
   is very low. Additionally given the recurrent mucous plugging and prior
   history of recurrent plug, aggressive care might entail a tracheostomy
   to facilitate clearance, though this would not necessarily change his
   overall poor prognosis. The team noted significant resistance from the
   son accepting this assessment, but some element of understanding/
   acceptance from patient and wife. In addition the patient has made
   repeated statements about NOT wanting aggressive care when talking to
   nursing/medical team.
   Pall Care c/s.
   Plan to hold another family mtg this pm, possibly w/ Pall Care svce.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including chronic renal failure, coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass graft (CAD s/p CABG), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to presumed pneumonia with right lower lobe infiltrate, acute on chronic renal failure, and a left lower extremity hematoma.

The patient has been experiencing delirium, which is likely due to infection and pain. Antibiotics have been prescribed for pneumonia, and benzodiazepines have been stopped to avoid worsening delirium. The patient's mucous plugging persists, causing recurrent issues with breathing. Aggressive chest physiotherapy, nebulizers, mucomyst, cough assist device, and mechanical in-exsufflation (MIE) are planned to manage this problem.

The patient has a stable cardiac status with controlled atrial fibrillation and controlled COPD symptoms. Renal function is being closely monitored due to acute on chronic renal failure, and the patient has a history of anemia (myelodysplastic syndrome).

The patient's prognosis is poor due to prolonged bedrest and numerous complications. A family meeting was held to discuss care options, but there is resistance from the son accepting the assessment. The patient has expressed repeated statements about not wanting aggressive care. Palliative care services have been consulted, and"

   Large L pleural effusion, appears improved from [**5-10**]
   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, MVR, afib, COPD, s/p recent admission for
   VATS/decortication/pleurectomy for L hemothorax was admitted with
   altered mental status, LLE fluid collection and persistent mucus
   plugging now w/ acute alteration of mental status.
   * Altered Mental Status:
   Much worse this am on rounds although continued waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] c/w
   intermittent delirium. Etiology was most likely due to infection and
   pain.  Now w/ concern for acute stroke vs hypercarbia.
   - pain control
   - treating ?infection as below
   - hold sedating medications
   - haldol prn, zyprexa QHS
   - have called the son to discuss goals of care given that the patient
   prevented us from obtaining an ABG, will not be able to get a head CT
   given respiratory status
   - he has been made DNR/DNI given his living will
   .
   * Respiratory distress
   Respiratory status much improved, no fever or leukocytosis. Mucous
   plugging and pleural effusion likely also were contributors to
   respiratory distress.
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin currently d7 complete 8d course for
   possible HCAP
   - prn bronchodilators
   - suctioning, chest PT as needed
   - thoracics recs appreciated
   .
   * Left sided pleural effusion/Collapse
   Patient has history of recurrent L pleural effusion, underwent
   decortication and pleurectomy [**2117-4-16**].  Hct stable arguing against
   significant bleeding into pleural space.
   - appreciate thoracics input
 no plan for thoracentesis at this time
   - CT chest w/o contrast to eval effusion -> shows persistent collapse
   - RT -> MIE
   * LLE hematoma
   Hct now stable.  Ultrasound suggestive of [**Hospital Ward Name 5060**] cyst with
   hemorrhage/clot.  He underwent aspiration with serosanguinous fluid
   with improvement in symptoms.
   - follow-up joint fluid culture -> NTGD
   - Hct daily
   - appreciate ortho input
   * Anemia:
   Etiology thought likely related to MDS and inflammation with baseline
   hct 28. Hct is slightly low in the setting of bleeding, although has
   been stable.
   - continue daily hct checks
   - transfuse if evidence of further bleeding, hb>7
   - maintain active T/S
   - GI consult given guaiac + stool
> outpt endoscopy, unless opens up
   from a GI source
   - change to PO PPI
   * Hypernatremia: Na trending up again yesterday.  We were unable to get
   AM labs so unclear what it is today.
   - Increase free water flushes in PEG
   * CAD s/p CABG:
   No symptoms of ischemia currently, or on EKG
   - Cont Metoprolol
   - ? not on ASA (given bleeding), statin
   * Afib: Afib on EKG.
   - Cont metoprolol
   - Hold anticoag given bleed
   * CHF:
   Per OSH Echo in [**2115**], EF 40%.  Echo here with EF 45% so stable.  Likely
   ischemic in origin given CAD.  Currently no signs of gross fluid
   overload
   - Cont BB
   * COPD: Unclear degree of COPD.  No PFTs available
   - Albuterol, ipratropium prn
   - 02 as needed
   * Acute on chronic renal failure: Stable.
   Baseline Cr 2.  FE Na is 1.5%. Currently slightly above.  Differential
   includes pre-renal physiology given underlying infection or decreased
   in setting of bleeding.
   - f/u urine cx
   - Cont to trend
   - send urine lytes, eos to assess today
   *  Thrombocytopenia: Prior Plt count 50-70s.  Per recent hematology
   eval likely multifactorial to include MDS, inflammation, CKD.
   Currently at baseline.
   - Active T/S, consent
   - Xfuse Plt <10
   * HTN: Tolerating home metoprolol
   .

","The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent admission for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and decortication/pleurectomy for left hemothorax. The patient was admitted with altered mental status, left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection, and persistent mucus plugging. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Altered mental status: The patient has intermittent delirium, and the etiology is likely due to infection and pain. There is concern for acute stroke vs hypercarbia.
- Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status has improved, and mucous plugging and pleural effusion likely contributed to respiratory distress.
- Left-sided pleural effusion/collapse: The patient has a history of recurrent left pleural effusion and underwent decortication and pleurectomy on [2117-4-16]. The Hct is stable, arguing against significant bleeding into the pleural space.
- LLE hematoma: The patient had a hematoma, which is now stable. Ultrasound suggests a cyst with hemorrhage/clot. Aspiration was performed with serosanguinous fluid, and symptoms improved.
- Anemia: The etiology"

","The patient in the ICU is experiencing altered mental status. There are no changes in the chest X-ray. The patient is receiving thoracic support and may undergo a tracheostomy next week, depending on the family's wishes. The family has started shifting towards comfort care and against the tracheostomy. They have not made a definitive decision on code status, but are leaning towards going home soon with comfort measures to avoid further procedures or long hospitalizations.

The patient's allergies include trazodone, and they have received antibiotics such as vancomycin and cefepime. The patient is on various ICU medications and other medications. There are no changes to the medical and family history. The review of systems remains unchanged except for pain and dyspnea, which the patient denies.

The vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 90 bpm (75-105 bpm), blood pressure of 134/67 mmHg (84-172/42-132 mmHg), respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute (17-39 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The fluid balance shows an input of 1,731 mL and output of 940 mL, resulting in a balance of 791 mL. The respiratory support indicates an oxygen saturation of 98% and ABG results are pending. The physical examination reveals that the patient appears comfortable"

   CXR
   Large L pleural effusion, appears improved from [**5-10**]
   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, MVR, afib, COPD, s/p recent admission for
   VATS/decortication/pleurectomy for L hemothorax was admitted with
   altered mental status, LLE fluid collection, and newly developed left
   sided pleural effusion.
   * Altered Mental Status:
   Continued waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] c/w intermittent delirium. Etiology was
   most likely due to infection and pain.
   - pain control
   - treating ?infection as below
   - hold sedating medications
   - haldol prn, zyprexa QHS
   .
   * Respiratory distress
   Respiratory status much improved, no fever or leukocytosis. Mucous
   plugging and pleural effusion likely also were contributors to
   respiratory distress.
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin currently d7 complete 8d course for
   possible HCAP
   - prn bronchodilators
   - suctioning, chest PT as needed
   - thoracics recs appreciated
   .
   * Left sided pleural effusion/Collapse
   Patient has history of recurrent L pleural effusion, underwent
   decortication and pleurectomy [**2117-4-16**].  Hct stable arguing against
   significant bleeding into pleural space.
   - appreciate thoracics input
 no plan for thoracentesis at this time
   - CT chest w/o contrast to eval effusion -> shows persistent collapse
   - RT -> MIE
   * LLE hematoma
   Ultrasound suggestive of [**Hospital Ward Name 5060**] cyst with hemorrhage/clot.  He
   underwent aspiration with serosanguinous fluid with improvement in
   symptoms.
   - follow-up joint fluid culture -> NTGD
   - Hct daily
   - appreciate ortho input
   * Anemia:
   Etiology thought likely related to MDS and inflammation with baseline
   hct 28. Hct is slightly low in the setting of bleeding, although has
   been stable.
   - continue daily hct checks
   - transfuse if evidence of further bleeding, hb>7
   - maintain active T/S
   - GI consult given guaiac + stool
> outpt endoscopy, unless opens up
   from a GI source
   - change to PO PPI
   * Hypernatremia: Na trending up again
   - Increase free water flushes in PEG
   * CAD s/p CABG:
   No symptoms of ischemia currently, or on EKG
   - Cont Metoprolol
   - ? not on ASA (given bleeding), statin
   * Afib: Afib on EKG.
   - Cont metoprolol
   - Hold anticoag given bleed
   * CHF:
   Per OSH Echo in [**2115**], EF 40%.  Echo here with EF 45% so stable.  Likely
   ischemic in origin given CAD.  Currently no signs of gross fluid
   overload
   - Cont BB
   * COPD: Unclear degree of COPD.  No PFTs available
   - Albuterol, ipratropium prn
   - 02 as needed
   * Acute on chronic renal failure:
   Baseline Cr 2.  FE Na is 1.5%. Currently slightly above.  Differential
   includes pre-renal physiology given underlying infection or decreased
   in setting of bleeding.
   - f/u urine cx
   - Cont to trend
   - send urine lytes, eos to assess today
   *  Thrombocytopenia: Prior Plt count 50-70s.  Per recent hematology
   eval likely multifactorial to include MDS, inflammation, CKD.
   Currently at baseline.
   - Active T/S, consent
   - Xfuse Plt <10
   * HTN: Tolerating home metoprolol
   .
   * Goals of care: Will consult palliative care to help discussion with
   goals of care and coordinating with family

   VAP:  n/a
   Communication: Patient discussed on interdisciplinary rounds
   Code status: Full code to discuss with family again today
   Disposition:ICU
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent admission for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)/decortication/pleurectomy for left hemothorax. The patient was admitted with altered mental status, left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection, and newly developed left-sided pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient continues to exhibit intermittent delirium, likely due to infection and pain. Pain control and treating the suspected infection are essential in addressing this complication.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status has improved, with no fever or leukocytosis. Mucous plugging and pleural effusion may have contributed to the respiratory distress. Continuing the current antibiotics, using bronchodilators as needed, performing suctioning and chest physiotherapy, and considering thoracic procedures are recommended.

3. Left Sided Pleural Effusion/Collapse: The patient has a history of recurrent left pleural effusion, which was previously treated with decortication and pleurectomy. A CT chest without contrast shows persistent collapse. Right-to-left (RT) intubation and mechanical ventilation (MIE) may"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, MVR, afib, COPD, s/p recent admission for
   VATS/decortication/pleurectomy for L hemothorax was admitted with
   altered mental status, LLE fluid collection and persistent mucus
   plugging now w/ acute alteration of mental status.
   * Goals of care
   Will discuss with family and palliative care today regarding
   transistioning to hospice
   - Holding off on labs and invasive procedures at this time with NO
   escalation of care
   * Altered Mental Status:
   Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] remains poor
   Much worse this am on rounds although continued waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] c/w
   intermittent delirium. Etiology was most likely due to infection and
   pain.  Now w/ concern for acute stroke vs hypercarbia.
   - pain control
   - treating ?infection as below
   - hold sedating medications
   - haldol prn
   - he has been made DNR/DNI given his living will
   .
   * Respiratory distress
   Respiratory status much improved, no fever or leukocytosis. Mucous
   plugging and pleural effusion likely also were contributors to
   respiratory distress.
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin currently d7 complete 8d course for
   possible HCAP
   - prn bronchodilators
   - chest PT as needed HOLDING on suctioning
   - thoracics recs appreciated
   .
   * Left sided pleural effusion/Collapse
   Patient has history of recurrent L pleural effusion, underwent
   decortication and pleurectomy [**2117-4-16**].  Hct stable arguing against
   significant bleeding into pleural space.
   - appreciate thoracics input
 no plan for thoracentesis at this time
   - CT chest w/o contrast to eval effusion -> shows persistent collapse
   - RT -> MIE
   * LLE hematoma
   Hct now stable.  Ultrasound suggestive of [**Hospital Ward Name 5060**] cyst with
   hemorrhage/clot.  He underwent aspiration with serosanguinous fluid
   with improvement in symptoms.
   - follow-up joint fluid culture -> NTGD
   - Hct daily
 labs on hold
   - appreciate ortho input
   * Anemia:
   Etiology thought likely related to MDS and inflammation with baseline
   hct 28. Hct is slightly low in the setting of bleeding, although has
   been stable.
   - continue daily hct checks
 labs on hold
   - transfuse if evidence of further bleeding, hb>7
   - maintain active T/S
   - GI consult given guaiac + stool
> outpt endoscopy, unless opens up
   from a GI source
   - change to PO PPI
   * Hypernatremia: Na trending up again yesterday.  We were unable to get
   AM labs so unclear what it is today.
   - Increase free water flushes in PEG
   * CAD s/p CABG:
   No symptoms of ischemia currently, or on EKG
   - Cont Metoprolol
   - ? not on ASA (given bleeding), statin
   * Afib: Afib on EKG.
   - Cont metoprolol
   - Hold anticoag given bleed
   * CHF:
   Per OSH Echo in [**2115**], EF 40%.  Echo here with EF 45% so stable.  Likely
   ischemic in origin given CAD.  Currently no signs of gross fluid
   overload
   - Cont BB
   * COPD: Unclear degree of COPD.  No PFTs available
   - Albuterol, ipratropium prn
   - 02 as needed
   * Acute on chronic renal failure: Stable.
   Baseline Cr 2.  FE Na is 1.5%. Currently slightly above.  Differential
   includes pre-renal physiology given underlying infection or decreased
   in setting of bleeding.
   - f/u urine cx
   - Cont to trend
   - send urine lytes, eos to assess today
   *  Thrombocytopenia: Prior Plt count 50-70s.  Per recent hematology
   eval likely multifactorial to include MDS, inflammation, CKD.
   Currently at baseline.
   - Active T/S, consent
   - Xfuse Plt <10
   * HTN: Tolerating home metoprolol
   .
   * Goals of care: Will consult palliative care to help discussion with
   goals of care and coordinating with family

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and previous surgeries including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mitral valve replacement (MVR). He was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection, and persistent mucus plugging. The patient's condition has been worsening, with recent developments including acute alteration of mental status, respiratory distress, left-sided pleural effusion/collapse, and a left lower extremity hematoma. The patient has been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) given his living will.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory distress could be due to an underlying infection. The current treatment plan includes continuing cefepime and vancomycin for possible healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).
2. Stroke: The patient's acute alteration of mental status could also be attributed to a stroke. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.
3. Hypercarbia: The patient's altered mental status could be caused by high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood (hypercarbia). This condition may be due to respiratory failure and inadequate ventilation.
4. Pleural Effusion/Collapse: The patient's left-sided pleural effusion and lung collapse could lead to respiratory compromise if not properly"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, MVR, afib, COPD, s/p recent admission for
   VATS/decortication/pleurectomy for L hemothorax was admitted with
   altered mental status, LLE fluid collection and persistent mucus
   plugging now w/ acute alteration of mental status.
   * Altered Mental Status:
   Much worse this am on rounds although continued waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] c/w
   intermittent delirium. Etiology was most likely due to infection and
   pain.  Now w/ concern for acute stroke vs hypercarbia.
   - pain control
   - treating ?infection as below
   - hold sedating medications
   - haldol prn, zyprexa QHS
   - have called the son to discuss goals of care given that the patient
   prevented us from obtaining an ABG, will not be able to get a head CT
   given respiratory status
   - he has been made DNR/DNI given his living will
   .
   * Respiratory distress
   Respiratory status much improved, no fever or leukocytosis. Mucous
   plugging and pleural effusion likely also were contributors to
   respiratory distress.
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin currently d7 complete 8d course for
   possible HCAP
   - prn bronchodilators
   - suctioning, chest PT as needed
   - thoracics recs appreciated
   .
   * Left sided pleural effusion/Collapse
   Patient has history of recurrent L pleural effusion, underwent
   decortication and pleurectomy [**2117-4-16**].  Hct stable arguing against
   significant bleeding into pleural space.
   - appreciate thoracics input
 no plan for thoracentesis at this time
   - CT chest w/o contrast to eval effusion -> shows persistent collapse
   - RT -> MIE
   * LLE hematoma
   Hct now stable.  Ultrasound suggestive of [**Hospital Ward Name 5060**] cyst with
   hemorrhage/clot.  He underwent aspiration with serosanguinous fluid
   with improvement in symptoms.
   - follow-up joint fluid culture -> NTGD
   - Hct daily
   - appreciate ortho input
   * Anemia:
   Etiology thought likely related to MDS and inflammation with baseline
   hct 28. Hct is slightly low in the setting of bleeding, although has
   been stable.
   - continue daily hct checks
   - transfuse if evidence of further bleeding, hb>7
   - maintain active T/S
   - GI consult given guaiac + stool
> outpt endoscopy, unless opens up
   from a GI source
   - change to PO PPI
   * Hypernatremia: Na trending up again yesterday.  We were unable to get
   AM labs so unclear what it is today.
   - Increase free water flushes in PEG
   * CAD s/p CABG:
   No symptoms of ischemia currently, or on EKG
   - Cont Metoprolol
   - ? not on ASA (given bleeding), statin
   * Afib: Afib on EKG.
   - Cont metoprolol
   - Hold anticoag given bleed
   * CHF:
   Per OSH Echo in [**2115**], EF 40%.  Echo here with EF 45% so stable.  Likely
   ischemic in origin given CAD.  Currently no signs of gross fluid
   overload
   - Cont BB
   * COPD: Unclear degree of COPD.  No PFTs available
   - Albuterol, ipratropium prn
   - 02 as needed
   * Acute on chronic renal failure: Stable.
   Baseline Cr 2.  FE Na is 1.5%. Currently slightly above.  Differential
   includes pre-renal physiology given underlying infection or decreased
   in setting of bleeding.
   - f/u urine cx
   - Cont to trend
   - send urine lytes, eos to assess today
   *  Thrombocytopenia: Prior Plt count 50-70s.  Per recent hematology
   eval likely multifactorial to include MDS, inflammation, CKD.
   Currently at baseline.
   - Active T/S, consent
   - Xfuse Plt <10
   * HTN: Tolerating home metoprolol
   .
   * Goals of care: Will consult palliative care to help discussion with
   goals of care and coordinating with family

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (AFib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and previous admission for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) decortication/pleurectomy for left hemothorax. He was admitted with altered mental status, left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection, and persistent mucus plugging. The patient's condition has worsened, with acute alterations in mental status, respiratory distress, left-sided pleural effusion/collapse, and a left lower extremity hematoma. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been made DNR/DNI per his living will.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased large left pleural effusion and left basilar consolidation: This indicates a possible worsening of the patient's respiratory status, which could lead to further respiratory distress or pneumonia.
2. Unchanged right lower lobe pneumonia: The patient already has pneumonia in the right lower lobe, which can progress and worsen his respiratory status.
3. LLE hematoma: Although the patient's Hct is stable, the presence of a hematoma in the LLE can potentially lead to further complications if it expands or becomes infected.
4. Acute stroke vs hypercarbia: The patient's acute alteration in mental status"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mitral valve replacement (MVR). He also has atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient was admitted with altered mental status, left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection, and persistent mucus plugging. The initial assessment indicated delirium, possibly due to infection and pain, and concern for acute stroke or hypercarbia. Pain control, infection treatment, holding sedating medications, and administering haloperidol (Haldol) as needed and quetiapine (Zyprexa) at bedtime were recommended.

The patient's respiratory distress has improved, and he no longer has a fever or leukocytosis. Mucus plugging and pleural effusion were likely contributing factors to the respiratory distress. The plan includes continuing cefepime and vancomycin for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP), using bronchodilators as needed, suctioning, chest physiotherapy (PT), and considering thoracicness.

The patient has a history of recurrent left pleural effusion and underwent decortication and pleurectomy. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed persistent collapse without evidence of active infection. Right-to-left (RT) transfer was done"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and previous CABG, currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 110/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the left side, rhonchorous breath sounds diffusely, and trace edema in both extremities. Neurologic examination shows purposeful movement and normal tone. The patient is responsive to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 10.3 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, normal platelet count of 136 K/uL, elevated creatinine of 2.6 mg/dL, and normal glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Imaging shows increasing right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray.

Assessment and plan:
1. Depressed mental status (acutely): The patient's blood sugar is normal, but there is concern for increased dead space (increased CO2). No medication effects are present at the moment, but there is a possibility of a new stroke or bleed. The patient's mental status is fluctuating without a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of acute renal failure, chronic renal disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, COPD, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has been experiencing confusion, tachypnea, and decreased oxygen saturation. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the left side, trace edema in both lower extremities, and normal neurologic function. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, low hemoglobin, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 76-99 bpm and blood pressure between 110/48-143/94 mmHg. 

Potential Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's tachypnea, diminished breath sounds on the left side, and history of COPD suggest a potential risk for respiratory complications, including pneumonia or further exacerbation of COPD.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate ongoing renal dysfunction, which may progress to acute renal failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Bleeding: The patient has experienced bleeding events, including a left lower extremity hematoma. This indicates a potential risk for further bleeding complications.
4. Infection: The patient has a presumed pneumonia with right lower lobe infiltrates and an elevated white blood cell count. There is a risk of the infection spreading or developing additional infections.
5. Cardiovascular Events: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions including acute on chronic renal failure, presumed pneumonia, left lower lobe infiltrate, altered mental status, COPD, and a history of cardiac artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The patient has fluctuating mental status, tachypnea, and poor cough. He has a history of mucous plugging and bronchial hygiene. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing atrial fibrillation. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal glucose levels. The patient's chest X-ray shows an increasing right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient has been on various medications including antibiotics, sedatives, bronchodilators, and cardiovascular drugs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increased dead space due to increased CO2 levels, which can lead to respiratory acidosis and subsequent respiratory failure.
2. Risk of stroke or bleed given the patient's altered mental status and history of atrial fibrillation.
3. Recurrent mucous plugging and bronchial hygiene issues, which can lead to further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or atelectasis.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to prerenal vs intrinsic renal ATN from now-resolving infection.
5. Chronic renal failure exacerbation.

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, MVR, afib, COPD, s/p recent admission for
   VATS/decortication/pleurectomy for L hemothorax was admitted with
   altered mental status, LLE fluid collection and persistent mucus
   plugging now w/ acute alteration of mental status.
   * Goals of care
   Will discuss with family and palliative care today regarding
   transistioning to hospice
   - Holding off on labs and invasive procedures at this time with NO
   escalation of care
   * Altered Mental Status:
   Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] remains poor
   Much worse this am on rounds although continued waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] c/w
   intermittent delirium. Etiology was most likely due to infection and
   pain.  Now w/ concern for acute stroke vs hypercarbia.
   - pain control
   - treating ?infection as below
   - hold sedating medications
   - haldol prn
   - he has been made DNR/DNI given his living will
   .
   * Respiratory distress
   Respiratory status much improved, no fever or leukocytosis. Mucous
   plugging and pleural effusion likely also were contributors to
   respiratory distress.
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin currently d7 complete 8d course for
   possible HCAP
   - prn bronchodilators
   - chest PT as needed HOLDING on suctioning
   - thoracics recs appreciated
   .
   * Left sided pleural effusion/Collapse
   Patient has history of recurrent L pleural effusion, underwent
   decortication and pleurectomy [**2117-4-16**].  Hct stable arguing against
   significant bleeding into pleural space.
   - appreciate thoracics input
 no plan for thoracentesis at this time
   - CT chest w/o contrast to eval effusion -> shows persistent collapse

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous cardiac surgeries, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a recent admission for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) decortication/pleurectomy for left hemothorax. He was admitted with altered mental status, left lower extremity fluid collection, and persistent mucus plugging. The patient's condition has worsened, with acute alterations in mental status. He is currently on comfort measures only (CMO) per family discussion and his living will.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status has improved, but he still requires oxygen delivery via a face tent and has decreased breath sounds on the left chest. There is a concern for recurrent pleural effusion and collapse, as indicated by the CT chest without contrast. This may require further intervention, such as chest physical therapy or thoracentesis.
2. Left-sided pleural effusion/collapse: The patient has a history of recurrent left pleural effusion and underwent decortication and pleurectomy. The recent CT chest shows persistent collapse. This may necessitate additional treatment, such as thoracic input or minimally invasive excision (MIE).
3. Left lower extremity hematoma: The patient underwent aspiration of a serosanguinous fluid from the hematoma, which improved symptoms. Close monitoring of hemat"

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent admission for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)/decortication/pleurectomy for left hemothorax. He was admitted with altered mental status, left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection, and persistent mucus plugging. The patient's condition has worsened, leading to acute alteration of mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, as indicated by decreased breath sounds on the left chest and low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 89%). This could lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Infection: The presence of fluid collection in the LLE and persistent mucus plugging raises concerns about potential infections, such as pneumonia or pleural effusion.
3. Organ dysfunction: The patient's lab results show elevated lactate levels (26.3%) and elevated troponin-T levels (8), indicating possible organ dysfunction, specifically cardiac or renal dysfunction.
4. Bleeding risk: The patient's prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) are elevated, suggesting a higher risk of bleeding, especially considering the use of anticoag"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of poor dentition, presenting in the ICU with mucus plugging, increased lethargy, and an episode of atrial fibrillation. He has been on multiple antibiotics including cefepime and vancomycin, but his condition has not improved. His vital signs show a temperature of 35.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 131/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient is on respiratory support with a face tent and is receiving morphine sulfate for pain management.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.3 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 136 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 112 mEq/L. The patient's potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels are within normal range.

Given the patient's overall poor prognosis, the family has agreed to make him comfortable, and there are no plans for further lab draws or administration of medications. The patient will be maintained on morphine and ativan for comfort, and scopolamine will be used to optimize comfort as well."

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, MVR, afib, COPD, s/p recent admission for
   VATS/decortication/pleurectomy for L hemothorax was admitted with
   altered mental status, LLE fluid collection and persistent mucus
   plugging now w/ acute alteration of mental status.
   * Goals of care
   Family meeting held yesterday and the decision was made to make the
   patient CMO given his worsening respiratory status.
   * Altered Mental Status:
   Worsened now in setting of declining respiratory status and worsening
   hypoxia.  Goals now for comfort.
   - pain control with IV morphine
   - abx d/c
d given transition to CMO
   .
   * Respiratory distress: patient
s respiratory status declined overnight
   with worsening hypoxia.  Mucous plugging, infection and pleural
   effusion likely all contributors to respiratory failure.
   - completed 7 days of cefepime and vancomycin for possible HCAP
   - prn bronchodilators
   - HOLDING on suctioning given discomfort
   - thoracics recs appreciated
   .
   * Left sided pleural effusion/Collapse
   Patient has history of recurrent L pleural effusion, underwent
   decortication and pleurectomy [**2117-4-16**].  Hct stable arguing against
   significant bleeding into pleural space.
   - appreciate thoracics input
 no invasive procedures indicated
   - CT chest w/o contrast to eval effusion -> shows persistent collapse
   - RT -> MIE
   * LLE hematoma
   Hct now stable.  Ultrasound suggestive of [**Hospital Ward Name 5060**] cyst with
   hemorrhage/clot.  He underwent aspiration with serosanguinous fluid
   with improvement in symptoms.
   - follow-up joint fluid culture -> NTGD
   - Hct daily
 labs on hold
   - appreciate ortho input
   * Anemia:
   Etiology thought likely related to MDS and inflammation with baseline
   hct 28. Hct is slightly low in the setting of bleeding, although has
   been stable.
   - continue daily hct checks
 labs on hold
   - transfuse if evidence of further bleeding, hb>7
   - maintain active T/S
   - GI consult given guaiac + stool
> outpt endoscopy, unless opens up
   from a GI source
   - change to PO PPI
   * Hypernatremia: Na trending up again yesterday.  We were unable to get
   AM labs so unclear what it is today.
   - Increase free water flushes in PEG
   * CAD s/p CABG:
   No symptoms of ischemia currently, or on EKG
   - Cont Metoprolol
   - ? not on ASA (given bleeding), statin
   * Afib: Afib on EKG.
   - Cont metoprolol
   - Hold anticoag given bleed
   * CHF:
   Per OSH Echo in [**2115**], EF 40%.  Echo here with EF 45% so stable.  Likely
   ischemic in origin given CAD.  Currently no signs of gross fluid
   overload
   - Cont BB
   * COPD: Unclear degree of COPD.  No PFTs available
   - Albuterol, ipratropium prn
   - 02 as needed
   * Acute on chronic renal failure: Stable.
   Baseline Cr 2.  FE Na is 1.5%. Currently slightly above.  Differential
   includes pre-renal physiology given underlying infection or decreased
   in setting of bleeding.
   - f/u urine cx
   - Cont to trend
   - send urine lytes, eos to assess today
   *  Thrombocytopenia: Prior Plt count 50-70s.  Per recent hematology
   eval likely multifactorial to include MDS, inflammation, CKD.
   Currently at baseline.
   - Active T/S, consent

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), mitral valve replacement (MVR), atrial fibrillation (AF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted with altered mental status, left lower extremity (LLE) fluid collection, and persistent mucus plugging. The patient's respiratory status has worsened, leading to a decision to make him comfort measure only (CMO) based on family discussion and his living will. The goals of care now focus on comfort, including pain control with IV morphine and discontinuing antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status has declined, with worsening hypoxia. Mucous plugging, infection, and pleural effusion are likely contributors to respiratory failure.
2. Left Sided Pleural Effusion/Collapse: The patient has a history of recurrent left pleural effusion and underwent decortication and pleurectomy. A CT chest showed persistent collapse.
3. LLE Hematoma: The patient had a hematoma in his left lower extremity, which was aspirated with improvement in symptoms. The joint fluid culture was negative.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely related to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and inflammation. Hct is slightly low but stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including acute on chronic renal failure, presumed pneumonia, left lower lobe hematoma, acute mental status changes, and a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should monitor the patient closely for signs of infection and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and compromised blood flow can increase the risk of developing DVT, which can potentially lead to a life-threatening PE. Prophylactic measures such as boots and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin are in place to reduce this risk.
3. Delirium: The patient's mental status changes indicate delirium, which can be associated with various factors such as infections, medications, and other underlying medical conditions. It is important to manage the patient's environment, provide appropriate pain control, and avoid sedating medications to help reduce delirium.
4. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's history of COPD, there is an increased risk of respiratory complications such as mucous plugging and further deterioration of lung function. Aggressive chest physiotherapy,"

   88 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, MVR, afib, COPD, s/p recent admission for
   VATS/decortication/pleurectomy for L hemothorax was admitted with
   altered mental status, LLE fluid collection and persistent mucus
   plugging now w/ acute alteration of mental status.
   * Goals of care
   Will discuss with family and palliative care today regarding
   transistioning to hospice
   - Holding off on labs and invasive procedures at this time with NO
   escalation of care
   * Altered Mental Status:
   Waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] remains poor
   Much worse this am on rounds although continued waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 282**] c/w
   intermittent delirium. Etiology was most likely due to infection and
   pain.  Now w/ concern for acute stroke vs hypercarbia.
   - pain control
   - treating ?infection as below
   - hold sedating medications
   - haldol prn
   - he has been made DNR/DNI given his living will
   .
   * Respiratory distress
   Respiratory status much improved, no fever or leukocytosis. Mucous
   plugging and pleural effusion likely also were contributors to
   respiratory distress.
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin currently d7 complete 8d course for
   possible HCAP
   - prn bronchodilators
   - chest PT as needed HOLDING on suctioning
   - thoracics recs appreciated
   .
   * Left sided pleural effusion/Collapse
   Patient has history of recurrent L pleural effusion, underwent
   decortication and pleurectomy [**2117-4-16**].  Hct stable arguing against
   significant bleeding into pleural space.
   - appreciate thoracics input
 no plan for thoracentesis at this time
   - CT chest w/o contrast to eval effusion -> shows persistent collapse
   - RT -> MIE
   * LLE hematoma
   Hct now stable.  Ultrasound suggestive of [**Hospital Ward Name 5060**] cyst with
   hemorrhage/clot.  He underwent aspiration with serosanguinous fluid
   with improvement in symptoms.
   - follow-up joint fluid culture -> NTGD
   - Hct daily
 labs on hold
   - appreciate ortho input
   * Anemia:
   Etiology thought likely related to MDS and inflammation with baseline
   hct 28. Hct is slightly low in the setting of bleeding, although has
   been stable.
   - continue daily hct checks
 labs on hold
   - transfuse if evidence of further bleeding, hb>7
   - maintain active T/S
   - GI consult given guaiac + stool
> outpt endoscopy, unless opens up
   from a GI source
   - change to PO PPI
   * Hypernatremia: Na trending up again yesterday.  We were unable to get
   AM labs so unclear what it is today.
   - Increase free water flushes in PEG
   * CAD s/p CABG:
   No symptoms of ischemia currently, or on EKG
   - Cont Metoprolol

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous CABG and MVR, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was admitted with altered mental status, left lower extremity fluid collection, and persistent mucus plugging. The patient's condition has worsened, with concerns for acute stroke or hypercarbia. He is now on comfort measures only (CMO) per family discussion and his living will.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 2.5, indicating pre-existing renal impairment. This could be exacerbated by dehydration, medication side effects, or underlying infection.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are trending upwards, which may be due to insufficient fluid intake or electrolyte imbalances.
3. Anemia: The patient has a slightly low hemoglobin level, which may be related to bleeding, inflammation, or underlying myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can be attributed to various factors including MDS, inflammation, or chronic kidney disease.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within the lower range, indicating potential hypotension.
6. Acute respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status has improved but there is a concern for recurrent mucus plugging and"

   Assessment and Plan
   After meeting with family and given his overall poor prognosis decision
   to make him comfortable was agreed upon. We will use morphine and
   ativan as well as scopolamine to optimize comfort with no plans for
   further lab draws or medications to be administered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including heart disease and diabetes. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with recent episodes of mucus plugging and increased lethargy. The family has agreed to focus on comfort care, and the decision has been made to withhold aggressive treatments such as antibiotics, further lab draws, or additional medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as indicated by crackles in the chest and a low oxygen saturation level of 89%. There is a risk of further respiratory decline, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient has a history of heart disease, and his vital signs show atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 92 bpm. This could indicate underlying cardiac dysfunction, which may worsen over time.
3. Infection: Despite previous antibiotic treatment, the patient's condition suggests a possible ongoing infection, considering the presence of mucus plugging and elevated white blood cell count. This could lead to the progression of the infection and potentially systemic involvement.
4. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's mental status is altered, as evidenced by confusion and poor dentition. This can increase the risk of delirium and confusion, making it difficult to assess the patient's overall condition and response to treatment.
5. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of"
