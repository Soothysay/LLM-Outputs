","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent cord blood transplantation. He is currently in the ICU due to several complications. The patient's recent events include a transjugular liver biopsy resulting in bleeding and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration (HCT). He received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and his HCT increased from 18 to 27. The patient also has a moderate amount of intraperitoneal fluid, particularly in a perisplenic location, indicating intraperitoneal hemorrhage from a recent transjugular liver biopsy. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/70 mmHg to 177/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient has received various infusions and medications including caspofungin, flowsheet data showing fluid balance, and respiratory support with oxygen delivery. 

Laboratory results show leukopenia (WBC: 3.9-4.9 K/uL), thrombocytopenia (Plt: 46-130 K/uL), elevated creatinine (Cr: 2.0 mg/dL), elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 133/101 U/L, Alk Phos/T Bili: 123/5.0 mg/dL), and other abnormalities. The patient's viral loads for CMV, HCV, and HBV are negative. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's assessment includes ongoing monitoring of HCT, platelets, and serial abdominal exams. Surgery is aware of the situation but has declined intervention at this time. The interventional radiology team has been consulted, and the patient will continue to receive aggressive transfusions. 

The patient's multiple myeloma status post cord transplant is also being monitored. He is still transfusion-dependent and continues on immunosuppressive therapy. 

The patient's other conditions include BRBPR/diarrhea, ARF, and rising liver enzymes. He underwent an EGD and colonoscopy which showed gastritis and previous duodenitis; path negative for CMV/GVHD, also negative for evidence of amyloid. H. pylori was positive, but treatment has been withheld for now. 

The patient has persistent diarrhea despite increased immunosuppression for presumed GVH. His current immunosuppression regimen includes solu-medrol, cellcept, and cyclosporin. 

The patient's rising liver enzymes may be secondary to GVH or CMV infection. A transjugular liver biopsy was performed, and the results are pending. 

The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) is multifactorial and likely due to tacrolimus, cyclospor"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He is currently in the ICU with multiple complications. The patient's chief complaint is the recent development of a tunneled (Hickman) line, which was placed on April 23rd. 

The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with a decreasing hematocrit (HCT) level despite receiving a blood transfusion. A repeat CT scan showed an increase in the size of hepatic/intraperitoneal hemorrhage. The patient's platelet count is low, and there is evidence of hemolysis. 

The patient has also been experiencing gastrointestinal issues, including gastritis/duodenitis, and persistent diarrhea despite increased immunosuppression. A recent endoscopy did not reveal any signs of CMV/GVHD. H. pylori antibodies were positive, and a capsule showed persistent bleeding in the small bowel, but no intervention is planned at this time.

Additionally, the patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are rising, suggesting possible GVH (graft-versus-host disease). The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, indicating acute renal failure. The patient's blood viral loads for CMV, HCV, and HBV are negative. 

The patient is currently on various medications, including Ms Contin for pain management, cellcept, methylprednisolone, and cyclo"

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant 99 days ago. He has been experiencing complications including CMV viremia, GVHD in the liver and colon, acute renal failure (ARF), and low-level hemolysis. The patient's recent transjugular liver biopsy resulted in a bleed, leading to a drop in hematocrit (HCT). He received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and his HCT increased from 18 to 27. However, a repeat CT scan showed an increase in the size of the hepatic/intraperitoneal hemorrhage. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.6Â°C (99.6Â°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) of 36.9Â°C (98.5Â°F), heart rate (HR) of 92 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 112/70 mmHg to 177/100 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 3.9 to 4.9 thousand/mmÂ³, hemoglobin (Hgb) level ranging from 20.0 to 27.4 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count ranging from 57 to 130 thousand/mmÂ³, creatinine (Cr) level of 2.0 mg/dL, and liver enzymes (ALT/AST) elevated at 133/101 IU/L. Other lab values including bilirubin, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and albumin are within normal range. 

The patient's current medications include caspofungin, cellcept, methylprednisolone, cyclosporin, sucralfate, pantoprazole, and atorvastatin. He is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Continued bleeding due to low platelet count and the presence of a hepatic/intraperitoneal hemorrhage.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF) due to dehydration, medication toxicity (tacrolimus, cyclosporin), or ongoing complications from the cord blood transplant.
3. GVHD affecting the liver and colon, potentially leading to further liver enzyme abnormalities and gastrointestinal symptoms.
4. CMV reactivation or viremia, despite negative viral loads, which may necessitate adjustments in antiviral prophylaxis or treatment.
5. Persistent diarrhea and gastritis, possibly related to GVHD or other causes such as H. pylori infection.
6. Hypertension requiring ongoing management with antihypertensive medications.
7. Hyperglycemia associated with steroid use and the need for insulin therapy.
8. Risk of thrombosis due to central venous catheter placement and immobility.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition, laboratory values, and response to treatment in order to address these potential complications and optimize his overall management."

   thrombocytopenia. Will need to keep platelets > 50 until Hct
   stabilizes.
   Check hct [**5-10**] h for now. Aim for Hct ~23. Finally seems to be
   stabilizing.
   2. GVHD - on steroids, on cellcept, cyclo. On caspo for hx of fungal
   infection
   3. Thrombocytopenia - multifactorial, keep > 50K
   4. CMV viremia - most recent viral load negative on [**4-21**], on acyclovir
   5. ARF - making urine, not currently on dialysis, lytes ok
   6. HTN - stable, on norvasc, labetolol
   7. ID issues - low grade temps, no evidence of pneumonia. D/c levoflox.
   F/u cultures, so far negative.
   8. Pain control

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old individual who underwent a cord blood transplant and is now experiencing complications such as CMV viremia and GVHD. The patient also had a transjugular biopsy that was complicated by an acute bleed. The patient's current conditions include acute bleeding, refractory thrombocytopenia, GVHD, thrombocytopenia, CMV viremia, ARF, HTN, and ID issues. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have low-grade temperatures and no evidence of pneumonia. The patient's lab results show elevated levels of WBC, Hct, and Plt, while other lab values like Cr, Glucose, and LDH are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute bleeding: The patient's recent transjugular biopsy resulted in an acute bleed, which may lead to further complications if not properly managed.
2. GVHD: The patient is experiencing GVHD, which is a common complication after a transplant. It can cause damage to various organs and tissues.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding and difficulty in controlling the acute bleed.
4. CMV viremia: Although the patient's most recent viral load was negative, there is still a risk of CMV-related complications, such as pneumonia or other organ infections.
5. ARF: The patient is showing signs of"

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who is currently on day 100 post cord blood transplant. The patient's medical conditions include CMV viremia, acute renal failure (ARF), low-level hemolysis, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the liver and colon. 

The patient's recent events include a transjugular liver biopsy that showed findings consistent with acute GVHD, bleeding, and a drop in hemoglobin concentration. The patient has received blood transfusions and platelet transfusion to maintain target hemoglobin and platelet counts. 

The patient is currently being treated with multiple medications including Ms Contin for pain management, immunosuppressants such as cellcept and methylprednisolone for GVHD, and cyclosporin for transplant rejection. The patient is also receiving sucralfate and pantoprazole for gastritis/duodenitis, and TPN (total parenteral nutrition) due to persistent diarrhea. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, hyperkalemia, and an increase in creatinine levels. The patient has been treated for CMV viremia with different antiviral medications, but the cause of ARF remains unclear. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure that required treatment for hypertension. The patient's glucose levels are being monitored and managed with insulin in TPN.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of recurrent multiple myeloma who underwent a cord blood transplant. He is currently experiencing CMV viremia, acute renal failure (ARF), low-level hemolysis, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affecting the liver and colon. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has dropped from 29% to 25%, and he has received a blood transfusion. His platelet count is also low, and he is receiving platelet transfusions. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and there are signs of iron deposition in the liver. He has been diagnosed with acute GVHD based on liver biopsy results. The patient is on immunosuppressive medications including cellcept and methylprednisolone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CMV Viremia: The patient has tested positive for CMV viral load greater than 800 copies, indicating active CMV infection. This may require antiviral treatment.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.8 to 2.1, suggesting impaired kidney function. The cause of ARF is unclear but could be related to cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity, dehydration, chronic diarrhea, or renal GVHD.
3. Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD): The patient is experiencing GVHD in the liver and colon,"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yr old s/p cord blood transplant d 99, course complicated by CMV
   viremia and now GVHD.
   S/p transjugular biopsy complicated by acute bleed.
   1. Acute bleeding - in setting of transjugular bx with refractory
   thrombocytopenia. Will need to keep platelets > 50 until Hct
   stabilizes.  Check hct [**5-10**] h for now. Aim for Hct ~23. Finally seems to
   be stabilizing.
   2. GVHD - on steroids, on cellcept, cyclo. On caspo for hx of fungal
   infection. Cyclo level 200, will touch base with heme about lowering
   goal given renal status
   3. Thrombocytopenia - multifactorial, keep > 50K
   4. CMV viremia - most recent viral load negative on [**4-21**], but 800
   copies on [**4-23**] titer.
   Acyclovir was held for increase in creatinine but that is less likely
   to be the culprit. Will give acyclovir this AM and discuss with ID.
   5. ARF - making urine, lytes ok. Etiology unclear, cyclosporine levels
   vs less likely acyclovir.
   6. HTN - stable, on norvasc, labetolol
   7. ID issues - low grade temps, no evidence of pneumonia. D/c levoflox.
   F/u cultures, so far negative.
   8. Pain control
 on MS contin.  Will d/c ativan.
   9. FEN - on TPN. Reduce insulin.
   Stable to transfer to floor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old individual who underwent a cord blood transplant and is currently in the ICU. The patient's course has been complicated by CMV viremia and GVHD. The patient also experienced an acute bleed during a transjugular biopsy and has refractory thrombocytopenia. The patient is on multiple medications including steroids, cellcept, cyclo, and caspofungin for a history of fungal infection. The patient's cyclosporine levels are being monitored due to renal status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute bleeding - The patient had an acute bleed in the setting of a transjugular biopsy with refractory thrombocytopenia. It is important to keep platelets above 50 until Hct stabilizes.
2. GVHD - The patient is on steroids, cellcept, and cyclo for GVHD. Cyclo level is 200, and there is a plan to discuss with heme about lowering the goal given the patient's renal status.
3. Thrombocytopenia - The patient has multifactorial thrombocytopenia, and it is important to keep platelets above 50K.
4. CMV viremia - The patient had a recent viral load that was negative on 4/21, but the latest titer showed 800 copies on 4/23. Acyclovir was held due to an increase in creat"
