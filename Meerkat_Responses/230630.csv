   zosyn on admission. Given CXR from [**2182-3-4**] that showed a left
   consolidation with pleural effusion, it seems possible that effusion is
   secondary to indection. Pt had mediastinal LN involvement on PET scan,

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with sepsis, likely secondary to healthcare-associated or aspiration pneumonia, along with a large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient is currently on room air and in the mid-90s on RA with no overnight events. She has been receiving various medications including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and vancomycin. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/76 to 91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's neurological examination reveals confusion and slow speech, while her strength is 4/5 in the right upper extremity and less in the left upper extremity. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and various electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing further complications related to sepsis, such as organ dysfunction or failure, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), or septic shock.
2. Respiratory Distress: Given the presence of pneumonia and pleural effusion, the patient may experience worsening respiratory distress, which could lead to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation"

   88 year old woman with sepsis, likely secondary to health care
   associated/aspiration pneumonia with large left sided pleural effusion
   with exudative
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt with hypotension, tachycardia suggestive of septic shock.
   Pt's mentation is at baseline. Urine output has been approx 30 cc/hr in
   ED. Labs suggestive of lactic acidosis with an anion gap of 21. Sepsis
   likely due to pneumonia given large pleural effusion, also consider
   UTI/urosepsis. Pt now s/p 3L IVF in ED.
   - Continue norepinephrine with goal MAP>60
   - Bolus with IVF prn to try to wean norepinephrine
   - Broadly culture (blood, urine, sputum)
   - Place a-line to monitor BP's
   - CVP>12
   - Check mixed venous sat, if low consider transfusion if hct<30
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Initially pt was on NRB, was weaned down to 4L
   NC, and is now tolerating room air. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to pneumonia,
   pleural effusion.
   - Check ABG
   - ATC nebs
   - Treat pneumonia with Unasyn x 10 day course for aspiration PNA (could
   transition to Augmentin)
   - Continue O2 PRN
   .
   # Anion-gap acidosis: Pt has an anion gap of 21, with a delta-delta of
   [**10-11**] which suggests a metabolic alkalosis as well. AG acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis and uremia.
   - Continue IVF for elevated lactate
   - ABG as above
   - A line for ABG monitoring
   .
   # Massive left pleural effusion: Likely infectious versus malignant
   pleural effusion. Pt has recently been on a course of levaquin and
   flagyl since [**3-6**] for aspiration pna, which was broadened to vanc and
   zosyn on admission. Given CXR from [**2182-3-4**] that showed a left
   consolidation with pleural effusion, it seems possible that effusion is
   secondary to indection. Pt had mediastinal LN involvement on PET scan,
   so pleural effusion could be related to known metastatic breast cancer.
   - Continue Unasyn as above
   - Hold off on draining fluid re-accumulation at this time as pt
   minimally symptomatic; may require repeat tap if sx accelerate (with
   Pleurex catheter placement)
   - Consider high-res CT
   - F/U cytology from initial thoracentesis
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension, but also may be a
   component of prerenal renal failure.
   - Check urine lytes
   - Hold ACE and diuretic
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia: Perhaps related to acute renal failure.
   - Phosphate today is normal.

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with sepsis, likely secondary to healthcare-associated or aspiration pneumonia. She has a large left-sided pleural effusion that is exudative in nature. The patient's current condition is stable, with improved respiratory status after a thoracentesis procedure. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of further deterioration due to sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can progress and cause worsening respiratory distress.
3. Pleural Effusion: The large pleural effusion may reaccumulate, leading to recurrent respiratory distress and potential infection.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is impaired, and there is a risk of AKI progressing to chronic kidney disease.
5. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient has known metastatic breast cancer, which could contribute to her overall prognosis and susceptibility to complications.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous lines.
7. Stress Ulcer Disease: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged ICU stay.
8. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing V"

   Assessment and Plan
   88 year old woman with sepsis, likely secondary to health care
   associated/aspiration pneumonia with large left sided pleural effusion.
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt with hypotension, tachycardia suggestive of septic shock.
   Pt's mentation is at baseline. Urine output has been approx 30 cc/hr in
   ED. Labs suggestive of lactic acidosis with an anion gap of 21. Sepsis
   likely due to pneumonia given large pleural effusion, also consider
   UTI/urosepsis. Pt now s/p 3L IVF in ED.
   - Continue norepinephrine with goal MAP>60
   - Bolus with IVF prn to try to wean norepinephrine
   - Broadly culture (blood, urine, sputum)
   - Place a-line to monitor BP's
   - CVP>12
   - Check mixed venous sat, if low consider transfusion if hct<30
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Initially pt was on NRB, was weaned down to 4L
   NC, and is now tolerating room air. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to pneumonia,
   pleural effusion.
   - Check ABG
   - ATC nebs
   - Treat pneumonia with vanc, zosyn
   .
   # Anion-gap acidosis: Pt has an anion gap of 21, with a delta-delta of
   [**10-11**] which suggests a metabolic alkalosis as well. AG acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis and uremia.
   - Continue IVF for elevated lactate
   - ABG as above
   - A line for ABG monitoring
   .
   # Massive left pleural effusion: Likely infectious versus malignant
   pleural effusion. Pt has recently been on a course of levaquin and
   flagyl since [**3-6**] for aspiration pna, which was broadened to vanc and
   zosyn on admission. Given CXR from [**2182-3-4**] that showed a left
   consolidation with pleural effusion, it seems possible that effusion is
   secondary to indection. Pt had mediastinal LN involvement on PET scan,
   so pleural effusion could be related to known metastatic breast cancer.
   - Continue vanc and zosyn
   - US-guided thoracentesis today
   - Consider high-res CT
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension, but also may be a
   component of prerenal renal failure.
   - Check urine lytes
   - Hold ACE and diuretic
   - Renally dose meds.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman with sepsis, likely secondary to healthcare-associated/aspiration pneumonia and a large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for multiple medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia are suggestive of septic shock. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. If not properly managed, sepsis can lead to organ failure and even death.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient initially required nonrebreather therapy but has been weaned down to nasal cannula and is now tolerating room air. Respiratory distress can occur due to pneumonia and pleural effusion. If not adequately treated, it can progress to respiratory failure.

3. Anion-gap acidosis: The patient has an elevated anion gap of 21, suggesting a metabolic acidosis likely due to lactic acidosis and uremia. Anion-gap acidosis occurs when there is an accumulation of acids or a loss of bicarbonate in the body. If not addressed, it can lead to further complications such as organ damage and respiratory failure.

4. Massive left pleural effusion: The patient has a large left-sided pleural effusion, which may be infectious or malignant in nature. If left"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with sepsis, likely secondary to healthcare-associated or aspiration pneumonia. She has a large left-sided pleural effusion with exudative characteristics. The patient's mentation is at baseline, and she is alert and oriented. She is tolerating room air after initially being on nonrebreather ventilation. Her vital signs show a blood pressure of 135/72 mmHg, heart rate of 77 bpm, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg, and she has received a total of 2,370 mL of fluids with a balance of -1,700 mL since admission. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and ampicillin/sulbactam. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of septic shock with hypotension and tachycardia. She also has lactic acidosis with an elevated anion gap. Immediate management includes aggressive fluid resuscitation and continued administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Hemodynamic monitoring and close observation for signs of organ dysfunction are crucial.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially required nonrebreather ventilation due to respiratory distress, likely secondary to"
