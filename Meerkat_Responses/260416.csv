   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of septic prosthetic knee, ESRD, atrial fibrillation, CAD, and chronic anemia. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to multiple complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of septic prosthetic joint and ongoing infection in the knee area. There is a possibility of further infection spread or development of new infections.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, ranging from 70s mmHg. This could be due to sepsis, medication effects, or underlying cardiac issues. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has underlying COPD and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and potential respiratory distress due to atelectasis or mucous plug in the airway.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is experiencing poorly controlled atrial fibrillation. This can lead to inadequate cardiac output and potential complications like stroke or heart failure.

5. Chronic kidney disease (ESRD): The patient is on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week. There is a need for careful monitoring of fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and medication dosages to avoid further renal deterioration.

6. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia and is dependent on transf"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with several medical conditions and complications. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with septic arthritis of the left knee, for which he underwent a washout procedure. However, the Gram stain of the fluid was negative for bacteria, although there were 72 white blood cells present out of a total of 186,000 white blood cells on joint tap in the ER.

The patient's vital signs indicate that he is tachycardic with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute and hypotensive with a blood pressure of 83/69 mmHg. He is also experiencing atrial fibrillation and has a tracheostomy tube in place for respiratory support.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), troponin T, lactate acid, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), along with low levels of hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), and platelets (Plt). His electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with elevated potassium (K+) and phosphorus (PO4), and decreased magnesium (Mg++) and calcium (Ca++).

The patient's medical history includes septic prosthetic joint, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), coronary artery disease (CAD), and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, septic knee joint, and chronic anemia. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient has been on dopamine, an infusion of dopamine at 7 mcg/kg/min, and daptomycin, an antibiotic, due to a septic prosthetic joint. His vital signs are unstable with low blood pressure, and he requires hemodialysis (HD) three times a week due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient also has atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulation. There are concerns about the patient's respiratory status, with an underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and possible left lung atelectasis. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple medical issues, including potential complications from his cirrhosis, septic joint, and ESRD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can be attributed to various factors such as cirrhosis, septic joint, volume loss from HD, progression of heart failure, and blood loss. Monitoring the patient's blood pressure closely is essential, especially during HD.

2. Septic Prosthetic Joint: Despite the negative gram stain of fluid, the patient's joint remains a potential source of infection. Continued monitoring and follow-up with infectious disease (ID) recommendations are crucial.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple medical complications. 

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, ranging from 83/51 mmHg to 101/64 mmHg. The possible causes mentioned include cirrhosis, septic joint, volume loss from dialysis, progression of heart failure, and blood loss. Dopamine infusion is being used to maintain blood pressure.

2. Septic Prosthetic Joint: The patient had a left knee washout and hardware remains in place. Culture results show sparse coag-positive staph, which is consistent with previous MRSA from the first tap on 4/10. The plan is to follow up with ortho recommendations and culture sensitivities.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has underlying COPD and a new whiteout of the left lung, most likely representing mucous plugging but could also be effusion or hemothorax due to a traumatic line attempt.

The patient is a 74-year-old male with hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, and a whiteout of the left lung on CXR. He has been treated with daptomycin for his septic prosthetic joint and had a left knee washout with hardware remaining in place. The patient's respiratory failure is due to underlying COPD, and there is a new whiteout of the left lung, which could be mucous plugging, effusion, or hemothorax. He is currently on a tracheostomy mask and awaiting final read on CT chest.

The patient has atrial fibrillation, and anticoagulation is being held due to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. He has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and will likely undergo dialysis on Monday. The patient also has a sacral ulcer, for which plastic surgery consultation did not recommend debridement. His medical history includes seizures, and he is currently on keppra. The patient has anemia and is transfusion-dependent; he received one unit of blood here and is also on epogen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension resolved but the etiology is unclear. Monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic status is essential to identify any potential causes and prevent further episodes of hypotension.

2. Septic Prosthetic Joint: The patient has a septic prosthetic joint with cultures"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including septic knee, sacral osteomyelitis, cirrhosis, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and anemia. He is currently in the ICU and has been admitted for several days.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 105/61 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a tracheostomy tube with supplemental oxygen. He is on dopamine infusion at a rate of 4 mcg/kg/min.

The patient has a history of hypotension, which could be due to several factors such as cirrhosis, septic joint, volume loss from hemodialysis, progression of heart failure, or blood loss. His current blood pressure is in the lower range but without evidence of hypoperfusion.

The patient has a septic prosthetic joint with hardware still in place after a left knee washout. The culture shows sparse coag-positive staph, which is consistent with previous MRSA infection from an earlier tap on 04/10.

The patient also has respiratory failure, with a new whiteout of the left lung on chest X-ray, likely representing mucous plugging, but could also be an effusion or hemothorax secondary to a traumatic line attempt. He is breathing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including septic knee, sacral osteomyelitis, hypotension, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a history of seizure disorder. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a septic knee and sacral osteomyelitis, which increases the risk of infection spreading to other parts of the body.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD and the presence of a pleural effusion put him at risk for further respiratory complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's uncontrolled hypotension could lead to organ damage and poor perfusion.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's irregular heart rhythm increases the risk of clot formation, which can result in strokes or other cardiovascular events.
5. ESRD: The patient's kidney failure may require ongoing dialysis, and there is a risk of fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Seizure Disorder: The patient's history of seizures needs to be monitored, and appropriate treatment should be provided to prevent further seizure episodes.
7. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia requires ongoing monitoring and management, including transfusions and erythropoietin therapy.
8. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's large sacral ulcer indicates a risk for"

   Labs / Radiology
   CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: [**4-25**]:
   1. Multiloculated simple-appearing left pleural effusion with adjacent
   regions of lung collapse as described above. Underlying infection
   within
   these regions of collapse as well as empyema cannot be excluded on this
   non-
   contrast examination. Additionally mild-to-moderate centrilobular
   emphysema
   with probable underlying tracheal and proximal bronchial malacia.
   2. Calcified and non-calcified pleural plaques consistent with
   underlying
   asbestos exposure. No parenchymal findings to suggest underlying
   asbestosis.
   Given the involvement of the medial pleural surface on the left as well
   as
   some regions of underlying nodularity, a dedicated biopsy and/or VATS
   examination would be of benefit to exclude underlying mesothelioma if a
   contrast enhanced exam can not be performed.
   3. Extensive atherosclerotic calcification with 2.6cm of focal region
   of
   ulceration involving the inferior aspect of the aortic arch.
   4. Colitis involving the residual left-sided colon. Most likely
   infectious
   or inflammatory with ischemia felt less likely.
   5. Known underlying sequelae of cirrhosis with mild-to-moderate intra-
   abdominal ascites.
   6. Large fecal load noted within the right and transverse colon.
   Fecalized
   matter within the stomach may suggest underlying gastroparesis and/or
   severe
   ileus.
   7. Fluid-filled distended esophagus also likely related to underlying
   dysmotility. Can consider further evaluation with dedicated esophogram
   when
   clinically feasible.
   8. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
   9. Large sacral decubitus ulcer with extension to involve the inferior
   sacrum
   and coccyx which display demineralization and destruction of the cortex
   consistent with osteomyelitis.
   10. Vertebra plana deformity involving T11 vertebral body likley
   related to
   prior infection and/or trauma. If there is clinical concern for an
   acute
   spondylitis, a dedicated MRI examination could be obtained. Gadolinium
   should
   be used if patient's GFR allows.

   helpful to

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypotension, septic knee, and cirrhosis. He was admitted with a white-out of the left lung on chest X-ray, which has since resolved. The patient underwent a left knee washout due to MRSA septic prosthetic joint and hardware remains in place. He is currently on daptomycin for six weeks from the knee washout. The patient also has sacral osteomyelitis confirmed by CT and is on daptomycin. 

The patient's respiratory status shows underlying COPD with left pleural effusion on CT chest, left lower lobe collapse/atalectasis, and potential pneumonia. The patient is on tracheostomy mask and will need a repeat CT as an outpatient to evaluate the left pleural effusion. 

The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but the etiology of hypotension is unclear. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, so anticoagulation is being held. The patient has chronic anemia likely secondary to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and acute illness. He is transfusion-dependent and on EPOGEN. 

The patient's medications include daptomycin for septic prosthetic joint and sacral osteomyelitis, tracheostomy care, prophylactic heparin (due to allergy), stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and VAP"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 74-year-old male with hypotension, septic knee, and cirrhosis.
- The patient has undergone a left knee washout due to a prosthetic joint infection.
- The patient has sacral osteomyelitis confirmed by CT scan.
- The patient's hypotension has resolved, but the underlying cause is unclear.
- The patient has respiratory failure due to underlying COPD and resolved atelectasis of the left lung.
- The patient also has a left pleural effusion.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation and is not receiving anticoagulation due to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and will be undergoing dialysis on Monday.
- The patient has a history of seizures and is currently on keppra.
- The patient has chronic anemia and is transfusion-dependent. Hemolysis labs are negative, and the patient's hematocrit (HCT) is stable.
- The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) code status.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of septic knee and sacral osteomyelitis, which increases the risk of further infections.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may recur if the underlying cause is not identified and addressed.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD puts him at risk for recurrent respiratory failures.

4. Pleural effusion: The patient's left pleural effusion could worsen and potentially lead to respiratory complications.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events.

6. ESRD: The patient's end-stage renal disease will require ongoing dialysis management to prevent complications associated with renal failure.

7. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures may recur, and appropriate management should be continued.

8. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may require ongoing transfusion support and monitoring.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, and other medical conditions. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple medications including daptomycin for MRSA septic prosthetic joint and sacral osteomyelitis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.3 C (97.4 F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on a tracheostomy collar and receiving supplemental oxygen. Physical examination shows irregularly irregular heart rhythm, absent breath sounds on the left, moderately distended abdomen, and 2+ pitting edema to midcalf. Laboratory results indicate mild anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient has several potential medical complications including hypotension, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, and end-stage renal disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low at 100/60 mmHg. This could be due to septic shock or another underlying cause. Close monitoring of fluid balance and vasopressor support may be necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has underlying COPD and is currently on a tracheostomy collar with intermittent muc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of septic knee. The patient has a history of osteomyelitis and is currently being treated for sepsis. The patient is in the ICU and is hemodynamically stable. The patient has allergies to vancomycin, heparin sodium (porcine), phenytoin sodium, diazepam, lorazepam, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was daptomycin on 04/24/2105 at 04:45 PM. The patient is receiving multiple infusions, including morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's septic knee indicates a possible infection, which can lead to sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Osteomyelitis: The patient's history of osteomyelitis suggests a chronic bone infection. Osteomyelitis can lead to complications such as abscess formation, bone necrosis, and systemic spread of infection.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is diagnosed with chronic respiratory failure, which can be a result of underlying lung disease or respiratory muscle weakness. This condition can worsen if the patient's ventilation support is inadequate.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with several medical conditions including hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, osteomyelitis, atrial fibrillation, chronic anemia, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 

The patient has been treated for a MRSA-infected prosthetic joint, which required a knee washout. He is currently on daptomycin therapy for this condition. Additionally, he has sacral osteomyelitis, also being treated with daptomycin, and is awaiting further consultation to tailor treatment.

The patient's hypotension has resolved, and he is no longer on pressors with a maintained mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. The etiology of his hypotension remains unclear.

The patient has a history of respiratory failure due to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), resolved atelectasis of the left lung, and a left pleural effusion seen on CT chest. He is intermittently experiencing mucous plugs and will continue to be on a tracheostomy mask for respiratory support.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is being rate-controlled but anticoagulation is being held due to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).

The patient has ESRD and requires dialysis, which will be done on Monday. His electrolyte levels will be monitored daily, and caution will be taken with lyte repletion during hemodialysis."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male with history of ESRD, HIT, Cirrhosis now admit following
   ""wash out"" of infected TKR and sepsis.  He has had persistent
   hypotension which does appear to be improved today and persistent
   issues may be related to a combination of A-Fib, continued volume
   shifts with dialysis and sepsis resolution
   1)Sepsis/Hypotension-The provocative findings are colitis on the CT
   scan with additional sources as described above being Rx
   -Daptomycin continuing for 6 week course from time of wash out
   -Do have concern for possible pulmonary infection based upon sputum
   volume but have had improvement with continued Daptomycin.
   -Will need to consider Rx for c. diff if clinical worsening seen, but,
   in interim will check c. diff.  The other place to evaluate for
   possible residual infectious source would be pleural fluid but is small
   volume and loculated.
   -Osteomyelitis to be covered by Daptomycin likely
   -Will send stool for C. Diff
   2)ESRD-
   _Dialysis per routine
   -Catheter in place
   3)Respiratory Failure
Paitent with intermittent collapse of left side
   but with excellent response to chest PT and positioning.
   -Continue with trach mask collar for now.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a complex medical history including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU following the ""wash out"" of an infected total knee replacement (TKR) and sepsis. 

The patient's current chief complaints are hypotension, sepsis, and an infected joint. The patient's vital signs show persistent hypotension, but there has been some improvement today. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, chronic pain, constipation, alterations in tissue perfusion, and a history of renal failure.

The patient's physical examination reveals poor dentition, tracheostomy tube in place, dullness in percussion, diminished breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and diminished pulses in the extremities. The patient's neurologic assessment is incomplete as movement and tone were not assessed.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated creatinine levels, low white blood cell count, low platelet count, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging shows a suggestion of colitis, pleural effusion, and sacral ileitis. The patient's fluid analysis indicates an aggressive loss of sodium.

The assessment and plan include sepsis/hypotension, ESRD, and respiratory failure. The patient is being treated with a 6-week course of daptomycin to cover for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, and multiple comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to underlying COPD. The patient also has a MRSA septic prosthetic joint, sacral osteomyelitis, left-sided colitis, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 

24-hour events include discontinuation of naloxone, removal of a dialysis catheter, initiation of vacuum assistance for sacral decubitus, and initiation of ceftazidime for suspected gram-negative bacterial coverage. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 77/55 to 68/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy mask.

Physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds bilaterally, moderate abdominal distension, and 1+ pitting edema to midcalf. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15,000 cells/mm³, elevated creatinine levels, and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging studies reveal persistent left pleural effusion, loculations, and atelectasis, as well as evidence of sacral osteomyelitis.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the ICU due to white-out of the left lung on chest X-ray, which has now resolved. The patient underwent a left knee washout for a prosthetic joint infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). He also has sacral osteomyelitis confirmed by CT scan. The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, with left pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse/atalectasis on CT chest. There is a suspicion of pneumonia, and the patient has increased sputum production with gram-negative rods (GNR) seen on gram stain.

The patient is currently on daptomycin for both the prosthetic joint infection and sacral osteomyelitis. He is also on ceftazidime for possible pneumonia. The patient's blood pressure has been low, and he is being monitored closely. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not currently on anticoagulation due to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. He is receiving hemodialysis three times a week for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient's mental status has worsened, and he is now intubated and mechanically ventilated.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male admitted with hypotension and septic arthritis in area of
   TKR.  He now has had evolution of worsening hypercarbia and requiring
   return to ventilator this morning--he has findings on his CXR to
   suggest recurrent collapse in left chest and concerning for mucus
   plugging contributing to worsening with progressive compromise across
   the past 24 hours.  In light or recurrent collapse will have to
   consider approach to prevention as well as management.  We are limited
   by trach tube size with ID at 6.0 limiting possibilities for
   bronchoscopy and will need to stabilize ventilation prior to
   intervention therefore.
   1)Septic Arthritis-
   -Daptomycin x 6 weeks
   2)Respiratory Failure-Secondary to recurrent substantial collapse at
   this time in addition to prolonged background of ventilatory
   compromise.
   -Chest PT
   -Frequent suctioning
   -COPD Rx with nebs and humidified air
   -Possible PNA
with GNR
s in sputum and will continue with Ceftazidime
   -Will need bronch to evaluate for full clearance of secretions and
   possible malacia when able
   3) H/O RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
   -Continue with dialysis and have been able to maintain good tolerance
   of dialysis without pressors

","The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted with hypotension and septic arthritis in the area of total knee replacement (TKR). He has worsening hypercarbia and requires return to the ventilator this morning. The patient has findings on his chest X-ray suggesting recurrent collapse in the left chest and concerning for mucus plugging contributing to worsening ventilatory compromise across the past 24 hours.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to recurrent substantial collapse and prolonged background of ventilatory compromise.
2. Possible pneumonia (PNA) with GNRs in the sputum, for which Ceftazidime will be continued.
3. Bronchial mucus plugging and malacia when able.
4. Decubitus ulcer (present at admission).
5. Constipation (obstipation, fos).
6. Chronic respiratory failure.
7. Sepsis without organ dysfunction.
8. Renal failure, end-stage (ESRD), which requires continued dialysis.

These potential complications need to be closely monitored and managed accordingly."

   74 yo M w/ hypotension, septic knee and cirrhosis p/w white out of L
   lung on CXR, now resolved (likely mucus plug?). F/u CXR and CT scan
   show persistent L pleural effusion, with loculations, and atalectasis.
   # MRSA Septic Prosthetic joint: Patient s/p L knee washout.  Hardware
   remains in place. Was not able to obtain records from OSH re: culture
   data.
   - continue Daptomycin (with HD), for six weeks from L knee washout per
   ID recs (start date was [**4-23**])
   # Sacral Osteomyelitis:  Patient with large Sacral ulcer, osteo
   confirmed by CT.  Patient is currently on daptomycin.
   - continue wound Vac
   - daptomycin as above
   # Respiratory failure: underlying COPD.  Patient with L pleural
   effusion on CT chest, with left lower lobe collapse/atalectasis/ cannot
   rule-out pneumonia. Likely mucous plugging given timing and imaging.
   Patient with some increase in sputum production with a gram stain with
   GNR.
   - start ceftazadime for possible PNA given CXR and increased sputum
   production
   - patient should complete 8-day course of ceftaz for pneumonia (started
   on [**4-28**])
   - continue vent for short time alternating with trach mask as tolerated
   - T/c bronch for mucous suction.  Chest PT.
   # Hypotension:   Some low blood pressures.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to HD made
   worse by autonomic dyxfunction from cirrhosis.  Off pressors currently,
   MAP > 55 with a goal > 60.  Patient
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 402**] stim test was normal.
   -if unable to increase MAP to > 60 may need some dopamine support.
   # Left-sided colitis on CT: no white count. Afebrile. Non-tender
   abdomen on physical exam. C. Diff negative.
   - continue to monitor abdominal exam
   # Atrial fibrillation: holding anticoagulation given Hx of GIB.  Rate
   controlled (without beta-blockade).
   - continue ASA 81
   # ESRD: HD M-W-F
   - HD dose meds
   - caution with lyte repletion
   # H/o seizure d/o: Question what prompted starting keppra as poor notes
   from OSH. Doubt unresponsive episodes represent sz activity as they are
   gradual onset.
   - keppra for now, dosing with HD
   # Anemia: Per notes is chronic, pt is transfusion dependent, likely
   secondary to ESRD and acute illness. Transfused one unit here, and HCT
   did not respond.  Hemolysis labs negative.  HCT stable.  Also on
   epogen.  No signs of bleeding.
   - trend hct, transfuse for <21

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has underlying COPD and currently shows signs of respiratory failure, including left pleural effusion and left lower lobe collapse/atalectasis. There is also an increased risk of pneumonia due to gram-negative bacteria (GNR).

2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced some low blood pressures, which may be related to hemodialysis (HD) and worsened by autonomic dysfunction from cirrhosis. It is important to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.

3. MRSA septic prosthetic joint: The patient had a left knee washout and hardware remains in place. They are currently on daptomycin for six weeks following the knee washout. There is a possibility of ongoing infection.

4. Sacral osteomyelitis: The patient has a large sacral ulcer and confirmed osteomyelitis by CT. They are currently on daptomycin for treatment.

5. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which is likely secondary to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and acute illness. They are transfusion-dependent and currently on epogen.

6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled without beta-blockade. Anticoagulation is being held due to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypotension, septic knee, and cirrhosis. He presented with a white-out of the left lung on a chest X-ray, which has since resolved. However, a follow-up chest X-ray and CT scan revealed persistent left pleural effusion with loculations and atelectasis. The patient underwent a left knee washout due to a MRSA septic prosthetic joint and is currently on daptomycin therapy. He also has sacral osteomyelitis confirmed by CT and is being treated with daptomycin. The patient's respiratory status has worsened, with underlying COPD and a left pleural effusion on CT chest. There is an increase in sputum production with gram-negative rods (GNR) on gram stain, suggesting possible pneumonia. Ceftazidime has been started for possible pneumonia. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is alternating between tracheostomy mask as tolerated. Chest physiotherapy and tracheal suctioning have been initiated. The patient's blood pressure has been low, but has responded to fluid resuscitation with a MAP > 55. Autonomic dysfunction from cirrhosis may contribute to hypotension. If the MAP does not improve, dopamine support may be needed. The patient has left-sided colitis on CT, but without any signs of infection. Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with several medical conditions including hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, MRSA septic prosthetic joint, sacral osteomyelitis, respiratory failure, anemia, and ESRD. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is being treated for multiple complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions and treatments include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of MRSA septic prosthetic joint and sacral osteomyelitis. There is a risk of ongoing infection and potential spread to other areas of the body.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has underlying COPD and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. There is a risk of worsening respiratory status and possible pneumonia.

3. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing low blood pressures, which may be related to hemodialysis or autonomic dysfunction from cirrhosis. There is a risk of further hypotension and inadequate perfusion.

4. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia and is transfusion-dependent. There is a risk of further blood loss or hemolysis.

5. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on maintenance hemodialysis. There is a risk of electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and anticoagulation may be required."

   74 yo male admitted with septic arthritis and now with prolonged
   hosptial course and has had recurrent collapse with Left lung collapse
   and required to be returned to mechanical ventilation.  His source of
   recurrent collapse is quite likely mucus plugging with subseqent
   collapse--intervention with bronchoscope is complicated by the size of
   trach tube which is 6.0.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Will continue with support of atelectasis and collapse with frequent
   suctioning and clearance of secretions
some improvement on film over
   past 24 hours.
   -Dapto/Ceftaz to continue
   -Suction frequently
   -Maintain PPV for this am and consider wean to TM trial
   -Will have to consider effusion evaluation if infiltrate persists as
   there is known locluated effusion
   2)ESRD-
   -Dialysis with negative fluid balance today as BP has tolerated.

","The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted with septic arthritis and a prolonged hospital course. He has experienced recurrent lung collapse requiring mechanical ventilation. The source of the recurrent collapse is likely mucus plugging with subsequent collapse. Intervention with a bronchoscope has been complicated by the size of the tracheostomy tube, which is 6.0.

The patient's conditions include respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, hypotension, and septic arthritis. He has also had an episode of sepsis without organ dysfunction. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving dialysis with a negative fluid balance today as his blood pressure has tolerated it. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent lung collapse and dependence on mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk for continued respiratory failure. Frequent suctioning and clearance of secretions are necessary to prevent further atelectasis and collapse. If infiltrates persist, an effusion evaluation may be needed.
2. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and ongoing dialysis indicate a risk for worsening renal function and potential complications related to fluid and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating a risk for hypotension-related complications such as decreased organ perfusion and shock.
4. Sepsis: The patient's history of septic arthritis and sepsis without organ dysfunction suggest an ongoing risk"

   cirrhosis.   Patient
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 402**] stim test was normal.
   - No need for dopamine for now; consider if unable to increase MAP to >
   60
   # MRSA Septic Prosthetic joint: Patient s/p L knee washout.  Hardware
   remains in place. Was not able to obtain records from OSH re: culture
   data.
   - continue Daptomycin (with HD), for six weeks from L knee washout per
   ID recs (start date was [**4-23**])
   # Sacral Osteomyelitis:  Patient with large Sacral ulcer, osteo
   confirmed by CT.  Patient is currently on daptomycin.
   - Continue wound Vac
   - daptomycin as above
   # Abdominal pain: Left-sided colitis on CT but afebrile without
   elevated WBC. C. Diff negative. Mildly tender but without acute
   abdomen, likely with component from impacted stool.
   - Saline enema through ostomy (had been receiving one q3d at rehab with
   good results)
   # Atrial fibrillation: holding anticoagulation given Hx of GIB.  Rate
   controlled (without beta-blockade).
   - continue ASA 81
   # ESRD: HD M-W-F
   - HD dose meds
   - caution with lyte repletion
   # H/o seizure d/o: Question what prompted starting keppra as poor notes
   from OSH. Doubt unresponsive episodes represent sz activity as they are
   gradual onset.
   - keppra for now, dosing with HD
   # Anemia: Per notes is chronic, pt is transfusion dependent, likely
   secondary to ESRD and acute illness. Transfused one unit here, and HCT
   did not respond.  Hemolysis labs negative.  HCT stable.  Also on
   epogen.  No signs of bleeding.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a complex medical history including hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, respiratory failure, anemia, and multiple other comorbidities. 

From the note, it can be inferred that the patient has been experiencing several medical complications. These include respiratory failure due to underlying COPD, left pleural effusion, and left lower lobe atelectasis likely caused by mucus plugging and GNR pneumonia. The patient has also been diagnosed with hypotension, which may be related to hemodialysis (HD) and autonomic dysfunction from cirrhosis. Additionally, the patient has MRSA septic prosthetic joint, sacral osteomyelitis, abdominal pain likely caused by left-sided colitis, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a history of seizure disorder.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure if the pleural effusion and atelectasis progress, further deterioration in blood pressure control leading to shock, potential spread of infection from the septic prosthetic joint or sacral osteomyelitis, development of complications related to ESRD such as fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances, and potential recurrence of seizures.

It is important for the healthcare team to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, blood pressure control, and laboratory values. Frequent reassessment of the patient's condition and"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo M w/ hypotension, septic knee and cirrhosis p/w white out of L
   lung on CXR, now resolved (likely mucus plug?). F/u CXR and CT scan
   show persistent L pleural effusion, with loculations, and atalectasis.
   # MRSA Septic Prosthetic joint: Patient s/p L knee washout.  Hardware
   remains in place. Was not able to obtain records from OSH re: culture
   data.
   - continue Daptomycin (with HD), for six weeks from L knee washout per
   ID recs (start date was [**4-23**])
   # Sacral Osteomyelitis:  Patient with large Sacral ulcer, osteo
   confirmed by CT.  Patient is currently on daptomycin.
   - continue wound Vac
   - daptomycin as above
   # Respiratory failure: underlying COPD.  Patient with L pleural
   effusion on CT chest, with left lower lobe collapse/atalectasis/ cannot
   rule-out pneumonia. Likely mucous plugging given timing and imaging.
   Patient with some increase in sputum production with a gram stain with
   GNR.
   - start ceftazadime for possible PNA given CXR and increased sputum
   production
   - patient should complete 8-day course of ceftaz for pneumonia (started
   on [**4-28**])
   - continue vent for short time alternating with trach mask as tolerated
   - T/c bronch for mucous suction.  Chest PT.
   # Hypotension:   Some low blood pressures.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to HD made
   worse by autonomic dyxfunction from cirrhosis.  Off pressors currently,
   MAP > 55 with a goal > 60.  Patient
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 402**] stim test was normal.
   -if unable to increase MAP to > 60 may need some dopamine support.
   # Left-sided colitis on CT: no white count. Afebrile. Non-tender
   abdomen on physical exam. C. Diff negative.
   - continue to monitor abdominal exam
   # Atrial fibrillation: holding anticoagulation given Hx of GIB.  Rate
   controlled (without beta-blockade).
   - continue ASA 81
   # ESRD: HD M-W-F
   - HD dose meds
   - caution with lyte repletion
   # H/o seizure d/o: Question what prompted starting keppra as poor notes
   from OSH. Doubt unresponsive episodes represent sz activity as they are
   gradual onset.
   - keppra for now, dosing with HD
   # Anemia: Per notes is chronic, pt is transfusion dependent, likely
   secondary to ESRD and acute illness. Transfused one unit here, and HCT
   did not respond.  Hemolysis labs negative.  HCT stable.  Also on
   epogen.  No signs of bleeding.
   - trend hct, transfuse for <21

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, respiratory failure, anemia, atrial fibrillation, and ESRD. The patient is currently in the ICU due to white-out of the left lung on CXR, which has since resolved. The patient also has persistent left pleural effusion with loculations, and atelectasis.

The patient underwent a knee washout due to a MRSA septic prosthetic joint and is currently on daptomycin. He also has sacral osteomyelitis confirmed by CT scan and is being treated with daptomycin as well. The patient has underlying COPD and is experiencing respiratory failure with increased sputum production, and a gram stain with GNR bacteria. The patient has been started on ceftazadime for possible pneumonia.

The patient's blood pressure has been low at times, which may be related to hemodialysis (HD) and autonomic dysfunction from cirrhosis. The goal is to maintain a MAP > 60. The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled, and anticoagulation is being held due to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is on ASA 81.

The patient has chronic anemia, likely secondary to ESRD and acute illness. He has been transfused one unit of blood, but his HCT did not respond. Hemolysis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of COPD, pleural effusions, ESRD, septic arthritis, and possible pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 112/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 83%. The patient is on nighttime ventilatory support and has a tracheostomy tube in place. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.2, hematocrit of 23.0, platelet count of 111, creatinine level of 4.6, blood glucose level of 63, and potassium level of 3.8. Other labs are within normal ranges. Imaging shows smaller effusions on chest x-ray. The patient's assessment and plan include decubitus ulcer, constipation, respiratory failure, pain control, alteration in tissue perfusion, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's prolonged ventilatory compromise may lead to further respiratory failure if adequate ventilation and oxygenation are not maintained.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and possible PNA mentioned in the progress note suggest an increased risk of developing pneumonia due to prolonged ventilation and immob"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has underlying COPD with left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis, which is likely due to mucous plugging and GNR pneumonia. The patient is currently on respiratory support with a tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures are low, which may be related to the hemodialysis (HD) treatment made worse by autonomic dysfunction from cirrhosis. The patient's stim test was normal, indicating no need for dopamine at this time, but consideration should be given if unable to increase mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

3. MRSA septic prosthetic joint: The patient had a left knee washout with hardware remaining in place. The patient is currently on daptomycin for six weeks from the knee washout per ID recommendations (start date was 04-23). However, the patient is unable to obtain records from OSH regarding culture data.

4. Sacral osteomyelitis: The patient has a large sacral ulcer confirmed by CT and is currently on daptomycin. The patient should continue wound vac and daptomycin as above.

5. Abdominal pain: The patient has left-sided colitis on CT but is afebrile without elevated WBC. Clostrid"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented to the hospital with white-out of the left lung on chest X-ray, which has since resolved. A follow-up chest X-ray and CT scan showed persistent left pleural effusion with loculations and atelectasis.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure due to underlying COPD with left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis, likely caused by mucous plugging and gram-negative bacterial (GNR) pneumonia. Staphylococcus aureus is not considered the cause of pneumonia. The patient occasionally requires ventilator support, which seems to be his current baseline from previous rehabilitation.

The patient is being treated with an 8-day course of ceftazidime for pneumonia, which started on April 28th. He is tolerating the tracheostomy mask and will continue with chest physical therapy.

The patient also has hypotension, possibly related to hemodialysis made worse by autonomic dysfunction from cirrhosis. The patient's stim test was normal, so there is no need for dopamine at this time. The target mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be >60.

Additionally, the patient has MRSA septic prosthetic joint, for which he underwent left knee washout. Hardware remains in place, and he is currently receiving daptom"

   show persistent L pleural effusion, with loculations, and atalectasis.
   # Respiratory failure: Underlying COPD with L pleural effusion on CT
   chest, with left lower lobe atelectasis likely [**2-2**] to mucous plugging
   and GNR pneumonia

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and multiple comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by pneumonia, hypotension, septic prosthetic joint, sacral osteomyelitis, abdominal pain, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a history of seizure disorder.

The patient has been on various treatments including antibiotics for pneumonia and MRSA septic prosthetic joint, daptomycin for MRSA and sacral osteomyelitis, saline enema for left-sided colitis, and anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. He also requires ongoing management for ESRD, including hemodialysis, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis due to MRSA infection, complications related to sacral osteomyelitis, further decline in renal function, and potential bleeding events due to anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male with septic arthritis and respiratory failure now with
   reasonable tolerance of trach mask trials during the day and minimal
   evidence of recurrent significant infection.
   1)Respiratory Failure-He has had continued good tolerance of daytime
   trach mask.  He has benefited from nocturnal ventilation in part to
   maintain airwy patency and minimize recurrent collapse.  This would be
   expected to be a long term support until better stability of
   oxygenation and lung patency seen.
   -Trach mask
   -PSV during nigh/sleep
   -continue current ABX
   2)Sepsis-clearly resolved, good long term ABX plan

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypotension, septic knee, and cirrhosis. He presented with white-out of the left lung on CXR, which has since resolved. A follow-up CXR and CT scan show persistent left pleural effusion with loculations and atelectasis. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to underlying COPD, left pleural effusion, and GNR pneumonia. 

The patient has been on an 8-day course of ceftazidime for pneumonia, which started on [**4-28**]. He is tolerating a tracheostomy mask and continues with chest physical therapy. 

The patient also has hypotension, possibly related to hemodialysis made worse by autonomic dysfunction from cirrhosis. The patient's stim test was normal, so there is no need for dopamine at this time. 

Additionally, the patient has MRSA septic prosthetic joint, for which he underwent left knee washout. The hardware remains in place, and he will continue with daptomycin for six weeks from the knee washout per ID recommendations (start date was [**4-23**]). 

The patient also has sacral osteomyelitis, confirmed by CT, and is currently on daptomycin. He will continue with wound vacuum and daptomycin as above. 

Furthermore, the patient presents with left-sided colitis on CT but is afebrile without elevated WBC. Clostridium difficile is negative. He is mildly tender but without acute abdomen, likely with a component from impacted stool. 

The patient has atrial fibrillation, for which anticoagulation is being held due to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. Rate control is achieved without beta-blockade, and he will continue with ASA 81. 

The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires hemodialysis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. He needs to be cautious with electrolyte repletion. 

The patient also has a history of seizures and is on keppra, but the notes from the outside hospital are poor. The patient's anemia is chronic, and he is transfusion-dependent, likely secondary to ESRD and acute illness. 

In terms of access, a PICC line will be placed today in interventional radiology. 

For nutrition, the patient should be encouraged to intake orally when off the ventilator. 

The patient's glycemic control should be monitored. 

Lines include a dialysis catheter placed on [**2105-4-22**] and a PICC line placed on [**2105-4-29**]. 

Prophylaxis includes pneumatic boots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pantoprazole for stress ulcers. 

The patient's ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should be monitored. 

The patient's code status is full code,"

   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) 7267**]
s note and I agree
   with his findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname **] has done well regarding
   Rx for his septic knee and pneumonia and left lung collapse.  We will
   add Tobramycin to Ceftaz for better lung coverage and add Rifampin to
   Daptomycin for better knee coverage, as per ID.  Yesterday the patient
   developed Afib but with digoxin and metoprolol he is rate controlled
   today.  We will continue metoprolol but at least for now stop digoxin.
   Chest PT continues, hoping to treat and prevent major lung atelectasis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, respiratory failure, MRSA septic prosthetic joint, sacral osteomyelitis, abdominal pain, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a history of seizure disorder. 

The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and is currently on several medications including sevlemir carbonate for renal dose, daptomycin, ceftazidime, digoxin, and metoprolol. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a heart rate between 75-116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/73 to 157/115 mmHg, respiratory rate between 17-31 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 97%, and temperature within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination shows irregularly irregular heart sounds, coarse breath sounds bilaterally, moderately distended abdomen with mild tenderness, and 1+ pitting edema to midcalf. Laboratory results indicate some abnormalities such as elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to underlying COPD with left pleural effusion on CT chest, pneumonia, hypotension related to HD made worse by autonomic dysfunction from cirrhosis, MRSA septic prosthetic joint"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, hypotension, MRSA septic prosthetic joint, sacral osteomyelitis, abdominal pain, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a history of seizure disorder. The patient is currently on various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and dialysis. He has several lines and catheters inserted, and is receiving nutritional support and prophylactic measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD with left pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis may lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressures, especially overnight, may indicate persistent hypotension that could compromise organ perfusion.
3. MRSA septic prosthetic joint: The patient's prosthetic joint infection with MRSA may require debridement and long-term antibiotic therapy. There is a risk of treatment failure or development of resistant organisms.
4. Sacral osteomyelitis: The patient's sacral osteomyelitis may require prolonged antibiotic therapy and could potentially lead to further complications such as bone infection spreading to other areas.
5. Abdominal pain: The patient's left-sided colitis on CT"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, respiratory failure, anemia, atrial fibrillation, ESRD, and a history of seizure disorder. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to underlying COPD with left pleural effusion on CT chest, left lower lobe atelectasis likely caused by mucous plugging and GNR pneumonia. Staphylin is unlikely the cause of pneumonia. The patient occasionally requires ventilator support, which seems to be his current baseline from previous rehab.

The patient has hypotension, with blood pressures lower overnight but improved in the morning. This may be related to hemodialysis (HD) made worse by autonomic dysfunction from cirrhosis. The patient's stim test was normal, so there is no need for dopamine for now.

The patient also has an MRSA septic prosthetic joint, for which he underwent left knee washout. Hardware remains in place. He is currently on daptomycin for six weeks from the left knee washout per ID recommendations (start date was 04-23).

Additionally, the patient has sacral osteomyelitis with a large sacral ulcer, confirmed by CT. He is currently on daptomycin, and wound Vac has been applied.

The patient is also experiencing left-sided colitis on CT but is afebrile without elevated W"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old male with several medical conditions including hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, respiratory failure, anemia, and a history of seizures. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by GNR bacteria and is being treated with an 8-day course of ceftazidime. There is also evidence of a persistent left pleural effusion with loculations, and atelectasis. The patient's blood cultures are negative, and Staphylinus aureus is not considered the cause of the pneumonia.

The patient's hypotension is believed to be related to hemodialysis (HD) made worse by autonomic dysfunction from cirrhosis. The patient's stim test was normal. The hypotension is being closely monitored, and the need for dopamine is being considered if the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) cannot be increased to >60 mmHg.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, respiratory failure, MRSA septic prosthetic joint, sacral osteomyelitis, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), abdominal pain, and a history of seizure disorder. 

The patient's current status includes being on mechanical ventilation, with a tracheostomy tube in place. He has coarse breath sounds bilaterally, and his lungs are clear. He also has moderate abdominal distention, mild tenderness diffusely, and no guarding/rebound. There is 1+ pitting edema to midcalf present.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and normal glucose level. Other lab values such as albumin, LDH, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure, MRSA septic prosthetic joint, sacral osteomyelitis, atrial fibrillation, ESRD, abdominal pain, and anemia. He is currently tolerating tracheal mask ventilation and continues with chest physical therapy. The antibiotics regimen has been adjusted to include tobramycin for the remainder of the 8-day ceftazime course. Daptomycin will be continued for six weeks"

   of the services provided.  I have reiviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) **]
s note above and
   agree with her findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname **] looks very good
   today, eating, talking, joking, and having no complaints. He
s been
   needing short lived vent support for 4 hrs at night.  The plan is to
   conclude antibiotics for his pneumonia tomorrow, but to continue
   antibiotics for his septic prosthetic knee for 6 weeks.  His rate
   control and hemodynamics are fine on low dose Metoprolol which will be
   continued.
   Hopefully he

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, respiratory failure, MRSA septic prosthetic joint, sacral osteomyelitis, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), abdominal pain, and a history of seizure disorder.

The patient has been treated for pneumonia caused by ceftaz-resistant Pseudomonas and is currently on a regimen of antibiotics including ceftazidime, tobramycin, and daptomycin. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but there are some concerns regarding his fluid balance, as he has received a significant amount of IV fluids over the past day.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), which may indicate kidney dysfunction. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and is tolerating it well. His chest physical therapy is ongoing to manage his respiratory condition.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing antibiotics for his septic prosthetic knee, monitoring tobramycin levels, and evaluating his response to treatment. He will continue to receive dialysis treatments three times a week for his ESRD. His other medical conditions, such as atrial fibrillation and abdominal pain, are being managed accordingly"

   74 yo man with hypotension, septic knee and cirrhosis p/w white out of
   L lung on CXR, now resolved (likely mucus plug?). F/u CXR and CT scan
   show persistent L pleural effusion, with loculations, and atalectasis.
   # Respiratory failure: Underlying COPD with L pleural effusion on CT
   chest, with left lower lobe atelectasis likely [**2-2**] to mucous plugging
   and GNR pneumonia including ceftaz-resistant strains although improved
   clinical status on abx regimen. Sparse staph not thought to be cause of
   pneumonia. Patient is occasionally vent dependant which seems to be his
   current baseline from his previous rehab.
   - Tobramycin added for remainder of 8-day ceftaz course (started on
   [**4-28**]), last dose today
   - Currently tolerating trach mask with vent overnight; cont chest PT
   # MRSA Septic Prosthetic joint: Patient s/p L knee washout.  Hardware
   remains in place. Was not able to obtain records from OSH re: culture
   data.
   - continue Daptomycin (with HD) and rifampin, for six weeks from L knee
   washout per ID recs (start date was [**4-23**])
   # Sacral Osteomyelitis:  Patient with large sacral ulcer, osteo
   confirmed by CT.  Patient is currently on daptomycin.
   - Continue wound Vac
   - Daptomycin as above
   # Atrial fibrillation: holding anticoagulation given Hx of GIB.  Rate
   controlled now on beta blockade.
   - Continue ASA 81, beta blocker
   # Hypotension:  Blood pressures stable on metoprolol despite h/o
   lower-running BPs which may be related to HD made worse by autonomic
   dyxfunction from cirrhosis.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test was normal.
   # ESRD: HD M-W-F
   - HD dose meds
   - Caution with lyte repletion
   # Abdominal pain: Left-sided colitis on CT but afebrile without
   elevated WBC. C. Diff negative. Mildly tender but without acute
   abdomen, likely with component from impacted stool.
   - Saline enema through ostomy prn (had been receiving one q3d at rehab
   with good results)
   # H/o seizure d/o: Question what prompted starting keppra as poor notes
   from OSH. Doubt unresponsive episodes represent sz activity as they are
   gradual onset.
   - keppra for now, dosing with HD
   # Anemia: Per notes is chronic, pt is transfusion dependent, likely
   secondary to ESRD and acute illness. Transfused one unit here, and HCT
   did not respond.  Hemolysis labs negative.  HCT stable.  Also on
   epogen.  No signs of bleeding.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with multiple medical complications. The summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU includes:

1. Septic knee and respiratory distress: The patient has a septic knee and is experiencing respiratory distress. He has been receiving antibiotics for his septic knee, and there is improvement in his clinical status.

2. MRSA septic prosthetic joint: The patient had a left knee washout due to a suspected MRSA infection in his prosthetic joint. He is currently on daptomycin and rifampin for six weeks.

3. Sacral osteomyelitis: The patient has a large sacral ulcer with confirmed osteomyelitis by CT scan. He is being treated with daptomycin.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled with a beta blocker. Anticoagulation is being held due to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures are stable on metoprolol, despite a history of lower-running blood pressures that may be related to hemodialysis made worse by autonomic dysfunction from cirrhosis.

6. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient requires hemodialysis three times a week (M-W-F). Medications need to be dosed appropriately, and caution should be taken with electrolyte repletion.

7. Abdominal pain: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with multiple medical complications. He has hypotension, septic knee, cirrhosis, respiratory failure, MRSA septic prosthetic joint, sacral osteomyelitis, atrial fibrillation, ESRD requiring dialysis, abdominal pain, and a history of seizures. The patient is currently on various medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, beta blockers, and others. He is also receiving renal dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has underlying COPD and a left pleural effusion with left lower lobe atelectasis, which can worsen his respiratory function.
2. MRSA Septic Prosthetic Joint: The patient has a prosthetic joint infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This infection may require surgical intervention and prolonged antibiotic treatment.
3. Sacral Osteomyelitis: The patient has confirmed sacral osteomyelitis, which is an infection of the bone. This condition may require long-term antibiotic therapy and can potentially lead to further complications if not appropriately managed.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can cause irregular heart rhythms and increase the risk of blood clots and stroke. Rate control is essential in this case.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures are stable on metoprolol, but there is a"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with hypotension, septic knee and cirrhosis p/w white out of
   L lung on CXR, now resolved (likely mucus plug?). F/u CXR and CT scan
   show persistent L pleural effusion, with loculations, and atalectasis.
   # Respiratory failure: Underlying COPD with L pleural effusion on CT
   chest, with left lower lobe atelectasis likely [**2-2**] to mucous plugging
   and GNR pneumonia including ceftaz-resistant strains although improved
   clinical status on abx regimen. Sparse staph not thought to be cause of
   pneumonia. Patient is occasionally vent dependant which seems to be his
   current baseline from his previous rehab.
   - Tobramycin added for remainder of 8-day ceftaz course (started on
   [**4-28**]), last dose today
   - Currently tolerating trach mask with vent overnight; cont chest PT
   # MRSA Septic Prosthetic joint: Patient s/p L knee washout.  Hardware
   remains in place. Was not able to obtain records from OSH re: culture
   data.
   - continue Daptomycin (with HD) and rifampin, for six weeks from L knee
   washout per ID recs (start date was [**4-23**])
   # Sacral Osteomyelitis:  Patient with large sacral ulcer, osteo
   confirmed by CT.  Patient is currently on daptomycin.
   - Continue wound Vac
   - Daptomycin as above
   # Atrial fibrillation: holding anticoagulation given Hx of GIB.  Rate
   controlled now on beta blockade.
   - Continue ASA 81, beta blocker
   # Hypotension:  Blood pressures stable on metoprolol despite h/o
   lower-running BPs which may be related to HD made worse by autonomic
   dyxfunction from cirrhosis.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test was normal.
   # ESRD: HD M-W-F
   - HD dose meds
   - Caution with lyte repletion
   # Abdominal pain: Left-sided colitis on CT but afebrile without
   elevated WBC. C. Diff negative. Mildly tender but without acute
   abdomen, likely with component from impacted stool.
   - Saline enema through ostomy prn (had been receiving one q3d at rehab
   with good results)
   # H/o seizure d/o: Question what prompted starting keppra as poor notes
   from OSH. Doubt unresponsive episodes represent sz activity as they are
   gradual onset.
   - keppra for now, dosing with HD
   # Anemia: Per notes is chronic, pt is transfusion dependent, likely
   secondary to ESRD and acute illness. Transfused one unit here, and HCT
   did not respond.  Hemolysis labs negative.  HCT stable.  Also on
   epogen.  No signs of bleeding.
   - trend hct, transfuse for <21

   74 yo man with hypotension, septic knee and cirrhosis p/w white out of
   L lung on CXR, now resolved (likely mucus plug?). F/u CXR and CT scan
   show persistent L pleural effusion, with loculations, and atalectasis.
   # Respiratory failure: Underlying COPD with L pleural effusion on CT
   chest, with left lower lobe atelectasis likely [**2-2**] to mucous plugging
   and GNR pneumonia including ceftaz-resistant strains although improved
   clinical status on abx regimen. Sparse staph not thought to be cause of
   pneumonia. Patient is occasionally vent dependant which seems to be his
   current baseline from his previous rehab.
   - Completed 8-day course or ceftaz and tobramycin
   - Currently tolerating trach mask with vent overnight; cont chest PT
   # MRSA Septic Prosthetic joint: Patient s/p L knee washout.  Hardware
   remains in place. Was not able to obtain records from OSH re: culture
   data.
   - Continue Daptomycin (with HD) and rifampin, for six weeks from L knee
   washout per ID recs (start date was [**4-23**])
   - Will need suppressive therapy after if prosthesis left in place
   - Will need qweekly CBC, AST/ALT, CK labs while on dapto and rifampin
   # Sacral Osteomyelitis:  Patient with large sacral ulcer, osteo
   confirmed by CT.  Patient is currently on daptomycin.
   - Continue wound Vac
   - Daptomycin as above
   # Atrial fibrillation: holding anticoagulation given Hx of GIB.  Rate
   controlled now on beta blockade.
   - Continue ASA 81, beta blocker
   # Hypotension:  Blood pressures stable on metoprolol despite h/o
   lower-running BPs which may be related to HD made worse by autonomic
   dyxfunction from cirrhosis.  [**Last Name (un) **] stim test was normal.
   # ESRD: HD M-W-F
   - HD dose meds
   - Caution with lyte repletion
   # Abdominal pain: Left-sided colitis on CT but afebrile without

   - keppra for now, dosing with HD
   # Anemia: Per notes is chronic, pt is transfusion dependent, likely
   secondary to ESRD and acute illness. Transfused one unit here, and HCT
   did not respond.  Hemolysis labs negative.  HCT stable.  Also on
   epogen.  No signs of bleeding.
