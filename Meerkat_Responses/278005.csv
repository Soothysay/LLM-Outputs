","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and autonomic dysfunction presenting with apparent first seizure after symptoms of gastroenteritis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. She has been febrile with a maximum temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F). Her blood pressure has been elevated at times. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate between 70-101 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 115/39 to 192/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. 

The patient underwent lumbar puncture, which showed no signs of meningitis. Imaging studies, including a CT scan of the head and abdomen/pelvis, were unremarkable except for bilateral perinephric stranding without renal perfusion abnormality and a markedly distended urinary bladder. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, and she has negative toxicology screens. 

The patient's medical history includes respiratory status, seizure, renal failure, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and femoral hernia. The plan includes discontinuing all empirical coverage for meningitis, ordering an MRI and EEG, and providing neurologic recommendations. The patient's diabetes management and coronary artery disease management will be discussed with the respective specialists. Prophylaxis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus. She presents with autonomic dysfunction and experienced an apparent first seizure following symptoms of gastroenteritis. There is suspicion of a viral infection causing gastroenteritis and potentially aseptic meningitis. The patient has been febrile since admission, with a temperature of 100.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Her CT scan was unremarkable, and lumbar puncture showed no signs of meningitis. Her blood pressure at presentation was elevated, which may be consistent with postural encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Tox screens have been negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause. It is unlikely to be secondary to electrolyte abnormalities or hypoglycemia as these were normal on admission. Other potential causes such as alcohol withdrawal or illicit medications are less likely given the patient's history. An infectious work-up, including blood, urine, and chest X-ray, should be performed. Lumbar puncture should also be done to rule out meningitis. Medications that lower seizure thresholds should be avoided.

2. Febrile status: The patient has been febrile since admission, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammation in the body. Further investigation is necessary to identify the source of fever and provide appropriate treatment.

3. Elevated blood pressure: The patient's elevated blood pressure at"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a medical history of CAD (coronary artery disease), DM (diabetes mellitus), and autonomic dysfunction presenting with an apparent first seizure following gastroenteritis symptoms. She has been febrile with a maximum temperature of 100.7 degrees Celsius. The CT scan showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage or large infarct, and the CSF analysis did not indicate meningitis. The patient's labs show normal sodium, blood sugar, LFTs (liver function tests), and negative troponins. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, multi-lumen, and lumbar puncture. She is receiving various medications including codeine, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin, acyclovir, fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, and dextrose.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure recurrence: The patient had an apparent first seizure, so there is a possibility of further seizures occurring due to the underlying cause or other factors.
2. Infection: Despite negative CSF analysis, the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftriaxone, amp) and antiviral medication (acyclovir) due to suspicion of aseptic meningitis or viral infection. There is a risk of developing secondary infections while on these medications.
3. Cardiovascular issues: The"

   I saw and examined Ms. [**Known lastname 11640**] with the ICU resident, whose note from
   today reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that this 67 y/o woman
   with type I DM presented with gastroenteritis-like symptoms to the ED.
   Evaluation revealed perinephric stranding by imaging.  Received a small
   amount of planned cipro, and seized.  Received benzodiazepines but
   eventually intubated.  Hypertense, never hypoglycemic.  On exam, she
   now has low-grade fever (100.4), 130/52, 15, 100% on the vent.  Gaze
   deviation.  Apparent weakness, exam limited by sedation.  Soft systolic
   murmur.  Clear lungs.  Soft abdomen.  Upgoing toe on left.  No
   sustained clonus.  Neck a bit stick but not frankly meningitic.
   Labs, imaging, meds, allergies, SH, FH, ROS all reviewed.  CT negative
   on official read, though ?some right temporal hypodensity.  EKG with
   slight lateral ST depressions.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of type I diabetes, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and autonomic dysfunction. She presented to the emergency department with gastroenteritis-like symptoms and was found to have perinephric stranding on imaging. The patient received a small amount of planned ciprofloxacin but subsequently experienced a seizure and was intubated. She has been on invasive ventilation since 06:00 PM on [**2158-1-17**]. A lumbar puncture was performed at 04:00 AM on [**2158-1-18**]. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 139/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the seizure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient's blood pressure is currently 139/54 mmHg, indicating hypotension. This may require further investigation and management.
2. HYPOGLYCEMIA: Although the patient's glucose level is within normal range at the moment, her history of type I diabetes puts her at risk for hypoglycemia. Continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential.

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y/o F DM1, CKD, hyperlipidemia who presents with diarrhea, vomiting
   and developed witnessed seizure in ED.
   .
   # Seizure: No prior history per OMR or family. Unlikely to be secondary
   to electrolyte abnormalities (Na normal on admission) and hypoglycemia
   (glucose normal). Less likely to be Alcohol withdrawal or illicit
   medications as no prior history. Patient recently suffering from
   gastroenteritis, certain viral etiologies can infect CSF and result in
   menigitis. Other etiologies on the differential include structural mass
   or CVA.
   - Add on tox screen
   - Infectious work-up: blood, urine, CXR
   - LP to eval for menigitis
   - Avoid medications that decrease seizure thresold. Hold patient's
   citalopram, gabapentin,lorazepam, reglan, chantix
   - MRI to eval for structural cause
   - EEG
   - Per neurology Levetiracetam 20 mg/kg divided into two doses, add on
   cyclosporine level
   .
   # Diarrhea, vomiting: Most likely gastroenteritis. However based on
   CAD/DM history rule out inferior MI.
   - treat symptoms
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - EKG in am
   .
   # Hypertension: Seizure could be result of PRES. HTN as outpatient
   significantly lower 100-154. Patient's BP dropped from 230 to 130 in ED
   following propofal.
   - Patient was started on levophed to maintain SBP > 170 (25% drop), can
   wean off as has been > 12 hours
   .
   # DM1: Continue long acting glargine.
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Simvastatin 40 mg qpm
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # CKD: Creatinine arond baseline 1.2-1.5.
   .
   # Depression: Hold meds that decrease seizure threshold
   .
   # Autonomic orthostatic hypotension: NaCl 2 gram [**Hospital1 **]

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 1, chronic kidney disease, and hyperlipidemia.
- She presents with diarrhea, vomiting, and experienced a witnessed seizure in the emergency department.
- No prior history of seizures was reported.
- The patient has been treated for gastroenteritis, but structural or cardiovascular causes for the seizure are still being evaluated.
- The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated, and there is a concern for possible PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome).
- The patient has a history of depression, diabetes mellitus type 1, hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic kidney disease.
- The patient's electrolytes and medications are being monitored closely.
- The patient is currently on levetiracetam for seizure management and has a central line for medication administration.
- The patient's condition is stable but requires further evaluation and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient experienced a witnessed seizure, which could be due to various causes such as viral meningitis, structural abnormalities, or cardiovascular issues. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Hypertension: The patient has significantly elevated blood pressure readings. This may be related to PRES or other underlying conditions. Blood pressure management is crucial to prevent further complications.
3. Gastroenteritis: The patient presents with diarrhea and vomiting, which are symptoms"
