","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis who presents with abdominal distention, jaundice, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient has completed a course of ceftriaxone (CTX) but continued to have peritoneal leukocytosis and no clinical improvement. The patient was then started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for broad coverage. All cultures are negative, and repeat paracentesis shows resolution of leukocytosis. The SBP has resolved.

The patient also has coffee ground material from the nasogastric tube in the setting of epistaxis. The patient has a history of grade one varices. Gastrocult NG aspirate and consultation with the liver team are recommended. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) from Hospital1 is also mentioned.

The patient has worsening renal function, likely due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Creatinine has peaked at 9.0 from 0.8 with decompensated liver failure. The patient received his first hemodialysis (HD) session. It is planned to continue HD, monitor renal recommendations, and continue midodrine and octreotide.

The patient has acute hepatitis, decompensated HCV cirrhosis with encephalopathy, and rising Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)/International Normalized Ratio ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, hepatorenal syndrome, hematemesis (upper gastrointestinal bleed), electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, bradycardia, and hypotension. The patient has been started on dialysis and is receiving various medications in the ICU. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/53 to 135/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels and other abnormalities. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination are not assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening renal function: The patient's current condition of acute renal failure may progress further, leading to worsening renal function. This could result in the accumulation of toxins in the body and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome progression: The patient is also diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome, which is a complication of liver disease leading to kidney dysfunction. If left untreated or uncontrolled, this condition may worsen, resulting in further deterioration of renal function.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding recurrence: The patient has experienced hematemesis, indicating bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. There is a risk of recurrent bleeding, which can lead to hypotension and shock"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of MELD 47 HCV cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, varices, admitted with abdominal distention, jaundice, and SBP. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), but peritoneal leukocytosis persisted despite the antibiotic treatment. The patient's cultures were negative, indicating no active infection. The patient's condition is complicated by renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, and decompensated liver disease. He is currently listed for liver transplantation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition is characterized by altered mental status and neuropsychiatric abnormalities due to liver dysfunction. It can lead to confusion, lethargy, coma, and even death if not managed properly.

2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): Although the patient has been treated with antibiotics, there is still a risk of recurrent SBP due to the presence of peritoneal leukocytosis. Prompt recognition and treatment of SBP are crucial to prevent further complications such as infection and sepsis.

3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal impairment. If not managed appropriately, renal failure can progress and require dialysis or renal transplantation.

4. Variceal bleeding: The patient has a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and varices. He was admitted with symptoms including abdominal distention, jaundice, and SBP. The patient has been treated with antibiotics but showed no clinical improvement. Repeat paracentesis showed resolution of leukocytosis. The patient also has coffee grounds in his NG tube, which could be indicative of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely secondary to varices. He is also experiencing renal failure, classified as HRS type 1, and has been receiving hemodialysis (HD). The patient is listed for OLT due to decompensated HCV cirrhosis with a MELD score >40. He is currently experiencing altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, and HRS. The patient's current medications include lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and midodrine and octreotide for HRS. Further management includes confirming NGT placement, repleting as necessary, and discussing plans with hepatology and transplant surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of coffee grounds in the NG tube suggests ongoing or recent upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be secondary to esophageal varices. This is a potentially life-threatening complication that requires immediate attention and intervention.
2. Hepatic enceph"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of MELD 47 HCV cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, and varices. The patient was admitted with abdominal distention, jaundice, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). 

The patient has been treated with a course of ceftriaxone (CTX) for SBP but showed continued peritoneal leukocytosis and absence of clinical improvement. Therefore, the patient was started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for broad-spectrum coverage. All cultures have been negative, and there is a resolution of leukocytosis.

The patient also has coffee grounds in the nasogastric tube and a history of grade one varices. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level is stable at 32.4%. 

The patient is diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS) in the setting of SBP and decompensated liver failure. The patient received hemodialysis (HD) yesterday, and the creatinine level is 7.5. The BUN level is 94, and it is being considered to hold HD today. 

The patient has decompensated HCV cirrhosis with a MELD score greater than 40 and is currently listed for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Follow-up with hepat"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MELD 47 HCV cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and varices. He was admitted with abdominal distention, jaundice, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient had completed a course of ceftriaxone (CTX) but showed continued peritoneal leukocytosis and absence of clinical improvement. He was then started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for broad coverage. All cultures were negative, and repeat paracentesis showed resolution of leukocytosis. The patient has coffee grounds in his nasogastric tube and a history of grade one varices. His hematocrit (Hct) is stable at 32.4 today. The patient also has renal failure and is listed for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). He is currently being treated for hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and decompensated liver disease. The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, and HRS. The plan includes confirming nasogastric tube placement, restarting tube feeds post-pyloric, repleting as necessary, and discussing disposition with transplant surgery and liver service.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with MELD 47 HCV cirrhosis, presenting with abdominal distention, jaundice, and SBP. The patient has completed a course of CTX but still has peritoneal leukocytosis. He is currently on vanco and zosy for broad coverage, and all cultures are negative. The patient also has coffee grounds per NG tube, indicating possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding. His Hct is stable at 32.4. The patient is listed for OLT due to decompensated liver failure. He has renal failure and received HD yesterday, with Cr 7.5 and BUN 94. The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, and HRS. His nutrition plan includes Renal (Full) at 45 mL/hour. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanco and zosy), indicating a potential or ongoing infection. The negative cultures suggest that the current antibiotic treatment is effective. However, there is still a risk of developing antibiotic resistance or not covering the specific pathogen causing the infection.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of coffee grounds in the NG tube suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This could be related to the patient's history of grade one varices or other causes of bleeding."

","Summary:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with MELD 47 HCV cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, and varices.
- He was admitted with abdominal distention, jaundice, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
- The patient has coffee grounds in his nasogastric (NG) tube and is on hemodialysis (HD) due to hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS) in the setting of SBP and decompensated liver failure.
- He is currently listed for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).
- The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, and HRS. He is on lactulose, rifaximin, and antimicrobials.
- The plan is to confirm NG tube placement and restart tube feeding post-pyloric. He will be repleted as necessary.
- The patient has multiple medical complications, including SBP, renal failure (HRS type 1), ESLD, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. It is essential to continue lactulose and rifaximin to manage this condition.
2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient was admitted with SBP, which is a common complication in patients"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with MELD 47 HCV cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, varices, abdominal distention, jaundice, and SBP.
- The patient is listed for OLT and remains encephalopathic.
- He has decompensated liver disease with a MELD score >40 and is experiencing hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
- The patient's condition includes suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is improving but still requires monitoring.
- He also has hypernatremia and altered mental status, most likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, and HRS.
- The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is on hemodialysis (HD) with midodrine/octreotide for hepatorenal syndrome type 1.
- Coffee grounds in the NG tube suggest a possible gastrointestinal bleed, and an EGD revealed portal hypertension gastropathy and grade II varices.
- The patient's electrolytes, blood counts, and coagulation profile need close monitoring.
- Treatment plans include continuing lactulose and rifaximin, antimicrobials, and following up with hepatology and transplant surgery services.
- The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU for now, with possible callouts to the liver service.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of HCV cirrhosis, currently admitted with abdominal distention, jaundice, and SBP. He has a MELD score of 47 and is listed for OLT. The patient remains encephalopathic, with ongoing treatment including lactulose and rifaximin. His SBP is improving, but he still has tenderness on examination. Renal failure is present, and he is on HD and midodrine/octreotide. The patient also has hypernatremia, altered mental status, and coffee grounds per NG tube. Further evaluation and management are needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient remains encephalopathic, indicating ongoing hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can lead to further deterioration in mental status and potentially life-threatening complications such as respiratory failure or sepsis.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient has evidence of renal failure, consistent with HRS. This condition can progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): Although the patient's SBP is improving, there is still tenderness on examination. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent recurrent infections and complications associated with SBP.
4. Hepatic Hydrothorax: The patient's history of cirrhosis and ascites puts him at risk for hep"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of MELD 47 HCV cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and varices. The patient has been admitted with abdominal distention, jaundice, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is currently listed for an organ transplant (OLT) due to end-stage liver disease (ESLD).

The patient's current condition includes hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), SBP, and renal failure. The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a condition characterized by cognitive and behavioral abnormalities caused by liver dysfunction. The patient may experience confusion, altered mental status, and changes in personality.

2. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): This is a type of kidney failure that occurs as a complication of advanced liver disease. It is characterized by low blood flow to the kidneys, leading to decreased kidney function and potential renal failure.

3. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): This is an infection of the fluid in the space surrounding the liver. SBP can lead to sepsis and organ failure if not promptly treated.

4. Renal failure: The patient already has evidence of renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and the need for hemodialysis. Further deterioration in kidney function may occur if"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1806**] is a 55 year old male with MELD 47 HCV cirhosis c/b
   encephalopathy, ascites, varices admitted with abdominal distention,
   jaundice, and SBP.
   # ESLD: Patient with decompensated HCV cirrhosis with MELD >40 in the
   setting of SBP, HRS. Currently listed for OLT. Remains encephalopathic.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - Appreciate hepatology and transplant surgery following.
   # SBP:  Improving. Still diffusely tender to palpation on exam but no
   fevers. WBC higher today at 14.2, may be reactive in setting of liver
   disease. Repeat para [**4-1**] showed resolution of leukocytosis and
   cultures remain no growth to date.
   - Continue vanco per HD protocol and pip/tazo (day 13/14).
   - Follow vancomycin levels.
   - Monitor WBC count, fever curve.
   - CIS and repeat dx para if spikes fever or if worsening abd exam.
   # Renal failure: Patient with HRS type 1 in setting of SBP and
   decompensated liver failure. No signs of renal recovery thus far.
   - On HD and midodrine/octreotide.
   - Appreciate renal following.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, BUN/Cr. ? phos binder given elevated phos.
   # Hypernatremia
 FWD based on wt > 3L. Pt does complain of thirst on
   exam.
   - Increase free water boluses via tube feeds from 50 cc q4h to 250 cc
   q4h.
   - Recheck serum Na in pm.
   # Altered Mental Status: Most likely from hepatic encephalopathy, SBP,
   HRS. Stable.
   - Continue HD
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin, antimicrobials.
   # Coffee grounds per NG tube:  Several days ago, now s/p NG tube

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of HCV cirrhosis, currently admitted with abdominal distention, jaundice, and SBP. The patient's MELD score is 47, indicating severe liver dysfunction. The patient is encephalopathic and has hepatorenal syndrome.

The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure (84/48 mmHg), low heart rate (49 bpm), and slightly elevated respiratory rate (11 breaths per minute). The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%. The physical examination reveals icteric sclerae, dry mucous membranes, clear lungs, distended abdomen with slight tenderness, and edema in the extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), bilirubin levels, and creatinine. The patient also has hypernatremia and altered mental status. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including lactulose, rifaximin, vancomycin, octreotide, midodrine, and pantoprazole.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathic state may worsen, leading to further deterioration in mental status and potential development of severe complications like seizures or coma.

2. Infection: Despite the patient being on antibiotics, there is a risk of developing or worsening infections such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, varices, and hepatorenal syndrome. He was admitted with abdominal distention, jaundice, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, blood pressure ranging from 84/46 to 106/89 mmHg, heart rate between 49-56 bpm, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on hemodialysis and being treated with midodrine/octreotide for hepatorenal syndrome type 1, lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, and vancomycin/tazobactam for SBP. He is also listed for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) due to decompensated liver failure. The patient's mental status is altered, most likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, SBP, and hepatorenal syndrome. Further management includes confirming the placement of the nasogastric tube, restarting tube feeding post-pyloric, repleting as necessary, and monitoring liver function tests.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hepatic failure, encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient has a history of allergies, last dose of antibiotics given on 04-04-2145 at 08:00 PM and 08:31 PM. Vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure of 84/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on respiratory support with no oxygen delivery device, and ABG results are pending. Physical examination reveals peripheral vascular issues, skin not assessed, neurologic responses absent, and labs showing abnormal values for potassium, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, and other parameters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels indicate impaired renal function, which can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid disorders.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The combination of hepatic failure and renal dysfunction increases the risk of hepatorenal syndrome, a condition characterized by renal failure secondary to advanced liver disease.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The presence of hematemesis in the assessment and plan suggests a potential complication of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which may require urgent intervention."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of hepatic failure, encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and HCV cirrhosis. He was admitted with abdominal distention, jaundice, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient has been treated with various medications including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, octreotide, midodrine, rifaximin, lactulose, and pantoprazole. He is currently listed for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition occurs when toxins build up in the bloodstream and reach the brain, causing confusion, disorientation, and other neurological symptoms. Proper management of lactulose and rifaximin will be important to prevent further deterioration.

2. Renal Failure: The patient is diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1), which is a form of kidney failure that occurs in advanced liver disease. The patient is already on hemodialysis (HD) and receiving midodrine/octreotide therapy to improve renal function.

3. Esophageal Varices: The patient's history of varices increases the risk of bleeding from these enlarged veins in the esophagus. Close monitoring for signs of bleeding and prompt intervention if necessary are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of HCV cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and varices. He was admitted with abdominal distention, jaundice, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's MELD score is 47, indicating decompensated liver disease. He is currently listed for an organ transplant and remains encephalopathic. The patient has several complications including hypotension, SBP, renal failure (hepatorenal syndrome type 1), hypernatremia, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He is on multiple medications and treatments such as lactulose, rifaximin, vancomycin, midodrine, octreotide, and proton pump inhibitors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient remains encephalopathic despite treatment with lactulose and rifaximin. Continuous monitoring and management of hepatic encephalopathy symptoms are necessary.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): Although the patient's SBP is improving, there is still a risk of infection due to his immunocompromised state. Monitoring WBC count, fever curve, and following vancomycin levels are important.
3. Renal failure: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome type 1, which is a form of renal failure associated with liver disease. Continuous monitoring of electrolytes, BUN/Cr"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 1806**] is a 55 year old male with MELD 47 HCV cirhosis c/b
   encephalopathy, ascites, varices admitted with abdominal distention,
   jaundice, and SBP.
   # ESLD: Patient with decompensated HCV cirrhosis with MELD >40 in the
   setting of SBP, HRS. Currently listed for OLT. Remains encephalopathic.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin.
   - Trend LFTs.
   - Continue lactulose and rifaximin, antimicrobials
   - Appreciate hepatology and transplant surgery following.
   # Hypotension: related to HD. Currently on pressors.
   - Monitor and continue HD without UF.
   - f/u cultures
   # SBP:  Improving. Still diffusely tender to palpation on exam but no
   fevers. WBC higher today at 14.2, may be reactive in setting of liver
   disease. Repeat para [**4-1**] showed resolution of leukocytosis and
   cultures remain no growth to date.
   - Continue vanco per HD protocol and pip/tazo (day 13/14).
   - Follow vancomycin levels.
   - Monitor WBC count, fever curve.
   - CIS and repeat dx para if spikes fever or if worsening abd exam.
   # Renal failure: Patient with HRS type 1 in setting of SBP and
   decompensated liver failure. No signs of renal recovery thus far.
   - On HD and midodrine/octreotide.
   - Appreciate renal following.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, BUN/Cr. ? phos binder given elevated phos.
   # Hypernatremia
 FWD based on wt > 3L. Pt does complain of thirst on
   exam.
   - Increase free water boluses via tube feeds from 50 cc q4h to 250 cc
   q4h.
   - Recheck serum Na in pm.
   # Coffee grounds per NG tube:  Several days ago, now s/p NG tube
   placement without further coffee grounds. Stable. EGD [**4-2**] revealed
   portal HTN gastropathy and 3 grade II varices. Coffee grounds seen in
   esophagus and stomach thought to be [**12-21**] nose bleed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of renal failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/37 mmHg to 107/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently high, ranging from 139 to 192 mg/dL. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. Other abnormalities include low platelet count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate acute renal failure, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and uremic symptoms.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and renal dysfunction suggest the possibility of hepatorenal syndrome, a condition characterized by liver disease leading to kidney failure.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB): The presence of hematemesis may indicate an upper GI bleed, which can result in hypotension and shock if significant blood loss occurs.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels and fluid balance indicate a disorder in electrolyte and fluid management, which can"

The patient is receiving dialysis and has been given IV fluids and albumin for hypotension. He is also receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to liver transplantation and renal failure increases the risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening respiratory status, is essential.
2. Bleeding: The patient's history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding raises concerns about ongoing bleeding or re-bleeding. Regular monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic status, and laboratory values (including coagulation profile) is necessary to identify any changes in bleeding status.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome progression: This syndrome can lead to worsening renal function and potential need for more aggressive dialysis or kidney transplantation. Monitoring serum creatinine levels, urine output, and electrolyte imbalances will help assess the progression of hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's altered mental status, bradycardia, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 55-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, is admitted to the ICU with abdominal distention, jaundice, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient has a high MELD score of 47, indicating severe liver disease. He is encephalopathic, has ascites, and varices. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and bradycardia. He is on pressors to maintain blood pressure and has been on hemodialysis (HD). The patient's labs indicate renal failure with elevated BUN and creatinine levels, along with electrolyte imbalances such as hypernatremia. The patient also has thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's nutritional support includes receiving Nutren Renal at 45 mL/hour. The patient's disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's WBC count is elevated, which is concerning for a new infection, especially given his hypoTN (hypotensive state). The patient is already on vancomycin for suspected hospital-acquired infection, and cultures should be monitored.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating ongoing hypotension. This could be related to HD or another underlying cause. Close monitoring and appropriate pressor therapy are necessary.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with MELD 47 HCV cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, and varices.
- He was admitted with abdominal distention, jaundice, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
- The patient's family declined the placement of a paracentesis (para) and arterial line.
- The patient has been receiving vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) per hospital protocol.
- He is currently on pressors for hypotension related to hemodialysis (HD).
- The patient has leukocytosis, which has improved, and negative cultures to date.
- He remains encephalopathic with a MELD score of 58 in the setting of SBP and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
- The patient continues to receive lactulose and rifaximin for ESLD, as well as antimicrobials.
- He is being followed by hepatology and transplant surgery.
- The patient has renal failure, classified as type 1 HRS in the setting of SBP and decompensated liver failure.
- He is on HD and midodrine/octreotide, and is being followed by renal services.
- The patient's electrolytes, BUN/Cr, and phosphorus levels are being monitored.
- He is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a feeding tube (TF).
- The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP precautions.
- His code status is full code, and his current disposition is ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at high risk for developing infections due to his compromised immune system as a result of ESLD, SBP, and the use of immunosuppressive medications.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathic state can worsen, leading to altered mental status and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further, requiring continuous monitoring and management.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension, likely due to the combination of ESLD, SBP, and HRS, can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and organ failure.
5. Variceal Bleeding: The patient's varices can rupture, resulting in significant bleeding and potentially life-threatening consequences.
6. Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Given the patient's history of HCV cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatocellular carcinoma development, which can complicate the clinical picture."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of HCV cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, admitted SBP, and on the transplant list. He was admitted with hypoTN and leukocytosis. The patient has a macular blanching erythematous rash in the right upper extremity, suspected drug eruption or skin infection. He also has recurrent para negative and is being treated for SBP, ESLD, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient has signs of abdominal dullness, which raises concern for SBP. This can lead to infection and sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has ongoing encephalopathy symptoms, indicating impaired liver function. This can lead to further cognitive decline and potential complications such as infections or gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient has renal failure secondary to HRS. This condition can worsen and lead to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-inch tall individual with unknown weight, admitted to the ICU due to acute renal failure, hepatorenal syndrome, upper gastrointestinal bleed, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, bradycardia, and hypotension. The patient has a history of piperacillin/tazobactam allergy. The patient's vital signs are stable with sinus bradycardia, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and 100% oxygen saturation. The patient has received multiple infusions of phenylephrine and other ICU medications. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, potassium, and lactate, while other lab values are within normal range. The patient's renal function has progressively worsened, leading to acute renal failure. The patient also has evidence of liver dysfunction and coagulopathy. The patient's nutritional support is being provided through enteral feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening renal function: The patient's creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels are elevated, indicating a decline in renal function. This could lead to further fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the accumulation of waste products.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's liver dysfunction may progress to hepatorenal syndrome, which is characterized by renal failure secondary to advanced liver disease. This condition requires prompt management to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has experienced hematemesis, indicating a potential upper gastrointestinal bleed. If this condition recurs or worsens, it could result in significant blood loss, hypotension, and shock.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte levels, including potassium and calcium, are abnormal. Inadequate correction of these imbalances can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other systemic complications.
5. Altered mental status: The patient presents with altered mental status, which may be due to various factors such as electrolyte imbalances, hepatic encephalopathy, or multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Proper evaluation and management are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
6. Bradyarrhythmia: The patient's sinus bradycardia requires close monitoring for potential bradyarrhythmias. Any significant bradycardia or heart block should be addressed promptly to maintain adequate cardiac output.
7. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be attributed to hypovolemia from gastrointestinal bleeding, decreased cardiac output, or vasodilatory effects of medications. Appropriate fluid resuscitation and hemodynamic support are necessary to maintain adequate tissue perfusion.
8. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to acute renal failure and liver dysfunction, making them susceptible to infections. Close monitoring for signs of infection and prompt initiation of antimicrobial therapy are essential to prevent sepsis and septic shock."

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of acute renal failure, hepatorenal syndrome, upper gastrointestinal bleed (hematemesis), electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, bradycardia, and hypotension. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is receiving various treatments including vasopressor support, fluid resuscitation, and renal replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury progression: The patient's baseline renal function is already compromised, and further deterioration can occur due to ongoing hypotension and inadequate renal perfusion.
2. Infection: The patient is at an increased risk of developing infections due to the presence of multiple lines and tubes, as well as compromised immune function.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: There is a possibility of re-bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract, considering the history of hematemesis and ongoing coagulopathy.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's bradycardia needs close monitoring, and there is a potential risk for developing other cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances and the effects of medications.
5. Hypotension and shock: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and there is a concern for persistent hypotension leading to shock, especially during periods of increased fluid losses or if vasopressor support is inadequate.
6. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status puts him at risk for"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of MELD 58 HCV cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, admitted for SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and was on the transplant list. The patient developed hypoTN (hypotension) and leukocytosis. A paracentesis was performed, which showed negative gram stain. The patient is currently being treated with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) antibiotics, lactulose, rifaximin, and midodrine/octreotide. The patient's condition includes hypoTN, leukocytosis, SBP, ESLD (end-stage liver disease), HRS (hepatorenal syndrome type 1), and a macular blanching erythematous rash in the right upper extremity, possibly due to a drug eruption or skin infection. The patient is also experiencing renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. SBP: The patient's recent admission for SBP indicates a high risk of recurrent infections, which can lead to worsening of the patient's condition and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. ESLD: The patient's advanced liver disease puts him at risk for further complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatomegaly.
3. HRS: The patient's hepatorenal syndrome type 1 indicates renal dysfunction, which may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1806**] is a 55-year-old male with MELD 58 HCV cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, admitted SBP, and on transplant list. He developed hypoTN and leukocytosis. The patient underwent paracentesis, wound culture, and sent ascites fluid for testing. The diagnostic para was negative, but there is concern for drug rash or skin infection due to a new rash. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is receiving appropriate medications. He has been de-listed from the transplant list. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient presented with SBP, which is an infection of the ascitic fluid. This can lead to severe complications if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Hepatic Hydrothorax: Ascites can also cause hepatic hydrothorax, where fluid accumulates in the pleural space. This can compromise respiratory function.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient has developed HRS, a type of renal failure caused by severe liver damage. This can progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed properly.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function due to liver dysfunction. This can lead to altered mental status and increased risk of infections.
5. Drug Eruption/Rash: The new rash on the patient's arm raises concern for a drug eruption or skin infection. Monitoring and consultation with a dermatologist are necessary to determine the cause and appropriate management.
6. Transplant List Status: The patient has been de-listed from the transplant list, indicating that he may not be eligible for a liver transplant at this time. This could be due to his current medical condition or other factors.
7. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and hypoTN suggest an ongoing infection, possibly related to SBP or another source. Continuing antibiotic therapy is essential to manage and prevent further infections.
8. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, requiring phenylephrine to maintain adequate perfusion. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status is necessary to adjust treatment accordingly.
9. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to his chronic liver disease and reduced oral intake. Enteral nutrition support may be required to meet his nutritional needs.
10. Liver Failure: The patient's decompensated HCV cirrhosis with high MELD score indicates advanced liver failure. Continued management of complications and optimization of liver function are crucial.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-inch old individual admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, hypotension, and renal failure. They have a history of liver disease and are currently on the transplant list. The patient's blood cultures are negative, and they have been delisted from the transplant list but have been readmitted. They have been receiving treatment with antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin), but these were stopped due to negative cultures. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6 C (97.9 F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/47 to 109/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal impairment, as well as abnormal liver function tests. The patient is receiving dialysis and nutritional support through an enteral feeding tube. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of diarrhea suggest a possible acute renal failure, which is a significant concern.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome: Given the patient's history of liver disease and the presence of renal failure, hepatorenal syndrome should be considered as a potential complication.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The presence of hematemesis raises the possibility of an upper gastrointestinal bleed, which requires further evaluation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of MELD 58 HCV cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He was previously on the transplant list but developed hypoTN and leukocytosis. The patient has decompensated liver disease with a negative paracentesis gram stain. He requires phenylephrine for hypotension and his white blood cell count is trending down. The patient's condition includes SBP, ESLD, renal failure, and a macular blanching erythematous rash in the right upper extremity, which could be a drug eruption or skin infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SBP: The patient's current and previous paracentesis results were negative, indicating no evidence of infection. However, the patient still requires vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics as recommended by the ID physician. Close monitoring is necessary to ensure resolution of the SBP without any further complications.

2. ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease): The patient has a high MELD score (58), indicating severe liver dysfunction. He is encephalopathic and has ascites, which are complications of ESLD. The patient is on the transplant list, but complications such as hypoTN and leukocytosis may affect his eligibility for transplantation. Continued management with lactulose and rifaximin is necessary"

The patient is a 55-year-old male with MELD 58 HCV cirrhosis, who presented with encephalopathy, ascites, and admitted spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is currently on the transplant list and has been experiencing hypotension and leukocytosis. The patient underwent a paracentesis, which revealed negative gram stain. His white blood cell count is trending down, but he still requires phenylephrine to maintain stable blood pressure. The patient also has decompensated liver failure with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type 1. He is on hemodialysis and midodrine/octreotide. The patient's renal function has not shown signs of recovery. He is receiving lactulose and rifaximin for ESLD, and his liver function tests (LFTs) are being monitored. The patient's renal function is also being closely monitored, and he is on a phosphate binder due to elevated phosphate levels. He is being followed by hepatology and transplant surgery. The patient's current medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, levo, and phenylephrine. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/47-109/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) complicated by end-stage liver disease (ESLD), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He was admitted for progressive somnolence and initiation of hemodialysis (HD). The patient is currently stable, tolerating HD, and awaiting a liver transplant. However, his current pressor requirement is likely to preclude transplantation.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 89/47 mmHg and a heart rate of 54 bpm. His respiratory rate is within normal limits at 18 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 36.6 degrees Celsius.

Physical examination reveals jaundice and distended abdomen, indicating liver dysfunction. Neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and is oriented to time, place, and person. However, movement, tone, and deep tendon reflexes are not assessed.

Laboratory results indicate deranged liver function tests, including elevated bilirubin, ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels. The patient also has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 46,000/mm³. Renal"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-inch tall individual with an unknown weight, admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and hypotension. The patient has a history of altered elimination, renal failure, hepatorenal syndrome, upper gastrointestinal bleed, electrolyte and fluid disorder, bradycardia, and altered mental status. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.9 F), current temperature of 36.4 C (97.5 F), heart rate of 52 bpm within normal range, blood pressure of 88/44 mmHg (53/26 - 105/80 mmHg), respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute within normal range, oxygen saturation of 92%, and sinus bradycardia as the heart rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,079 mL and total output of 992 mL, resulting in a balance of 550 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg within normal range.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 11.2 to 20.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 32.6% to 35.2%, platelet count ranging from 32 to 54 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 7.8 to 11.4 mg/dL, glucose levels ranging from 130 to 180 mg/dL, and other lab abnormalities including elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate level, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Assessment and plan include alterations in elimination related to diarrhea, acute renal failure, hepatorenal syndrome, upper gastrointestinal bleed, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, bradycardia, and hypotension.

ICU care includes nutrition provided through Nutren Renal (Full), glycemic control measures, multiple lines including a dialysis catheter and PICC line, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications for this patient may include worsening of acute renal failure, development of further electrolyte imbalances, progression of hepatorenal syndrome, increased risk of infections due to altered mental status and compromised immune system, and complications related to the upper gastrointestinal bleed such as re-bleeding or development of strictures. Close monitoring and management of fluid and electrolyte balance, renal function, and gastrointestinal status will be crucial in preventing and managing these potential complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of MELD 58 HCV cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, admitted SBP, and on the transplant list. He developed hypoTN and leukocytosis. The patient has decompensated liver failure with MELD 58, in the setting of SBP and HRS. He remains encephalopathic. The patient has renal failure with HRS type 1 in the setting of SBP and decompensated liver failure. He is on HD and midodrine/octreotide. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient requires continuous pressor support, which indicates ongoing hypotension. This could be due to hepatorenal syndrome or septic shock secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient initially presented with leukocytosis, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation. It is important to monitor the white blood cell count trend and repeat paracentesis and blood cultures to identify the causative organism.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient remains encephalopathic, indicating ongoing hepatic dysfunction. Treatment with lactulose and rifaximin should be continued, and follow-up with hepatology is advised.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1): The patient has HRS-1, a form of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of end-stage liver disease (ESLD). The patient is currently admitted for progressive somnolence and initiation of hemodialysis (HD). The patient's encephalopathy is stable, and they are tolerating HD. The patient's white blood cell count is down, and pressor requirement is stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient continues to require a stable dose of neo for blood pressure support, indicating ongoing issues with maintaining stable blood pressure. This may lead to further complications such as organ perfusion issues or shock.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status has improved, but there is ongoing treatment with lactulose and rifaximin via nasogastric tube to manage encephalopathy. If the treatment is not effective or if the patient develops new symptoms, this could lead to worsening encephalopathy and potential respiratory failure.

3. Acute renal failure/ hepatorenal syndrome (ARF/HRS): The patient continues to require dialysis, indicating ongoing kidney dysfunction. If this condition worsens, it may lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, or uremic toxicity.

4. Infection: The patient's blood culture results are pending, which may indicate a potential infection. Prompt identification and treatment of any infection are crucial to prevent further complications and systemic"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of MELD 58 HCV cirrhosis, complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, admitted SBP, and on the transplant list. He developed hypoTN and leukocytosis. The patient underwent paracentesis on [**2145-4-9**] with negative results for infection. Antimicrobials were stopped as per ID recommendation. The patient's MS remains unchanged. He is currently on lactulose and rifaximin for ESLD, and his LFTs are being monitored. He also has renal failure with HRS type 1, for which he is on HD and midodrine/octreotide. The patient's vital signs show low blood pressure (BP) in the 80s, heart rate (HR) around 67 bpm, respiratory rate (RR) at 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 93%. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,973 mL and output of 1,082 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,473 mL. His blood glucose level is elevated at 159 mg/dL, while his white blood cell count has been trending down. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium at 3.5 mEq/L. The"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and admitted SBP. He has been on the transplant list but developed hypoTN and leukocytosis. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, leukocytosis, encephalopathy, and negative paracentesis results. He is currently on phenylephrine, lactulose, rifaximin, HD, midodrine/octreotide, and receiving full nutrition. The patient's labs show elevated WBC count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's ongoing encephalopathy indicates a potential complication of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause confusion, altered mental status, and even coma in advanced stages.

2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has had previous episodes of SBP, which is a bacterial infection in the abdominal cavity. It can lead to severe complications if not managed properly.

3. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient has been diagnosed with HRS type 1, a form of renal failure associated with severe liver disease. This condition is often irreversible and requires urgent management.

4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and previous history of SBP indicate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 55-year-old male with ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease), HCV cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and SBP (Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis).
- The patient is on vasopressors and awaiting liver transplant.
- There have been attempts to wean off vasopressors, but the patient had to be put back on.
- Paracentesis performed on 4/9 was negative for SBP, and WBC count is trending down.
- Antibiotics have been discontinued.
- The patient remains encephalopathic and has a MELD score of 58.
- He is currently on the transplant list as of 4/10.
- Lactulose and rifaximin are being continued, and liver function tests are being monitored.
- The patient also has renal failure, classified as HRS type 1, with no signs of renal recovery.
- He is on HD (Hemodialysis) and midodrine/octreotide. SPA (Surgical Placement of Aorta) was received yesterday.
- Renal recommendations are being followed, and electrolytes, BUN/Cr (Blood Urea Nitrogen/Creatinine), are being monitored.
- TFs (Total Fluids) are being managed, and fluids are being replete as necessary.
- SCDs (Surgical Consultations/Diagnoses) and PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitor) are being addressed.
- Contacts are listed for HCPs (Healthcare Providers), including sisters and additional HCPs.
- Disposition remains ICU level of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating a risk of hypotension. This could be due to the underlying liver disease, SBP, or the use of vasopressors.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient continues to experience encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function due to severe liver disease. This can lead to confusion, altered mental status, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Ascites: The patient has ascites, which is the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. If not properly managed, it can lead to respiratory distress, infection, or other complications.
5. SBP: Although the recent paracentesis was negative for SBP, the patient's history of SBP increases the risk of recurrence and potential complications such as sepsis or organ failure.
6. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure, classified as HRS type 1, indicates a poor prognosis and an increased risk of complications related to kidney function.
7. HRS: Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HRS) can occur as a complication of liver"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathic condition indicates a risk of further deterioration in mental status, potentially leading to coma.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): Although the recent paracentesis was negative for SBP, the patient's history of SBP puts him at risk for recurrent infections.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient's renal failure in the setting of SBP and decompensated liver failure indicates a risk of progressive kidney dysfunction.
4. Liver transplant complications: The patient is awaiting liver transplantation, which carries its own risks, including surgical complications, rejection, and post-transplant infections.
5. Hypotension: The patient's requirement for vasopressors suggests ongoing hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of multiorgan failure.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ascites and portal hypertension increase the risk"

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with ESLD, SBP, HCV cirrhosis, encephalopathy, and ascites who is awaiting a liver transplant. He is currently in the ICU and requires vasopressors. 

The patient has had several events over the past few days, including hypotension and leukocytosis. A paracentesis was performed on [**2145-4-9**] which was negative for SBP. The patient's WBC count has been trending down. The antimicrobials have been held per ID. 

The patient's SBP was previously positive but subsequent paracentesis on [**4-1**] and [**4-9**] were negative. The antibiotics vanco and pip/tazo were discontinued after a 14-day course. 

The patient remains encephalopathic and has a MELD score of 58. He is currently on the transplant list as of [**2145-4-10**]. 

The patient also has renal failure with HRS type 1. He is on HD and midodrine/octreotide. He received SPA yesterday. 

The plan includes continuing lactulose and rifaxamin, following up with hepatology and transplant [**Doctor First Name 91**], and monitoring LFTs. The patient will continue to be monitored for renal recovery and electrolyte imbalances. FEN and PPx have been ordered.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with MELD 58 HCV cirrhosis, presenting with encephalopathy, ascites, SBP, and awaiting liver transplant. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 92/41 mmHg, heart rate of 64 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on vasopressors and receiving albumin infusions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may indicate ongoing hypotension. Continuous monitoring and management of blood pressure is essential to prevent further complications.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be indicative of an infection or inflammation. Repeat paracentesis and cultures should be done to rule out SBP.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has HRS type 1, a form of renal failure associated with liver disease. The patient is on hemodialysis and receiving midodrine/octreotide. Close monitoring of electrolytes and BUN/Cr levels is necessary.
4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has encephalopathy, which may worsen without proper management. Continuation of lactulose and rifaximin is recommended, along with follow-up with hepatology.
5. Liver Transplant Evaluation: The patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1806**] is a 55 year old male with MELD 58 HCV cirhosis c/b
   encephalopathy, ascites, SBP on vasopressors awaiting liver transplant.
   # Anemia:  Considering streaks of bright red blood, likely secondary to
   LGIB, with possible sources being hemorrhoids, diverticulosis, or
   mass.  UGIB unlikely given absence of melena, though patient did have
   varices at time of scope in [**3-27**].
   - transfuse for Hct>25, plt<50
   - FFP, desmopressin
   - touch base with hepatology regarding willingness to scope
   - hemolysis labs
   # Hypotension, leukocytosis: Repeat paracentesis ([**2145-4-9**]) negative for
   SBP with cultures NGTD.  WBC trending down.  Weaned off neo on [**4-15**].
   Antimicrobials held per ID.
   - Per tx [**Doctor First Name 91**], SPA Q6H.
   - F/u paracentesis and blood cultures.
   # SBP: Para negative on [**4-1**] and repeat para negative on [**4-9**].
   - vanco and pip/tazo discontinued after 14 day course
   - Follow-up culture data
   # ESLD: Patient with decompensated HCV cirrhosis with MELD 58 in the
   setting of SBP, HRS. Remains encephalopathic, although mental status
   improved from initial micu admission.  Per hepatology attending,
   patient is currently on the transplant list as of [**2145-4-10**].
   - Continue lactulose and rifaxamin.
   - Trend LFTs.
   -  Follow-up with hepatology and transplant [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   # Renal failure: Patient with HRS type 1 in setting of SBP and
   decompensated liver failure. Patient on HD for 15 days, irenal states
   that he is now a candidate for renal transplant also.
   - On HD and midodrine/octreotide.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not clearly stated in the note, but it can be inferred that she has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by the presence of BRBPR (blood-tinged red blood cells in the stool) and hematemesis (vomiting of blood). 

The patient's vital signs show a stable temperature, with a maximum temperature of 37°C (98.6°F) and a current temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F). Her heart rate is within the normal range at 68 beats per minute (bpm), but her blood pressure is low, ranging from 100/57 mmHg to 124/63 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is normal at 14 breaths per minute (bpm), and her oxygen saturation is consistently above 95% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments, including the placement of a dialysis catheter and a PICC line. She is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and is being monitored for glycemic control. Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis have also been implemented.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, altered mental status, and electrolyte imbalance. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 100/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications and fluids through infusions. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, as well as elevated liver enzymes and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's condition has been monitored closely with frequent assessments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is experiencing lower gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypotension and shock if not managed properly.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidney function is impaired, indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, as well as the accumulation of waste products in the body.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: Given the patient's liver dysfunction and renal failure, there is a risk of developing hepatorenal syndrome, which further compromises kidney function.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, including low potassium and magnesium, which can affect cardiac rhythm and muscle"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of MELD 58 HCV cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and SBP. He is currently on vasopressors and awaiting liver transplant. The patient has several ongoing medical issues that require attention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient likely has low-grade and stable LGIB. His HCT is stable, but transfusion may be required if his HCT falls below 21, PLT below 10, or if there is active bleeding, decompensation, or ischemia with HCT above 30 and PLT above 50. FFP and desmopressin may be used if bleeding occurs.

2. Hypotension and Leukocytosis: The patient previously experienced hypotension and leukocytosis. A repeat paracentesis on [**2145-4-9**] was negative for SBP, and his WBC count is trending down. Hypotension has resolved, and he has been weaned off neo. Antimicrobials were held per ID. The patient should continue to be monitored for any signs of recurrent infection or sepsis.

3. SBP: Although the patient's paracentesis on [**4-1**] and repeat para negative on [**4-9**] were negative for SBP, he remains at risk for recurrent infections"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with MELD 58 HCV cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is currently in the ICU awaiting liver transplantation. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/33 to 114/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on nasal cannula. His laboratory results show mild anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure with a creatinine level of 7.8 mg/dL. The patient is being treated with vasopressors, diuretics, antimicrobials, lactulose, rifaximin, and hemodialysis. His mental status has improved since admission, and he is on the transplant list.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of HCV cirrhosis and current encephalopathic state indicate a risk for hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause cognitive impairment and may require adjustment of lactulose dosage.
2. SBP recurrence: Despite negative paracentesis results, the patient's history of SBP puts him at risk for recurrence. Close monitoring of vital signs and regular paracentesis may be necessary.
3. Renal failure:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified, but the note mentions several ongoing health issues. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 35.9 C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/33 to 114/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,907 mL and output of 1,607 mL, indicating a positive fluid balance of 300 mL. The patient is receiving various medications and infusions, including antibiotics, midodrine, octreotide, and other ICU medications.

The patient's laboratory results reveal abnormalities in several parameters. The white blood cell count is elevated at 13.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level is 9.4 g/dL, platelet count is 53 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen level is 29 K/uL, creatinine level is 7.8 mg/dL, and lactate level is 1.1 mmol/L. The liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are also elevated, along with altered levels of electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, chloride, and magnesium.

The patient's assessment and plan indicate multiple medical complications, including gastrointestinal bleed, altered elimination related to diarrhea, acute renal failure, hepatorenal syndrome, hematemesis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, bradycardia, and hypotension.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these findings include worsening gastrointestinal bleed leading to hypovolemic shock, worsening acute renal failure potentially progressing to chronic kidney disease, further deterioration of liver function in hepatorenal syndrome, persistent electrolyte and fluid imbalances, progression of altered mental status to delirium, and persistent bradycardia and hypotension requiring further intervention.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's condition and provide appropriate medical interventions to manage these complications and prevent further deterioration."

The patient is a 73-inch tall individual with a current temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 89/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert, oriented, and not in acute distress. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rhythm with no murmurs, supple neck, and no clubbing or cyanosis in the extremities. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, altered elimination, acute renal failure, hepatorenal syndrome, upper gastrointestinal bleed, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, bradycardia, and hypotension. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, which can lead to hypotension and shock if not managed appropriately.
2. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which can result in electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has hepatorenal syndrome, a condition where kidney function deteriorates due to severe liver disease. This can worsen renal failure and require dial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of MELD 58 HCV cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is currently on vasopressors and awaiting liver transplantation. The patient's current conditions include anemia, hypotension, leukocytosis, SBP, ESLD (end-stage liver disease), and renal failure (HRS type 1).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's HCT (hematocrit) is stable but may require transfusion if it falls below 21%, PLT (platelet count) falls below 10, or in the presence of active bleeding, decompensation, or ischemia when HCT is above 30% and PLT is above 50.
2. Hypotension and Leukocytosis: The patient's hypotension has resolved, and WBC (white blood cell count) is trending down. However, repeat paracentesis on [**2145-4-9**] was negative for SBP, and cultures NGTD (negative gram stain, no growth on blood culture) were obtained. Antimicrobials were held per ID (infectious disease) due to the negative results.
3. SBP: Although para-centesis on [**4-1**] and repeat para-centesis on [**4-9"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his
   note above, including assessment and plan.  PMH, SH, FH and ROS are
   unchanged from admission except where noted above and below.

    4. Hypotension: consistently mildly hypotensive, but mentating and
       comfortable. Will use pressors if necessary but this appears to be
       his baseline. If he develops signs/sxs of volume overload such as
       increased dyspnea, hypoxemia, hypotension with possible increased
       IVC pressure, abd pain, then we can consider titrating pressor to
       remove fluid by dialysis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with MELD 58 HCV cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and SBP on vasopressors awaiting liver transplant.
- The patient's condition has been relatively stable, with some fluctuations in vital signs and lab results.
- The patient's mental status has improved from initial admission, although he remains encephalopathic.
- Serial paracentesis has been negative for recurrent SBP, and antimicrobials have been held per ID.
- The patient is on lactulose and rifaximin for ESLD, and on HD for renal failure.
- The patient is awaiting liver and kidney transplants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ESLD/ESRD awaiting liver and kidney transplant.
2. Encephalopathy - mental status may deteriorate.
3. Volume overload - the patient may develop signs of increased dyspnea, hypoxemia, hypotension, increased IVC pressure, abdominal pain.
4. Hypotension - may require pressor support, but careful monitoring is needed to avoid volume overload.
5. Anemia and thrombocytopenia - counts stable but may require transfusion if Hct falls below 21, plt below 10, or if there is active bleeding or decompensation.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of MELD 58 HCV cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is currently on vasopressors awaiting a liver transplant. The patient's condition has been stable, with improvements in mental status and resolution of hypotension. He remains encephalopathic but alert and oriented. His anemia and thrombocytopenia are stable, and he is being monitored for any signs of bleeding. The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is on hemodialysis (HD) for 15 days. He has also been identified as a candidate for a renal transplant. The patient's nutrition is being managed due to his aspiration risk, and prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and he is awaiting transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ESLD/ESRD awaiting liver and kidney transplant: The patient has decompensated HCV cirrhosis with a high MELD score, indicating a severe liver disease. He also has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring renal transplant.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient continues to experience encephalopathic episodes, although his mental status has improved from initial admission. Monitoring for any further"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with MELD 58 HCV cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy, ascites, and SBP. He is currently on vasopressors and awaiting liver transplant. The patient has been experiencing hypotension and leukocytosis but has shown improvement after repeating paracentesis and discontinuing antimicrobials. He also has anemia likely due to low-grade and stable LGIB, as indicated by HCT stable. The patient's mental status has improved from initial admission, and he is currently on the transplant list. He is being managed with lactulose and rifaximin for ESLD, midodrine/octreotide for renal failure, and hemodialysis for HRS type 1. The patient requires continued monitoring and follow-up with hepatology, transplant, and renal teams.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's ongoing confusion and mental status changes may indicate ongoing hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can lead to further deterioration in mental function and potential development of severe complications such as infections or bleeding.

2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): Although the patient's most recent paracentesis was negative for SBP, there is still a risk for recurrence due to his compromised liver function. SBP can lead to sepsis and multiorgan failure if not promptly treated.

3. Liver transplantation: While the patient is on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of MELD 58 HCV cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and SBP. He is currently in the ICU awaiting a liver transplant. The patient has been off vasopressors and has improved mental status. His blood cultures are negative for infection. He has been treated for SBP and his antimicrobials have been held per ID. The patient remains encephalopathic but is on the transplant list. He is being monitored for anemia, hypotension, leukocytosis, ESLD, renal failure, and other complications related to his liver disease. Nutrition and glycemic control are being managed, and prophylaxis measures are in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, and his laboratory values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient is at risk for low-grade anemia due to LGIB. Close monitoring of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is necessary. Transfusion may be required if the patient's Hct falls below 21, Plt below 10, or if there are signs of active bleeding, decompensation, or ischemia.
2. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension in the past but is currently stable. Monitoring of blood pressure and prompt treatment if hypotension occurs is essential.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient had leuk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a medical history of MELD 58 HCV cirrhosis, encephalopathy, ascites, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). He is currently in the ICU awaiting a liver transplant. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 102/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His physical examination is notable for sclera anicteric, clear oropharynx, supple neck, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and no abdominal tenderness or organomegaly. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated bilirubin levels, thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 39), anemia (hematocrit of 31.1), and renal dysfunction (creatinine of 9.0). The patient's white blood cell count has been fluctuating, with the most recent result at 10.6. The assessment and plan include management of anemia, hypotension, leukocytosis, SBP, ESLD, renal failure, and ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of encephalopathy indicates a risk for further deterioration of mental status.
2. Infection: Despite negative"
