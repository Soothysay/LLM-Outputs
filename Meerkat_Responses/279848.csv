   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
   2. Severe left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   3. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
   OSH blood culture:
 bottles positive for GPC, speciation and
   sensitivities pending
   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting evaluation for CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI, now down-trending cardiac enzymes. Given low CK,
   elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely patient had
   acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now down-trending.
   Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be in the setting
   of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath, with critical left
   main stenosis. Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, beta-blocker, high dose statin
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - started low dose ACEI (captopril 6.25 mg PO TID) on CCU transfer
   given EF of 30%
   - hold heparin gtt for now, will restart when pt has anginal equivalent
   (""heart-burn"" sx)
   - plavix washout for 5 days prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US and UA as part of the pre-op eval
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   - restart heparin gtt
   - remove swan catheter today
   .
   # PUMP:  Acute decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 30%
   on TTE on [**2180-2-14**]) likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows
   elevated pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient
   with evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures) likely worsened in setting of elevated PCWP. Patient has
   evidence of both right and left sided heart failure. Received 60 mg of
   IV lasix in cath lab, and another dose of 40mg IV lasix, with good UOP.
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - lasix 40mg IV this am, with goal -1L to -1.5L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - continue ACEI (captopril) given depressed EF
   - continue BB
   - remove swan today
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  This is concerning especially given her smoking
   history.  However, her weight loss and decreased appetite could be due
   to related to heart failure and bowel congestion, especially given her
   elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above to reduce wedge pressure
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - f/u final CTA read
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   - pt will need regular outpatient f/u
   - remove swan today
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # SOB: likely secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt
   is ambulatory, no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE
   exam.
   - treat CHF as above
   - f/u on final PE-CT read
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - bloos sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, captopril
   - will uptitrate captopril and down-titrate hydralazine
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # Positive blood culture from OSH:
 bottles positive for GPC at [**Hospital1 **].  Possible contamination but need to f/u OSH micro.
   - call [**Hospital3 **] today regarding speciation and sensitivity

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD) presenting with progressive dyspnea on exertion, NSTEMI, and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. She has severe left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction, severe pulmonary hypertension, and three-vessel coronary artery disease. The patient is awaiting evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient had an acute ACS event a few weeks ago, evidenced by elevated cardiac enzymes. It is crucial to monitor her for any signs of recurrent angina or myocardial infarction.

2. Heart Failure: The patient has acute decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%. Close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolytes, and daily weight is essential. Treatment includes diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers.

3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has evidence of pulmonary hypertension, likely worsened by elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Smoking cessation and aggressive treatment of heart failure are important in managing this condition.

4. Colonoscopy: The patient's unintentional weight loss raises concern for potential malignancy. A colonoscopy should be performed to evaluate for colorectal cancer as a potential cause of her symptoms.

   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting evaluation for CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI (elevated troponin-T of 1.04), now down-trending.
   Given low CK, elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely
   patient had acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now
   down-trending. Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be
   in the setting of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath today.
   Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, beta-blocker, high dose statin
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - started low dose ACEI (captopril 6.25 mg PO TID) on CCU transfer
   given EF of 30%
   - hold heparin gtt for now, will restart when pt has anginal equivalent
   (""heart-burn"" sx)
   - plavix washout for 5 days prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US and UA as part of the pre-op eval
   - IABP if worsening chest pain, worsening heart failure or hypotension
   .
   # PUMP:  Acute decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 30%
   on TTE on [**2180-2-14**]) likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows
   elevated pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient
   with evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures) likely worsened in setting of elevated PCWP. Patient has
   evidence of both right and left sided heart failure. Received 60 mg of
   IV lasix in cath lab, and another dose of 40mg IV lasix, with good UOP.
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - lasix 40mg IV this am, with goal -1L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   - continue ACEI (captopril) given depressed EF
   - continue BB
   - no indication for IABP currently, can consider placement of IABP if
   hypotensive or heart failure worsens
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  This is concerning especially given her smoking
   history.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above to reduce wedge pressure
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - f/u final CTA read
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   - pt will need regular outpatient f/u
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # SOB: likely secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt
   is ambulatory, no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE
   exam.
   - treat CHF as above
   - f/u on final PE-CT read
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - bloos sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, hydralazine, captopril
   - goal SBP 120-130s to decrease afterload: if achievable with
   metoprolol and ACEI, can consider stopping hydralazine.
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # Positive blood culture from OSH:
 bottles positive for GPC at [**Hospital1 **].  Possible contamination but need to f/u OSH micro.
   - call [**Hospital3 **] today regarding speciation and sensitivity

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion. She has been diagnosed with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has severe left and right ventricular diastolic dysfunction, severe pulmonary hypertension, and three-vessel coronary artery disease (3VD). She is awaiting evaluation for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Potential medical complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient had an ACS event in the past few weeks, indicated by elevated troponin levels and temporal symptoms. It is important to continue monitoring her cardiac status and provide appropriate treatment.

2. Diabetic Neuropathy: The patient has diabetes mellitus type II and may have developed diabetic neuropathy, which can cause a lack of angina equivalent symptoms. Regular monitoring of her diabetic control and neuropathic pain management is necessary.

3. Pulmonary Hypertension (PH): The patient has severe pulmonary hypertension, which may be worsened by elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and right heart failure. Smoking cessation and treatment of CHF are crucial to reduce wedge pressure and improve pulmonary function.

4. Weight Loss and Possible Malignancy: The patient has unintentionally lost 30 pounds over the past 6 months. Her smoking history raises concern for malignancy, and a colonoscopy is needed to"

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). She also has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, and is a current smoker. 

The patient has undergone cardiac catheterization, which revealed triple vessel disease (3VD) with critical left main stenosis. She is currently awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. 

In the ICU, the patient's central venous catheter was removed due to positive cultures for coagulase-negative staphylococci. She was started on heparin infusion for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The patient's chest X-ray showed interstitial abnormality in the left lung with nodularity, raising concern for lymphangitic carcinomatosis. However, a CT scan ruled out this condition. 

Her vital signs are stable, but she has evidence of both right and left-sided heart failure, with diastolic and systolic dysfunction. Her ejection fraction (EF) on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is 30%. 

The patient's pain equivalent symptoms may be related to diabetic neuropathy,"

   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2589**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Well on IV UFH awaiting CABG on Friday.

   on:[**2180-2-16**] 10:17 ------
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. She has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
- Heart rate: 61 bpm
- Blood pressure: 121/60 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 96% on nasal cannula

Her physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds throughout the lung fields, more significantly decreased breath sounds at the right base, mild crackles at the right base, and prolonged expiratory phase. The patient also has trace lower extremity edema and warm feet. Neurologically, she is grossly intact.

The patient's laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: 12.6 K/uL
- Hemoglobin: 12.7 g/dL
- Sodium: 142 mEq/L
- Potassium: 3.7 mEq/L
- Glucose: 169 mg/dL
- Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
- Troponin-T: 0.87
- Ejection fraction (EF): 30% on TTE

The patient's medical history includes CAD, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral vascular disease. She is a current smoker and has unintentional weight loss of 30 lbs over the past 6 months.

The assessment and plan include the following:
- Coronaries: The patient has multiple risk factors for CAD, including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and current smoking. She also had an acute coronary syndrome event a few weeks ago. She is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
- Pump: The patient has evidence of both right and left-sided heart failure, with diastolic and systolic dysfunction. Her ejection fraction is 30%, and she has elevated pulmonary wedge pressures indicating elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). She also has evidence of pulmonary hypertension, which is likely chronic.
- Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient is a current smoker, and her lung examination reveals decreased breath sounds throughout the lung fields, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The elevated wedge pressure could worsen pulmonary hypertension. She also admits to unintentional weight loss of 30 lbs over the past 6 months, and her chest X-ray indicates interstitial abnormality in the left lung with nodularity concerning for lymphangitic carcinomatosis. However, her CT scan showed no evidence of it.
- Rhythm: The patient is in sinus rhythm but has a first-degree atriovent"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI, now down-trending cardiac enzymes. Given low CK,
   elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely patient had
   acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now down-trending.
   Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be in the setting
   of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath, with critical left
   main stenosis. Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - plavix washout for prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US as part of the pre-op eval
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion.  Her sx of SOB is likely
   secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt is ambulatory,
   no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE exam.  CTA ruled
   out PE.   Pt received 40mg IV lasix x 2 yesterday am and pm, 60mg IV
   lasix at midnight (total of 140mg), approx -600cc balance over the past
   24h
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - lasix 40mg IV this am, with goal -1L to -1.5L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QID
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB, captopril
   - will uptitrate captopril and down-titrate hydralazine
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # UTI:  UA was positive on [**2-15**].  blood cx from [**Hospital3 **] grew out
   Coag neg staph, likely contamination.
   - continue cipro for 3 days for uncomplicated UTI
   - continue to trend WBC and fever

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and smoking. She presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). She also has evidence of right and left-sided heart failure, diastolic and systolic dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's symptoms of progressive dyspnea on exertion and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest a recent ACS event. Close monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary to prevent further cardiac complications.

2. Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction, resulting in acute decompensated CHF. Aggressive treatment of heart failure symptoms and careful management of fluid balance are crucial to prevent worsening heart failure.

3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient's elevated pulmonary arterial pressures indicate chronic pulmonary hypertension. This can lead to right ventricular diastolic dysfunction and peripheral congestion. Smoking cessation and optimization of heart failure treatment are important to manage this condition.

4. Colonoscopy: The patient's unintentional weight loss and decreased appetite warrant further investigation for potential malignancy. A colonoscopy"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Transferred
   from OSH with NSTEMI, now down-trending cardiac enzymes. Given low CK,
   elevated troponin, and temporal symptoms x3 weeks, likely patient had
   acute ACS event a few weeks ago. Troponins are now down-trending.
   Patient had no anginal equivalent symptoms, which may be in the setting
   of diabetic neuropathy. Has 3VD on cardiac cath, with critical left
   main stenosis. Awaiting CABG.
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - plavix washout for prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - may need carotid US as part of the pre-op eval
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion.  Her sx of SOB is likely
   secondary to heart failure.  PE is less likely given pt is ambulatory,
   no calf pain, no recent plain rides, no asymmetric LE exam.  CTA ruled
   out PE.   Pt received 40mg IV lasix x 2 yesterday am and pm, 60mg IV
   lasix at midnight (total of 140mg), approx -600cc balance over the past
   24h
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - lasix 40mg IV this am, with goal -1L to -1.5L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates that the interstitial abnormality in the left
   lung with sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - monitor pt on telemetry

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD) presenting with progressive dyspnea on exertion. She has a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and is awaiting coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery for triple vessel disease and critical left main stenosis. The patient has multiple risk factors for CAD, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and current smoking. She is currently on various medications such as aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, and ACE inhibitors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient shows evidence of both right and left-sided heart failure with diastolic and systolic dysfunction. She has an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and elevated pulmonary wedge pressures indicating elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath are likely secondary to heart failure.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has elevated pulmonary arterial pressures and evidence of chronic pulmonary hypertension, which may be due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cor pulmonale from malignancy. This could worsen her symptoms and increase the risk of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction.
3. Coronary artery disease: The patient has significant CAD with subacute non"

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with subacute NSTEMI (without anginal symptoms)
   now with downtrending Troponins, awaiting CABG for 3VD & critical left
   main stenosis. Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Carotid U/S
   performed on [**2-16**] preliminary read was 40% stenoses bilaterally. Patient
   stable since admission, but de-sating with ambulation, so will remain
   in CCU until surgery.
   - F/U final read of carotid U/S
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - plavix washout for prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion.  Her sx of SOB is likely
   secondary to heart failure.   CTA ruled out PE.
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - decrease lasix gtt to 2.5/hr with goal -2L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - wean O2 as tolerates
   - Repeat CXR today pre-op & assess for changes in fluid status
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates interstitial abnormality in the left lung with
   sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - on telemetry
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QACHS
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB
   - Captopril at 25mg PO TID
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # UTI:  UA was positive on [**2-15**].  blood cx from [**Hospital3 **] grew out
   Coag neg staph, likely contamination.
   - continue cipro for 3 days for uncomplicated UTI, day [**3-15**]
   - continue to trend WBC and fever
   .
   # Med non-compliance:
   - SW consult
   .
   # Smoking cessation:
   - offered nicotine patch, pt refused

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD) presenting with progressive dyspnea on exertion. She has a history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient is currently awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery for triple vessel disease and critical left main stenosis. She has multiple risk factors for CAD including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and current smoking. The patient is stable since admission but desaturates with ambulation, so she will remain in the cardiac care unit (CCU) until surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CAD, NSTEMI, and CHF. She is awaiting CABG surgery, which carries its own risks such as bleeding, infection, arrhythmias, and myocardial ischemia.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient has evidence of right and left-sided heart failure with pulmonary hypertension. This increases the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pulmonary edema.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's use of medications like Lasix and heparin may increase the risk of renal impairment or acute kidney injury (AKI).
4. Infectious Complications: The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections, particularly in"

   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with subacute NSTEMI (without anginal symptoms)
   now with downtrending Troponins, awaiting CABG for 3VD & critical left
   main stenosis. Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Carotid U/S
   performed on [**2-16**] preliminary read was 40% stenoses bilaterally. Patient
   stable since admission, but de-sating with ambulation, so will remain
   in CCU until surgery.
   - F/U final read of carotid U/S
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - plavix washout for prior to CABG
   - f/u Csurg recs
   - urgent surgery if chest pain / angina equivalent unresponsive to
   nitro, morphine, oxygen
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion.  Her sx of SOB is likely
   secondary to heart failure.   CTA ruled out PE.
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - continue lasix gtt at 5/hr with goal -1L today
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - O2 as needed
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates interstitial abnormality in the left lung with
   sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - on telemetry
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%
   - continue RISS
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QACHS

   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB
   - Captopril at 25mg PO TID
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # UTI:  UA was positive on [**2-15**].  blood cx from [**Hospital3 **] grew out
   Coag neg staph, likely contamination.
   - continue cipro for 3 days for uncomplicated UTI, day [**3-15**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with known coronary artery disease (CAD) presenting with progressive dyspnea on exertion, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). She has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and is a current smoker. The patient underwent an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement in 2006 and has bilateral carotid artery stenosis. She is awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery: The patient is awaiting this procedure due to critical left main stenosis and three-vessel disease.
2. Acute decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has evidence of both right and left-sided heart failure with diastolic and systolic dysfunction. She also has pulmonary hypertension, which may worsen her condition.
3. Uncontrolled pain and angina: The patient's chest pain/angina equivalent may be unresponsive to nitro, morphine, oxygen, requiring urgent surgery.
4. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's elevated pulmonary arterial pressures indicate chronic pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right ventricular diastolic dysfunction and peripheral congestion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus type II, and heart failure (CHF). He underwent carotid ultrasound which showed right ICA stenosis less than 40% and left ICA stenosis less than 40%. The patient was started on heparin sodium infusion and furosemide (Lasix) due to his medical conditions.

24-hour events include the placement of a Csurg, discontinuation of lasix gtt at 4pm when urine output decreased and the patient appeared dry, restarting lasix gtt at midnight due to low fluid intake, discontinuation of the foley catheter at 7pm due to hematuria/foley trauma, and the patient being hypoxic on room air. The patient was seen by anesthesia before going to the operating room at 7am.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for improved respiratory symptoms. The patient reported no pain and appeared comfortable.

Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/57mmHg to 103/51mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on continuous heparin and furosemide infusions.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo F with known CAD presenting with progressive dypnea on exertion,
   with NSTEMI and acute decompensated congestive heart failure. Has known
   3VD on cardiac cath, and is awaiting CABG.  She was taken to the OR and
   therefore off of the CCU service on [**2180-2-18**]. She has several issues;
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient with subacute NSTEMI (without anginal symptoms)
   now with downtrending Troponins, awaiting CABG for 3VD & critical left
   main stenosis. Multiple risk factors for CAD including DMII, HTN, HLD,
   and current smoker. s/p IMI in '[**66**] with RCA BMS placement. Carotid U/S
   performed on [**2-16**] preliminary read was 40% stenoses bilaterally. Patient
   stable since admission, but de-sating with ambulation, so will remain
   in CCU until surgery.
   - To OR today
   - continue ASA, BB, high dose statin, ACEI, heparin gtt
   - patient given smoking cessation information by SW
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has evidence of both right and left sided heart
   failure, has both diastolic and systolic heart dysfunction.  EF 30% on
   TTE on [**2180-2-14**], acute decompensation that prompted this admissiion
   likely in setting of ischemia.  Left heart cath shows elevated
   pulmonary wedge pressures, indicating elevated LVEDP. Patient with
   evidence of pulmonary hypertension (elevated pulmonary arterial
   pressures), which is likely chronic, leading to RV diastolic
   dysfunction and peripheral congestion. Serial CXR and physical exams
   show significant right effusiom  Her sx of SOB is likely secondary to
   heart failure.   CTA ruled out PE.
   - continue BB, ACEI
   - low Na diet, fluid restriction < 2 L daily, strict Is and Os, daily
   weight
   - continue diuresis
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes while on diuresis
   - wean O2 as tolerates; patient may need home 02, reassess post-op
   .
   # Pulmonary Hypertension: patient is a current smoker, and her lung
   exam reveals decreased breath sounds throughout lung fields, prolonged
   expiratory phase, consistent with COPD.  COPD could have contributed to
   pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, elevated wedge pressure could
   also worsen pulmonary hypertension.  Another source of pulmonary
   hypertension is cor pulmonale from malignancy.  Pt admits to 30 lb
   weight loss over past 6 months, unintentional. States up to date cancer
   screening including mammograms and pap smears, but no colonoscopies.
   CXR from [**2-13**] indicates interstitial abnormality in the left lung with
   sufficient nodularity to raise concern for lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis.  However, CT showed no evidence for it.  Her weight
   loss and decreased appetite could be due to related to heart failure
   and bowel congestion, especially given her elevated PA pressure.
   - aggressively treat heart failure as above
   - encourage smoking cessation
   - pt will need outpatient pulm f/u for pulmonary hypertension
   - need colonoscopy to work up this weight loss
   - communicate these plans to CSURG team
   .
   # Diabetes Mellitus II: non-insulin dependent. HgA1c 7.0%. Patient not
   likely to benefit from intensive glucose control. However, needs better
   control than currently managing.
   - continue RISS in house
   - diabetic diet
   - blood sugar QACHS
   - restart metformin outpatient
   .
   # RHYTHM: sinus rhythm, has 1' AV block on EKG. 1' AV block may be due
   to decreased coronary supply to AV node from RCA. Hemodynamically
   stable.
   - continue beta-blocker
   - on telemetry
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - continue BB
   - Captopril at 25mg PO TID
   .
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Patient has known PVD and is s/p R iliac
   stent. Stable exertional calf claudication. LDL on lipid panel not at
   goal (98, goal 70-80).
   - continue ASA, high dose statin
   .
   # UTI:  UA was positive on [**2-15**].  blood cx from [**Hospital3 **] grew out
   Coag neg staph, likely contamination.
   - continue cipro for 3 days for uncomplicated UTI, day [**3-15**]
   - continue to trend WBC and fever
   .
   # Med non-compliance:
   - SW consult
   .
   # Smoking cessation:
   -          offered nicotine patch, pt refused. Offer again
   -          motivated to quit per SW consult
