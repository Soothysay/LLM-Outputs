","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male who presents with acute blast crisis, likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He is experiencing leukostasis, which is causing dyspnea, acute renal failure, lung opacities, and mild confusion. The patient has significant electrolyte abnormalities, including hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and hypocalcemia. He is also hyperphosphatemic and hypomagnesemic.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute anuric renal failure, likely due to uric acid deposition or tubular damage from tumor lysis. It is important to monitor renal function closely and manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances.

2. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia, which can lead to complications such as renal dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, and bone demineralization. Fluids and diuretics may be used to manage this condition.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an anion-gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to increased uric acid and BUN levels. This can be treated with bicarbonate supplementation and addressing the underlying cause.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may be chronic in nature. It is important to monitor his heart rhythm and adjust medication dosages accordingly. Anticoagulation should be considered due to the presence of throm"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male who presents with acute blast crisis.
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  Given the description of the smear, likely AML.
   Clinical picture c/w leukostasis and possibly spontaneous tumor lysis
   causing dyspnea, ARF and significant electrolyte abnormalities. Acute
   renal faiure, lung opacities, and mild confusion may all be reflective
   of leukostasis.
   - pharesis team at the bedside for emergent leukapheresis for his
   leukostasis.
   - given limitations of patient mobility on pheresis, oncology will bone
   marrow biopsy for diagnosis, with a potential for chemotherapy based
   off cytogenetics.
   - hydroxyurea written by oncology
   - will follow q6h tumor lysis labs
   - rasburicase ordered for elevated uric acid
   - will check vbg and follow serum pH, giving NaHCO3 in IVF.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure:  No acute indication for emergent dialsys.
   Acute aniuric renal failure likely due to uric acid deposition vs
   tubular damage from tumor lysis.  Ca and Phos electrolyte deraments
   likely more secondary to TL than renal failure.  No evidence of
   significant volume overload and no critical uremia.
   - continue to trend vbg pH
   - renal aware and will see patient in morning, likely for initiation of
   HD.  Will follow labs and volume status for any indication for need of
   emergent dialysis
   - rasburicase and HCO3 in IVF
   .
   # Hypercalcemia:
   - fluids
   - lasix if euvolemic
   .
   #) Metabolic Acidosis:  Patient with an anion-gap acidis, likely
   secondary to UA and BUN.  Will check VBG pH and give bicarb in IVF and
   treated hyperuricemia.
   - holding off on allopurinol
   .
   #) Atrial Fib:  Likely chronic AF.  Hold asa in the pressence of
   thrombocytopenia.  Digoxin level normal in the setting of ARF.
   - hold off metoprolol
   - holding dig
   - holding aspirin
   .
   # HTN)  Not well controlled here.  Unclear if this poorly controlled at
   baseline, although seems unlikely.
   - hold ace in setting of ARF
   - consider head CT to r/o intracranial pathology.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male presenting with acute blast crisis, likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient is experiencing leukostasis, which is causing dyspnea, acute renal failure, lung opacities, and mild confusion. The medical team has initiated emergent leukapheresis, hydroxyurea, rasburicase for elevated uric acid, and will follow tumor lysis labs every 6 hours. 

The patient also has acute renal failure, possibly due to uric acid deposition or tubular damage from tumor lysis. There is no evidence of significant volume overload or critical uremia. The plan is to continue monitoring the patient's volume status and renal function, with the possibility of starting hemodialysis (HD) in the morning.

Additionally, the patient has hypercalcemia, which is being treated with fluids and lasix if euvolemic. The patient also has metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to uric acid and BUN. The plan is to check vital blood gases (VBG) pH and give bicarb in IVF to treat hyperuricemia.

The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) and will have his anticoagulation held in the setting of thrombocytopenia. Digoxin levels are normal, and metoprolol, digoxin, and aspirin will be held.

The patient's hypertension is not well-controlled, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yom now with acute blast crisis (tumor lysis syndrome).
   LEUKOCYTOSIS -- blast crisis (likely AML based on peripheral blood
   smear).  Lung infiltrates, acute renal faiure, and confusion may
   reflect leukostasis.  Spontaneous tumor lysis.  Continue eukapheresis
   for leukostasis.  Bone marrow for cytogenetic study --> determine
   chemotherapy.  Continue hydroxyurea, rasburicase.  Monitor tumor lysis
   labs.
   TUMOR LYSIS -- predominately contributing to electrolyte disturbances.
   Monitor tumor lysis lab tests.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Acute aniuric renal failure likely attributable
   to uric acid deposition vs. tubular damage from tumor lysis.  Ca and
   Phos electrolyte derangements likely more secondary to tumor lysis
   rather than renal failure.  No indication for acute dialysis at this
   time.  No evidence of significant volume overload and no critical
   uremia.  Renal consulation team to follow.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Anion-gap acidis, likely secondary to uric acid
   and BUN.  Will check VBG pH and give bicarb in IVF and treated
   hyperuricemia.  Holding off on allopurinol
   A-FIB -- Likely chronic AF.  Hold ASA with thrombocytopenia.  Holding
   digoxin in the setting of ARF and checking level, and hold off
   metoprolol dose.
   HTN --  Variable BP overnight.  Hold ACE in setting of ARF
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- severe.  Replete.  Monitor PO4.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to acute leukemia.
   CONFUSION -- [**Month (only) 8**] be due to leukocytosis.  Consider head CT to assess
   for intracranial pathology.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- monitor glucose, maintain <150.
   FLUIDS -- desire net volume expansion, and maintain diuresis.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending evaluation.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yom now with acute blast crisis (tumor lysis syndrome).
   LEUKOCYTOSIS -- blast crisis (likely AML based on peripheral blood
   smear).  Lung infiltrates, acute renal faiure, and confusion may
   reflect leukostasis.  Spontaneous tumor lysis.  Continue eukapheresis
   for leukostasis.  Bone marrow for cytogenetic study --> determine
   chemotherapy.  Continue hydroxyurea, rasburicase.  Monitor tumor lysis
   labs.
   TUMOR LYSIS -- predominately contributing to electrolyte disturbances.
   Monitor tumor lysis lab tests.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Acute aniuric renal failure likely attributable
   to uric acid deposition vs. tubular damage from tumor lysis.  Ca and
   Phos electrolyte derangements likely more secondary to tumor lysis
   rather than renal failure.  No indication for acute dialysis at this
   time.  No evidence of significant volume overload and no critical
   uremia.  Renal consulation team to follow.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Anion-gap acidis, likely secondary to uric acid
   and BUN.  Will check VBG pH and give bicarb in IVF and treated
   hyperuricemia.  Holding off on allopurinol
   A-FIB -- Likely chronic AF.  Hold ASA with thrombocytopenia.  Holding
   digoxin in the setting of ARF and checking level, and hold off
   metoprolol dose.
   HTN --  Variable BP overnight.  Hold ACE in setting of ARF
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- severe.  Replete.  Monitor PO4.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to acute leukemia.
   CONFUSION -- [**Month (only) 8**] be due to leukocytosis.  Consider head CT to assess
   for intracranial pathology.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- monitor glucose, maintain <150.
   FLUIDS -- desire net volume expansion, and maintain diuresis.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending evaluation.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is leukemia, specifically blast crisis. The patient underwent plasmapheresis last night and a bone marrow biopsy this morning. The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the events mentioned above.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 146/58-74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient has atrial fibrillation as their heart rhythm.

The patient is well-nourished, not in acute distress, and has no signs of overweight, obesity, thinness, anxiety, or diaphoresis. Their eyes, conjunctiva, head and neck examination, lymphatic system, cardiovascular examination, peripheral vascular examination, respiratory/chest examination, and musculoskeletal examination are all normal. The patient has right and left lower extremity edema but no cyanosis or clubbing. Their neurologic examination is also normal.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 302.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, platelet count of 54 K/uL, creatinine level of 7.5 mg/dL, glucose level of 135 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.02. Other lab results include elevated levels of lactate acid, lactic acid, LDH, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Assessment and plan:
1. The patient is diagnosed with acute blast crisis (likely acute myeloid leukemia) along with lung infiltrates, acute renal failure, and confusion due to leukostasis. The patient will continue with eukapheresis for leukostasis, bone marrow for cytogenetic study to determine chemotherapy, and continue with hydroxyurea and rasburicase.
2. The patient is also diagnosed with tumor lysis syndrome, which is contributing to electrolyte disturbances. The patient will be monitored for tumor lysis lab tests.
3. Acute renal failure is likely due to uric acid deposition or tubular damage from tumor lysis. The patient may require consultation with a renal team.
4. Metabolic acidosis is likely secondary to uric acid and BUN. The patient will have a VBG pH checked and receive bicarb in IVF. Hyperuricemia will be treated, and allopurinol will be held off.
5. The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is likely chronic. Aspirin will be held with thrombocytopenia, and digoxin levels will be checked. Metoprolol dose will be held off.
6. The patient has hypertension with variable blood pressure overnight. ACE will be held in the setting of acute renal failure.
7. The patient has severe hypophosphat"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male who presents with acute blast crisis.
   .
   # leukocytosis:  Given the description of the smear, likely AML blast
   crisis, monocytosis. Presentation c/w blast crisis c/b leukostasis and
   possibly spontaneous tumor lysis causing dyspnea, ARF and significant
   electrolyte abnormalities.  On [**3-11**], he was started on leukopheresis.
   His WBC continues to rise, however. He was also started on rasburicase
   with good effect.
   - plan for repeat pheresis today
   - f/u Onc recs regarding chemotherapeutic options.  At this time,
   obtaining TTE to assess cardiac fxn to see if patient will be a
   candidate for anthracycline therapy.
   - f/u bone marrow biopsy for diagnosis
   - chemotherapy this AM, continue hydroxyurea, uptitrated to 2g [**Hospital1 **] per
   BMT recs --> BMT may want WBC < 100 before chemo
   - will follow q6h tumor lysis labs, trend uric acid --> continue during
   chemotherapy
   - continue aggressive fluid support
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure:  No acute indication for emergent dialysis.
   Acute renal failure likely due to uric acid deposition vs tubular
   damage from tumor lysis.  Presenting Ca and Phos electrolyte
   derangements likely more secondary to tumor lysis than renal failure.
   The placement of his HD line was complicated by bleeding that required
   suturing. Urine output needed assistance keeping up with hydration.
   Renal U/S was unremarkable.
   - f/u renal recs
   - f/u PTH and PTHrp
   - lasix drip to facilitate mildly positive fluid balance with good UOP
   - rasburicase and HCO3 in IVF
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: related to blast crisis and bone marrow
   insufficiency
   - transfuse for < 30
   .
   # Anemia - related to blast crisis and bone marrow insufficiency. Also,
   acute blood loss from procedure
   - transfuse for HCT < 21, unless WBC > ~ 150 as transfusion +
   leukocytosis = stasis
   .
   # Hypercalcemia - related to tumor lysis and ARF. Improving over time
   - fluids
   - lasix if euvolemic
   .
   #) Metabolic Acidosis:  Patient with an anion-gap acidosis, likely
   secondary to UA and BUN.  Will check VBG pH and give bicarb in IVF and
   treated hyperuricemia.
   - holding off on allopurinol
   .
   #) Atrial Fib:  Likely chronic AF.  Hold asa in the presence of
   thrombocytopenia.  Digoxin level normal in the setting of ARF.
   - hold off metoprolol
   - holding dig
   - holding aspirin
   .
   #) HTN:  Not well controlled here.  Unclear if this poorly controlled
   at baseline, although seems unlikely.
   - hold ace in setting of ARF, starting hydralazine as patient is
   hypertensive
   .
   #)  Access:  2 PIVs, HD line, PICC

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male who presents with acute blast crisis. The patient has several medical complications that need attention:

1. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, likely due to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blast crisis. This can lead to leukostasis and spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome. The patient is already undergoing leukopheresis and has been started on rasburicase.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure, which could be caused by uric acid deposition or tubular damage from tumor lysis. The placement of the hemodialysis (HD) line was complicated by bleeding. The patient's calcium and phosphate levels are deranged, likely secondary to tumor lysis rather than renal failure. 

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, likely due to bone marrow insufficiency related to the blast crisis. Transfusion is recommended for platelet counts less than 30,000.

4. Anemia: The patient also has anemia, which can be attributed to the blast crisis and bone marrow insufficiency, as well as acute blood loss from procedures. Transfusion is advised for hematocrit (HCT) levels less than 21, unless the white blood cell (WBC) count is above ~150, as transfusion combined with leukocytosis can cause stasis.

5. Hypercalcemia: The patient initially had elevated calcium levels, likely secondary to tumor lysis and acute renal failure. However, these levels are improving over time.

6. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an anion-gap acidosis, possibly due to uric acid and BUN. A venous blood gas (VBG) pH will be checked, and bicarbonate will be given in the intravenous fluids (IVF). Treatment for hyperuricemia is ongoing.

7. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient has chronic AF, and medications such as aspirin and digoxin should be held in the presence of thrombocytopenia. Metoprolol should also be held, and the patient may require hydralazine for hypertension.

8. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is not well-controlled. ACE inhibitors should be avoided in the setting of acute renal failure, and hydralazine can be started for hypertension.

9. Access: The patient currently has multiple intravenous lines, including a hemodialysis line and a percutaneous catheter (PICC) line.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and make appropriate adjustments to the treatment plan based on the progress and response to therapy."

   crisis, monocytosis. Presentation c/w blast crisis c/b leukostasis and
   possibly spontaneous tumor lysis causing dyspnea, ARF and significant
   electrolyte abnormalities.  On [**3-11**], he was started on leukopheresis.
   His WBC continues to rise, however. He was also started on rasburicase
   with good effect.
   - plan for repeat pheresis today
   - f/u Onc recs regarding chemotherapeutic options.  At this time,
   obtaining TTE to assess cardiac fxn to see if patient will be a
   candidate for anthracycline therapy.
   - f/u bone marrow biopsy for diagnosis
   - chemotherapy this AM, continue hydroxyurea, uptitrated to 2g [**Hospital1 **] per
   BMT recs --> BMT may want WBC < 100 before chemo
   - will follow q6h tumor lysis labs, trend uric acid --> continue during
   chemotherapy
   - continue aggressive fluid support
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure:  No acute indication for emergent dialysis.
   Acute renal failure likely due to uric acid deposition vs tubular
   damage from tumor lysis.  Presenting Ca and Phos electrolyte
   derangements likely more secondary to tumor lysis than renal failure.
   The placement of his HD line was complicated by bleeding that required
   suturing. Urine output needed assistance keeping up with hydration.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with acute blast crisis, likely acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He presents with leukocytosis, monocytosis, and symptoms consistent with leukostasis and tumor lysis syndrome. The patient has been started on leukopheresis and rasburicase, which showed good effect. His WBC continues to rise, so repeat pheresis is planned today. Oncology recommendations regarding chemotherapy options will be followed, and a TTE will be obtained to assess cardiac function for potential anthracycline therapy. Bone marrow biopsy for diagnosis will also be pursued.

The patient has acute renal failure likely due to uric acid deposition or tubular damage from tumor lysis. There is no acute indication for emergent dialysis. The placement of his HD line was complicated by bleeding that required suturing. Renal U/S was unremarkable. Lasix drip will be continued to facilitate mildly positive fluid balance with good urine output.

The patient is also experiencing thrombocytopenia related to blast crisis and bone marrow insufficiency. Transfusion will be given for platelet count < 30. Anemia is also present, related to blast crisis and bone marrow insufficiency, as well as acute blood loss from procedures. Transfusion will be considered for HCT < 21, unless WBC > ~150, as transfusion plus leukocytosis can lead to stasis.

The patient also has acute renal failure, possibly due to uric acid deposition or tubular damage from tumor lysis. Electrolyte derangements are likely secondary to tumor lysis rather than renal failure. The placement of his hemodialysis (HD) line was complicated by bleeding that required suturing. 

The patient is thrombocytopenic, likely due to bone marrow insufficiency. Anemia is also present, related to bone marrow insufficiency and acute blood loss from procedures. 

Hypercalcemia is present and improving over time, possibly related to tumor lysis and acute renal failure. Metabolic acidosis is likely secondary to uric acid and BUN. 

Atrial fibrillation is chronic and may not require immediate intervention. Hypertension is not well controlled. 

Access for medications and treatments has been established. The patient is currently stabilized in the ICU and will be monitored closely for clinical improvement."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yom now with acute blast crisis (tumor lysis syndrome).
   LEUKOCYTOSIS -- blast crisis (likely AML based on peripheral blood
   smear).  Lung infiltrates, acute renal faiure, and confusion may
   reflect leukostasis.  Spontaneous tumor lysis.  Continue leukapheresis
   for leukostasis, desire for WBC <100k.  Bone marrow for cytogenetic
   study --> determine chemotherapy.  Check cardiac echo.  Continue
   hydroxyurea, rasburicase.  Monitor tumor lysis labs.  To begin
   chemotherapy for AML tonight.
   TUMOR LYSIS -- predominately contributing to electrolyte disturbances.
   Monitor tumor lysis lab tests.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Gradual improvement in creatinine, preserved
   urine output.  Now on lasix infusion.  Acute aniuric renal failure
   likely attributable to uric acid deposition vs. tubular damage from
   tumor lysis.  Ca and Phos electrolyte derangements likely more
   secondary to tumor lysis rather than renal failure.  No indication for
   acute dialysis at this time.  No evidence of significant volume
   overload and no critical uremia.  Renal consulation team to follow.
   [**Month (only) 8**] require initiation of CVVH concurrently with chemotherapy.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Anion-gap acidis, likely secondary to uric acid
   and BUN.  Will check VBG pH and give bicarb in IVF and treated
   hyperuricemia.  Holding off on allopurinol
   A-FIB -- Likely chronic AF.  Hold ASA with thrombocytopenia.  Holding
   digoxin in the setting of ARF and checking level, and hold off
   metoprolol dose.
   HTN --  Variable BP overnight.  Hold ACE in setting of ARF.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- attributed to diuresis.  Replete K to >4.0
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- severe.  Replete.  Monitor PO4.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to acute leukemia.  Monitor.  Transfuse
   if <20.
   CONFUSION -- [**Month (only) 8**] be due to leukocytosis.  Consider head CT to assess
   for intracranial pathology.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- monitor glucose, maintain <150.
   FLUIDS -- desire net volume expansion, and maintain diuresis.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending evaluation.

   Total time spent: 40 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 78-year-old male with acute blast crisis (likely acute myeloid leukemia) and acute renal failure. The patient has experienced several medical complications including tumor lysis syndrome, leukostasis, spontaneous tumor lysis, electrolyte disturbances, metabolic acidosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, thrombocytopenia, confusion, hyperglycemia, and fluid management issues.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: This condition is characterized by the rapid breakdown of cancer cells, leading to the release of potassium, phosphorus, and uric acid into the bloodstream. It can cause acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and metabolic acidosis.

2. Leukostasis: This is a condition where there is an excess of white blood cells in the blood vessels, leading to blockage. It can cause respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, and organ damage.

3. Electrolyte Disturbances: The patient's electrolyte levels, such as potassium and phosphorus, are critically low. These imbalances can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and nerve dysfunction.

4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an anion-gap metabolic acidosis, which is likely secondary to uric acid and BUN. This condition can result in altered mental status, respiratory distress, and multiorgan dysfunction.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yom now with acute blast crisis (tumor lysis syndrome).
   LEUKOCYTOSIS -- blast crisis (likely AML based on peripheral blood
   smear).  Lung infiltrates, acute renal faiure, and confusion may
   reflect leukostasis.  Spontaneous tumor lysis.  Continue leukapheresis
   for leukostasis, desire for WBC <100k.  Bone marrow for cytogenetic
   study --> determine chemotherapy.  Check cardiac echo.  Continue
   hydroxyurea, rasburicase.  Monitor tumor lysis labs.
   TUMOR LYSIS -- predominately contributing to electrolyte disturbances.
   Monitor tumor lysis lab tests.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Gradual improvement in creatinine, preserved
   urine output.  Now on lasix infusion.  Acute aniuric renal failure
   likely attributable to uric acid deposition vs. tubular damage from
   tumor lysis.  Ca and Phos electrolyte derangements likely more
   secondary to tumor lysis rather than renal failure.  No indication for
   acute dialysis at this time.  No evidence of significant volume
   overload and no critical uremia.  Renal consulation team to follow.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS --  Anion-gap acidis, likely secondary to uric acid
   and BUN.  Will check VBG pH and give bicarb in IVF and treated
   hyperuricemia.  Holding off on allopurinol
   A-FIB -- Likely chronic AF.  Hold ASA with thrombocytopenia.  Holding
   digoxin in the setting of ARF and checking level, and hold off
   metoprolol dose.
   HTN --  Variable BP overnight.  Hold ACE in setting of ARF.
   HYPOKALEMIA -- attributed to diuresis.  Replete K to >4.0
   HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA -- severe.  Replete.  Monitor PO4.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- attributed to acute leukemia.  Monitor.  Transfuse
   if <20.
   CONFUSION -- [**Month (only) 8**] be due to leukocytosis.  Consider head CT to assess
   for intracranial pathology.
   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- monitor glucose, maintain <150.
   FLUIDS -- desire net volume expansion, and maintain diuresis.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending evaluation.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with acute blast crisis (likely acute myeloid leukemia), acute renal failure, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition is critical and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Leukostasis: Due to the high white blood cell count, there is a risk of leukostasis, which can lead to lung infiltrates, acute renal failure, and confusion.

2. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient's tumor lysis syndrome may contribute to electrolyte disturbances, including hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has already experienced acute renal failure, which may be due to uric acid deposition or tubular damage from tumor lysis. Monitoring renal function and managing fluid and electrolyte balance is crucial.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has anion-gap acidosis, likely secondary to uric acid and BUN. Monitoring arterial blood gas pH levels and treating hyperuricemia are important.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has chronic atrial fibrillation, and anticoagulation should be managed carefully due to thrombocytopenia.

6. Hypotension and hypertension: Variable blood pressure readings indicate the need for close monitoring, and medications should be adjusted accordingly.

7. Hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia: The patient's potassium and phosphate levels are low and require repletion.

8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be attributed to acute leukemia. Close monitoring and transfusion if necessary are important.

9. Confusion: The patient's confusion may be related to leukocytosis, and further evaluation with a head CT scan should be considered.

10. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated and need to be monitored and managed to maintain glycemic control.

11. Fluid management: The patient's fluid balance needs to be carefully managed to maintain diuresis and avoid fluid overload.

12. Nutritional support: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) pending evaluation, so nutritional support should be addressed once appropriate.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of various complications related to leukemia, renal failure, metabolic disturbances, and other systemic issues."
