 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL BLEED. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q4h, transfuse for Hct > 25
   - Vascular surgery following: appreciate recs - for now will defer to
   IR
   - IR following; will not intervene without INR < 2. Overnight pt still
   bleeding despite INR < 2, pt to angio but no active extravasation seen.
   IR will follow.
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox, hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures; IVF or blood products for MAP <
   65 or UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of distention (initially 21), elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs - ?angio for embolization (unsigned note)
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Transfuse Plts if < 50
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.
   - Ordered for 2 more units FFP (for total of 6 by [**5-16**] by 7am)
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags q4 hours
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Will restart heparin with goal PTT 60-80 without bolus when INR < 2.0
   and Hct stable X 24 hours without transfusions
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to rule out abdominal compartment syndrome
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   .
   # ARRHYTHMIA/ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in setting of CHB.
   Pt with WCT, paced, to 100s-120s overnight [**5-15**]. In and out of sinus
   rhythm with HR 70s-80s. Unclear why pacer is pacing a tachycardic
   rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold home metoprolol in setting of active bleeding/hypovolemia
   - Consider EP consult if tachycardia increases.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of mechanical aortic valve, subtherapeutic INR on lovenox bridge and coumadin, admitted for subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin. The patient presents with 2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in the setting of an 8-point Hct drop. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Retroperitoneal bleed: The patient has a retroperitoneal hematoma, which is causing low back pain. The etiology of the bleed is unclear, but it appears spontaneous in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. Active management is required to prevent further bleeding.

2. Coagulopathy/mechanical valve: The patient has a mechanical aortic valve and is on coumadin with a lovenox bridge. His INR is slightly supratherapeutic at 4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). There is ongoing bleeding despite an INR of 2.0 after receiving 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Monitoring coagulation parameters and adjusting anticoagulation therapy is crucial to prevent further bleeding.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.7 on admission. He received contrast for CT torso with"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who was admitted for subtherapeutic INR and is now experiencing multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Retroperitoneal bleed: The patient has a retroperitoneal hematoma, which is causing low back pain and a significant drop in hemoglobin levels. This may lead to hypotension and shock if not managed appropriately.

2. Coagulopathy/Mechanical valve: The patient has a mechanical valve in the aortic position and is on coumadin with a lovenox bridge. The INR is slightly supratherapeutic, indicating an increased risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and adjustment of anticoagulant therapy will be necessary.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is evidence of prerenal azotemia due to hypovolemia and bleeding. Active management of fluid balance, avoidance of nephrotoxins, and consideration of renal replacement therapy may be required.

4. Arrhythmia/Atrial fibrillation: The patient had a previous episode of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. This may recur, potentially leading to hemodynamic instability. An electrophysiology consult may be needed to manage this condition.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, possibly secondary"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve admitted for subtherapeutic INR and presents with low back pain and a retroperitoneal hematoma. The patient has several medical complications that need attention.

1. Retroperitoneal bleed: The patient has a retroperitoneal bleed, which is a spontaneous bleed in the space behind the peritoneum. This condition can be life-threatening and requires immediate intervention. The patient has received blood transfusions and intravenous fluids but continues to bleed despite an INR of 2.0. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to control the bleeding.

2. Coagulopathy/mechanical valve: The patient has a mechanical aortic valve and is on coumadin with a lovenox bridge. The INR is slightly supratherapeutic at 4.2 on admission, which is above the desired therapeutic range of 2.5-3.5. The patient has received four units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to lower the INR. It is important to monitor the coagulation profile regularly and adjust the anticoagulation therapy accordingly.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.7, indicating acute renal failure. This may be due to hypovolemia and the recent administration of contrast agents for imaging studies. The patient has received N-acetylcysteine (NAC)"

   Assessment and Plan
 RETROPERITONEAL BLEED (RP BLEED), SPONTANEOUS
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL BLEED. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.  Interventional radiology attempted to
   intervene last night but could not find a source for bleed, suggesting
   venous source.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct > 25; platelets < 50 in setting of active
   bleeding
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox, hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures; IVF or blood products for MAP <
   65 or UOP < 30 cc/hr
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of distention (initially 21), elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs
   - Vascular surgery following: appreciate recs - for now will defer to
   IR
   - IR following
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Guaiac stools

   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.  Patient received oral vitamin K overnight.
   - Ordered for 2 more units FFP (for total of 6 by [**5-16**] by 7am)
   - Will give vitamin K 5mg IV x 1 now
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags q4 hours
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Will restart heparin with goal PTT 60-80 without bolus when INR < 2.0
   and Hct stable X 24 hours without transfusions
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to rule out abdominal compartment syndrome
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   - bolus 1 liter of fluid now and monitor UOP
   .
   # TACHYARRHYTHMIA/HISTORY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in
   setting of CHB.  Pt initially in sinus rhythm, not paced, with RBBB in
   70s-90s. Later pt developed WCT, a-sensed v-paced, to 100s-120s, may
   have p waves present indicating this is a sinus tachycardia. In and out
   of sinus rhythm.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of mechanical aortic valve, subtherapeutic INR on Coumadin and Lovenox bridge, acute renal failure, hypertension, COPD, hypercholesterolemia, and previous gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient presented with low back pain and was found to have a retroperitoneal hematoma. He has received multiple blood transfusions and has a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration. The etiology of the bleed is unclear, but it appears spontaneous in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR and Lovenox bridge. The patient's condition has been unstable, with persistent hypotension, tachycardia, and worsening back pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Retroperitoneal bleed: The patient has a retroperitoneal hematoma, which can lead to further bleeding and potential complications such as hypotension, shock, and organ dysfunction.
2. Coagulopathy/mechanical valve: The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, indicating a bleeding risk. The use of Lovenox bridge and Coumadin increases the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, suggesting acute renal failure. This could be due to hypovolemia, contrast-induced nephropathy, or prerenal etiology.
4. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has developed various arrhythmias, including"

               -         Will give IV vitamin K - 5mg, continue to keep
   INR <2, and keep Hct >25, platelets > 50, fibrinogen ok.
               -         continue to monitor bladder pressures
   Acute renal failure:  due to hypovolemia and dye load.  Continue HCO3
   drip, and IVF go get urine output up.
   Afib:  HR under good control.
   Leukocytosis:  likely due to stress from bleed.  No evidence of

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of aortic valve replacement (AVR) and recurrent endocarditis. He was admitted to the ICU with spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed) in the setting of an elevated INR of 4.2. The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), but the interventional radiology (IR) was unable to locate an arterial source for the bleed. The patient has multiple comorbidities including acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, leukocytosis, and hypovolemia. He is currently being treated with aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation, vitamin K supplementation, and close monitoring of bladder pressures. The patient is critically ill and remains in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Continued bleeding: The patient's RP bleed has not been fully controlled, and there is a risk of ongoing bleeding, which can lead to further hypovolemia and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may worsen due to hypovolemia, ongoing bleeding, and potential nephrotoxic effects of medications or interventions.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, and his immunocompromised state due to the AVR and medications puts him at an increased risk of developing infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. They have respiratory failure, acute pain, ineffective coping, retroperitoneal bleed, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and fever of unknown origin. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with increasing distress, hypotension, and organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing severe respiratory distress, leading to the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. This indicates the possibility of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has signs of systemic infection, such as fever, elevated white blood cell count, and positive cultures. This suggests the presence of sepsis with organ dysfunction.
3. Retroperitoneal Bleed: The patient has evidence of bleeding in the retroperitoneal space, which can be a life-threatening complication if not managed promptly.
4. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's lab results indicate imbalances in potassium, sodium, chloride, and magnesium levels. These electrolyte abnormalities need to be corrected to prevent further complications.
5. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient's persistent fever despite antibiotic therapy suggests an ongoing infectious process that needs to be identified and treated appropriately.
6. Ineffective Coping: The patient's inability to manage their stress or cope with the current situation may lead to increased anxiety, agitation, and distress.
7. Acute Pain: The patient is experiencing acute pain, which requires adequate"

   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # Respiratory distress. Patient intubated [**5-16**] after ~90 minutes of
   uncomfortable breathing, patient in distress despite O2 sats in upper
   90s, no response to Lasix or IVF. Concern that origin of SOB may be
   increased abdominal pressure/work of breathing. Unable to tolerate
   BiPAP so intubated.
   - Currently on trial of pressure support
   - Monitor for PIP > 30 as could indicate compartment syndrome
   - Consider mental status, patient
s ability to tolerate BIPAP prior to
   extubation
   .
   # Hypotension. Patient dropped pressures to SBPs in 80s MAPs in 50s
   shortly after intubation and was unable to tolerate even low dose
   sedation. Therefore, CVL placed and started on pressors (initially neo,
   then converted to levophed).
   - Wean as tolerated
   - Goal MAP > 65

   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.  Interventional radiology attempted to
   intervene last night but could not find a source for bleed, suggesting
   venous source.  To date, patient has received 9 units of pRBCs with no
   bump in Hct.  Discoloration of skin apparent.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct > 25; platelets < 50 in setting of active
   bleeding
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox, hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of distention (initially 21), elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate (increasing)
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs
   - Vascular surgery following: appreciate recs - for now will defer to
   IR
   - IR following
 discuss value of tagged RBC scan to identify ? site of
   bleeding
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Guaiac stools
   - fentanyl patch for pain control
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.  Patient received oral vitamin K overnight. Total of 6 units FFP.
   INR now ~ normalized at 1.2.
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags daily
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   - Discuss reversal with protamine
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan
   on admission to MICU with only 50 cc urine. FeNa 0.3% (on diuretics),
   Na 45. Foley in place by urology. Urinalysis benign (neg nitrite,
   leuks; though occ bact on sediment). Low urine output overnight despite
   fluids/blood products. UOP currently down to 15 cc/hr. Renal failure
   likely secondary to increased abdominal pressure and poor perfusion to
   kidneys.
   - Hold home lisinopril
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Monitor UOP, I/O. IVF for UOP < 30 cc/hr.
   - Monitor bladder pressures to rule out abdominal compartment syndrome
   - Follow urine culture (pending)
   - Maintain Hct > 25
   .
   # Rising CKs. Do not seem cardiac in nature as CK-MB are only
   proportionally elevated and troponins < 0.1. Concerned that this may
   relate to muscle breakdown secondary to compartment syndrome.
   - Trend CKs
   - Monitor for compartment syndrome as below
   - Held statin (recently changed type/dose to 80 simvastatin) in acute
   setting
   .
   # Concern for compartment syndrome. Surgical team continues to feel no
   role for surgery at this time as patient not meeting surgical criteria
   for compartment syndrome. The criteria would be:
   1)       Anuria or very low UOP
   2)       Bladder pressures > 25-30 (may be unreliable in setting of
   retroperitoneal bleed)
   3)       PIP > 30
   .
   # TACHYARRHYTHMIA/HISTORY OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. s/p PMP in [**2139**] in
   setting of CHB.  Pt initially in sinus rhythm, not paced, with RBBB in
   70s-90s. Later pt developed WCT, a-sensed v-paced, to 100s-120s, may
   have p waves present indicating this is a sinus tachycardia. In and out
   of sinus rhythm.
   - Continue amiodarone
   - Hold home metoprolol in setting of active bleeding/hypovolemia
   - consider EP consult if other arrhythmias or if PM interrogation
   required.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS. Possibly related to bleeding, multiple transfusions.
   Still rising to 18 K today. Had episode of fever overnight so
   pan-cultured; sputum with multiple species of organisms. Pus at Foley
   site suggests one source of infection
   - Trend WBC, monitor temperature, CIS.
   - Follow urine, blood, sputum cultures (pending)
   - Tylenol for fever PRN
   - Leaving Foley in place for now as difficult to place (required
   urology)
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG. EKG showed more pronounced T-wave inversions after
   episode of SOB on [**5-16**].
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes in setting of bleed; first two sets negative
   - Hold ASA in setting of active bleeding
   - Re-check EKG
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia
   - Simvastatin held as above
   .
   # HYPERTENSION
   - Hold home lisinopril, metoprolol, HCTZ in setting of active bleeding.
   .
   # COPD
   - Continue home atrovent prn
   .
   # HISTORY OF GIB
   - Continue home omeprazole
   - Hold home iron until taking POs
   .
   # FEN: pRBCs/IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO except meds in setting of
   active bleeding; senna prn when taking POs
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots (hold anticoagulation in setting of bleed)
   # Access: 2 PIV, CVL (may need to be replaced with 20-cm line), A-line
   is needed given pressors

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve admitted for subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with 2 days of low back pain and found to have a retroperitoneal hematoma in the setting of an 8-point Hct drop. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory distress, hypotension, retroperitoneal bleed, coagulopathy/mechanical valve, acute renal failure, rising CKs, concern for compartment syndrome, tachyarrhythmia/history of atrial fibrillation, leukocytosis, CAD s/p CABG, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, COPD, and history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation (CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode) with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a spontaneous breathing trial that was unsuccessful.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has an arterial line, central venous line, and pulmonary artery catheter (PA catheter) in place.
- Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 7,353 mL of fluids, including 2,097 mL of blood"

   additional unit of pRBCs
   - Pt subjectively SOB at ~3:30 PM, though O2 sats 100%; ordered for
   albuterol/ipratropium nebs with no relief of symptoms. O2 sats dropped
   transiently to 92-93% in setting of hyperventillation and patient
   appeared uncomfortable, so BiPAP initiated. Got IV Lasix 40, then 80 mg
   but no increased UOP.
   - CXR showed increased opacity over LLL (some effusion there)
   - EKG showed T-wave inversions in anterior leads more pronounced than
   on prior (although quality of EKG was low given patient's movement).
   - Cardiac enzymes showed elevated CK but only proportionally elevated
   CK-MB and flat troponins, raising concern for ? intra-abdominal process
   contributing to muscle necrosis
   - At 6:00 PM, patient still appearing in distress (anxious,
   diaphoretic) despite O2 sats in upper 90s. Lactate trending up, UOP
   trailing off, bladder pressure up to 29. Patient intubated.
   - Patient became hypotensive, so CVL placed in LIJ, but only extended
   to brachiocephalic. [**Month (only) 60**] need to be exchanged over wire for 20-cm line
   (current line is 16-cm).
   - Started on pressors with neo; converted to levophed for goal MAP > 65
   - A-line not placed
   - Spiked fever in PM to > 101, so started on vanco/zosyn, cultured. Of
   note, pus was leaking from around Foley at this time.
   - Bladder pressures trending up (25-29), Hct not yet stable, patient
   clinically worsening so contact[**Name (NI) **] surgery to update/re-evaluate as
   needed; they will add patient back onto list in AM if still unstable
   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2759**] (PCP) came to evaluate patient. He would like to
   communicate to team that he feels it is better to give MORE blood to
   keep up with losses and avoid hypoperfusion to organs. Also, was
   interested in giving protamine (limited data; see email) as the patient
   had recently been on Lovenox in addition to warfarin, and may need
   additional reversal.

   Assessment and Plan
   67M w/St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**] mechanical aortic valve admitted [**Date range (3) 12204**] for
   subtherapeutic INR now on lovenox bridge and coumadin who presents with
   2 days of low back pain and found to have retroperitoneal hematoma in
   setting of 8 point hct drop.
   .
   # Respiratory distress. Patient intubated [**5-16**] after ~90 minutes of
   uncomfortable breathing, patient in distress despite O2 sats in upper
   90s, no response to Lasix or IVF. Concern that origin of SOB may be
   increased abdominal pressure/work of breathing. Unable to tolerate
   BiPAP so intubated.
   - Currently on trial of pressure support
   - Monitor for PIP > 30 as could indicate compartment syndrome
   - Consider mental status, patient
s ability to tolerate BIPAP prior to
   extubation
   .
   # Hypotension. Patient dropped pressures to SBPs in 80s MAPs in 50s
   shortly after intubation and was unable to tolerate even low dose
   sedation. Therefore, CVL placed and started on pressors (initially neo,
   then converted to levophed).
   - Wean as tolerated
   - Goal MAP > 65
   .
   # Retroperitoneal bleed. Retroperitoneal bleed found on CT torso
   w/contrast; 8 point Hct drop; systolics in 70s; on [**5-15**] received 2
   units FFP and 2 units pRBCs, 3.2L IVF in ED, more IVF on floor. On
   floor systolics in 100s (baseline 140s even on antihypertensives); HR
   in 80s. Hct 39.2 on [**5-9**] -> 31.4 at 12pm -> 25.5 at 3pm -> 26.6 at 6pm
   (during second unit pRBC). Etiology for bleed unclear; appears
   spontaneous in setting of supratherapeutic INR and lovenox bridge. CT
   negative for dissection; no history of trauma or recent intravascular
   manipulation/procedures.  Interventional radiology attempted to
   intervene last night but could not find a source for bleed, suggesting
   venous source.  To date, patient has received 9 units of pRBCs with no
   bump in Hct.  Patient with elevated PIP, worsening creatinine, CKs, and
   bladder pressure concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome. General
   Surgery and Vascular surgery and IR are evaluating to determine optimal
   mngt at this time.
   - Maintain active type and screen, 2 large bore PIV, 2 units crossed in
   blood bank
   - Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct > 27; platelets < 50 in setting of active
   bleeding
   - Hold home ASA/coumadin/lovenox and send factor XA level
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Monitor UOP and I/Os and pressures
   - Coordinate w/ IR whether tagged RBC scan or CT abdomen (non-con)
   would be more helpful to eval for bleeding
   - Coordinate with gen surgery, vascular [**Doctor First Name 458**] possible operative
   management in setting of concern for compartment syndrome
   - Monitor bladder pressure to assess for compartment syndrome in
   setting of elevated lactate, decreased UOP.
   - Trend lactate (increasing)
   - General surgery following for increased abdominal pressure:
   appreciate recs
   - Morphine for abdominal pain but watch blood pressures
   - Guaiac stools
   - fentanyl patch for pain control
   .
   # Concern for compartment syndrome.   Patient with elevated PIP,
   worsening creatinine, oliguria, elevated CKs, and bladder pressure
   concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome. General Surgery and
   Vascular surgery and IR are evaluating to determine optimal mngt.  We
   are coordinating with these teams at this time.
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY/MECHANICAL VALVE. St. Jude's valve in aortic position,
   pt on coumadin with lovenox bridge. INR slightly supratherapeutic at
   4.2 on admission (goal 2.5-3.5). [**5-16**] INR decreased to 2.0 s/p 4 units
   FFP.  Patient received oral vitamin K overnight. Total of 6 units FFP.
   INR now ~ normalized at 1.2.
   - Hold coumadin/lovenox in setting of bleed
   - Cardiology recommended initially holding vitamin K but given
   continued bleeding, gave 5 mg [**5-16**] AM
   - Monitor coags daily
   - Check fibrinogen [**Hospital1 **] (wnl thus far)
   - Continue home dicloxacillin for endocarditis prophylaxis
   - Discuss reversal with protamine
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE. Creatinine 1.7 on admission. Received contrast
   for CT torso with prophylactic bicarb prior to procedure. Contrast
   again for angio, got NAC/bicarb.  Likely prerenal etiology in setting
   of hypovolemia/bleed despite large volume resuscitation; bladder scan

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who was admitted for a subtherapeutic INR and is currently on Lovenox bridge and Coumadin. The patient presented with low back pain and was found to have a retroperitoneal hematoma in the setting of an 8-point Hct drop. The patient's condition has deteriorated rapidly, with respiratory distress leading to intubation, hypotension requiring vasopressors, and a retroperitoneal bleed. There are concerns for compartment syndrome, coagulopathy due to mechanical valve, acute renal failure, rising CKs, tachyarrhythmia with history of atrial fibrillation, leukocytosis, CAD with previous CABG, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, COPD, and history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient experienced respiratory distress, which necessitated intubation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension required the placement of a central venous line and initiation of vasopressors. This indicates a potential for septic shock or hypovolemic shock.
3. Retroperitoneal bleed: The presence of a retroperitoneal bleed suggests a risk of ongoing bleeding and potential need for blood transfusions.
4. Compartment syndrome: The elevated P"

   coagulopathy:  check factor Xa level to see if lovenox is still
   around.  INR has normalized.
   acute renal failure:  urine output has dropped off.  cause may be
   multifactorial including dye load, intrabdominal compartment syndrome.
   intrabdominal compartment syndrome:  rising CK and lactate is
   worrisome.  Will discuss with general surgery.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man with respiratory failure who underwent intubation overnight. He is currently on levophed and has rising CK and lactate levels, which are concerning for abdominal compartment syndrome. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 114/54 mmHg to 142/90 mmHg, heart rate between 61-136 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 inspiratory breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90%. 

The patient is receiving various medications, including fentanyl, propofol, norepinephrine, lorazepam, furosemide, morphine sulfate, and others. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Other lab values indicate elevated levels of creatinine, troponin T, lactate, and lactic acid. 

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure, hemorrhage, coagulopathy, acute renal failure, and potential intrabdominal compartment syndrome. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further hemorrhage leading to hypovolemic shock, progression of coagulopathy resulting in increased bleeding risk, deterioration of renal function, and development of or worsening of intrabdominal compartment syndrome."
