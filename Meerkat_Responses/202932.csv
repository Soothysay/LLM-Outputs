   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of dementia and HTN who
   presents with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers.
   # Fever/leukocytosis/hypoxia
 Likely [**3-19**] aspiration pneumonia given
   CXR, difficulty swallowing, thick secretions.  Viral etiologies ruled
   out, legionella antigen negative.  NGTD in urine or blood cultures.
   - Cover broadly with IV vancomycin (dosing by level given CrCl), change
   meningitic to PNA dosing of ceftriaxone, continue levaquin, and also
   continue PO flagyl for C.diff until we rule it out given recent ABX
   use.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cxs.
   - Check c. diff toxins when stool
   - Hold on LP for now as has other derangements that are likely
   contributing to pt's AMS and fever. If pt's AMS and fever do not
   improve with treatment of PNA, hyperNa, and ARF, will need to consider
   treating for empiric course for meningitis, consider LP.
   - IV fluid boluses) if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 20cc/hr
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   -swallow eval when able to cooperate
   .
   # Hypernatremia - Likely [**3-19**] decreased/poor po intake in addition to
   lasix administration ( BUN/Cr ratio > 20, ARF, appears very dry on
   exam).   Likely a chronic issue so can decrease at goal of  0.5/hr.  We
   had to change d5 to 1/2NS [**3-19**] hyperglycemia and this has continued to
   do well.
   - Continue 1/NS @125, q6h sodium checks, adjust rate as needed
   - Hold lasix.
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Cr 2.5-2.9-2.5. Last Cr in OMR in [**2162**] 0.8. As
   above, likely prerenal cause as no eosinophils in urine to indicate AIN
   (recent ABX) and renal ultrasound normal so no obstruction.  Associated
   anion-gap metabolic acidosis is improved this morning (12 from 18) and
   was likely [**3-19**] uremia.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Hold lasix.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status
 Likely [**3-19**] infection and hypernatremia and
   uremia. ABG without significant hypercarbia. Improving this morning
   with improved oxygenation and serum sodium.  LFTs and TSH WNL.
   - Covering broadly with IV abxs as above.
   - Check urine/serum tox.
   - Hold sedating medications; home celexa, trazodone.
   - Replete free water deficit as above.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia - No documented h/o diabetes.  Improved when D/C
d D5.
   - Check FS q6h and cover with HISS.
   .
   # HTN - Maintaining BPs currently. Not on anti-HTNs as outpt beyond
   lasix.
   - Holding lasix as above.
   .
   # Dementia - Not on cholinesterase inhibitors as outpt.
   .
   # FEN: NPO, replete lytes prn.
   .
   # Access: PIV X 1, PICC requested
   .
   # PPx: hep SQ tid, bowel regimen

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the

   add the following points:

   Agree with plan to continue supportive care for septic presentation.
   Will taper antibx to vanco/ctx for pna, continuing empiric c diff
   treatment with flagyl given significant leukocytosis, recent course of
   levoflox, and NH resident although no diarrhea and benign abd exam.
   (Would r/o by c diff X 3).   Will d/c levoflox as s/p 1 wk course at NH
   prior to admit and with neg urine leg ag. Is maintaining BP without
   pressor support.  Have been able to taper o2 with improvement in resp
   distress.  CXR now with evolving RMl and probable retrocadiac process.
   Given significant aspiration risk will keep hob elevation and continue
   sx
ing, chest PT as tolerated.  Will need swallow eval once able to
   coop.
        Exam and labs most c/w pre-renal presentation / dehyrdration with
   poor PO and diuretics at NH.  Cr is slowly responding to IVF hydration
   and maintaining good urine output.
        AMS likely from infection/hypernatremia. Have low suspicion for
   CNS infection and MS improving slowly with na correction, fluids,
   antibx. Would recheck abg to assess for CO2 retention contributing.
   Correcting na slowly with 1/2 ns as process appears aub acute over
   atleast days to 1 wk.  Continue to hold all sedating mediations/psych
   meds for now.  Check TSH.
        Hyperglycemia has improved since changing IVF from d5w.
   Continuing SSI.  Has no reported hx of DM.
        PIV access--would proceed with PICC in anticipation of prolonged
   antibiotic course.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and hypertension presenting with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. She has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, altered mental status, hyperglycemia, and hypertension. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, and other supportive care measures. Her sodium levels are being corrected slowly due to hypernatremia. The patient's condition is critical, and she is currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's difficulty swallowing and thick secretions increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the patient may require more targeted treatment based on the results of cultures and sensitivities.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated serum creatinine level. The underlying cause of acute renal failure is likely pre-renal due to dehydration and poor oral intake. Continued monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly are necessary.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated serum sodium level indicates hypernatremia, which can contribute to altered mental status and dehydration. Slow correction of sodium levels is essential to prevent rapid shifts in fluid balance.

4. Altered mental status: The patient's confusion and disorientation may be attributed to a combination of factors including infection, hypernatremia, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of dementia and HTN who
   presents with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers.
   # Fever/leukocytosis/hypoxia
 Likely [**3-19**] aspiration pneumonia given
   CXR, difficulty swallowing, thick secretions.  Viral etiologies ruled
   out, legionella antigen negative.  NGTD in urine or blood cultures.
   - Cover broadly with IV vancomycin (dosing by level given CrCl), change
   meningitic to PNA dosing of ceftriaxone, continue levaquin, and also
   continue PO flagyl for C.diff until we rule it out given recent ABX
   use.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cxs.
   - Check c. diff toxins when stool
   - Hold on LP for now as has other derangements that are likely
   contributing to pt's AMS and fever. If pt's AMS and fever do not
   improve with treatment of PNA, hyperNa, and ARF, will need to consider
   treating for empiric course for meningitis, consider LP.
   - IV fluid boluses) if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 20cc/hr
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   -swallow eval when able to cooperate
   .
   # Hypernatremia - Likely [**3-19**] decreased/poor po intake in addition to
   lasix administration ( BUN/Cr ratio > 20, ARF, appears very dry on
   exam).   Likely a chronic issue so can decrease at goal of  0.5/hr.  We
   had to change d5 to 1/2NS [**3-19**] hyperglycemia and this has continued to
   do well.
   - Continue 1/NS @125, q6h sodium checks, adjust rate as needed
   - Hold lasix.
   .
   # Acute renal failure
 Cr 2.5-2.9-2.5. Last Cr in OMR in [**2162**] 0.8. As
   above, likely prerenal cause as no eosinophils in urine to indicate AIN
   (recent ABX) and renal ultrasound normal so no obstruction.  Associated
   anion-gap metabolic acidosis is improved this morning (12 from 18) and
   was likely [**3-19**] uremia.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Hold lasix.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status
 Likely [**3-19**] infection and hypernatremia and
   uremia. ABG without significant hypercarbia. Improving this morning
   with improved oxygenation and serum sodium.  LFTs and TSH WNL.
   - Covering broadly with IV abxs as above.
   - Check urine/serum tox.
   - Hold sedating medications; home celexa, trazodone.
   - Replete free water deficit as above.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia - No documented h/o diabetes.  Improved when D/C
d D5.
   - Check FS q6h and cover with HISS.
   .
   # HTN - Maintaining BPs currently. Not on anti-HTNs as outpt beyond

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly female with a history of dementia and hypertension. She presents with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. She has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, likely due to her difficulty swallowing and thick secretions. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover potential bacterial pathogens.

The patient is also experiencing hypernatremia, likely caused by decreased oral intake and administration of Lasix. Her sodium levels are being closely monitored, and IV fluids are being adjusted accordingly.

The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely pre-renal in nature, as indicated by the absence of eosinophils in the urine and a normal renal ultrasound. Renal dosing of medications has been implemented, and Lasix has been withheld.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of infection, hypernatremia, and uremia. Oxygenation and serum sodium levels are being closely monitored, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered.

The patient also has hyperglycemia, which improved after discontinuation of D5. Frequent blood glucose checks are being performed, and coverage with HISS is being considered.

Other issues include hypertension, dementia, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is ICU level of care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory distress suggest a potential respiratory complication such as"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of dementia and HTN who
   presents with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers.
   # Fever/leukocytosis/hypoxia - Pt meets sepsis criteria with
   significant leukocytosis, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Also
   significantly hypoxic with abnl A-a gradient on ABG. CXR does not
   suggest diffuse aspiration pneumonitis but does have blurry of L
   hemidiaphragm. It is possible that pt has LLL pneumonia which is not
   manifesting very well on radiographs given significant degree of
   dehydration. Other consideration would be PE, influenza, other
   respiratory viral pathogens, and c. diff given recent course of abxs.
   Pt also has associated AMS and cannot clearly evaluate for meningmus on
   exam. Thus, meningitis also remains on differential, although pt has
   been nursing home resident and thus less likely community acquired.
   Furthermore, in setting of likely pulm infection, hyperNa, and uremia,
   there are other likely contributing factors to pt's sxs.
   - Cover broadly with IV vancomycin (dosing by level given CrCl),
   meningitic dosing of ceftriaxone, levaquin, and flagyl.
   - Start tamiflu.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cxs.
   - Check c. diff toxins.
   - Send for nasal aspirate for flu r/o and rapid respiratory viral
   screen.
   - Check urinary legionella antigen.
   - Hold on LP for now as has other derangements that are likely
   contributing to pt's AMS and fever. If pt's AMS and fever do not
   improve with treatment of PNA, hyperNa, and ARF, will need to consider
   treating for empiric course for meningitis, consider LP.
   - Would prefer to have central venous line access if BPs become more
   tenuous; however pt is DNR/DNI and unclear if would want TLC. Will need
   to contact next of [**Doctor First Name **].
   - IV fluid boluses and dopamine (given only PIV access for now) if
   needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 20cc/hr
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   .
   # Hypernatremia - Calculated free water deficit 4.4 L. Likely [**3-19**]
   decreased/poor po intake based off of BUN/Cr ratio > 20, ARF, appears
   very dry on exam.
   - Plan to correct hypernatremia at 0.5 meq/hr over next 24 hrs.
   - Will use D5W @ 125 cc/hr.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] need boluses D
   - Check lytes q4h.
   - Renal c/s.
   - Hold lasix.
   .
   # Acute renal failure - No prior labs sent over from NH. Last Cr in OMR
   in [**2162**] 0.8. BUN/Cr ratio > 20 suggests prerenal cause. Pt also appears
   hypovolemic on exam. No electrolyte derangements currently that would
   require urgent hemodialysis. Associated anion-gap metabolic acidosis of
   18 likely [**3-19**] uremia.
   - Check UA with sediment, urine lytes, urinary eos given recent course
   of quinolones, although no signs of peripheral eosinophilia.
   - Renal U/S.
   - Renal c/s as above.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Hold lasix.
   - Check pm BUN/Cr, pm lytes.
   .
   # Unresponsiveness - Only responsive to deep sternal rub. Does not
   answer questions or follow commands. AMS in setting of leukocytosis,
   fevers, and hypoxia. Per NH notes, MS change was relatively acute. Most
   likely that infection(s) are contributing to pt's AMS as well as
   significant hypernatremia and uremia as above. Other possibilities are
   other metabolic derangements, ingestions (pt is on fair amt of sedative
   meds as outpt), significant hypothyroidism (has h/o grave's dz per
   OMR). ABG without significant hypercarbia.
   - Covering broadly with IV abxs as above.
   - Infectious w/u as above.
   - Check LFTs, TSH.
   - Check urine/serum tox.
   - Hold celexa, trazodone.
   - Repleting free water deficit as above.
   - Closely monitoring lytes as above.
   .
   # Hyperglycemia - No documented h/o diabetes.
   - Check FS q6h and cover with HISS.
   .
   # HTN - Maintaining BPs currently. Not on anti-HTNs as outpt beyond
   lasix.
   - Holding lasix as above.
   .
   # Dementia - Not on cholinesterase inhibitors as outpt.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and hypertension who presents with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. She meets criteria for sepsis with significant leukocytosis, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The patient is also hypoxic with an abnormal A-a gradient on ABG. Her chest X-ray does not show diffuse aspiration pneumonitis but has a blurry left hemidiaphragm, suggesting possible left lower lobe pneumonia. Other considerations include pulmonary embolism, influenza, other respiratory viral pathogens, and Clostridium difficile given her recent antibiotic course. The patient also has acute mental status changes and cannot evaluate for meningismus on exam. Meningitis is still on the differential, especially considering her nursing home residency. 

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presents with signs of systemic infection, including fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and hypoxia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover potential bacterial pathogens.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a significantly elevated sodium level, likely due to decreased water intake and dehydration. Free water deficit is planned to be corrected at a rate of 0.5 mEq/hr over the next 24 hours using D5W at 125 cc/hr.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and hypertension who presents with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. She meets the criteria for sepsis with significant leukocytosis, tachycardia, and tachypnea. The patient is also hypoxic with an abnormal alveolar-arterial gradient on arterial blood gas (ABG). Chest X-ray does not suggest diffuse aspiration pneumonitis but shows a blurry left hemidiaphragm. There is a possibility of left lower lobe pneumonia, which may not be well visualized on the radiograph due to significant dehydration. Other considerations include pulmonary embolism, influenza, other respiratory viral pathogens, and Clostridium difficile given the recent course of antibiotics. The patient also has acute mental status changes (AMS) and is unable to evaluate for meningismus on examination. Therefore, meningitis remains on the differential diagnosis, although the patient is a nursing home resident and thus less likely to have community-acquired meningitis. 

Assessment and Plan:
- Cover broadly with IV vancomycin, meningitic dosing of ceftriaxone, levaquin, and flagyl.
- Start tamiflu.
- Follow-up blood and urine cultures.
- Check C. difficile toxins.
- Send for nasal aspirate for flu r/o and rapid respiratory viral screen.
- Check urinary legionella antigen.
- Hold lumbar puncture"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of dementia and HTN who presents
   with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. Mental status is improved
   from admission with patient being more alert and interactive.
   # Fever/leukocytosis/hypoxia:
   Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia given CXR appearance,
   difficulty swallowing, thick secretions.  Viral etiologies ruled out,
   legionella antigen negative.  NGTD in blood cultures. Urine culture
   revealed Proteus that is resistant to most antibiotics, but sensitive
   to Tobramycin.
   - Cover broadly with IV vancomycin (dosing by level given CrCl),
   ceftriaxone, and metronidazole.
   - Follow-up blood cx, NGTD
   - Follow-up c.diff toxin
   - IV fluid boluses if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 20cc/hr
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   - Swallow eval tomorrow AM if mental status continues to improve
   # Hypernatremia:
   Likely secondary to decreased/poor po intake in addition to lasix
   administration (BUN/Cr ratio > 20, ARF, appears very dry on exam).
   Likely a chronic issue so can decrease at goal of  0.5/hr. Patient had
   acute drop overnight from 160 to 147 this AM in setting of increasing
   D5W rate to 100 mL/hr overnight.
   - Set fluids at 50 mL/hr D5W
   - Sodium checks Q6H with adjust in fluid rate as needed
   - Continue to hold lasix.
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr is 2.1 this AM and downtrending from 2.9 since admission. Last Cr in
   OMR in [**2162**] was 0.8. As above, likely prerenal cause as no eosinophils
   in urine to indicate AIN (recent ABX) and renal ultrasound normal so no
   obstruction.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Continue to hold lasix
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely secondary to infection and hypernatremia and uremia. ABG without
   significant hypercarbia. Improving this morning with improved
   oxygenation and serum sodium.  LFTs and TSH WNL. Serum tox was negative
   aside from acetaminophen on [**2-10**]/1008. Urine tox from [**2169-2-10**] was
   negative.
   - Covering broadly with IV abxs as above
   - Hold sedating medications; home celexa, trazodone
   - Replete free water deficit as above
   # Hyperglycemia:
   No documented h/o diabetes. Likely related to D5W infusion. Serum
   glucose was 207 this AM.
   - Check FS q6h and cover with HISS.
   # Dementia:
   Not on cholinesterase inhibitors as outpt.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and hypertension who presented with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. Her mental status has improved since admission, but she remains alert and interactive. She has several medical issues, including fever/leukocytosis/hypoxia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, altered mental status, hyperglycemia, and dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever/leukocytosis/hypoxia: This condition suggests aspiration pneumonia. Possible complications include worsening respiratory distress, septic shock, and multi-organ failure.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels are likely due to decreased/poor oral intake and administration of lasix. Chronic hypernatremia can lead to neurological complications, such as seizures or cerebral edema.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function. This can result in electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for dialysis.

4. Altered mental status: Infection, hypernatremia, and uremia may contribute to the patient's confusion. Complications can include worsening mental status, delirium, and difficulty in managing her care.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels may be related to D5W infusion. Poor glycemic control can increase the risk of infections and complications related to diabetes.

   - Cover broadly with IV vancomycin (dosing by level given CrCl),
   ceftriaxone, and metronidazole.
   - Follow-up blood cx, NGTD
   - Follow-up c.diff toxin
   - IV fluid boluses if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 20cc/hr
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   - Swallow eval tomorrow AM if mental status continues to improve
   # Hypernatremia:
   Likely secondary to decreased/poor po intake in addition to lasix
   administration (BUN/Cr ratio > 20, ARF, appears very dry on exam).
   Likely a chronic issue so can decrease at goal of  0.5/hr. Patient had
   acute drop overnight from 160 to 147 this AM in setting of increasing
   D5W rate to 100 mL/hr overnight.
   - Set fluids at 50 mL/hr D5W
   - Sodium checks Q6H with adjust in fluid rate as needed
   - Continue to hold lasix.
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr is 2.1 this AM and downtrending from 2.9 since admission. Last Cr in
   OMR in [**2162**] was 0.8. As above, likely prerenal cause as no eosinophils
   in urine to indicate AIN (recent ABX) and renal ultrasound normal so no
   obstruction.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Continue to hold lasix
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely secondary to infection and hypernatremia and uremia. ABG without
   significant hypercarbia. Improving this morning with improved
   oxygenation and serum sodium.  LFTs and TSH WNL. Serum tox was negative
   aside from acetaminophen on [**2-10**]/1008. Urine tox from [**2169-2-10**] was
   negative.
   - Covering broadly with IV abxs as above
   - Hold sedating medications; home celexa, trazodone
   - Replete free water deficit as above
   # Hyperglycemia:
   No documented h/o diabetes. Likely related to D5W infusion. Serum
   glucose was 207 this AM.
   - Check FS q6h and cover with HISS.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
        [**Age over 90 **] yo F NH resident with h/o dementia and htn presented with
   sepsis--f/leukocytosis, hypoxemic resp failure from pna, ARF,
   dehydration and altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3106**] hypernatremia.

        Agree with plan to continue supportive care for septic
   presentation--clinically improving.  Continue treatment for asp (NH)
   pna and possible proteus UTI.  Proteus is multi-drug resistant, u/a was
   not grossly pos (?colonized) and pt is clinically improving on current
   antibx regimen now AF with decreased WBC ct. Will continue vanco/ctx
   for pna, continuing empiric c diff treatment with flagyl given
   significant leukocytosis, recent course of levoflox at NH, and NH
   resident although no diarrhea and benign abd exam. (Will r/o by c diff

   rsponse to current treatment.
        Continues to maintain BP without pressor support with slow
   improvement in cr and good urine outpt. Have been able to taper O2 with
   improvement in resp distress.  Appears at significant aspiration risk
   --> keep hob elevation and continue sx
ing, chest PT as tolerated.
   Very wheezy on exam--> nebs. Will need swallow eval once better able to
   coop.
        AMS likely from infection/hypernatremia.  MS is improving with na
   correction, fluids, antibx. Continue to hold all sedating
   mediations/psych meds for now.
       Hyperglycemia appears [**3-19**] D5W -->  Continuing SSI.
        PIV access--consulted for PICC in anticipation of prolonged
   antibiotic course.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill, improving but remains tenuous, continue in
   ICU for now.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and hypertension who presented with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. The patient's mental status has improved since admission, but they remain unable to follow simple commands.

The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected aspiration pneumonia, which is supported by the chest X-ray appearance and difficulty swallowing. Blood cultures are pending, and the urine culture revealed Proteus, which is resistant to most antibiotics but sensitive to Tobramycin.

The patient also has hypernatremia, likely secondary to decreased/poor oral intake and lasix administration. Acute renal failure is suspected, but further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of factors including infection, hypernatremia, and uremia. Blood glucose levels are elevated, but no documented history of diabetes exists.

The patient's current treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia, repletion of free water deficit, and close monitoring of electrolyte levels. The patient's condition is considered tenuous, and they will remain in the ICU for further evaluation and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, further deterioration of renal function, development of Clostridium difficile infection, and potential drug-resistant infection due to the identified Proteus species."

   Likely [**3-19**] aspiration pneumonia given CXR, difficulty swallowing, thick
   secretions.  Viral etiologies ruled out, legionella antigen negative.
   NGTD in urine or blood cultures.
   - Cover broadly with IV vancomycin (dosing by level given CrCl), change
   meningitic to PNA dosing of ceftriaxone, continue levaquin, and also
   continue PO flagyl for C.diff until we rule it out given recent ABX
   use.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cxs.
   - Check c. diff toxins when stool
   - Hold on LP for now as has other derangements that are likely
   contributing to pt's AMS and fever. If pt's AMS and fever do not
   improve with treatment of PNA, hyperNa, and ARF, will need to consider
   treating for empiric course for meningitis, consider LP.
   - IV fluid boluses) if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 20cc/hr
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   -swallow eval when able to cooperate
   # Hypernatremia:
   Likely [**3-19**] decreased/poor po intake in addition to lasix administration
   ( BUN/Cr ratio > 20, ARF, appears very dry on exam).   Likely a chronic
   issue so can decrease at goal of  0.5/hr.  We had to change d5 to 1/2NS
   [**3-19**] hyperglycemia and this has continued to do well.
   - Continue 1/NS @125, q6h sodium checks, adjust rate as needed
   - Hold lasix.
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr 2.5-2.9-2.5. Last Cr in OMR in [**2162**] 0.8. As above, likely prerenal
   cause as no eosinophils in urine to indicate AIN (recent ABX) and renal
   ultrasound normal so no obstruction.  Associated anion-gap metabolic
   acidosis is improved this morning (12 from 18) and was likely [**3-19**]
   uremia.
   - Renally dose meds.
   - Hold lasix.
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely [**3-19**] infection and hypernatremia and uremia. ABG without
   significant hypercarbia. Improving this morning with improved
   oxygenation and serum sodium.  LFTs and TSH WNL.
   - Covering broadly with IV abxs as above.
   - Check urine/serum tox.
   - Hold sedating medications; home celexa, trazodone.
   - Replete free water deficit as above.
   # Hyperglycemia:
   No documented h/o diabetes. Likely related to D5W infusion.
   - Check FS q6h and cover with HISS.
   # HTN:
   Maintaining BPs currently. Not on anti-HTNs as outpt beyond lasix.
   - Holding lasix as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and hypertension presenting with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have been experiencing respiratory distress and low urine output. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated glucose levels, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics, IV fluids, and other medications. The plan includes broad coverage for potential infections, including aspiration pneumonia, and addressing electrolyte imbalances and acute renal failure. The patient's altered mental status is being managed with sedation reduction and repletion of free water deficit. The patient's condition is improving with improved oxygenation and serum sodium levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's difficulty swallowing and thick secretions, there is a risk of aspiration leading to pneumonia.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient's recent use of antibiotics raises concern for Clostridium difficile infection, which is being ruled out with stool toxin assays.
3. Meningitis: With the patient's fever and altered mental status, meningitis should be considered and treated appropriately.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may be due to decreased or poor oral intake and the use of diuretics. Careful monitoring and adjustment of IV fluids are necessary.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction, possibly"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of dementia and HTN who presents
   with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. Mental status is improved
   from admission with patient being more alert and interactive.
   # Fever/leukocytosis/hypoxia:
   Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia given CXR appearance,
   difficulty swallowing, thick secretions.  Viral etiologies ruled out,
   legionella antigen negative.  NGTD in blood cultures. Urine culture
   revealed Proteus that is resistant to most antibiotics, but sensitive
   to Tobramycin.
   - Cover broadly with IV vancomycin (dosing by level given CrCl),
   ceftriaxone, and metronidazole.
   - Follow-up blood cx, NGTD
   - Follow-up c.diff toxin
   - IV fluid boluses if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 20cc/hr
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   - Swallow eval tomorrow AM if mental status continues to improve
   # Hypernatremia:
   Likely secondary to decreased/poor po intake in addition to lasix
   administration (BUN/Cr ratio > 20, ARF, appears very dry on exam).
   Likely a chronic issue so can decrease at goal of  0.5/hr. Patient had
   acute drop overnight from 160 to 147 this AM in setting of increasing
   D5W rate to 100 mL/hr overnight.
   - Set fluids at 50 mL/hr D5W
   - Sodium checks Q6H with adjust in fluid rate as needed
   - Continue to hold lasix.
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr is 2.1 this AM and downtrending from 2.9 since admission. Last Cr in
   OMR in [**2162**] was 0.8. As above, likely prerenal cause as no eosinophils
   in urine to indicate AIN (recent ABX) and renal ultrasound normal so no
   obstruction.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Continue to hold lasix
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely secondary to infection and hypernatremia and uremia. ABG without
   significant hypercarbia. Improving this morning with improved
   oxygenation and serum sodium.  LFTs and TSH WNL. Serum tox was negative
   aside from acetaminophen on [**2-10**]/1008. Urine tox from [**2169-2-10**] was
   negative.
   - Covering broadly with IV abxs as above
   - Hold sedating medications; home celexa, trazodone
   - Replete free water deficit as above
   # Hyperglycemia:
   No documented h/o diabetes. Likely related to D5W infusion. Serum
   glucose was 207 this AM.
   - Check FS q6h and cover with HISS.
   # Dementia:
   Not on cholinesterase inhibitors as outpt.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and hypertension who was admitted with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. The patient's mental status has improved since admission, but she still has difficulty swallowing and thick secretions. The initial assessment suggests that the patient may have aspiration pneumonia. Blood cultures revealed NGTD, and the urine culture showed Proteus sensitivity to Tobramycin. The patient is being covered broadly with IV vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's difficulty swallowing and thick secretions increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia. This is supported by the appearance on the chest X-ray.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, likely due to decreased/poor oral intake and administration of lasix. Chronic hypernatremia can lead to neurological complications.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible acute renal failure. Prerenal causes are suspected, possibly due to dehydration or infection.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, likely secondary to infection, hypernatremia, and uremia. Immediate improvement in oxygenation and serum sodium is necessary.
5. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The urine culture revealed Proteus, which is resistant to most antibiotics but sensitive to"

   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of dementia and HTN who presents
   with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. Mental status is improved
   from admission with patient being more alert and interactive.
   # Fever/leukocytosis/hypoxia:
   Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia given CXR appearance,
   difficulty swallowing, thick secretions.  Viral etiologies ruled out,
   legionella antigen negative. NGTD in blood cultures. Urine culture
   revealed Proteus that is resistant to most antibiotics, but sensitive
   to Tobramycin. Has a meropenem sensitivity pending. Has been c.diff
   toxin negative x 2. Patient with pulmonary exam and CXR today
   consistent with volume overload in setting of getting hypotonic fluids
   to correct hypernatremia. Was > 2L positive fluid balance in 24 hours
   yesterday.
   - Gentle diuresis today with 10 mg IV furosemide
   - Continue to cover broadly with IV vancomycin (dosing by level given
   CrCl), ceftriaxone
   - Follow-up blood cx, NGTD
   - Follow-up one additional c.diff toxin and discontinue metronidazole
   if third c.diff toxin assay is negative
   - IV fluid boluses if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 20cc/hr
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   - Follow-up swallowing evaluation this AM
   # GI bleed:
   Patient with report of several small, dark, tarry bowel movements last
   night that were guaiac positive. Had PM HCTof 23.6 last night in
   setting of guaiac positive bowel movements and received 1U PRBC
   transfusion overnight.
   - Keep active type and cross
   - Start IV PPI
   - Follow-up HCT this AM to assure appropriate increase following 1 U
   PRBC transfusion yesterday.
   - Contact patient
s niece regarding consent for blood products.
   # Hypernatremia:
   Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia secondary to decreased/poor po intake
   in addition to lasix administration (BUN/Cr ratio > 20, ARF, appears
   very dry on exam).  Likely a chronic issue so can decrease sodium level
   at goal of  0.5/hr. Patient
s PM sodium was 150 yesterday and was 147
   this morning despite receiving hypotonic fluids all day yesterday.
   - Continue IVF at 55 mL/hr for the day today and follow-up PM sodium
   level
   - Sodium checks [**Hospital1 **] in order to adjust fluid rate
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr is 1.7 this AM and downtrending from 2.9 since admission. Last Cr in
   OMR in [**2162**] was 0.8. As above, likely prerenal cause as no eosinophils
   in urine to indicate AIN (recent ABX) and renal ultrasound normal so no
   obstruction.
   - Renally dose meds
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely secondary to infection and hypernatremia and uremia. ABG without
   significant hypercarbia. LFTs and TSH WNL. Serum tox was negative aside
   from acetaminophen on [**2-10**]/1008. Urine tox from [**2169-2-10**] was
   negative. Likely that some of her speech abnormalities are related to
   difficulty hearing as patient indicates that she normally has hearing
   aids in place. Also possible that unintelligible speech impacted by
   extremely dry mouth.
   - Covering broadly with IV abxs as above
   - Hold sedating medications; home celexa, trazodone
   - Replete free water deficit as above
   - Call niece to see if patient has hearing aids at home
   - Oral care while NPO to moisten mouth
   # Hyperglycemia:
   No documented h/o diabetes. FS yesterday were all ranging 207 to 275.
   Likely related to D5W infusion. Serum glucose was 157 this AM.
   - Check FS q6h and cover with HISS.
   # Dementia:
   Not on cholinesterase inhibitors as outpt. Attempt to clarify baseline
   with patient

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and hypertension who presents with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. The patient's mental status has improved from admission, showing more alertness and interaction. The patient has a history of difficulty swallowing, thick secretions, and pulmonary exam and CXR consistent with volume overload. 

The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia, possibly secondary to her difficulty swallowing, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and ceftriaxone. 

The patient also has evidence of a gastrointestinal bleed, indicated by dark, tarry bowel movements that are guaiac positive. She has received a blood transfusion and will continue to be monitored for any signs of further bleeding. 

Hypernatremia has been identified, likely due to decreased/poor oral intake and the administration of lasix. The patient's sodium level is being carefully monitored and adjusted accordingly. 

Acute renal failure has occurred, with a creatinine level of 1.7 this morning. This is likely prerenal in nature, as no other indications of acute kidney injury are present. Medications are being dosed accordingly based on renal function. 

The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to infection, hypernatremia, and uremia. ABG results do not show significant hypercarbia, and LFTs and TSH are within normal limits. Serum tox was negative"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of dementia and HTN who presents
   with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. Mental status is improved
   from admission with patient being more alert and interactive.
   # Fever/leukocytosis/hypoxia:
   Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia given CXR appearance,
   difficulty swallowing, thick secretions.  Viral etiologies ruled out,
   legionella antigen negative. NGTD in blood cultures. Urine culture
   revealed Proteus that is resistant to most antibiotics, but sensitive
   to Tobramycin. Has a meropenem sensitivity pending. Has been c.diff
   toxin negative x 2. Patient with pulmonary exam and CXR today
   consistent with volume overload in setting of getting hypotonic fluids
   to correct hypernatremia. Was > 2L positive fluid balance in 24 hours
   yesterday.
   - Gentle diuresis today with 10 mg IV furosemide
   - Continue to cover broadly with IV vancomycin (dosing by level given
   CrCl), ceftriaxone
   - Follow-up blood cx, NGTD
   - Follow-up one additional c.diff toxin and discontinue metronidazole
   if third c.diff toxin assay is negative
   - IV fluid boluses if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 20cc/hr
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   - Follow-up swallowing evaluation this AM
   # GI bleed:
   Patient with report of several small, dark, tarry bowel movements last
   night that were guaiac positive. Had PM HCTof 23.6 last night in
   setting of guaiac positive bowel movements and received 1U PRBC
   transfusion overnight.
   - Keep active type and cross
   - Start IV PPI
   - Follow-up HCT this AM to assure appropriate increase following 1 U
   PRBC transfusion yesterday.
   - Contact patient
s niece regarding consent for blood products.
   # Hypernatremia:
   Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia secondary to decreased/poor po intake
   in addition to lasix administration (BUN/Cr ratio > 20, ARF, appears
   very dry on exam).  Likely a chronic issue so can decrease sodium level
   at goal of  0.5/hr. Patient
s PM sodium was 150 yesterday and was 147
   this morning despite receiving hypotonic fluids all day yesterday.
   - Continue IVF at 55 mL/hr for the day today and follow-up PM sodium
   level
   - Sodium checks [**Hospital1 **] in order to adjust fluid rate
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr is 1.7 this AM and downtrending from 2.9 since admission. Last Cr in
   OMR in [**2162**] was 0.8. As above, likely prerenal cause as no eosinophils
   in urine to indicate AIN (recent ABX) and renal ultrasound normal so no
   obstruction.
   - Renally dose meds
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely secondary to infection and hypernatremia and uremia. ABG without
   significant hypercarbia. LFTs and TSH WNL. Serum tox was negative aside
   from acetaminophen on [**2-10**]/1008. Urine tox from [**2169-2-10**] was
   negative. Likely that some of her speech abnormalities are related to
   difficulty hearing as patient indicates that she normally has hearing
   aids in place. Also possible that unintelligible speech impacted by
   extremely dry mouth.
   - Covering broadly with IV abxs as above
   - Hold sedating medications; home celexa, trazodone
   - Replete free water deficit as above
   - Call niece to see if patient has hearing aids at home
   - Oral care while NPO to moisten mouth
   # Hyperglycemia:
   No documented h/o diabetes. FS yesterday were all ranging 207 to 275.
   Likely related to D5W infusion. Serum glucose was 157 this AM.
   - Check FS q6h and cover with HISS.
   # Dementia:
   Not on cholinesterase inhibitors as outpt. Attempt to clarify baseline
   with patient
s niece.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and hypertension. She presents with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. The patient's mental status has improved since admission, and she is more alert and interactive. The patient has multiple medical complications including aspiration pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleed, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, altered mental status, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's difficulty swallowing, thick secretions, and fever may indicate aspiration pneumonia. This is further supported by the appearance on the chest X-ray.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The presence of guaiac positive stools suggests gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has received a blood transfusion due to low hemoglobin levels.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels indicate hypernatremia, which may be secondary to decreased/poor oral intake and lasix administration. This condition needs to be managed carefully to avoid further complications.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 0.8 to 1.7, indicating acute renal failure. This may be due to prerenal causes such as dehydration or infection.

5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to infection, hypernatremia, and uremia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover potential infections.

   24 Hour Events:
   - Urine culture from [**2-10**] was speciated again and revealed that
   Proteus is sensitive to ceftriaxone.
   - Repeat urinalysis and urine culture pending.
   - Swallowing evaluation revealed that patient should remain NPO.
   - Third stool c.diff toxin sent and is pending.
   - Patient received 10 mg IV lasix with very little urine output in the
   afternoon, then received 20 mg IV lasix in the evening.
   - PM HCT was 28.6, stable from post-transfusion HCT of 29.2
   - PM lytes revealed an improved creatinine to 1.6 and stable sodium at
   147, thus rate of D5W infusion was increased to 75 mL/hr.
   - Niece was contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding goals of care and feels that no feeding
   tube is warranted at this time. Niece felt that we should continue with
   antibiotics and hydration in hopes that swallowing evaluation will
   improve with time.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of dementia and HTN who presents
   with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. Mental status is improved
   from admission with patient being more alert and interactive.
   # Fever/leukocytosis/hypoxia:
   Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia given CXR appearance,
   difficulty swallowing, thick secretions.  Viral etiologies ruled out,
   legionella antigen negative. NGTD in blood cultures. Urine culture
   revealed Proteus that is resistant to most antibiotics, but sensitive
   to Tobramycin. Has a meropenem sensitivity pending. Has been c.diff
   toxin negative x 2. Patient with pulmonary exam and CXR today
   consistent with volume overload in setting of getting hypotonic fluids
   to correct hypernatremia. Was > 2L positive fluid balance in 24 hours
   yesterday.
   - Gentle diuresis today with 10 mg IV furosemide
   - Continue to cover broadly with IV vancomycin (dosing by level given
   CrCl), ceftriaxone
   - Follow-up blood cx, NGTD
   - Follow-up one additional c.diff toxin and discontinue metronidazole
   if third c.diff toxin assay is negative
   - IV fluid boluses if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 20cc/hr
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   - Follow-up swallowing evaluation this AM
   # GI bleed:
   Patient with report of several small, dark, tarry bowel movements last
   night that were guaiac positive. Had PM HCTof 23.6 last night in
   setting of guaiac positive bowel movements and received 1U PRBC
   transfusion overnight.
   - Keep active type and cross
   - Start IV PPI
   - Follow-up HCT this AM to assure appropriate increase following 1 U
   PRBC transfusion yesterday.
   - Contact patient
s niece regarding consent for blood products.
   # Hypernatremia:
   Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia secondary to decreased/poor po intake
   in addition to lasix administration (BUN/Cr ratio > 20, ARF, appears
   very dry on exam).  Likely a chronic issue so can decrease sodium level
   at goal of  0.5/hr. Patient
s PM sodium was 150 yesterday and was 147
   this morning despite receiving hypotonic fluids all day yesterday.
   - Continue IVF at 55 mL/hr for the day today and follow-up PM sodium
   level
   - Sodium checks [**Hospital1 **] in order to adjust fluid rate
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr is 1.7 this AM and downtrending from 2.9 since admission. Last Cr in
   OMR in [**2162**] was 0.8. As above, likely prerenal cause as no eosinophils
   in urine to indicate AIN (recent ABX) and renal ultrasound normal so no
   obstruction.
   - Renally dose meds
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely secondary to infection and hypernatremia and uremia. ABG without
   significant hypercarbia. LFTs and TSH WNL. Serum tox was negative aside
   from acetaminophen on [**2-10**]/1008. Urine tox from [**2169-2-10**] was
   negative. Likely that some of her speech abnormalities are related to
   difficulty hearing as patient indicates that she normally has hearing
   aids in place. Also possible that unintelligible speech impacted by
   extremely dry mouth.
   - Covering broadly with IV abxs as above
   - Hold sedating medications; home celexa, trazodone
   - Replete free water deficit as above
   - Call niece to see if patient has hearing aids at home
   - Oral care while NPO to moisten mouth
   # Hyperglycemia:
   No documented h/o diabetes. FS yesterday were all ranging 207 to 275.
   Likely related to D5W infusion. Serum glucose was 157 this AM.
   - Check FS q6h and cover with HISS.
   # Dementia:
   Not on cholinesterase inhibitors as outpt. Attempt to clarify baseline
   with patient
s niece.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and hypertension who presents with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. The patient's mental status has improved from admission, indicating some level of responsiveness and interaction. The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) due to swallowing difficulties, as evidenced by the swallowing evaluation. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 95 bpm (normal range: 74-109 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 110/56 mmHg to 153/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (normal range: 19-32 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient is on a nasal cannula for supplemental oxygen.

The patient has a history of altered mental status, fever, and hypoxia. The assessment suggests that these symptoms are likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia, given the appearance on chest X-ray, difficulty swallowing, and thick secretions. Viral etiologies have been ruled out, and the patient has tested negative for c.diff toxin twice.

The patient has a positive fluid balance of 2,248 mL since 12 AM, with a total intake of 2,248 mL and total output of 1,195 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids, including D5W, and has received IV lasix twice, with minimal urine output"

   1 L positive fluid balance in 24 hours yesterday. Gentle diuresis today
   with 10 mg IV furosemide resulted in no increase in UOP, though 20 mg
   IV furosemide resulted in an increased UOP. Leukocytosis is worse today
   with WBC count of 22.1.
   - Discontinue metronidazole
   - Continue to cover broadly with IV vancomycin (dosing by level given
   CrCl), ceftriaxone with last dose of antibiotics being [**2169-2-16**].
   - Follow-up blood cx, NGTD
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve.
   # GI bleed:
   Patient with report of several small, dark, tarry bowel movements night
   of [**2169-2-12**] that were guaiac positive. Received 1U PRBC transfusion
   overnight on [**2169-2-12**]. Post-transfusion HCT was inappropriately up to
   29.2 and is now 26.9 this AM.
   - Keep active type and cross
   - Continue IV PPI
   # Hypernatremia:
   Likely hypovolemic hypernatremia secondary to decreased/poor PO intake
   in addition to lasix administration (BUN/Cr ratio > 20, ARF, appears
   very dry on exam).  Likely a chronic issue so can decrease sodium level
   at goal of  0.5/hr. Patient
s PM sodium was 147 yesterday and was
   normal at 141 this morning after increased overnight fluids.
   - Switch to maintenance fluids with D5 1/2NS at rate of 70 mL/hr.
   - Daily sodium
   # Acute renal failure:
   Cr is 1.7 this AM and down trending from 2.9 since admission. Last Cr
   in OMR in [**2162**] was 0.8. As above, likely prerenal cause as no
   eosinophils in urine to indicate AIN (recent ABX) and renal ultrasound
   normal so no obstruction.
   - Renally dose meds
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Likely secondary to infection and hypernatremia and uremia. ABG without
   significant hypercarbia. LFTs and TSH WNL. Serum tox was negative aside
   from acetaminophen on [**2-10**]/1008. Urine tox from [**2169-2-10**] was
   negative. Likely that some of her speech abnormalities are related to
   difficulty hearing as patient
s niece reported yesterday that patient
   is deaf. Also possible that unintelligible speech impacted by extremely
   dry mouth.
   - Covering broadly with IV abxs as above
   - Hold sedating medications; home celexa, trazodone
   - Oral care while NPO to moisten mouth
   # Hyperglycemia:
   No documented h/o diabetes. FS yesterday were all ranging 143 to 157.
   Likely related to D5W infusion. Serum glucose was 143 this AM.
   - Check FS q6h and cover with HISS, consider discontinuing fingersticks
   and HISS if FS remain under 200.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:
   NPO given failed swallowing evaluation yesterday
   Glycemic Control:  On HISS while getting D5W infusion

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia and hypertension. She presents with unresponsiveness, hypoxia, and fevers. Her mental status has improved since admission, but she still exhibits altered mental status and difficulty understanding speech due to deafness and extremely dry mouth. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, and her creatinine levels are elevated. She also has hypernatremia, likely secondary to decreased/poor oral intake and lasix administration. The patient's urine culture revealed Proteus bacteria, which is sensitive to ceftriaxone. She has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and her blood cultures showed no growth. The patient experienced a small gastrointestinal bleed, resulting in a transfusion of packed red blood cells. Her sodium levels are being carefully managed, and she is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for her infections. The patient's current plan includes maintaining hydration, monitoring her sodium levels, managing her acute renal failure, addressing her altered mental status, and controlling her hyperglycemia. She is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) due to a failed swallowing evaluation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status, difficulty swallowing, and thick secretions increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, such as increased hypoxia and respiratory distress.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. If left untreated"
