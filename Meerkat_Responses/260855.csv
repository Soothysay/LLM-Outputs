","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, alcohol withdrawal, and potential delirium tremens. He is currently intubated on assist-control ventilation with a PEEP of 15 cmH2O and FiO2 of 100%. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 38.5Â°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/61 to 78/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. Hemodynamic monitoring includes arterial lines for continuous blood pressure measurement and central venous pressure monitoring. The patient has received multiple doses of midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol for sedation and pain control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and regular chest X-rays can help identify any potential infections.

2. Delirium: The patient's alcohol withdrawal and sedative use may contribute to delirium. Monitoring for changes in mental status and providing appropriate pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions is essential.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or pharmacological prophylaxis should"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with DM, EtOH abuse, s/p a recent a. fib ablation admitted for
   ICH and found to have aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia and EtOH
   withdrawal.
   .
   # Respiratory failure/hypoxia: Likely related to an aspiration event in
   the setting of alcohol withdrawal. Other potential etiologies include
   CAP, influenza pneumonia or ARDS. Has known OSA and has refused CPAP in
   the past. Has moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, question
   if also contributing to respiratory failure. He continues to exhibit
   ARDS like physiology at this time. [**Month (only) 51**] have flashed prior to transfer
   to MICU.
   - Cefepime x 7 days ([**Date range (1) 12808**]), Flagyl x 7 days ([**Date range (1) 12809**]),
   Levofloxacin x 7 days ([**Date range (1) 12809**]) for aspiration pneumonia/cover for
   CAP
   - ARDSnet protocol ventilation for ARDS
   - Wean vent and sedation as tolerated; continue on Propofol and
   intermittent with Valium prn CIWA
   - Trend CXR
   - Albuterol, ipratropium nebs
   .
   # Labile BP. Initial hypotension in the setting of intubation and
   alcohol withdrawal. [**Month (only) 51**] also be secondary to PEEP in ARDS ventilation.
   Patient also received all of his medications for BP on floor. Less
   likely related to sepsis given clinical presentation. Hypertensive
   episodes throughout the day [**1-22**]. Likely related with withdrawal as
   below.
   - Goal SBP 120-160
   - Start short-acting antihypertensives, IV labetalol
   - Wean vent and sedation as tolerated; continue on Propofol and
   intermittent with Valium prn CIWA
   .
   # Alcohol withdrawal: Had episode of tremors, agitation, hypertension,
   low-grade fever and tachycardia during the [**1-22**] late evening and also
   [**1-22**] early morning prior to transfer to MICU.
   - Wean vent and sedation as tolerated; continue on Propofol and
   intermittent with Valium prn CIWA
   - Follow up social work consult recommendations; appreciate their input
   .
   # Fever: Etiology likely multifactorial, related with alcohol
   withdrawal, ICH, ARDS. [**Month (only) 51**] also be related with aspiration pneumonitis.
   Unlikely sepsis given clinical picture.
   - Trend fever
   - Follow cultures
   .
   # ICH: Stable. Neurosurgery is following.
   - Continue to follow neurosurgery recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   - Defer head CT at this time and re-assess neuro exam once weaned off

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, ethanol abuse, and recent atrial fibrillation ablation. He was admitted for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and found to have aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia and ethanol withdrawal. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure/Hypoxia: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to an aspiration event in the setting of alcohol withdrawal. Other potential etiologies include community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), influenza pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's known obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may also contribute to respiratory failure. ARDS-like physiology is present.

2. Labile Blood Pressure: The patient has labile blood pressure, which may be related to intubation, alcohol withdrawal, or PEEP in ARDS ventilation. Hypertensive episodes throughout the day are likely related to withdrawal.

3. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient had an episode of tremors, agitation, hypertension, low-grade fever, and tachycardia during the late evening and early morning. Sedation and weaning of ventilation should be continued as tolerated.

4. Fever: The etiology of the patient's fever is likely multifactorial, related to alcohol withdrawal, ICH, ARDS, and aspiration pneumonitis. Sepsis is unlikely"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), alcohol abuse, and recent atrial fibrillation ablation. He was admitted for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and found to have aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia and alcohol withdrawal. The patient is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and is also experiencing hypotension, fever, and elevated troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure/hypoxia: The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to an aspiration event in the setting of alcohol withdrawal. Other potential etiologies include community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), influenza pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's known obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and refusal of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the past may contribute to respiratory failure. Moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction could also be a contributing factor. ARDSnet protocol ventilation has been initiated for ARDS.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely related to medications in the setting of intubation and alcohol withdrawal. The low blood pressure may also be secondary to positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS ventilation. Other potential causes include sepsis, but the clinical presentation suggests otherwise.
3. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient had episodes of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes and EtOH abuse who was admitted for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and found to have aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia and EtOH withdrawal. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure/hypoxia, likely related to an aspiration event in the setting of alcohol withdrawal. Other potential etiologies include community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), influenza pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, which may be contributing to respiratory failure. He is being treated with antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia/cover for CAP and ARDSnet protocol ventilation for ARDS.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure/hypoxia likely due to an aspiration event in the setting of alcohol withdrawal. Other potential causes include CAP, influenza pneumonia, or ARDS.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, likely related to medications in the setting of intubation and alcohol withdrawal. It may also be secondary to PEEP in ARDS ventilation.
3. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient had episodes of tremors, agitation, hypertension, low-grade fever, and tachycardia during the late evening and early morning. He is being managed with midazolam and diazepam for CIWA >10 when able.
4. Fever"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old man who underwent a pulmonary vein ablation procedure and subsequently experienced head trauma, delirium tremens, and aspiration pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, alcohol withdrawal, intracranial hemorrhage, mild renal insufficiency, and hypertension.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 102.1Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 131/79 to 198/108 mmHg, heart rate between 63 and 114 bpm, respiratory rate at 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 22, PEEP at 18 cmH2O, FiO2 at 80%, and spontaneous respiratory efforts are absent.

The patient's physical examination reveals obesity, warm skin, bilateral lower extremity edema, and he is unresponsive with no movement or assessed tone. His laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels, while his glucose level is within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. His allergies include penicillins, and he has received various medications such as metronidazole, cefepime, midazolam, fentanyl, prop"

   the setting of alcohol withdrawal. Other potential etiologies include
   CAP, influenza pneumonia or ARDS. Has known OSA and has refused CPAP in
   the past. Has moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, question
   if also contributing to respiratory failure. He continues to exhibit
   ARDS like physiology at this time. [**Month (only) 51**] have flashed prior to transfer

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), ethanol abuse, and recent atrial fibrillation ablation. The patient was admitted for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and found to have aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia and ethanol withdrawal.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note are:

1. Respiratory failure/hypoxia: The patient has ARDS-like physiology, indicating potential respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia or other causes such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), influenza pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressure, initially hypotension in the setting of intubation and alcohol withdrawal. Hypertensive episodes throughout the day are likely related to withdrawal.

3. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient experienced tremors, agitation, hypertension, low-grade fever, and tachycardia during the late evening and early morning prior to transfer to the MICU. This suggests the need for continued monitoring and treatment for alcohol withdrawal.

4. Fever: The etiology of the fever is likely multifactorial, related to alcohol withdrawal, ICH, ARDS, and aspiration pneumonitis. It is important to trend fever and follow cultures.

5. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): The patient's ICH is stable, and neurosurgery is following up on it. The"

   - Wake-ups q4 and check neurological status
   # Alcohol withdrawal
   Difficult to evaluate baseline hypertension versus withdrawal, but now
   in excess of 80 mg given. Will likely safely taper within half-life.
   Also covered with propofol.
   - Continue light sedation
   - Restart home pressure meds to get back to baseline
   - Then treat signs of withdrawal
   # Respiratory failure/hypoxia
   Likely CAP with no radiographic evidence of aspiration.
   - Levofloxacin x 7 days ([**Date range (1) 12809**]) for CAP
   - Stop aspiration - pneumonia coverage given no radiographic evidence

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and a history of ethanol abuse. He was admitted for an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and found to have aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia and ethanol withdrawal. The patient underwent an atrial fibrillation ablation procedure prior to the ICH. On the first day, he experienced a subarachnoid hemorrhage and was given propofol for sedation. His blood pressure was controlled, and he was held on Coumadin due to the bleed. He was also treated for alcohol withdrawal and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: The patient has a subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is a serious condition that requires close monitoring. Neurosurgery is following the case, and the pressure needs to be controlled below 160 mmHg. Repeat CT scans may be necessary if there is a change in clinical status or if there are suspicions of bleeding.

2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is experiencing alcohol withdrawal, which can lead to complications such as seizures, hallucinations, and delirium tremens. He is being closely monitored for signs of withdrawal and is being treated with propofol and intermittent Valium to manage symptoms.

3. Respiratory failure/hypoxia: The patient is likely suffering from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with no radiographic evidence of aspiration. He has been started on Lev"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of recent atrial ablation, intracranial hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, and ethanol withdrawal. He is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.9Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 107/68 to 184/101 mmHg, heart rate of 107 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is being treated for atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, alcohol withdrawal (delirium tremens), intracranial hemorrhage, mild renal insufficiency, and diabetes mellitus. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and lactic acid levels. The plan includes narrow antibiotic therapy, weaning of PEEP, and managing the patient's conditions accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intracranial hemorrhage - The patient's condition requires close monitoring for any signs of worsening or expansion of the hemorrhage.
2. Respiratory failure - The patient's respiratory function needs to be closely monitored, and efforts should be made to wean PEEP and minimize ventilator-associated pneumonia risks.
3. Alcohol withdrawal (delirium tremens) - The patient is at risk for seizures and requires close monitoring for symptoms of withdrawal. Valium may be administered as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with DM, EtOH abuse, s/p a recent a. fib ablation admitted for
   ICH and found to have aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia and EtOH
   withdrawal.
   # Subarachnoid hemorrhage
   Neurosurgery following. Given territory of bleed, difficult to assess
   status clinically (higher function). CT reassuring.
   - Control pressure to < 160 mmHg
   - Repeat CT if change in clinical status or suspicious of bleed
   - Holding coumadin for one month with goal INR 1.5
   - Wake-ups q4 and check neurological status
   - Will follow-up with Neurosurgery in one month with head CT
   # Alcohol withdrawal
   Difficult to evaluate baseline hypertension versus withdrawal, but now
   in excess of 80 mg given. Will likely safely taper within half-life.
   Also covered with propofol.
   - Continue light sedation
   - Restart home pressure meds to get back to baseline
   - Then treat signs of withdrawal
   # Respiratory failure/hypoxia
   Likely CAP with no radiographic evidence of aspiration.
   - Levofloxacin x 7 days ([**Date range (1) 12809**]) for CAP
   - Stop aspiration - pneumonia coverage given no radiographic evidence
   - ARDSnet protocol ventilation for ARDS
   - Wean vent and sedation as tolerated; continue on Propofol and
   intermittent with Valium prn CIWA
   - Trend CXR
   - Albuterol, ipratropium nebs
   # Labile BP
   Likely related to holding BP meds as well as withdrawal.
   - Goal SBP 120-160
   - restart home meds as above
   - Valium per hypertension/tachycardia/diaphoresis/agitation thereafter
   # Fever
   Likely secondary to withdrawal and PNA.
   # L Non-displaced temporal bone fracture
   ENT has signed off.
   - Ciprodex otic 5 gtts TID both ears x10 days
   - Dexamethasone 5 gtts TID left ear x 10 days
   - Audiogram in 1 week; can be done as outpatient
   - Dry ear precautions AS
   - Follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 732**], ORL attending in [**1-1**] weeks
   # Diabetes:
   - Hold home glipizide for now
   - ISS goal FS 100-130

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and a history of ethanol abuse, who was admitted for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and found to have aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia and ethanol withdrawal. The patient has a subarachnoid hemorrhage and is being closely monitored by neurosurgery. The blood pressure is controlled and the patient's INR is targeted at 1.5. The patient is also being sedated with propofol and will have wake-ups every four hours to assess neurological status.

The patient is being treated for respiratory failure/hypoxia, likely due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), with Levofloxacin for seven days. The patient will continue on ARDSnet protocol ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and will be weaned off the ventilator and sedation as tolerated. Trending chest X-rays will be done.

The patient's labile blood pressure is likely related to holding blood pressure medications as well as withdrawal. The goal blood pressure is between 120-160 mmHg, and home medications will be restarted.

The patient has a fever, which is likely secondary to withdrawal and pneumonia. The patient also has a non-displaced temporal bone fracture, for which ENT has signed off. The patient will receive Ciprodex otic, Dexamethasone, and will undergo an audiogram in one week.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a fall with a subsequent subdural hemorrhage (SDH) and intracranial hemorrhage. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and is currently on anticoagulation therapy. The patient also has respiratory failure due to a non-ARDS cause, alcohol withdrawal, and is being treated for MRSA infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's prolonged immobility and presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's need for mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness can increase the risk of stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Delirium: Alcohol withdrawal and the ICU environment can contribute to the development of delirium.
5. Seizures: The presence of SDH and alcohol withdrawal increases the risk of seizures.
6. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): Although not currently present, the patient's respiratory failure needs close monitoring to prevent the development of ARDS.
7. Infection: The patient has a positive MRSA screen, indicating a risk of further infections.
8. Bleeding: Due to the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo M with DM, EtOH abuse, s/p a recent a. fib ablation admitted for
   ICH and found to have aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia and EtOH
   withdrawal.
   General plan: Move bowels, reduce sedation, return to home BP med
   regimen, wean sedation, sit up, wean vent. Extubate when PEEP, SBT,
   RSBI appropriate.
   # Subarachnoid hemorrhage
   - Control pressure to < 160 mmHg
   - Holding coumadin for one month with goal INR 1.5
   - Wean sedation and follow neurologic status
   - Will follow-up with Neurosurgery in one month with head CT
   # Alcohol withdrawal
   - Wean sedation
   - Place on CIWA again if suspicious of withdrawal
   # Respiratory failure/hypoxia
   - Move bowels then hopefully reduce PEEP (lung look good on CXR)
   - Finish course of levofloxacin x 7 days ([**Date range (1) 12809**]) for CAP
   - Wean vent and sedation as tolerated; continue on Propofol and
   intermittent with Valium prn CIWA
   - Stop Albuterol, ipratropium nebs
   # Labile BP
   Likely related to holding BP meds as well as withdrawal.
   - Goal SBP 120-160
   - restart home meds as above
   - Labetalol if needed for BP
   - Consider withdrawal if poorly controlled on home meds
   # A Flutter
   - Restart home pressure meds then try to address rate with BB at first.
   - Continue sotalol
   - Consider withdrawal as cause
   # Fever
   Likely secondary to withdrawal and PNA.
   - Blood cultures
   # L Non-displaced temporal bone fracture
   ENT has signed off.
   - Check course of below with ENT
   - Ciprodex otic 5 gtts TID both ears x10 days
   - Dexamethasone 5 gtts TID left ear x 10 days
   - Audiogram in 1 week; can be done as outpatient
   - Dry ear precautions AS
   - Follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 732**], ORL attending in [**1-1**] weeks
   # Diabetes:
   - Hold home glipizide for now
   - ISS goal FS 100-130
   # Replete K and phos.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with diabetes mellitus and a history of ethanol abuse. He was admitted for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and was found to have aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia and ethanol withdrawal. The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

- Vital signs: The patient has a fever with a maximum temperature of 38.2Â°C (100.7Â°F), tachycardia with a heart rate between 107-124 bpm, fluctuating blood pressure ranging from 91/63 mmHg to 153/85 mmHg, respiratory rate between 19-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is on ventilator support with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 22 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) initially set at 15 cmH2O, later increased to 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 245, and oxygen ventilation (Ve) of 10.7 L/min.

- Physical examination: The patient is sedated and responsive to loud voice and answering yes/no questions"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple health issues including subdural hemorrhage (SDH), history of atrial fibrillation (AFIB), respiratory failure, alcohol withdrawal, recent atrial ablation, intracranial hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, and etoh withdrawal.

The patient is currently in the ICU and has been sedated. He complains of abdominal discomfort and has not moved his bowels for several days. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 115 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 144/80 mmHg to 188/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient is mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 22 breaths per minute, PEEP level at 15 cmH2O, and FiO2 at 40%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.48, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 185 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 37 mmHg.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, platelet count of 264 K/uL, sodium level of 28 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L, glucose level of 195 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient has a subdural hemorrhage, which is a type of intracranial hemorrhage. This condition requires careful monitoring and management to prevent further bleeding and neurological complications.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation. The need for high PEEP levels suggests possible lung injury or difficulty weaning from the ventilator. Regular assessment of respiratory function and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary to optimize the patient's respiratory support.

3. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is withdrawing from alcohol, which can lead to complications such as delirium tremens (DTs), seizures, and autonomic instability. Monitoring for signs of withdrawal and providing appropriate pharmacological support will be essential.

4. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis. Close monitoring of respiratory status and prompt treatment of any infections will be important.

5. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's abdominal discomfort and lack of bowel movement for several days may indicate gastrointestinal complications such as bowel ischemia or ileus. Monitoring for signs of bowel perforation or necrosis and ensuring adequate nutritional support will be necessary.

6. Medication management: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including sedatives, antibiotics, and antihypertensives. Careful monitoring of drug levels, side effects, and drug interactions will be important to optimize the patient's treatment plan.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple health issues requiring close monitoring and management"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with SAH, SDH, and non-displaced spinal fractures after a fall. He has a history of alcohol abuse and is experiencing respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypertension, withdrawal symptoms, worsening left basal opacity on chest X-ray, abdominal distension, resolving pneumonia, and some COPD. His vital signs show tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. The patient's recent events include increased bowel regimen, restart of home medications, and titration of Lisinopril. He had a bowel movement in the afternoon but still exhibits dilated bowel on KUB. The patient is receiving multiple infusions and other ICU medications. His labs show elevated WBC count and CRP levels, along with deranged electrolytes. The patient's imaging shows worsening left basal opacity on chest X-ray and no new findings on the abdomen. The assessment and plan include continued bowel management to decrease PEEP, extubation when needing PEEP 5, finishing the course of levofloxacin, and addressing hypertension, withdrawal symptoms, skull fracture, SAH/SDH, COPD, constipation, nutrition, atrial flutter, diabetes, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's code status is full code, and he is to be transferred to the floor once stable."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), subdural hematoma (SDH), and a non-displaced spinal fracture after a fall. The patient also has a past medical history of COPD, hypertension, diabetes, and alcohol abuse.

24-hour events:
- Blood cultures were obtained.
- The neurosurgery team signed off in the morning.
- Increased bowel regimen was initiated due to abdominal distention, which was inhibiting the successful weaning off the ventilator. The patient had a bowel movement in the afternoon.
- Repeated kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) showed dilated bowel.
- Restarted home Lisinopril at half dose (20mg) and planned to titrate up (40mg).
- Started Diltiazem drip for tachycardia and hypertension; added Clonidine patch; restarted Nicardipine drip.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's active issues include pneumonia (PNA) resolving, hypertension, and alcohol withdrawal. The patient continues to require respiratory support and is being ventilated. The plan includes continuing to move bowels to decrease PEEP, extubation when needing PEEP 5, and finishing the course of levofloxacin.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypertension, COPD, skull fracture, SAH/SDH, diabetes, electrolyte"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are respiratory failure, EtOH withdrawal, and intracranial hemorrhage. The patient remains distended with high OGT output and has a PEEP down to 10 with a pO2 of 62. 

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and pain. The last dose of antibiotics was metronidazole on 2129-01-23 at 09:00 PM, and cefipime on 2129-01-24 at 08:00 AM. 

Infusions include nicardipine at 2 mcg/kg/min, propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min, and diltiazem at 15 mg/hour. Other ICU medications are noted in the resident's note. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2Â°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/73 to 187/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. 

The patient's blood cultures were taken at 04:13 AM on 2129-01-26. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and a Vt set of 450 mL, RR set at 22, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and SpO2 of 90%. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, distended abdomen, warm skin, and no peripheral edema. Neurological examination shows the patient to be unattentive, not following simple commands, and not assessed for movement, tone, or pain. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, platelet count of 272 K/uL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, and glucose of 175 mg/dL. Other lab values are provided in the note. 

Assessment and plan include subdural hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, acute on chronic, alcohol withdrawal, and aspiration pneumonia. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise, including worsening respiratory failure, sepsis due to infection, further neurological deterioration from the intracranial hemorrhage or atrial fibrillation, and complications related to alcohol withdrawal."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 12875**] is a 68 yo M s/p fall while EtOH intox > skull #, SAH, SDH.
   Active issues: PNA resolving, HTN, withdrawal.
   # Respiratory Failure
   Episodes of hypoxia overnight. Minimal response with PEEP to 10. No
   change with recruitment maneuvers. PEEP increased to 15, Fi02 to 100%
   with good response. Fi02 weaned down overnight. Concern for plugging,
   aspiration pneumonia, HAP. Less likely PE. Abdominal distension
   obviously has effect on respiratory mechanics. CXR yesterday without
   change in ETT tube, pneumo, or appreciable change in parenchymal
   disease.
   - Levo, Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia; consider expand coverage to
   Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl to cover for hospital acquired pneumonia
   - Follow up CT torso
   - Reduce abdominal distention as discussed below
   - SBT, extubate when able (i.e. PEEP 5)
   #Abdominal Distention/possible partial SBO
   KUB with illeus. Large amount of air in colon. No stool in rectum
   flexiseal in place. 1.5 liters from 0G tube yesterday. Enema of no
   benefit given lack of stool in rectum. Unable to take POs currently.
   Clinically distention worsened today, with minimal bowel sounds.
   Lactate stable.
   - NPO, IVF maintenance
   - Follow up CT torso
   - Continue OG tube to intermittent suction, flexiseal in place
   - Serial abdominal exam
   - Surgery consult
   # Fever/Leukocytosis
   Temperature to 102.4 overnight with new leukocytosis. Blood/Urine
   cultures sent. CXR without clear new infiltrate. Given history of
   vomiting x2 yesterday may be aspiration pneumonitis vs pneumonia. Also
   consider HAP. Less likely intraabdominal pathology however possible. UA
   without infection.
   - Follow up CT torso
   - Follow up cultures
   - Levo, Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia; consider expand coverage to
   Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl to cover for hospital acquired pneumonia
   # ? Change in Neuro Status/Deficits
   Per Nursing concern this AM. Unable to wean propofol enough to
   appreciate exam. With minimal sedation patient appears to move right
   upper and lower extremity however would not move left upper and lower
   extremity. Would not follow my finger. Pupils were ERRL. Unlikely
   secondary to repeat bleed given INR and neuro findings. If patient does
   have real deficits which I doubt given level of sedation would be
   secondary to right MCA stroke. Pt does have A. Fib without adequate
   anticoagulation currently.
   - Follow up CT head
   - Wean sedation to further evaluate neuro exam
   - Based on CT Head would recontact neurosurgery or neurology depending
 I think this will be unlikely
   # Atrial flutter
   Off coumadin for one month. Poor rate control when febrile/sedation
   decreased.
   - Continue dilt IV
   - Restart sotalol when taking POs
   - Restart coumadin in one month
   - Cardiology follow-up
   # Hypertension
   Baseline difficult to control pressure and now withdrawal also.
   - Restart ACE (start 20 and home 40), sotalol (120) and short acting
   nifedipine (90 CR at home) when taking POs
   - While OG output/suspicion of partial obstruction/ileus, continue dilt
   and nicardipine
   # Skull fracture
   - Cipro and dex ear drops per ENT - check duration
   - F/u with ENT
   # SAH/SDH. Needs follow up CT and Neurosurgery appointment in one month
   - Follow up CT head
   # COPD
   Not convincing COPD flare, but still some wheeze and benefit from nebs.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium for now
   # Nutrition
   - Hold tube feeds given abdominal distention, Thiamine, MVI, Folate IV.
   - NPO
   # Withdrawal
   Few symptoms, but may be contributing to AF, tachycardia and
   hypertension.
   - Follow clinically
   # Diabetes
   - ISS
   - Glipizide held
   # Electrolytes
   - Ca, Mg, K Phos sliding scales

   meeting held , ICU consent signed Comments:
   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of fall while intoxicated, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, abdominal distention, fever, change in neuro status, atrial flutter, hypertension, skull fracture, SAH/SDH, COPD, nutrition, withdrawal, diabetes, and electrolyte imbalance.

The patient has had episodes of hypoxia overnight, which were initially managed with PEEP to 10 but did not show much improvement. The FiO2 was increased to 100% with good response, and then gradually weaned down. There is concern for aspiration pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), or other respiratory complications.

Abdominal distention has worsened, with minimal bowel sounds and no stool in the rectum. The patient has been given an enema, which was unsuccessful due to lack of stool in the rectum. Flexiseal has been placed, and the patient is on intermittent suction. There is a concern for partial small bowel obstruction (SBO).

The patient developed a fever of 102.4 degrees overnight with leukocytosis. Blood and urine cultures have been sent, and the patient has been started on antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia. There is also concern for HAP.

There have been concerns about a possible change in neuro status, with the patient showing movement"

   - BP/Rate Control: Well rate controlled 90 - low hundreds. BP 140-150s.
   Systolics to 80s-100s when propofol increased during episode of
   decreased 02 saturation.
   - Urine Output dropped over the course of the day. Given increased OG
   output bolused one liter NS
   - Spiked 102.4 overnight. Urine/Blood Cultured. Given concern for
   aspiration flagyl added to levofloxacin. Endotracheal gram
   stain/culture sent. This regimen may need to be broadened if patient
   does not improve - HAP coverage, etc.
   - 02sat dropped to 90s overnight, Recruitment without success, CXR
   performed given concern for aspiration no major changes, Oxgenation
   improved with increased PEEP, Fi02 was weaned down.
   - Called this morning with concerns that during wake up patient was
   posturing with left upper extremity. Decreased propofol, On my exam
   patient seemed to move right upper/lower extremity. Less movement in
   left upper extremity. Pupils equal. Propofol increased when patient
   became dysynchronous with vent, limiting exam. Non Contrast Head CT.
   - Increased distention of abdomen overnight, sent for non contrast CT

   hospital acquired pneumonia.
   - Reduce abdominal distention as discussed below.
   - Extubate when needing PEEP 5
   # Fever/Leukocytosis
   Temp. to 102.4 overnight with new leukocytosis. Blood/Urine cultures
   sent. CXR without clear new infiltrate. Given history of vomiting x2
   yesterday may be aspiration pneumonitis vs pneumonia. Also consider
   HAP. Less likely intraabdominal pathology however possible. UA without
   infection.
   - FU Blood/Urine
   - FU CT Torso
   - FU Final CXR
   - Levo/Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia, should patient spike later
   today or CT torso with evidence of new pneumonia would consider
   broadening coverage to Vanc/Zosyn.
   #Abdominal Distention
   KUB with illeus. Large amount of air in colon. No stool in rectum
   flexiseal in place. 1.5 liters from 0G tube yesterday. Enema of no
   benefit given lack of stool in rectum. Unable to take POs currently.
   Clinically distention worsened today, with minimal bowel sounds.
   Lactate stable.
   - CT abdomen with gastrograffin oral contrast
   - Continue OG tube to intermittent suction, flexiseal in place
   - Serial Abdominal exam
   # ? Change in Neuro Status/Deficits
   Per Nursing concern this AM. Unable to wean propofol enough to
   appreciate exam. With minimal sedation patient appears to move right
   upper and lower extremity however would not move left upper and lower
   extremity. Would no follow my finger. Pupils were ERRL. Unlikely
   secondary to repeat bleed given INR and neuro findings. If patient does

 I think this will be unlikely
   # Atrial flutter
   Off coumadin for one month. Poor rate control when febrile/sedation
   decreased.
   - Continue dilt IV
   - Restart sotalol when taking POs
   - Restart coumadin in one month
   - Cardiology follow-up
   # Hypertension
   Baseline difficult to control pressure and now withdrawal also.
   - Restart ACE (start 20 and home 40), sotalol (120) and short acting
   nifedipine (90 CR at home) when taking POs
   - While OG output/suspicion of partial obstruction/ileus, continue dilt

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of fall while intoxicated, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient's current issues include pneumonia resolving, hypertension, alcohol withdrawal, respiratory failure, fever with leukocytosis, abdominal distention, and potential change in neuro status.

The patient's respiratory failure is indicated by episodes of hypoxia overnight. Despite increasing PEEP to 15 and FiO2 to 100%, there was a good response, and FiO2 was weaned down overnight. There is concern for aspiration pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), or a plugged bronchus. The patient is currently on levo and flagyl for aspiration pneumonia, and pending CT, the patient will continue to spike. Coverage will be expanded to Vanc/Zosyn/Flagyl to cover for HAP.

The patient's fever with leukocytosis overnight suggests an infection. Blood and urine cultures were sent. CXR does not show clear new infiltrate. Given the history of vomiting, it may be aspiration pneumonitis versus pneumonia. Also, consider HAP. Less likely intraabdominal pathology, but possible. UA without infection.

The patient's abdominal distention is due to ileus with large amounts of air in the colon. No stool in the rectum, flexiseal in place. Enema was given, but it did not help due to the lack"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with multiple medical issues including recent atrial ablation, intracranial hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, and alcohol withdrawal. He is currently in the ICU and is critically ill. The patient has experienced dropped O2 sats overnight with an attempt to wear PEEP, fever, and has been sedated and unable to provide a history. He is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and normal oxygen saturation. His laboratory results indicate renal failure, fever of unknown origin, small bowel obstruction, subdural hemorrhage, and a history of atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient has a history of intracranial hemorrhage, which can lead to neurological complications such as increased intracranial pressure, brain herniation, or seizures.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which may be related to abdominal distention. This can lead to further respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and potential complications like pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Small bowel obstruction: The patient has signs of small bowel obstruction, which can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and distention. If not treated promptly, it can lead to complications like bowel ischemia, perforation,"

   # Respiratory Failure
   No repeat episodes of hypoxia. Continue PEEP at 15. Prior episodes of
   hypoxia concern for plugging, aspiration PNA, HAP as described above.
   Less likely PE. Abdominal distension obviously has effect on
   respiratory mechanics. CXR without change in ETT tube, pneumo, or
   appreciable change in parenchymal disease.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Reduce abdominal distention as discussed below
   - SBT, extubate when able
   # Ileus vs Low Grade SBO/Abdominal Distention
   Persistent abdominal distention. No stool in rectum flexiseal in place.
   Enema of no benefit given lack of stool in rectum. 1.5 liters from OG
   tube yesterday. Unable to take POs currently. Minimal bowel sounds.
   Lactate stable.

   - Dose Vancomycin by trough given rapidly changing Cr
   # Change in Neuro Status/Deficits
   Per nursing concern yesterday AM. Unable to wean propofol enough to
   appreciate exam. Difficult to assess interval change. CT head obtained
   without progression of bleed. Likely related with evolving concussion.
   - Wean sedation as tolerated to further evaluate neuro exam
   - Follow anticoagulation as patient with atrial fibrillation/flutter
   and no adequate anticoagulation at this time
   # Atrial flutter
   Off coumadin for one month. Poor rate control when febrile/sedation
   decreased.
   - Continue dilt IV

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a history of fall while intoxicated, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient's current issues include pneumonia (PNA) resolving, hypertension (HTN), withdrawal, and ileus. 

Medical Complications:
1. Positive Blood Culture/Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has persistent fever and one set of blood cultures positive for gram-positive cocci. There is a concern for sepsis, and the patient is being treated broadly with antibiotics covering both respiratory and abdominal sources.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had episodes of hypoxia, but no repeat episodes have been observed. The patient will continue to receive PEEP at 15, and antibiotics will be continued as above.
3. Ileus vs Low Grade SBO/Abdominal Distention: The patient has persistent abdominal distention, and there is a concern for ileus or low-grade small bowel obstruction. The patient is NPO, receiving IV fluids, and has an ongoing nasogastric (OG) tube to intermittent suction.
4. Change in Neuro Status/Deficits: The patient's neuro status has changed, but it is difficult to assess due to sedation. A CT head has been obtained, and there are evolving concussions.
5. Atrial Flutter: The patient has atrial flutter, and rate control is"

   # Positive Blood Culture/Fever/Leukocytosis
   WBC stable increased slightly, but patient with persistent fever and
   one set blood culture on [**1-26**] positive with coag neg staph. Question
   sepsis from primary respiratory source versus contamination. Will treat
   broadly given concurrence of fevers and initial leukocytosis. Less
   likely primary abdominal source.

   # Respiratory Failure
   No repeat episodes of hypoxia. Continue PEEP at 15. Prior episodes of
   hypoxia concern for plugging, aspiration PNA, HAP as described above.
   Less likely PE. Abdominal distension obviously has effect on
   respiratory mechanics. CXR without change in ETT tube, pneumo, or
   appreciable change in parenchymal disease.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Reduce abdominal distention as discussed below
   - SBT, extubate when able
   # Ileus vs Low Grade SBO/Abdominal Distention
   Persistent abdominal distention. No stool in rectum flexiseal in place.
   Enema of no benefit given lack of stool in rectum. 1.5 liters from OG
   tube yesterday. Unable to take POs currently. Minimal bowel sounds.
   Lactate stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who sustained a fall while intoxicated, resulting in a skull fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hematoma (SDH). He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, pneumonia, sepsis, ileus, and other medical issues. The patient's current concerns include positive blood cultures, persistent fever, leukocytosis, hypertension, atrial flutter, hypotension, neuro status changes, COPD exacerbation, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 15 cmH2O and FiO2 of 60%. There have been no recent episodes of hypoxia, but previous episodes were concerning for aspiration pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Further monitoring and assessment of respiratory function are necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient has positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci, indicating a possible bloodstream infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the source of infection needs to be identified. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and clinical symptoms is crucial.
3. Ileus vs Low Grade SBO/Abdominal Distention: The patient has persistent abdominal distention with minimal bowel sounds. An enema was unsuccessful in relieving the distention. NPO status, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and serial abdominal exams should"

   aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, etoh withdrawal.  Now with
   ileus, ? obtruction in decscending colon.
   1. Sepsis/hypotension
   -has gone from hypertension to hypotension requiring pressors
   -vanc/cefipime/flagyl/cipro empirically - narrow as cx data becomes
   available
    2.  Resp Failure
   -Ongoing PEEP requirment related to abd distention
   -Cont to wean FIO2 as tolerated
   3. Ileus vs SBO
   -surgery & GI following
   4. Afib:
   -Sotolol when able to tolerate OGT meds again. Cont dilt.
   5. Acute renal failure:
   -Cr cont to rise 2.4 today
   -urine output 20-33cc/hr
   6. Fevers/GPC bacteremia:
   -central lines resited
   -Cx SCN from aline only so might be contaminant though since CVL in
   place at time can't exclude line infection
   7. ETOH withdrawal
   -CIWA scale
   8. Intracranial hemorrhage - SAH & SDH
   -Stable

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of fall while intoxicated, resulting in skull fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple active issues including pneumonia (PNA) resolving, hypertension, alcohol withdrawal, and ileus. 

The patient's recent events include fever, positive blood culture for coag-negative staphylococci, and abdominal distension. The blood culture was positive on January 26th. The patient has been treated with vancomycin, cefepime, Flagyl, and ciprofloxacin to cover for gram-positive cocci in the blood, as well as HAP and aspiration PNA. 

The patient's respiratory status is stable with no recent episodes of hypoxia. However, the patient has respiratory failure, and PEEP has been maintained at 15. There are concerns about aspiration PNA, HAP, and possibly a pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The patient's abdominal distension suggests ileus or low-grade small bowel obstruction (SBO). The patient has not had any stool in the rectum, and an enema was unsuccessful in relieving the distension. The patient is unable to take oral medications currently. 

The patient also has acute tubular necrosis (ATN), likely secondary to hypotension in the setting of sepsis. There is a need for aggressive fluid"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 12875**] is a 68 yo M s/p fall while EtOH intox > skull #, SAH, SDH.
   Active issues: PNA resolving, HTN, withdrawal, ileus.
   Impression: Although presenting with head injury c/b SAH and SDH, his
   admission has been complicated by an ileus, worsening renal failure and
   stupor.
   # Ileus
   Unclear etiology. Likely secondary to medications in the first
   instance, along with immobility. Now worsened by uremia. This also
   supports a uremic etiology to neurologic findings. Continuing
   supportive measures as per SBO: Fluids, NPO, gentle suction to OG tube.
   - Attempted lactulose when no residual overnight. Now stopped given OG
   output again
   - Follow abdominal exam
   - Repeat KUB tomorrow
   # Positive Blood Culture/Fever/Leukocytosis
   Likely PNA given positive sputum. Will send UA again. Other sites of
   infection are possible. Meningitis is low probability and difficult to
   evaluate clinically given present exam
 consider LP to complete
   picture. Low grade fever persists fever and one set blood culture on
   [**1-26**] positive with coag neg staph. Broadly covered at present:
   Vancomycin/Cefepime/Ciprofloxacin/Flagyl
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Cipro given gram positive cocci in blood. Start
   date [**1-27**] for Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro. Covering HAP, aspiration PNA.
   - Follow cultures, await speciation
   - Levophed prn early goal directed MAP > 65, UOP > 33cc/hr
 considered
   too low given typically hypertensive. Should aim for SBP ~ 120 mmHg for
   cerebral perfusion
 concerned for anoxic injury. Aggressive fluid
   hydration
   - Daily Blood Cultures
   # Respiratory Failure
   Improving with PEEP from 15 yesterday to 12 today. Brief desaturation
   only then maintaining well. Abdominal distension obviously has effect
   on respiratory mechanics.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Reduce abdominal distention as discussed below
   - SBT, extubate when able
   # [**Last Name (un) **]
   Likely secondary to hypotension in the setting of sepsis - ATN. AIN
   also possible given extensive exposure to medications/antibiotics.
   - UA with reflex to micro
   - Urine lytes/osms/eos.
   - If creatinine continues to rise will talk to renal tomorrow about
   potential dialysis/further tests
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Follow UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough given rapidly changing Cr
   # Stupor
   Given little focality on exam seems likely metabolic/toxic. Given this.
   Most likely uremic, despite not dramatically elevated BUN. Other
   contributors are infection and concussion. If dialysis ends up being
   performed soon, then may wait to see if resolution of uremia improves
   mental status. Otherwise need to be sensitive to CNS infection or
   re-bleed.
   - Check benzo tox in urine to see if cleared
   - Follow neurologic exam
   # Atrial flutter
   Rate Controlled this AM. Off coumadin for one month. Poor rate control
   when febrile/sedation decreased.
   - Continue dilt IV
   - Restart sotalol when taking POs
   - Restart coumadin in one month

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 12875**] is a 68 yo M s/p fall while EtOH intox > skull #, SAH, SDH.
   Active issues: PNA resolving, HTN, withdrawal, ileus.
   # Positive Blood Culture/Fever/Leukocytosis
   WBC stable increased slightly, but patient with persistent fever and
   one set blood culture on [**1-26**] positive with coag neg staph. Question
   sepsis from primary respiratory source versus contamination. Will treat
   broadly given concurrence of fevers and initial leukocytosis. Less
   likely primary abdominal source.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Cipro given gram positive cocci in blood. Start
   date [**1-27**] for Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro. Covering HAP, aspiration PNA.
   - Follow cultures, await speciation
   - Levophed prn early goal directed MAP > 65, UOP > 33cc/hr, aggressive
   fluid hydration
   - Daily Blood Cultures
   # Respiratory Failure
   No repeat episodes of hypoxia. Continue PEEP at 15. Prior episodes of
   hypoxia concern for plugging, aspiration PNA, HAP as described above.
   Less likely PE. Abdominal distension obviously has effect on
   respiratory mechanics. CXR without change in ETT tube, pneumo, or
   appreciable change in parenchymal disease.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Reduce abdominal distention as discussed below
   - SBT, extubate when able
   # Ileus vs Low Grade SBO/Abdominal Distention
   Persistent abdominal distention. No stool in rectum flexiseal in place.
   Enema of no benefit given lack of stool in rectum. 1.5 liters from OG
   tube yesterday. Unable to take POs currently. Minimal bowel sounds.
   Lactate stable.
   - NPO, IVF maintenance
   - Continue OG tube to intermittent suction, flexiseal in place
   - Serial abdominal exam
   - Follow surgery recommendations; appreciate their input
   - GI consult regarding recommendations
   - Clamp NG tube and eval response.
   # [**Last Name (un) **]. Likely secondary to hypotension in the setting of sepsis, ATN.
   - Trend Cr
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Follow UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough given rapidly changing Cr
   # Atrial flutter
   Rate Controlled this AM. Off coumadin for one month. Poor rate control
   when febrile/sedation decreased.
   - Continue dilt IV
   - Restart sotalol when taking POs
   - Restart coumadin in one month
   - Cardiology follow-up
   # Skull fracture
   - Cipro and dex ear drops per ENT - check duration
   - F/u with ENT
   # SAH/SDH. Needs follow up CT and Neurosurgery appointment in one month
   # COPD
   Not convincing COPD flare, but still some wheeze and benefit from nebs.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium for now
   # Nutrition
   - Hold tube feeds given abdominal distention, Thiamine, MVI, Folate IV.
   - NPO
   # Withdrawal
   Out of the [**Doctor Last Name 1078**]. No symptoms, but have contributed to AF, tachycardia
   and hypertension.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male who has experienced a fall while intoxicated and has sustained a skull fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient's active issues include pneumonia (PNA) that is resolving, hypertension (HTN), alcohol withdrawal, and ileus.

The patient has a positive blood culture with coag-negative Staphylococcus, along with fever and leukocytosis. This indicates the possibility of sepsis, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started. The source of the infection could be either respiratory or contaminated blood culture, so further investigation is needed.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to abdominal distension caused by ileus or small bowel obstruction (SBO). Efforts are being made to reduce the abdominal distension and improve respiratory mechanics.

Additionally, the patient has an ileus or low-grade SBO, as evidenced by persistent abdominal distension and lack of stool output. The patient is currently on NPO (nothing by mouth), with intermittent suctioning of the gastric tube and placement of a flexiseal to prevent aspiration.

There are concerns about acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to hypotension during sepsis, and aggressive fluid resuscitation is being implemented. The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating kidney dysfunction.

Other issues include atrial flutter, which is being rate-controlled"

   Assessment and Plan
   68M w/ recent atrial ablation admitted to MICU with intracranial
   hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, etoh
   withdrawal.
   1. Sepsis/hypotension
   -able to wean off neo yesterday
   -vanc/cefipime/flagyl/cipro empirically
     -SCN from aline likely contaminant but had CVL in place so possible
   line infxn
     -MRSA from sputum
    2.  Resp Failure
   -Significant portion of ongoing PEEP requirment related to abd
   distention
   -Cont to wean FIO2 as tolerated
   3. Ileus vs SBO
   -surgery & GI following - feel likely ileus though could be partial SBO

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the MICU with intracranial hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, and ethanol withdrawal. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation for which he recently underwent ablation.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 101.4Â°F (38Â°C), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/56 mmHg to 157/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 15 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, and invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated platelet count, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, distended abdomen, absence of bowel sounds, and no neurologic assessment due to sedation.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient is still on vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, and ciprofloxacin empirically. There is a concern"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Vancomycin level 18.6
   - Ordered urine lytes, osms, eos, etc. Given that we will likely
   consult Renal in the a.m. - particularly if renal function worsens.
   - OG tube output down in a.m. and lactulose given with some stool
   output also. Later began to put out a lot per OG - 500 cc.
   - Thus still dramatic ileus (with uremia possibly partly responsible).
   - Still essentially non-responsive with eyes opening to name and no
   attention or following of commands. Diffuse metabolic character and
   major contributor may be uremia, but PNA and previous sedating
   medications (more than two days ago) may contribute. No benzos remain
   in urine, however.
   - Continued with low-grade fever. Gave OG Tylenol but unlikely much
   absorbed. Temperature was reduced slightly, nonetheless.
   - Urine output quite large: Adequate volume and renal perfusion, but
   also possible diuresis phase of ATN. Will need to follow CVP/clinical
   volume status.
   - Accidentally extubated during cleaning at 5 a.m. Re-intubated by
   Anesthesia without incident.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 12875**] is a 68 yo M s/p fall while EtOH intox > skull #, SAH, SDH.
   Active issues: PNA resolving, HTN, withdrawal, ileus.
   Although presenting with head injury c/b SAH and SDH, his admission has
   been complicated by an ileus, worsening renal failure and stupor.
   # Ileus: Resolving, given flatus, stool, bowel sounds. Unclear
   etiology. Likely secondary to medications in the first instance, along
   with immobility. Possibly worsened by uremia. Continuing supportive
   measures as per SBO: Fluids, NPO, gentle suction to OG tube. GI has
   signed off.
   - Serial abdominal exam
   - Repeat KUB PRN
   # Positive Blood Culture/Fever/Leukocytosis
   Likely PNA given MRSA+ positive sputum. Will send UA again. Other sites
   of infection are possible. Meningitis is low probability and difficult
   to evaluate clinically given present exam
 consider LP to complete
   picture. Low grade fever persists fever and one set blood culture on
   [**1-26**] positive with coag neg staph. Broadly covered at present:
   Vancomycin/Cefepime/Ciprofloxacin/Flagyl. Now off pressors
   - Can d/c flagyl, given known culture data
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro given gram positive cocci in blood. Start date
   [**1-27**] for Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro. Covering HAP.
   - Follow cultures, await speciation
   - Daily Blood Cultures
   # Respiratory Failure: Improving with PEEP from 15 yesterday to 12
   today. Brief desaturation only then maintaining well. Abdominal
   distension obviously has effect on respiratory mechanics. Changed to
   pressure support this morning.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Expect reduction in abdominal distension with resolving ileus.
   - SBT, extubate when able
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely secondary to hypotension in the setting of sepsis
 ATN;
   may be in diuresis phase now, given large volume urine output over past
   24 hrs. AIN also possible given extensive exposure to
   medications/antibiotics, although urine eo
s negative.
   - Can hold off on renal consult at this time. If BUN/creatinine start
   to rise again, will talk to renal tomorrow about potential
   dialysis/further tests
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Follow UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough given rapidly changing Cr
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Stupor: Given little focality on exam seems likely metabolic/toxic,
   potentially [**2-1**] uremia, despite not dramatically elevated BUN. Other
   contributors are infection, lingering sedative medications, and
   concussion. If dialysis ends up being performed soon, then may wait to
   see if resolution of uremia improves mental status. Otherwise need to
   be sensitive to CNS infection or re-bleed.
   - Check benzo tox in urine to see if cleared
   - Follow neurologic exam
   # Atrial flutter: Not adequately rate controlled on diltiazem. Known to
   be difficult to rate control in past.
   - Change to esmolol gtt
   - Consider EP input, given patient
s known difficulty with HR. Off
   coumadin for one month. Poor rate control when febrile/sedation
   decreased.
   - Restart sotalol when taking POs
   - Restart coumadin in one month
   - Cardiology follow-up
   # Rash: Concerning for drug rash, although offending [**Doctor Last Name **] unclear.
   Responded well to IV benadryl x 1
   - Monitor skin exam
   # Skull fracture
   - Cipro and dex ear drops per ENT - check duration
   - F/u with ENT
   # SAH/SDH. Needs follow up CT and Neurosurgery appointment in one month
   # COPD: Not convincing COPD flare, but still some wheeze and benefit
   from nebs.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium for now
   # Nutrition: Will provide nutrients through IV, given resolving ileus
   - NPO
   # Withdrawal: Now beyond duration during which withdrawal would be
   expected. Holding benzos or other sedatives given stupor.
   - SW / advice about rehabilitation when acute issues resolved
   # Diabetes
   - ISS
   - Glipizide held
   # Electrolytes
   -          Stop Ca, Mg, K Phos sliding scales given renal failure
   # Proph: Pantoprazole

","The patient is a 68-year-old male who experienced a fall while intoxicated, resulting in a skull fracture with subsequent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient's current issues include pneumonia (PNA) that is resolving, hypertension (HTN), alcohol withdrawal, and ileus. The ileus appears to be resolving, but the cause is unclear. It may be due to medications, immobility, or uremia. The patient remains stuporous with a decreased level of consciousness, likely secondary to metabolic/toxic factors, possibly uremia. Other contributing factors include infection, lingering sedative medications, and concussion. The patient has a history of COPD, diabetes, and a rash that responded well to IV benadryl. He also has atrial flutter that is not adequately rate-controlled on diltiazem. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure, respiratory failure, infection (such as meningitis), gastrointestinal bleeding, and electrolyte imbalances."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 12875**] is a 68 yo M s/p fall while EtOH intox > skull #, SAH, SDH.
   Active issues: PNA resolving, HTN, withdrawal, ileus.
   Impression: Although presenting with head injury c/b SAH and SDH, his
   admission has been complicated by an ileus, worsening renal failure and
   stupor.
   # Ileus
   Unclear etiology. Likely secondary to medications in the first
   instance, along with immobility. Now worsened by uremia. This also
   supports a uremic etiology to neurologic findings. Continuing
   supportive measures as per SBO: Fluids, NPO, gentle suction to OG tube.
   - Attempted lactulose when no residual overnight. Now stopped given OG
   output again
   - Follow abdominal exam
   - Repeat KUB tomorrow
   # Positive Blood Culture/Fever/Leukocytosis
   Likely PNA given positive sputum. Will send UA again. Other sites of
   infection are possible. Meningitis is low probability and difficult to
   evaluate clinically given present exam
 consider LP to complete
   picture. Low grade fever persists fever and one set blood culture on
   [**1-26**] positive with coag neg staph. Broadly covered at present:
   Vancomycin/Cefepime/Ciprofloxacin/Flagyl
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl/Cipro given gram positive cocci in blood. Start
   date [**1-27**] for Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro. Covering HAP, aspiration PNA.
   - Follow cultures, await speciation
   - Levophed prn early goal directed MAP > 65, UOP > 33cc/hr
 considered
   too low given typically hypertensive. Should aim for SBP ~ 120 mmHg for
   cerebral perfusion
 concerned for anoxic injury. Aggressive fluid
   hydration
   - Daily Blood Cultures
   # Respiratory Failure
   Improving with PEEP from 15 yesterday to 12 today. Brief desaturation
   only then maintaining well. Abdominal distension obviously has effect
   on respiratory mechanics.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Reduce abdominal distention as discussed below
   - SBT, extubate when able
   # [**Last Name (un) **]
   Likely secondary to hypotension in the setting of sepsis - ATN. AIN
   also possible given extensive exposure to medications/antibiotics.
   - UA with reflex to micro
   - Urine lytes/osms/eos.
   - If creatinine continues to rise will talk to renal tomorrow about
   potential dialysis/further tests
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Follow UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough given rapidly changing Cr
   # Stupor
   Given little focality on exam seems likely metabolic/toxic. Given this.
   Most likely uremic, despite not dramatically elevated BUN. Other
   contributors are infection and concussion. If dialysis ends up being
   performed soon, then may wait to see if resolution of uremia improves
   mental status. Otherwise need to be sensitive to CNS infection or
   re-bleed.
   - Check benzo tox in urine to see if cleared
   - Follow neurologic exam
   # Atrial flutter
   Rate Controlled this AM. Off coumadin for one month. Poor rate control
   when febrile/sedation decreased.
   - Continue dilt IV
   - Restart sotalol when taking POs
   - Restart coumadin in one month
   - Cardiology follow-up
   # Skull fracture
   - Cipro and dex ear drops per ENT - check duration
   - F/u with ENT
   # SAH/SDH. Needs follow up CT and Neurosurgery appointment in one month
   # COPD
   Not convincing COPD flare, but still some wheeze and benefit from nebs.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium for now
   # Nutrition
   - Hold tube feeds given abdominal distention, Thiamine, MVI, Folate IV.
   - NPO
   # Withdrawal
   Out of the [**Doctor Last Name 1078**]. No symptoms, but have contributed to AF, tachycardia
   and hypertension.
   - SW / advice about rehabilitation when acute issues resolved
   # Diabetes

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who presented with a fall while intoxicated and was found to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and subdural hematoma (SDH). Since admission, the patient has experienced several complications, including pneumonia (PNA), hypertension, withdrawal symptoms, ileus, acute renal failure, fever of unknown origin, small bowel obstruction, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, and alcohol withdrawal.

The patient's current condition includes continued ileus, worsening renal function, and stupor. There is a concern for uremic encephalopathy contributing to the neurologic findings. The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The blood cultures are positive with coag-negative staphylococci, indicating a possible infection. The patient's electrolytes are deranged, and there is a need for aggressive fluid resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by increasing creatinine levels. This may require dialysis to manage the uremic encephalopathy and prevent further kidney damage.

2. Sepsis: The positive blood cultures suggest a systemic infection, which could lead to sepsis. Appropriate antibiotic therapy has been initiated, but the source of infection needs to be identified and treated.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient remains on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 12875**] is a 68 yo M s/p fall while EtOH intox > skull #, SAH, SDH.
   Active issues: PNA resolving, HTN, withdrawal, ileus.
   Although presenting with head injury c/b SAH and SDH, his admission has
   been complicated by an ileus, worsening renal failure and stupor.
   # Altered Mental status: Less responsive to verbal and painful stimuli
   today. BP
s down from yesterday. CT unrevealing for new pathology.
   Given phenylephrine this morning to raise BP
s. Since then, has been
   slightly more responsive, now partially opening eyes to verbal and
   painful stimuli, possibly also tracking voices.  Previously had
   considered metabolic (e.g. uremic) etiology, but BUN increased for past
   several days. Has by now cleared etoh and benzos.
   - serial neuro exams
   - f/u final head CT read
   - trend BUN/creat
   - avoid sedating meds
   # Ileus: Continues to have flatus, stool, bowel sounds. Abd still
   somewhat distended. Unclear etiology. Likely secondary to medications
   in the first instance, along with immobility. Continuing supportive
   measures as per SBO: Fluids, NPO, gentle suction to OG tube. GI has
   signed off.
   - Serial abdominal exam
   - Repeat KUB PRN
   - Monitor bowel output
   # Positive Blood Culture/Fever/Leukocytosis: Known MRSA in sputum and
   coag negative staph in blood ([**1-26**]). Other/subsequent culture data
   unrevealing thus far. On vancomycin, cipro, cefepime, but withdrawing
   cipro and cefepime given ID recs and possible drug rash to cefepime
   (given PCN allergy).
   - Re-culture for spiking temps
   - F/u outstanding cultures
   # Respiratory Failure: PEEP currently at 10 as above, after 8
   overnight.. Abdominal distension obviously has effect on respiratory
   mechanics. Changed to pressure support this morning.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Expect reduction in abdominal distension with resolving ileus.
   - SBT, extubate when able
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely secondary to hypotension in the setting of sepsis
 ATN;
   likely experienced diuresis  for past 1-2 days. Creatinine continuing
   to trend down. Urine eo

   - Continue to monitor BUN/creatinine.
   - Consider renal consult if BUN/creatinine start to rise again, for
   further testing or HD
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation PRN
   - Follow UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough given rapidly changing Cr
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Atrial flutter: Rate control somewhat improved on esmolol gtt,
   although later hypotensive, as above. Known to be difficult to rate
   control in past.
   - C/w esmolol gtt when BP tolerates
   - Restart sotalol when taking POs
   - Restart coumadin in one month
   - Cardiology follow-up
   # Rash: Concerning for drug rash, possibly [**2-1**] cefepime, given PCN
   allergy.
   - d/c cefepime, as above
   - Monitor skin exam
   # Skull fracture: Course of cipro/dexamethasone ear drops now complete
   # SAH/SDH: CT today unrevealing for worsening or new fractures
   # COPD: Not convincing COPD flare, but still some wheeze and benefit
   from nebs.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium for now
   # Nutrition: Will provide nutrients through IV, given resolving ileus
   - re-consult nutrition for re-starting tube feeds, as ileus resolves
   - NPO
   # Withdrawal: Now beyond duration during which withdrawal would be

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of fall while intoxicated, resulting in a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient's admission has been complicated by pneumonia (PNA) resolving, hypertension (HTN), alcohol withdrawal, and ileus. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, worsening renal failure, and stupor. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C (99.7Â°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/68 mmHg to 156/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is currently on esmolol drip for rate control of atrial fibrillation. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactic acid levels. The patient also has anemia with a hematocrit of 25.9%. The abdominal exam reveals a distended abdomen with bowel sounds present. The patient has flatus and stool, but the etiology of ileus is unclear. The patient is being managed with supportive measures such as fluids, nasogastric (NG) tube, and gentle suction. 

The patient has positive blood cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coag-negative Staphylococcus, and he is currently on vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. The antibiotics are being adjusted based on culture results and the patient's renal function. 

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and has a tracheostomy in place. The respiratory failure is attributed to abdominal distension affecting respiratory mechanics. The patient's recent CT scan did not reveal any new pathology. 

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a skull fracture. The patient's diabetes medication has been held. The patient is also receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 12875**] is a 68 yo M s/p fall while EtOH intox > skull #, SAH, SDH.
   Active issues: PNA resolving, HTN, withdrawal, ileus.
   Although presenting with head injury c/b SAH and SDH, his admission has
   been complicated by an ileus, worsening renal failure and stupor.
   # Ileus: Resolving, given flatus, stool, bowel sounds. Unclear
   etiology. Likely secondary to medications in the first instance, along
   with immobility. Possibly worsened by uremia. Continuing supportive
   measures as per SBO: Fluids, NPO, gentle suction to OG tube. GI has
   signed off.
   - Serial abdominal exam
   - Repeat KUB PRN
   # Positive Blood Culture/Fever/Leukocytosis
   Likely PNA given MRSA+ positive sputum. Will send UA again. Other sites
   of infection are possible. Meningitis is low probability and difficult
   to evaluate clinically given present exam
 consider LP to complete
   picture. Low grade fever persists fever and one set blood culture on
   [**1-26**] positive with coag neg staph. Broadly covered at present:
   Vancomycin/Cefepime/Ciprofloxacin/Flagyl. Now off pressors
   - Can d/c flagyl, given known culture data
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro given gram positive cocci in blood. Start date
   [**1-27**] for Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro. Covering HAP.
   - Follow cultures, await speciation
   - Daily Blood Cultures
   # Respiratory Failure: Improving with PEEP from 15 yesterday to 12
   today. Brief desaturation only then maintaining well. Abdominal
   distension obviously has effect on respiratory mechanics. Changed to
   pressure support this morning.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Expect reduction in abdominal distension with resolving ileus.
   - SBT, extubate when able
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely secondary to hypotension in the setting of sepsis
 ATN;
   may be in diuresis phase now, given large volume urine output over past
   24 hrs. AIN also possible given extensive exposure to
   medications/antibiotics, although urine eo
s negative.
   - Can hold off on renal consult at this time. If BUN/creatinine start
   to rise again, will talk to renal tomorrow about potential
   dialysis/further tests
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - Follow UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough given rapidly changing Cr
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Stupor: Given little focality on exam seems likely metabolic/toxic,
   potentially [**2-1**] uremia, despite not dramatically elevated BUN. Other
   contributors are infection, lingering sedative medications, and
   concussion. If dialysis ends up being performed soon, then may wait to
   see if resolution of uremia improves mental status. Otherwise need to
   be sensitive to CNS infection or re-bleed.
   - Check benzo tox in urine to see if cleared
   - Follow neurologic exam
   # Atrial flutter: Not adequately rate controlled on diltiazem. Known to
   be difficult to rate control in past.
   - Change to esmolol gtt
   - Consider EP input, given patient
s known difficulty with HR. Off
   coumadin for one month. Poor rate control when febrile/sedation
   decreased.
   - Restart sotalol when taking POs
   - Restart coumadin in one month
   - Cardiology follow-up
   # Rash: Concerning for drug rash, although offending [**Doctor Last Name **] unclear.
   Responded well to IV benadryl x 1
   - Monitor skin exam
   # Skull fracture
   - Cipro and dex ear drops per ENT - check duration
   - F/u with ENT
   # SAH/SDH. Needs follow up CT and Neurosurgery appointment in one month
   # COPD: Not convincing COPD flare, but still some wheeze and benefit
   from nebs.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium for now
   # Nutrition: Will provide nutrients through IV, given resolving ileus
   - NPO
   # Withdrawal: Now beyond duration during which withdrawal would be
   expected. Holding benzos or other sedatives given stupor.
   - SW / advice about rehabilitation when acute issues resolved
   # Diabetes
   - ISS
   - Glipizide held
   # Electrolytes
   -          Stop Ca, Mg, K Phos sliding scales given renal failure

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of fall while intoxicated, resulting in a skull fracture with subsequent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient's admission has been complicated by pneumonia (PNA) resolving, hypertension (HTN), alcohol withdrawal, and ileus.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has shown improvement with the adjustment of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) from 15 to 12 cmH2O. However, there is still a need for pressure support due to abdominal distension affecting respiratory mechanics. It is important to continue antibiotics and expect a reduction in abdominal distension with resolving ileus. Extubation may be considered when the patient is able to pass a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is worsening, indicated by the increasing levels of BUN and creatinine. This may be secondary to hypotension in the setting of sepsis or as a result of medication exposure leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's large volume urine output over the past 24 hours suggests they may be in the diuresis phase. Holding off on renal consult for now, but considering dialysis if BUN/creatinine levels rise again"

   Assessment and Plan
   68M s/p fall while EtOH intoxicated leading to skull fracture with SAH,
   SDH. His admission has been complicated by an ileus, acute on chronic
   renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fib, and
   stupor.
   # Altered Mental status: MS changes somewhat waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] in nature,
   hard to attribute to uremia or hepatic encephalopathy; to EtOH or
   withdrawal (all clear of system now). Could be multifocal (TBI +
   hypernatremia +/- hepatic encephalopathy.)
   - Touch base with neurosurg: Expected course given his head injuries?
   - Touch base with neuro: EEG read, would he be someone to put on
   Keppra?
   - Start Lactulose
   - f/u final head CT read
   - trend BUN/creat
   - avoid sedating meds
   - continue D5W for hyperNa+
   # Hypernatremia: Do not bring down precipitately.
   -          30 cc free H2O q6, and D5W
   -          Target 144 Na+
   -          For hypotension: Use neo instead of LR boluses
   # A Fib/Flutter: Rate control never achieved fully on esmolol gtt, has
   brief hypotensive spells. Known to be difficult to rate control in
   past.
   - Digoxin
   - Esmolol gtt when BP tolerates
   - Add Neo for hypotensive events
   - Restart coumadin in one month
   # Respiratory Failure: Abdominal distension has effect on respiratory
   mechanics. Not convincing COPD flare, but still some wheeze and benefit

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a fall while intoxicated with ethanol. The patient has a history of skull fracture with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient's admission has been complicated by ileus, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and stupor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status changes could be attributed to traumatic brain injury (TBI), hypernatremia, or hepatic encephalopathy. It is important to monitor the patient closely and consider further evaluation, such as an EEG, to determine the cause and appropriate management.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be managed carefully to avoid rapid changes in sodium levels. The target sodium level is 144 mEq/L. Monitoring the patient's electrolytes and fluid balance is crucial.
3. Atrial Flutter/Fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is irregular, and rate control has not been achieved fully. Digoxin may be considered for rate control, and esmolol can be used to manage hypotensive spells. Neo should be used for hypotensive events.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated for 11 days and has abdominal distension affecting respiratory mechanics. Tracheost"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr [**Known lastname 12875**] is a 68 yo M s/p fall while EtOH intox > skull #, SAH, SDH.
   Active issues: PNA resolving, HTN, withdrawal, ileus.
   Although presenting with head injury c/b SAH and SDH, his admission has
   been complicated by an ileus, worsening renal failure and stupor.
   # Altered Mental status: Less responsive to verbal and painful stimuli
   today. BP
s down from yesterday. CT unrevealing for new pathology.
   Given phenylephrine this morning to raise BP
s. Since then, has been
   slightly more responsive, now partially opening eyes to verbal and
   painful stimuli, possibly also tracking voices.  Previously had
   considered metabolic (e.g. uremic) etiology, but BUN increased for past
   several days. Has by now cleared etoh and benzos.
   - serial neuro exams
   - f/u final head CT read
   - trend BUN/creat
   - avoid sedating meds
   # Ileus: Continues to have flatus, stool, bowel sounds. Abd still
   somewhat distended. Unclear etiology. Likely secondary to medications
   in the first instance, along with immobility. Continuing supportive
   measures as per SBO: Fluids, NPO, gentle suction to OG tube. GI has
   signed off.
   - Serial abdominal exam
   - Repeat KUB PRN
   - Monitor bowel output
   # Positive Blood Culture/Fever/Leukocytosis: Known MRSA in sputum and
   coag negative staph in blood ([**1-26**]). Other/subsequent culture data
   unrevealing thus far. On vancomycin, cipro, cefepime, but withdrawing
   cipro and cefepime given ID recs and possible drug rash to cefepime
   (given PCN allergy).
   - Re-culture for spiking temps
   - F/u outstanding cultures
   # Respiratory Failure: PEEP currently at 10 as above, after 8
   overnight.. Abdominal distension obviously has effect on respiratory
   mechanics. Changed to pressure support this morning.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Expect reduction in abdominal distension with resolving ileus.
   - SBT, extubate when able
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely secondary to hypotension in the setting of sepsis
 ATN;
   likely experienced diuresis  for past 1-2 days. Creatinine continuing
   to trend down. Urine eo
s negative.
   - Continue to monitor BUN/creatinine.
   - Consider renal consult if BUN/creatinine start to rise again, for
   further testing or HD
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation PRN
   - Follow UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough given rapidly changing Cr
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Atrial flutter: Rate control somewhat improved on esmolol gtt,
   although later hypotensive, as above. Known to be difficult to rate
   control in past.
   - C/w esmolol gtt when BP tolerates
   - Restart sotalol when taking POs
   - Restart coumadin in one month
   - Cardiology follow-up
   # Rash: Concerning for drug rash, possibly [**2-1**] cefepime, given PCN
   allergy.
   - d/c cefepime, as above
   - Monitor skin exam
   # Skull fracture: Course of cipro/dexamethasone ear drops now complete
   # SAH/SDH: CT today unrevealing for worsening or new fractures
   # COPD: Not convincing COPD flare, but still some wheeze and benefit
   from nebs.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium for now
   # Nutrition: Will provide nutrients through IV, given resolving ileus
   - re-consult nutrition for re-starting tube feeds, as ileus resolves
   - NPO
   # Withdrawal: Now beyond duration during which withdrawal would be
   expected. Holding benzos or other sedatives given stupor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of fall while intoxicated, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hematoma (SDH).
- He is currently in the ICU due to multiple complications including renal failure, fever of unknown origin, small bowel obstruction, and respiratory failure.
- The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of responsiveness and unresponsiveness.
- He has been on various medications including phenylephrine, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and cefepime.
- The patient's blood cultures showed MRSA in the sputum and coag-negative staph in the blood.
- The abdominal distension suggests ongoing ileus, and the patient has been on bowel rest with NPO (nothing by mouth) status.
- His respiratory support has been adjusted, with increased PEEP and pressure support.
- The patient's creatinine levels are trending down, indicating improvement in renal function.
- There are concerns about drug rashes and the need for rate control in atrial flutter.
- The patient's electrolytes need to be managed cautiously due to renal failure.
- There are ongoing concerns regarding withdrawal, nutrition, and communication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly. This can lead to further complications such as fluid and electrolyte imbalances, uremia, and increased risk of infections.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fever needs to be investigated further to determine the underlying cause. Possible causes could include infections, malignancy, or drug reactions.
3. Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): The patient's ileus has led to small bowel obstruction, which can cause abdominal distension, vomiting, and constipation. Surgical intervention may be required if conservative measures fail.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if adequate ventilation and oxygenation are not maintained. This can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
5. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter needs to be managed with appropriate rate control measures to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.
6. Drug Rash: The patient's suspected drug rash could progress to Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis if not recognized and treated promptly.
7. Subdural Hematoma: The patient's underlying subdural hematoma may continue to expand and cause increased intracranial pressure, leading to neurological deterioration.
8. Falls: The patient's history of falls increases the risk of further falls in the ICU, which can result in additional injuries or complications.

Overall, the patient is facing multiple complex medical complications that require careful management to prevent further deterioration and improve his chances of recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   68M s/p fall while EtOH intoxicated leading to skull fracture with SAH,
   SDH. His admission has been complicated by an ileus, worsening renal
   failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fib, and
   stupor.
   # Altered Mental status: MS improved after neo to raise BPs, opens eyes
   to stimuli, seems to track. MS changes hard to attribute to uremia as
   BUN remains unchanged (while MS has improved); to EtOH or withdrawal
   (all clear of system now). Link to BP suggests either TBI or
   hypernatremia as etiology of AMS.
   - serial neuro exams
   - f/u final head CT read
   - trend BUN/creat
   - avoid sedating meds
   - continue D5W for hyperNa+
   - continue Neo for now
   #
   # Ileus: Continues to have flatus, stool, bowel sounds. Abd still
   somewhat distended. Unclear etiology. Likely secondary to medications
   in the first instance, along with immobility. Continuing supportive
   measures as per SBO: Fluids, NPO, gentle suction to OG tube. GI has
   signed off.
   - Serial abdominal exam
   - Repeat KUB PRN
   - Monitor bowel output
   # Positive Blood Culture/Fever/Leukocytosis: Known MRSA in sputum and
   coag negative staph in blood ([**1-26**]). Other/subsequent culture data
   unrevealing thus far. On vancomycin, cipro, cefepime, but withdrawing
   cipro and cefepime given ID recs and possible drug rash to cefepime
   (given PCN allergy).
   - Re-culture for spiking temps
   - F/u outstanding cultures
   # Respiratory Failure: PEEP currently at 10 as above, after 8
   overnight.. Abdominal distension obviously has effect on respiratory
   mechanics. Changed to pressure support this morning.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Expect reduction in abdominal distension with resolving ileus.
   - SBT, extubate when able

   - Consider renal consult if BUN/creatinine start to rise again, for
   further testing or HD
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation PRN
   - Follow UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough given rapidly changing Cr
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Atrial flutter: Rate control somewhat improved on esmolol gtt,
   although later hypotensive, as above. Known to be difficult to rate
   control in past.
   - C/w esmolol gtt when BP tolerates
   - Restart sotalol when taking POs
   - Restart coumadin in one month
   - Cardiology follow-up
   # Rash: Concerning for drug rash, possibly [**2-1**] cefepime, given PCN
   allergy.
   - d/c cefepime, as above
   - Monitor skin exam
   # Skull fracture: Course of cipro/dexamethasone ear drops now complete
   # SAH/SDH: CT today unrevealing for worsening or new fractures
   # COPD: Not convincing COPD flare, but still some wheeze and benefit
   from nebs.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium for now
   # Nutrition: Will provide nutrients through IV, given resolving ileus

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male who presented to the ICU with a history of fall while intoxicated, resulting in a skull fracture with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient's admission has been complicated by an ileus, worsening renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter, and altered mental status (AMS).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8Â°C (100Â°F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/73 mmHg to 157/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 27.8 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 4,830 mL with an output of 2,970 mL.

Physical examination reveals an intubated patient with generalized anasarca, warm, dry skin, and no rash. The patient opens eyes to verbal stimuli and seems to track, but falls asleep again. The heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AF), and lung examination shows clear to bilaterally auscultated lung fields with crackles at the bases.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hg"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who presented to the ICU with a history of fall while intoxicated, leading to skull fracture with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and subdural hematoma (SDH). He has had complications including ileus, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation, and stupor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 50 mg/dL. It is important to monitor and manage this condition carefully to avoid rapid changes in sodium levels, which can lead to neurological complications.
2. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation/flutter with a difficult-to-control heart rate. Rate control is essential to prevent cardiac complications such as hypotension and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
3. Positive Blood Culture/Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has positive blood cultures for MRSA and coag-negative staph, indicating an ongoing infection. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent sepsis and other related complications.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation support due to respiratory distress. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters, including oxygenation and ventilation, is crucial to optimize gas exchange and prevent further respiratory complications.
5. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient has experienced acute kidney injury,"

   Assessment and Plan
   68M s/p fall while EtOH intoxicated leading to skull fracture with SAH,
   SDH. His admission has been complicated by an ileus, acute on chronic
   renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fib, and
   stupor.
   # Altered Mental status: MS changes somewhat waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] in nature,
   hard to attribute to uremia or hepatic encephalopathy; to EtOH or
   withdrawal (all clear of system now). Could be multifocal (TBI +
   hypernatremia +/- hepatic encephalopathy.)
   - Touch base with neurosurg: Expected course given his head injuries?
   - Touch base with neuro: EEG read, would he be someone to put on
   Keppra?
   - Start Lactulose
   - f/u final head CT read
   - trend BUN/creat
   - avoid sedating meds
   - continue D5W for hyperNa+
   # Hypernatremia: Do not bring down precipitately.
   -          30 cc free H2O q6, and D5W
   -          Target 144 Na+
   -          For hypotension: Use neo instead of LR boluses
   # A Fib/Flutter: Rate control never achieved fully on esmolol gtt, has
   brief hypotensive spells. Known to be difficult to rate control in
   past.
   - Digoxin
   - Esmolol gtt when BP tolerates
   - Add Neo for hypotensive events
   - Restart coumadin in one month
   # Respiratory Failure: Abdominal distension has effect on respiratory
   mechanics. Not convincing COPD flare, but still some wheeze and benefit
   from nebs. Has been intubated 11 days now.
   - Consider trach for better suctioning
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Expect reduction in abdominal distension with resolving ileus.
   - SBT, extubate when able
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely secondary to hypotension in the setting of sepsis
 ATN;
   likely experienced diuresis  for past 1-2 days. Creatinine continuing
   to trend down. Urine eo
s negative.
   - Continue to monitor BUN/creatinine.
   - Consider renal consult if BUN/creatinine start to rise again, for
   further testing or HD
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation PRN
   - Follow UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough given rapidly changing Cr
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Rash: Was concerning for drug rash, possibly [**2-1**] cefepime, given PCN
   allergy. Cefepime has been d/c
d, rash resolved.
   # Skull fracture: Course of cipro/dexamethasone ear drops now complete
   # SAH/SDH: CT unrevealing for worsening or new fractures. Neurosurg to
   see.
   # Ileus: Resolving, continues to have flatus, stool, bowel sounds.
   Getting tube feeds. Abd still somewhat distended. Unclear etiology.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who presented with a fall while intoxicated, resulting in a skull fracture with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient's admission has been complicated by ileus, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation, and stupor.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has a change in mental status, which is waxing and waning in nature. The cause could be multifactorial, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), hypernatremia, or hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, which needs to be managed carefully. The target sodium level is 144 mEq/L.
3. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: The patient has an irregular heart rhythm that is difficult to control. Medications such as digoxin and esmolol are being used to manage the rate.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated for 11 days due to respiratory failure. There is a consideration for tracheostomy for better suctioning.
5. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has acute kidney injury likely secondary to hypotension in the setting of sepsis-associated tubular necrosis (ATN). The creatinine level is trending down, but renal function needs"

   Assessment and Plan
   68M s/p fall with EtOH onboard leading to skull fracture, SAH, SDH.
   Admission c/b intermittent ileus, acute on chronic renal failure,
   respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fib, and altered mental
   status.
   # Altered Mental status: MS [**First Name (Titles) 899**] [**Last Name (Titles) 13059**]/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Likely
   multifactorial (TBI + hypernatremia +/- hepatic encephalopathy.) Per
   neurosurg his head injuries alone should be resolving. His LP,
   additional labs and MRI were unrevealing. On lactulose.
   - trend BUN/creat
   - avoid sedating meds
   - continue D5W for hyperNa+
   # Hypernatremia: Was at 144, D5w was stopped, crept back to 147.
   -          D5W
   -          Target 144 Na+
   -          For hypotension: Use neo instead of LR boluses
   # Ileus: Has returned, patient no longer stooling, belly distended.
   - KUB
   - NPO, gentle suction to OG tube.
   - Serial abdominal exam
   - GI consult
   - Monitor bowel output
   # A Fib/Flutter: Rate control never achieved on esmolol, has brief
   hypotensive spells. Known to be difficult to rate control in past.
   - Digoxin on board
   - Esmolol gtt when BP tolerates
   - Add Neo for hypotensive events
   - Restart coumadin in one month
   # Respiratory Failure: Abdominal distension has effect on respiratory
   mechanics. Still some wheeze and benefit from nebs. Has been intubated
   12 days now. [**Month (only) 51**] do better if we can resolve ileus. Could be extubated
   if awake enough to protect airway.
   - Consider trach for better suctioning
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - SBT, extubate when able
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Likely secondary to hypotension in the setting of sepsis
 ATN;
   likely experienced diuresis for past 1-2 days. Creatinine continuing to
   trend down. Urine eo
s negative.
   - Continue to monitor BUN/creatinine.
   - Consider renal consult if BUN/creatinine start to rise again, for
   further testing or HD
   - Aggressive fluid resuscitation PRN
   - Follow UOP > 30cc/hr
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough given rapidly changing Cr
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Rash: Was concerning for drug rash, possibly [**2-1**] cefepime, given PCN
   allergy. Cefepime has been d/c
d, rash resolved.
   # Skull fracture: Course of cipro/dexamethasone ear drops now complete
   # SAH/SDH: CT unrevealing for worsening or new fractures. Neurosurg to
   see.
   # Positive Blood Culture/Fever/Leukocytosis: Resolving. MRSA in sputum
   and coag- staph in blood ([**1-26**]). Other/subsequent culture data
   unrevealing thus far.
   - Continue Vanc
   - Re-culture for spiking temps
   - F/u outstanding cultures
    # EtOH: Now beyond duration during which withdrawal expected. Holding
   benzos or other sedatives. Getting Thiamine/Folate.
    - SW / advice about rehabilitation when acute issues resolved
   # Diabetes
   - ISS
   - Glipizide held

","The patient is a 68-year-old male who presented with a history of alcohol use and sustained a fall resulting in a skull fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hematoma (SDH). He was admitted with intermittent ileus, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter, altered mental status, and hypernatremia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6Â°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 148/78 to 165/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and an irregular heart rhythm consistent with atrial fibrillation. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, elevated platelet count, moderately elevated creatinine levels, decreased total CO2, low albumin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), normal calcium and magnesium levels, and slightly decreased phosphorus level. 

The patient's physical examination reveals anasarca (generalized swelling), clear lung sounds with crackles at the bases, tachycardia with irregular heart rhythm, and a distended abdomen. 

The patient has been intubated for 12 days and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after falling with ethanol onboard, resulting in a skull fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hemorrhage (SDH). The patient's condition has been complicated by intermittent ileus, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter and fibrillation, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is multifactorial, including traumatic brain injury, hypernatremia, and possibly hepatic encephalopathy. The neurosurgical team believes that the patient's head injuries alone should resolve over time, and additional labs and MRI were unrevealing. The patient is being treated with lactulose.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient initially had a high sodium level of 144, which was treated with D5W. However, the sodium level crept back up to 147. The plan is to continue with D5W to target a sodium level of 144.

3. Ileus: The patient's ileus has returned, with the patient no longer stooling and experiencing belly distension. A gastrointestinal consult has been ordered, and the patient is being placed on NPO status with gentle suction to the OG tube. Serial abdominal exams will be performed, and monitoring of bowel output will be done.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted with a history of ethanol use, subsequent fall, and diagnosed with a skull fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient's current health issues include intermittent ileus, acute-on-chronic renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter and fibrillation, and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 134/74 mmHg, heart rate of 96 bpm, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's lab results show elevated sodium levels, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal moderate cardiomegaly and minimal pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, and post-traumatic changes with evolution of contusion/hematoma on MRI/MRA brain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high serum sodium level, which can lead to dehydration, increased blood viscosity, and neurological complications if not managed appropriately.
2. Ileus: The patient's bowel movements are impaired, leading to a lack of stool output. This could progress to complete bowel obstruction, causing further complications such as infection or electrolyte imbalances.

   - 24-hour EEG ordered
   - Nsurg recs: MRI c/w cerebral contusions course, does not explain
   altered MS, they sign off.
   - Curbsided Cards for AF:  No other recommendations for controlling AF
   other than cardioversion.  Could try verapamil (strongest CCB) but
   didn't given ileus and concern for ischemia.
   - PM lytes: continued hyperNa+, getting D5W
   - Dialed Esmolol up to 200 mcg, better HR and BP control

   Assessment and Plan
   68M s/p fall with EtOH onboard leading to skull fracture, SAH, SDH.
   Admission c/b intermittent ileus, acute on chronic renal failure,
   respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fib, and altered mental
   status.
   # Altered Mental status: Continues to lack purposeful interaction off
   sedation, although is opening eyes more spontaneously today. Traumatic
   brain injury may be contributing factor, but subsequent head scans not
   showing any new acute processes, other than evolving
   contusion/hematoma. Mildly hypernatremic and BUN approaching normal.
   Bedside EEG unrevealing. Minimal response to lactulose (now withheld,
   given ongoing ileus).
   - trend BUN/creat, electrolyte abnormalities
   - avoid sedating meds
   - continue D5W for hyperNa+
   - 24 hour EEG
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Serum [Na+] 145 this morning, on D5W infusion.
   - Complete current D5W infusion, target 144
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # Ileus: Some stool output today, abdomen mildly softer. Per GI, no
   intervention indicated at this time.
   - Mesenteric MRA today, to r/o ischemic bowel
   - NPO, c/w OG suction
   - Serial abdominal exam
   - Monitor stool output via flexiseal
   .
   # A Fib/Flutter: Loaded with Digoxin, also continues on esmolol gtt.
   Known to be difficult to rate control in past.
   - C/w daily IV Digoxin
   - Wean Esmolol gtt as tolerated
   - Add Neo for hypotensive events
   # Respiratory Failure: Respiratory status stable, with reasonable ABG
   on PSV. Known MRSA in sputum
   - Extubation trial after MRA today; if mental status inadequate
   following extubation, consider trach for better suctioning
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue with  vanco
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine improvement has plateaued at 2.2. [**Month (only) 51**] respresent new
   baseline following hypotensive episode/ATN.
   - Continue to monitor BUN/creatinine, UOP
   - Consider renal consult if BUN/creatinine start to rise again, for
   further testing or HD
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough given rapidly changing Cr
   # Rash: Was concerning for drug rash, possibly [**2-1**] cefepime, given PCN
   allergy. Cefepime has been d/c
d, rash resolved.
   # Skull fracture: Course of cipro/dexamethasone ear drops now complete
   # SAH/SDH: CT unrevealing for worsening or new fractures.
   # EtOH: Now beyond duration during which withdrawal expected. Holding
   benzos or other sedatives. Getting Thiamine/Folate.
    - SW / advice about rehabilitation when acute issues resolved
   # Diabetes: ISS; Glipizide held
   # FEN: Tube feeds turned off now. Will restart if ileus resolves.
   Alternatively will consider TPN
   # Proph: Pantoprazole, pneumoboots

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 68-year-old male who sustained a fall with ethanol onboard, resulting in a skull fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hematoma (SDH).
2. The patient has intermittent ileus, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter and fibrillation, and altered mental status.
3. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8Â°C (100.1Â°F), blood pressure ranging from 101/51 mmHg to 178/87 mmHg, heart rate of 78 bpm with atrial fibrillation, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
4. The patient is receiving various treatments, including esmolol, digoxin, D5W infusion, and vancomycin.
5. The patient has ongoing ileus with some stool output today. Mesenteric MRA has been ordered to rule out ischemic bowel.
6. The patient's renal function shows improvement but has plateaued at a creatinine level of 2.2. Monitoring of BUN/creatinine and UOP is ongoing.
7. The patient's respiratory status is stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with reasonable arterial blood gas (ABG) values.
8. The patient's mental status remains"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual who presented with altered mental status and was found to have atrial fibrillation. They were intubated due to respiratory failure and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with signs of acute renal failure, small bowel obstruction, subdural hemorrhage, and fever of unknown origin. They have been receiving various medications, including esmolol for heart rate and blood pressure control, digoxin for cardiac function, and NG tube for ileus management. The patient's labs show elevated creatinine levels indicating renal dysfunction, as well as elevated liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal proximal small bowel distension without a clear transition point, sigmoid diverticulosis, aperistaltic small bowel, and no proximal vessel filling defects. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a heart rate ranging from 76 to 145 bpm, blood pressure between 64/43 mmHg and 101/51 mmHg, respiratory rate between 17 and 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 99%, and temperature within normal range. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,492 mL and output of 2,710 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -218 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 448 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP"

   Assessment and Plan
   68M s/p fall with EtOH onboard leading to skull fracture, SAH, SDH.
   Admission c/b intermittent ileus, acute on chronic renal failure,
   respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fib, and altered mental
   status.
   # Altered Mental status: Continues to lack purposeful interaction off
   sedation, although is opening eyes more spontaneously since two days
   ago. Traumatic brain injury may be contributing factor, but subsequent
   head scans not showing any new acute processes, other than evolving
   contusion/hematoma. Mildly hypernatremic and BUN approaching normal.
   Lumbar puncture unrevealing. Minimal response to lactulose (now
   withheld, given ongoing ileus).
   - trend BUN/creat, electrolyte abnormalities
   - avoid sedating meds
   - 24 hour EEG to be done this weekend
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Serum [Na+] 145 yesterday on D5W infusion, 146 today
   - Complete current D5W infusion
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   # Ileus: Some stool output today, abdomen mildly softer. Per GI, no
   intervention indicated at this time.
   - Mesenteric MRA today, to r/o ischemic bowel
   - NPO, c/w OG suction
   - Serial abdominal exam
   - Monitor stool output via flexiseal
   .
   # A Fib/Flutter: Loaded with Digoxin, also continues on esmolol gtt.
   Known to be difficult to rate control in past.
   - C/w daily IV Digoxin
   - Wean Esmolol gtt as tolerated
   - Add Neo for hypotensive events
   # Respiratory Failure: Respiratory status stable, with reasonable ABG
   on PSV. Known MRSA in sputum
   - Extubation trial after MRA today; if mental status inadequate
   following extubation, consider trach for better suctioning
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue with  vanco
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine improvement has plateaued at 2.2. [**Month (only) 51**] respresent new
   baseline following hypotensive episode/ATN.
   - Continue to monitor BUN/creatinine, UOP
   - Consider renal consult if BUN/creatinine start to rise again, for
   further testing or HD
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough given rapidly changing Cr
   # Rash: Was concerning for drug rash, possibly [**2-1**] cefepime, given PCN
   allergy. Cefepime has been d/c
d, rash resolved.
   # Skull fracture: Course of cipro/dexamethasone ear drops now complete
   # SAH/SDH: CT unrevealing for worsening or new fractures.
   # EtOH: Now beyond duration during which withdrawal expected. Holding
   benzos or other sedatives. Getting Thiamine/Folate.
    - SW / advice about rehabilitation when acute issues resolved
   # Diabetes: ISS; Glipizide held
   # FEN: Tube feeds turned off now. Will restart if ileus resolves.
   Alternatively will consider TPN

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male who has experienced multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Renal failure: The patient's BUN and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration of renal consult if necessary.

2. Fever of unknown origin: The patient has been experiencing fever without a known cause. Further investigation is required to identify the underlying cause.

3. Small bowel obstruction: The patient's proximal small bowel distension and absence of bowel sounds suggest the possibility of small bowel obstruction. A mesenteric MRA has been ordered to rule out ischemic bowel.

4. Subdural hematoma: The patient has a history of skull fracture with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and subdural hematoma (SDH). Ongoing monitoring for any changes in neurological status.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a known history of atrial fibrillation. Close monitoring of heart rhythm and consideration of further antiarrhythmic therapy as needed.

6. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation support due to acute respiratory failure. Weaning off esmolol and consideration of extubation trial after MRA today.

7. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient's history of EtOH use may lead to withdrawal symptoms. Close monitoring for signs of withdrawal and appropriate management.

It is important to note that these potential complications may require"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of trauma-related subdural and subarachnoid bleed. The patient has several medical conditions including acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, and ileus. The patient is intubated, awake, but unresponsive. Vital signs show elevated temperature, low blood pressure, increased heart rate, and normal respiratory rate with SpO2 at 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 113 kg to 107 kg since admission. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,492 mL and output of 2,710 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -218 mL. Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with PSV/SBT mode, FiO2 at 50%, and PEEP at 0 cmH2O. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 55 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 218. Lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and abnormal electrolyte levels. CXR shows somewhat improved bibasilar infiltrates. The patient's mental status remains unchanged with no signs of recovery, and they continue to require supportive care including EEG monitoring. Renal failure is stable, but the patient has ileus and requires NG suction with plans for TPN. Subdural hemorrhage is present,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions and complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. However, the patient has a history of renal failure, fever of unknown origin, small bowel obstruction, subdural hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, alcohol withdrawal, and has been receiving ICU care.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate of 81 bpm with an irregular rhythm consistent with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 106/55 to 178/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's weight is currently 107 kg, which is a decrease from the admission weight of 113 kg.

The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a volume control mode (PSV/SBT), set at a tidal volume of 485 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 55 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 218 mmHg, oxygen consumption (Ve) of 11.5 L/min, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 218.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,492 mL and output of 2,710 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -218 mL since the last 24 hours. The patient's urine output is 2,060 mL, NG output is 650 mL, and stool output is not mentioned. The patient has received a total of 673 mL of blood products.

The patient's laboratory results indicate several abnormalities, including a low hemoglobin level of 7.5 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.1 K/uL, elevated platelet count (Plt) of 481 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 28 mg/dL, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 2.3 mg/dL, elevated total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 30 mmHg, elevated glucose level of 189 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure, persistent fever of unknown origin, progression of small bowel obstruction, expansion of subdural hemorrhage, management of atrial fibrillation, and resolution of respiratory failure. The patient is also at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization and mechanical ventilation. Additionally, the patient's history of alcohol withdrawal may require close monitoring and appropriate treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   68M s/p fall with EtOH onboard leading to skull fracture, SAH, SDH.
   Admission c/b intermittent ileus, acute on chronic renal failure,
   respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fib, and altered mental
   status.
   # Altered Mental status: Continues to lack purposeful interaction off
   sedation, although is opening eyes more spontaneously today. Traumatic
   brain injury may be contributing factor, but subsequent head scans not
   showing any new acute processes, other than evolving
   contusion/hematoma. Mildly hypernatremic and BUN approaching normal.
   Lumbar puncture unrevealing. Minimal response to lactulose (now
   withheld, given ongoing ileus).
   - trend BUN/creat, electrolyte abnormalities
   - avoid sedating meds
   - continue D5W for hyperNa+
   - 24 hour EEG to be done over the weekend
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Serum [Na+] 146 this morning, on D5W infusion.
   - Complete current D5W infusion and monitor/trend serum sodium
   .
   # Ileus: Some stool output today, abdomen mildly softer. Per GI, no
   intervention indicated at this time. Mesenteric MRA not suggestive of
   ischemic bowel yesterday
   - NPO, c/w OG suction
 will start TPN today
   - Serial abdominal exam
   - Monitor stool output via flexiseal
   .
   # A Fib/Flutter: Loaded with Digoxin, also continues on esmolol gtt.
   Known to be difficult to rate control in past.
   - C/w daily IV Digoxin
   - Wean Esmolol gtt as tolerated
   - Add Neo for hypotensive events PRN (did not require any yesterday)
   # Respiratory Failure: Respiratory status stable, with reasonable ABG
   on PSV. Known MRSA in sputum
   - Given mental status, no plans for extubation today. If mental status
   improves over the weekend, could consider extubation but will likely be
   unable to maintain airway and clear secretions.
   - Will organize family meeting for Monday to discuss risk/benefits of
   tracheostomy placement for better suctioning
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue with  vanco
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine improvement has improved slightly, 2.1 today. [**Month (only) 51**]
   represent new baseline following hypotensive episode/ATN.
   - Continue to monitor BUN/creatinine, UOP
   - Consider renal consult if BUN/creatinine starts to rise again, for
   further testing or HD
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough given rapidly changing Cr
   # Rash: Was concerning for drug rash, possibly [**2-1**] cefepime, given PCN
   allergy. Cefepime has been d/c
d, rash resolved.
   # Skull fracture: Course of cipro/dexamethasone ear drops now complete
   # SAH/SDH: CT unrevealing for worsening or new fractures.
   # EtOH: Now beyond duration during which withdrawal expected. Holding
   benzos or other sedatives. Getting Thiamine/Folate.
    - SW / advice about rehabilitation when acute issues resolved
   # Diabetes: ISS; Glipizide held
   # FEN: Tube feeds turned off now. Will restart if ileus resolves.
   Starting TPN today.
   # Proph: Pantoprazole, pneumoboots

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with a history of trauma and multiple comorbidities. The patient has experienced several medical complications since admission.

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure indicated by elevated BUN and creatinine levels. The cause could be due to hypotensive episodes or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

2. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient has had persistent fever without any identified source. Further investigations are required to determine the cause.

3. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient has proximal small bowel distension, but no clear transition point. This suggests the possibility of small bowel obstruction. Mesenteric MRA did not reveal any ischemic bowel.

4. Subdural Hemorrhage: The patient had a subdural hemorrhage initially, but subsequent head scans have not shown any new acute processes.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation, which has been difficult to rate control in the past. He is currently loaded with digoxin and continues on esmolol.

6. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, and his respiratory status is stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV). He has known MRSA in his sputum, making extubation risky. A tracheostomy placement may be considered to better suction secretions.

   Assessment and Plan
   68M s/p fall with EtOH onboard leading to skull fracture, SAH, SDH.
   Admission c/b intermittent ileus, acute on chronic renal failure,
   respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fib, and altered mental
   status.
   # Altered Mental status: Continues to lack purposeful interaction off
   sedation, although is opening eyes more spontaneously today. Traumatic
   brain injury may be contributing factor, but subsequent head scans not
   showing any new acute processes, other than evolving
   contusion/hematoma. Mildly hypernatremic and BUN approaching normal.
   Lumbar puncture unrevealing. Minimal response to lactulose (now
   withheld, given ongoing ileus).
   - trend BUN/creat, electrolyte abnormalities
   - avoid sedating meds
   - continue D5W for hyperNa+
   - 24 hour EEG to be done over the weekend
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Serum [Na+] 146 this morning, on D5W infusion.
   - Complete current D5W infusion and monitor/trend serum sodium
   .
   # Ileus: Some stool output today, abdomen mildly softer. Per GI, no
   intervention indicated at this time. Mesenteric MRA not suggestive of
   ischemic bowel yesterday
   - NPO, c/w OG suction
 will start TPN today
   - Serial abdominal exam
   - Monitor stool output via flexiseal
   .
   # A Fib/Flutter: Loaded with Digoxin, also continues on esmolol gtt.
   Known to be difficult to rate control in past.
   - C/w daily IV Digoxin
   - Wean Esmolol gtt as tolerated
   - Add Neo for hypotensive events PRN (did not require any yesterday)
   # Respiratory Failure: Respiratory status stable, with reasonable ABG
   on PSV. Known MRSA in sputum
   - Given mental status, no plans for extubation today. If mental status
   improves over the weekend, could consider extubation but will likely be
   unable to maintain airway and clear secretions.
   - Will organize family meeting for Monday to discuss risk/benefits of
   tracheostomy placement for better suctioning
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue with  vanco
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine improvement has improved slightly, 2.1 today. [**Month (only) 51**]
   represent new baseline following hypotensive episode/ATN.
   - Continue to monitor BUN/creatinine, UOP
   - Consider renal consult if BUN/creatinine starts to rise again, for
   further testing or HD
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough given rapidly changing Cr
   # Rash: Was concerning for drug rash, possibly [**2-1**] cefepime, given PCN
   allergy. Cefepime has been d/c
d, rash resolved.
   # Skull fracture: Course of cipro/dexamethasone ear drops now complete
   # SAH/SDH: CT unrevealing for worsening or new fractures.
   # EtOH: Now beyond duration during which withdrawal expected. Holding
   benzos or other sedatives. Getting Thiamine/Folate.
    - SW / advice about rehabilitation when acute issues resolved
   # Diabetes: ISS; Glipizide held
   # FEN: Tube feeds turned off now. Will restart if ileus resolves.
   Starting TPN today.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male who experienced a fall while intoxicated, leading to a skull fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient has been admitted with intermittent ileus, acute-on-chronic renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter/fibrillation, and altered mental status. 

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient lacks purposeful interaction off sedation, although he is opening his eyes more spontaneously. Traumatic brain injury may be contributing to this, but subsequent head scans show no new acute processes other than evolving contusion/hematoma.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high serum sodium level of 146 mg/dL. He is on D5W infusion to correct the electrolyte abnormality.
3. Ileus: The patient has some stool output today, and his abdomen is mildly softer. No intervention is indicated at this time, as the mesenteric MRA does not suggest ischemic bowel.
4. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: The patient is loaded with digoxin and continues on esmolol. He is known to be difficult to rate control in the past.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable with reasonable ABG on PSV. He has known MRSA in sputum.
6. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with creatinine levels improving slightly to 2.1 today. This improvement represents a new baseline following a hypotensive episode/acute tubular necrosis.
7. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient has a fever with an unknown origin.
8. Small Bowel Obstruction: The patient has proximal small bowel distension but no clear transition point, along with sigmoid diverticulosis and aperistaltic small bowel.
9. Subdural Hematoma: The patient has a subdural hematoma but subsequent head scans show no worsening or new fractures.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal failure, development of sepsis due to unknown fever, further deterioration of mental status, progression of small bowel obstruction, and potential need for tracheostomy placement due to respiratory failure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who presented to the hospital with a skull fracture, subdural hematoma, and acute renal failure. He also has small bowel obstruction, atrial fibrillation, and altered mental status. The patient's current condition includes hypernatremia, ileus, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and the need for tracheostomy placement for better suctioning.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a concern for further deterioration of renal function. Monitoring of BUN and creatinine levels is essential, and the possibility of dialysis may be considered if necessary.
3. Small bowel obstruction: The patient has small bowel obstruction, which can lead to complications such as intestinal ischemia or perforation if not managed appropriately.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation therapy may be required to prevent such complications.
5. Subdural hematoma: Although the initial CT scan did not show any new acute processes, there is still a risk of worsening or expansion of the subdural hematoma, potentially leading to increased intracranial pressure and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted with a history of a fall while intoxicated, leading to a skull fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient's conditions include intermittent ileus, acute-on-chronic renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter, altered mental status, hypernatremia, and hypertension. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been unresponsive to weaning attempts. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38Â°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/71 mmHg to 186/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) reading of 7.39/48/99 with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 250.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has shown difficulty in weaning off the ventilator. This indicates a risk of respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient is experiencing atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. These cardiac arrhythmias can lead to complications such as heart failure, stroke, or other cardiovascular events if not managed appropriately.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute-on-chronic renal failure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, unresponsiveness, renal failure, subdural hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, respiratory failure, and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/62 mmHg to 186/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on various medications including esmolol, pantoprazole, metoprolol, and labetalol. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, high platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, low total CO2 levels, high glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's kidney function is slowly improving, ileus has improved with NG suction and TPN started, and efforts are being made to avoid anticoagulation due to the subdural hemorrhage. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with esmolol and digoxin, and plans for long-term management will be discussed with an electrophysiologist. Hypertension is being treated with labetalol, and the respiratory failure is being supported with ventilation. Pneumonia treatment includes completing a course of vancomycin. The patient's nutrition is being provided through TPN without lipids, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status and unresponsiveness. He has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including acute renal failure, subdural hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently on ventilatory support and receiving TPN (total parenteral nutrition). He also has ileus and is receiving NG suction. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 140/62 mmHg and a heart rate of 91 bpm. His oxygen saturation is at 100% on CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's lab results show elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and lactic acid, along with decreased albumin and leukocyte count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is on ventilatory support, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Infection: Due to the patient's immobility and invasive lines, there is an increased risk of developing infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) and pressure ulcers.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility increases the risk of developing DVT.
4. Renal Complications: The patient's renal function is compromised, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, alcohol withdrawal, acute renal failure, small bowel obstruction, subdural hemorrhage, and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38Â°C (100.4Â°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/62 mmHg to 186/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on multiple medications including esmolol, pantoprazole, metoprolol, and labetalol.

The patient's flow sheet data shows fluid balance with a total input of 1,529 mL and total output of 4,060 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,531 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 361 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas values indicate a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 48 mmHg, PaO2 of 250 mmHg, and HCO3- of 26 mEq/L.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 10.1 to 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 374 to 481 K/uL, creatinine level ranging from 1.9 to 2.3 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 116 to 257 mg/dL, and various other lab values within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Renal failure, acute (ARF)
2. Fever, unknown origin (FUO)
3. Small bowel obstruction (SBO)
4. Subdural hemorrhage (SDH)
5. Atrial fibrillation (AFib)
6. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
7. Alcohol withdrawal

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening renal function and potential progression to chronic kidney disease.
2. Development of sepsis due to unknown origin fever.
3. Progression of small bowel obstruction leading to bowel ischemia or perforation.
4. Expansion or worsening of subdural hemorrhage.
5. Arrhythmias related to atrial fibrillation.
6. Respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
7. Seizures or delirium tremens due to alcohol withdrawal."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of fall-related injuries, including a skull fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient was admitted with intermittent ileus, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter, altered mental status, and other comorbidities.

Over the course of the day, the patient's condition has improved with increased alertness and responsiveness. The patient is extubated and has an orogastric tube in place, confirmed by chest X-ray. The patient is receiving various medications, including esmolol, labetalol, nifedipine, pantoprazole, and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2Â°F, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/56 mmHg to 178/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's neurological status is described as more alert, with eyes open and tracking.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), as well as abnormal renal function tests including elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Electrolyte imbalances are also noted, including hypernatremia (high sodium level) and hypokalemia (low potassium level).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had acute respiratory failure initially, but the respiratory status is now stable with reasonable arterial blood gas (ABG) on pressure support ventilation (PSV). There may be a possibility of extubation today.

2. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: The patient is known to be difficult to rate control in the past and is loaded with digoxin. Esmolol infusion is continued for now. A cardiology/EP consult is planned for next steps.

3. Hypertension: Labetolol is added as needed to manage hypertension.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a serum sodium level of 146. D5W infusion is ongoing, and free water PO can be switched once bowel function returns. Serial monitoring of urine osmolality is recommended.

5. Ileus: The patient had intermittent ileus initially but is now showing improvement with good stool output. TPN is initiated, and gentle PO intake can be started.

6. Chronic Care Issues: A family meeting is organized for Monday to discuss chronic care issues.

7. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure. Close monitoring of BUN/creatinine and urine output (UOP) is necessary.

8. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient has a fever of unknown origin, and further investigation is needed.

","The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, chronic renal failure, small bowel obstruction, subdural hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, and alcohol withdrawal. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation but extubated today. He is currently on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.2Â°F (38.4Â°C), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/56 to 178/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

Laboratory results show elevated potassium levels at 4.0 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 27 mg/dL, creatinine at 1.5 mg/dL, glucose levels ranging from 116 to 227 mg/dL, and leukocyte count within normal range.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,009 mL and output of 4,435 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,426 mL. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and enteral nutrition. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show pH at 7.42, PaCO2 at 32 mmHg, and PaO2 at 210 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals the inability to assess peripheral vascular pulses, skin, neurologic status, and tone due to sedation or unconsciousness.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension, acute renal failure, fever of unknown origin, small bowel obstruction, subdural hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, acute respiratory failure, and alcohol withdrawal. 

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending further evaluation and improvement."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted with a history of fall, traumatic brain injury (TBI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient has been experiencing intermittent ileus, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation (A Fib), and altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 147/71 to 168/81 mmHg, heart rate of 110 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and creatinine levels. The patient has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is receiving heparin therapy. Other notable findings include altered mental status, intermittent low-grade fevers, and a history of MRSA pneumonia.

Plan:
The patient's plan includes continuing with tube feeds, monitoring for any signs of neurologic changes or worsening of DVT, maintaining glycemic control, and adjusting medications accordingly. The patient will be discussed in a family meeting to address chronic care issues and rehabilitation options."

   Assessment and Plan
   68M s/p fall with EtOH onboard leading to skull fracture, SAH, SDH.
   Admission c/b intermittent ileus, acute on chronic renal failure,
   respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fib, and altered mental
   status.
   # Altered Mental status: Seemed more alert on Monday
 much less
   interactive yesterday. Would open eyes and say
 only. EEG showed
   slow encephalopathy, no seizures. Repeat CT head showed no acute
   intracranial processes (hemorrhage, herniation, ischemia). ABGs showed
   respiratory alkalosis, ? due to CNS injury. Patient does have a
   tendency to wax and wane.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Work with PT as much as possible
   - Maintain sleep/wake cycle, manage symptoms (pain etc) to minimize ICU
   delirium
   .
   # Pain: Grimacing in pain yesterday, ?due to left arm. Left
   forearm/elbow films unrevealing. Lipase 100.
   - NPO now for bowel rest and re-evaluate later today
   - Pain control with low-dose IV dilaudid PRN
   - Continue bowel regimen in setting of resolving ileus to prevent
   worsening on narcotic pain medications
   - Given effusion in elbow region, will hold on ultrasound for DVT for
   now. Consult rheum for possible tap of fluid. Will hold on heparin gtt
   for now
   .
   # DVT: Right lower extremity
   - Continue heparin gtt with lower goal PTT 60-80 in setting of ICH
   - Repeat ECHO per Cardiology recommendations given change in
   pericardial effusion quality possibly concerning for bleeding into
   pericardium
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Serum [Na+] 146
 144. Essentially resolved.
   -  Continue with free water PO flushes
   # A Fib/Flutter: Appreciate Cardiology recommendations. Discontinued
   Digoxin, Esmolol gtt off X2 days now. Of note, heart rate improved with
   Tylenol for pain.
   - Continue Labetalol 800mg TID
   - Continue to hold Sotalol in setting of recent INR reversal and risk
   of thromboembolic event with cardioversion on Sotalol
   Loaded with Digoxin, also continues on esmolol gtt.  Known to be
   difficult to rate control in past.
   # Ileus: Good stool output, ileus resolving. Just written for tubefeeds
   but can start to take occasional gentle PO
   - NPO for now given elevated lipase
   - Serial abdominal exam
   # Hypertension:
   - Continue Labetalol PO TID and will consider adding Captopril today
   given poor blood pressure control yesterday (although did not receive
   full 800mg TID until midnight)
   - Control pain
   # Respiratory Failure: Respiratory status stable, with reasonable ABGs
   (respiratory alkalosis) - now extubated. ABGs continue to [**Location (un) 988**] PO2
   although pulse ox showing good saturation.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue with  vanco, day 13/14
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine stable at 1.5, had been steadily/gradually improving.
   Likely new baseline
   - Continue to monitor BUN/creatinine, UOP
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough
   # Skull fracture: Course of cipro/dexamethasone ear drops now complete
   # SAH/SDH: CT unrevealing for worsening or new fractures.
   # EtOH: Now beyond duration during which withdrawal expected. Holding
   benzos or other sedatives. Getting Thiamine/Folate.
    - SW / advice about rehabilitation when acute issues resolved
   # Diabetes: ISS; Glipizide held
 will likely need to tighten sliding
   scale once back on Tube Feeds
   # FEN: NPO for now. Will reassess for TPN vs. reinitiation of Tube
   Feeds today
   # Proph: Pantoprazole, heparin gtt
   # Access: PICC, right radial line

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and subdural hemorrhage. He was admitted to the ICU with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 due to a fall and subsequent head injury. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hyperglycemia, fever of unknown origin (FUO), and an evolving frontal contusion. The patient's condition remains unchanged since admission. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if there are any complications related to mechanical ventilation or if the underlying cause of the failure is not appropriately managed.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if fluid balance is not maintained or if there is inadequate management of the underlying cause.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's lower extremity edema and immobilization in the ICU increase the risk of developing DVT. Proper prophylaxis measures should be implemented to prevent clot formation.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels need to be controlled to prevent further complications such as infections or worsening of existing conditions.
5. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fever requires further investigation to identify the"

   Assessment and Plan
   68M s/p fall with EtOH onboard leading to skull fracture, SAH, SDH.
   Admission c/b intermittent ileus, acute on chronic renal failure,
   respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fib, and altered mental
   status.
   # Altered Mental status: Seemed more alert on Monday
 much less
   interactive yesterday. Would open eyes and say
 only. EEG showed
   slow encephalopathy, no seizures. Repeat CT head showed no acute
   intracranial processes (hemorrhage, herniation, ischemia). ABGs showed
   respiratory alkalosis, ? due to CNS injury. Patient does have a
   tendency to wax and wane.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Work with PT as much as possible
   - Maintain sleep/wake cycle, manage symptoms (pain etc) to minimize ICU
   delirium
   .
   # Pain: Grimacing in pain yesterday, initially thought due to left arm.
   Left forearm/elbow films unrevealing. Lipase 100.
   - NPO now for bowel rest
   - Pain control with low-dose IV dilaudid PRN
   - Continue bowel regimen in setting of resolving ileus to prevent
   worsening on narcotic pain medications
   .
   # DVT: Right lower extremity
   - Continue heparin gtt with lower goal PTT 60-80 in setting of ICH
   - Repeat ECHO per Cardiology recommendations given change in
   pericardial effusion quality possibly concerning for bleeding into
   pericardium
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Serum [Na+] 146
 144. Essentially resolved.
   -  Continue with free water PO and flushes with tube feeds
   # A Fib/Flutter: Appreciate Cardiology recommendations. Discontinued
   Digoxin, Esmolol gtt off X2 days now.
   - Continue Labetalol 800mg TID
   - Continue to hold Sotalol in setting of recent INR reversal and risk
   of thromboembolic event with cardioversion on Sotalol
   Loaded with Digoxin, also continues on esmolol gtt.  Known to be
   difficult to rate control in past.
   # Ileus: Good stool output, ileus resolving. Just written for tubefeeds
   but can start to take occasional gentle PO
   - NPO for now given elevated lipase
   - Serial abdominal exam
   # Hypertension:
   - Continue Labetalol PO TID and will consider adding Captopril today
   given poor blood pressure control yesterday (although did not receive
   full 800mg TID until midnight)
   - Control pain
   # Respiratory Failure: Respiratory status stable, with reasonable ABGs
   (respiratory alkalosis) - now extubated. ABGs continue to [**Location (un) 988**] PO2
   although pulse ox showing good saturation?
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue with  vanco, day 13/14
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine stable at 1.5, had been steadily/gradually improving
   - Continue to monitor BUN/creatinine, UOP
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough
   # Skull fracture: Course of cipro/dexamethasone ear drops now complete
   # SAH/SDH: CT unrevealing for worsening or new fractures.
   # EtOH: Now beyond duration during which withdrawal expected. Holding
   benzos or other sedatives. Getting Thiamine/Folate.
    - SW / advice about rehabilitation when acute issues resolved
   # Diabetes: ISS; Glipizide held
   # FEN: NPO for now. Will reassess for TPN vs. reinitiation of Tube
   Feeds today

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of fall, ethanol abuse, and subsequent skull fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient was admitted with intermittent ileus, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation, and altered mental status. He is currently in the ICU and has been extubated.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of increased alertness and interaction, but mostly showing signs of confusion and disorientation.
2. Pain: The patient was grimacing in pain, which was initially thought to be due to a left arm issue. However, X-rays of the left forearm and elbow did not reveal any acute fractures. The lipase level is elevated, indicating a possible pancreatic involvement.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has right lower extremity edema and an elevated D-dimer, suggesting a possible DVT. Heparin has been started to prevent further clot formation.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium level is elevated, but it has improved from previous levels. Free water administration and flushing with tube feeds are being continued to manage this condition.
5. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: The patient's heart rhythm remains unstable, with ongoing episodes of atrial fibrillation"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. The key points and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is not ARDS. This indicates that the patient's lungs are not functioning properly, leading to inadequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination.

2. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase the risk of blood clots and other complications.

3. Anemia: The patient has anemia, although the specific type is not mentioned. Anemia can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, indicating hyperglycemia. This can be a sign of poor glycemic control and may require insulin therapy.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a lower extremity DVT, which is a blood clot in one of the deep veins of the leg. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.

6. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. This means that the kidneys are not functioning properly and may require dialysis.

7. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has an unexplained fever, which can be a sign of an underlying"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old overweight/obese male with a chief complaint of fever, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has a history of gout, alcohol abuse, and other medical conditions. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for acute renal failure, DVT, hyperglycemia, and other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory support indicates potential acute respiratory failure. It is important to monitor oxygen saturation levels and respiratory function closely.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and unknown origin of fever suggest the possibility of sepsis. Monitoring vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature, is crucial. Culturing blood and urine can help identify the source of infection.

3. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The presence of lower extremity edema and the diagnosis of DVT indicate a potential risk for pulmonary embolism. Regular assessment of leg circulation and monitoring for signs of a pulmonary embolism are essential.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury. Monitoring kidney function and ensuring appropriate fluid management are vital.

5. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications.

6. Gout: The patient's history of gout and the presence of birefr"

   Assessment and Plan
   68M s/p fall with EtOH onboard leading to skull fracture, SAH, SDH.
   Admission c/b intermittent ileus, acute on chronic renal failure,
   respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fib, and altered mental
   status.
   # Altered Mental status: Significantly improved today, conversant.
   Seemed more alert on Monday
 much less interactive yesterday. Would
   open eyes and say
 only. EEG showed slow encephalopathy, no
   seizures. Repeat CT head showed no acute intracranial processes
   (hemorrhage, herniation, ischemia). ABGs showed respiratory alkalosis,
   ? due to CNS injury. Patient does have a tendency to wax and wane.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Work with PT as much as possible
   - Maintain sleep/wake cycle, manage symptoms (pain etc) to minimize ICU
   delirium
   .
   # Gout: Grimacing in pain yesterday due to left arm. Left forearm/elbow
   films unrevealing but aspirate confirmed gout. Lipase 100.
   - Continue Prednisone 60mg for two more days
   - Given lack of localizing symptoms to the abdomen, patient will do a
   swallow trial today and start PO diet if he passes. Otherwise, will
   resume tube feed
   - Pain control with low-dose IV dilaudid PRN
   - Continue bowel regimen in setting of resolving ileus to prevent
   worsening on narcotic pain medications
   .
   # DVT: Right lower extremity
   - Continue heparin gtt with lower goal PTT 60-80 in setting of ICH;
   will start Coumadin today with low INR goal of 2.0
   - Repeat ECHO per Cardiology recommendations given change in
   pericardial effusion quality possibly concerning for bleeding into
   pericardium
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Serum [Na+] 146
 145. Essentially resolved.
   -  Continue with free water PO flushes
   # A Fib/Flutter: Appreciate Cardiology recommendations. Discontinued
   Digoxin, Esmolol gtt off X2 days now. Of note, heart rate improved with
   Tylenol for pain. Loaded with Digoxin, also continues on esmolol gtt.
   Known to be difficult to rate control in past.
   - Continue Labetalol 800mg TID
   - Continue to hold Sotalol in setting of recent INR reversal and risk
   of thromboembolic event with cardioversion on Sotalol
   # Ileus: Good stool output, ileus resolving. Will resume diet if passes
   swallow study today. Otherwise, resume tube feeds per above
   - Serial abdominal exam
   # Hypertension:
   - Continue Labetalol PO TID and will consider adding Lisinopril today
   given poor blood pressure control yesterday (although did not receive
   full 800mg TID until midnight)
   - Control pain from gout
   # Respiratory Failure: Respiratory status stable, with reasonable ABGs
   (respiratory alkalosis) - now extubated. ABGs continue to [**Location (un) 988**] PO2
   although pulse ox showing good saturation.
   - Continue albuterol and ipratropium
   - Continue with  vanco, day 14/14
   # [**Last Name (un) **]: Creatinine stable at 1.5, had been steadily/gradually improving.
   Likely new baseline
   - Continue to monitor BUN/creatinine, UOP
   - Dose Vancomycin by trough
   # Skull fracture: Course of cipro/dexamethasone ear drops now complete
   # SAH/SDH: CT unrevealing for worsening or new fractures.
   # EtOH: Now beyond duration during which withdrawal expected. Holding
   benzos or other sedatives. Getting Thiamine/Folate.
    - SW / advice about rehabilitation when acute issues resolved
   # Diabetes: ISS; Glipizide held
 will likely need to tighten sliding
   scale once back on Tube Feeds
   # FEN: NPO for now. Will reassess for TPN vs. reinitiation of Tube
   Feeds today

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions. These conditions include acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation, and altered mental status. The patient also has a history of skull fracture, subdural hemorrhage, alcohol abuse, hypertension, gout, diabetes, and deep vein thrombosis.

During the ICU stay, the patient has shown improvement in some areas. The altered mental status has significantly improved, and the patient is conversant. The respiratory status is stable, and the patient has been successfully extubated. The ileus is resolving, and the patient is expected to resume a regular diet soon.

However, there are still several ongoing issues that need to be addressed. The patient continues to have atrial fibrillation, and there are concerns about controlling his heart rate. He also has persistent fever of unknown origin, which needs further investigation. The patient's renal function is stable but will require ongoing monitoring. The blood pressure remains poorly controlled, and additional medications may be necessary. There is also a concern for potential complications related to his gout, such as further joint damage or infection.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, infection (such as sepsis), deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, gastrointestinal bleeding, and further neurological deterioration."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who presented with a history of EtOH use, resulting in a skull fracture, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient also had intermittent ileus, acute-on-chronic renal failure, respiratory distress, atrial flutter, altered mental status, and gout. 

Medical Complications:
1. Gout: The patient experienced pain in the left arm, and there was an effusion in the elbow region. Lipase levels were elevated, suggesting possible pancreatitis. The patient is currently NPO for bowel rest and re-evaluation, pain control with low-dose IV dilaudid PRN, and will hold on heparin gtt for now. A consultation with rheum for possible tap of fluid is planned.
2. DVT: The patient has a right lower extremity DVT. Heparin gtt will continue with a lower goal PTT of 60-80 in the setting of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). A repeat ECHO per Cardiology recommendations is needed due to the change in pericardial effusion quality, possibly concerning for bleeding into the pericardium.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium level was elevated at 146, but it has essentially resolved. Free water PO flushes will be continued.
4. Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter:"
