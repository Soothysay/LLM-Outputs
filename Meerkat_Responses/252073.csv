   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation for pulselessness.
   .
   # Cardiopulmonary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Now s/p intubation with resolution
   in hypercarbia, no evidence of hypoxia.  Likely etiology is mucus plug
   and pulmonary edema as above, leading to CPA. Given 40mg IV lasix with
   mild increase in urine output but significant improvement on lung exam.
   Today will work on wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - continue on AC and wean FIO2 as tolerated
   - follow ABGs, lactate
   - f/u CXR
   - suction, nebs prn
   .
   # HAP Aspiration PNA: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 10 of ABX, but
   given poor clinical response will continue for additional 4 days
   - f/u pending cultures
   - consider bronchoscopy
   - repeat sputum and blood cultures
   .
   # Urosepsis: E.coli bacteremia, and E.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on appropriate abx since [**8-24**],
   will plan for 2 week course from this date.
   - continue amikacin, f/u send out level
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6. Had been
   >2 on initial presentation and was improving prior to arrest.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to episode of hypoprofusion.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   .
   # Hypertension:  Pt with hypotensive episode initially, held
   metoprolol.
   - restart metoprolol as tolerated
   .
   # Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative medications
   - continue namenda and aricept
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, monitor electrolytes, NGT in place so will start
   tube feeds this am
   .
   # Prophylaxis: SC heparin, bowel regimen, PPI

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension. She was admitted to the medical floor after a recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and right lower lobe (RLL) aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient presented from the medical floor after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for pulselessness. She was found pulseless, ashen, and cool, suggesting a prolonged period without perfusion. The patient quickly regained rhythm after intubation and 1 gm epinephrine with CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most likely etiology respiratory arrest with mucous plug. The patient was treated for underlying cause of PNA, provided respiratory support with ventilation, and monitored on telemetry.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Cardiopulmonary Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest due to respiratory failure with a mucous plug and pulmonary edema. The underlying cause of the PNA is being treated, and respiratory support with ventilation is being provided.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient had hypercarbic respiratory failure, which resolved after intubation. The likely etiology is a mucus plug and pulmonary edema. The patient received 40 mg IV lasix, with mild improvement in urine output and significant improvement on lung"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation for pulselessness.
   .
   # Cardiopulmonary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Now s/p intubation with resolution
   in hypercarbia, no evidence of hypoxia.  Likely etiology is mucus plug
   and pulmonary edema as above, leading to CPA. Given 40mg IV lasix with
   mild increase in urine output but significant improvement on lung exam.
   Today will work on wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - continue on AC and wean FIO2 as tolerated
   - follow ABGs, lactate

   # HAP Aspiration PNA: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 10 of ABX, but
   given poor clinical response will continue for additional 4 days
   - f/u pending cultures
   - consider bronchoscopy
   - repeat sputum and blood cultures
   .
   # Urosepsis: E.coli bacteremia, and E.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on appropriate abx since [**8-24**],
   will plan for 2 week course from this date.
   - continue amikacin, f/u send out level
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6. Had been
   >2 on initial presentation and was improving prior to arrest.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to episode of hypoprofusion.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension. She was admitted to the medical floor after experiencing cardiopulmonary arrest. She has had multiple ICU stays for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and right lower lobe aspiration pneumonia (RLA PNA). On this current admission, the patient presented with pulselessness and was found to be bradycardic. She was intubated and received epinephrine during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 

The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia (HAP), acute kidney failure, urosepsis, hypertension, dementia, and fecal incontinence (FEN). She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for her infections, including E.coli bacteremia and UTI. She is also being treated for pulmonary edema with IV lasix and is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening pulmonary edema: The patient's underlying RLL infiltrate and the presence of pulmonary edema could lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or cardiac complications due to fluid overload.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Being intubated and on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Regular monitoring and appropriate care should be taken to prevent"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation for pulselessness.
   .
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Now s/p intubation with resolution
   in hypercarbia, no evidence of hypoxia.  Likely etiology is mucus plug
   and pulmonary edema as above, leading to CPA. Given 40mg IV lasix with
   mild increase in urine output but significant improvement on lung exam.
   Today will work on wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - continue on AC and wean FIO2 as tolerated
   - follow ABGs, lactate
   - f/u CXR
   .
   # HAP Aspiration PNA: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 10 of ABX, but
   given poor clinical response will continue for additional 4 days
   - consider reeval w/ bronchoscopy
   - repeat sputum cultures
   - follow blood cultures
   .
   # Urosepsis: W. e.coli bacteremia, and e.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on appropriate abx since [**8-24**],
   will plan for 2 week course from this date.
   - continue amikacin, f/u send out level
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6. Had been
   >2 on initial presentation and was improving prior to arrest.  Likely
   prerenal in etiology secondary to episode of hypoprofusion.
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output
   - trend creatinine
   .
   # Hypertension:  Pt with hypotensive episode initially, held
   metoprolol.
   - restart metoprolol as tolerated
   .
   # Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative medications
   - continue namenda and aricept

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and right lower lobe (RLL) aspiration pneumonia. The patient presented from the medical floor after cardiopulmonary resuscitation for pulselessness.

The patient experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) and was found pulseless, ashen, and cool. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation and administration of 1gm epinephrine with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The likely etiology of the CPA was respiratory arrest due to a mucus plug and pulmonary edema.

The patient is currently being treated for hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has resolved since intubation. The likely cause is also a mucus plug and pulmonary edema. The patient received 40mg IV Lasix with mild increase in urine output but significant improvement in lung exam.

The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) aspiration pneumonia, and cultures have shown persistent RLL infiltrate. She has been on broad-spectrum coverage since admission. It is planned to continue vancomycin, levofloxacin, and Flagyl for an additional 4 days. Reevaluation with bronchoscopy and repeat sputum cultures are recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo female with h/o breast CA with recent MICU admission and
   prolonged respiratory failure.  She was transferred to medical floor
   extubated.  Now patient found pulseless and apneic and had intubation
   and initial rhythm junctional and had rapid response to ACLS protocol.
   Upon intubation patient had minimal secretions and minimal evidence of
   bronchospasm.  Intubation was completed without sedation required.
   This was fundamentally a hypercarbic respiratory arrest based upon ABG
   but antecedent history is hard to define as patient was found apneic
   and pulseless.  She does have antecedent fever, rising WBC count and
   bandemia on CBC.  Is likely respiratory related arrest with rapid
   return to circulation with intubation and only single dose of EPI.  [**Month (only) 60**]
   well be mucus plug and hypoxemic respiratory failure.  She has ongoing
   findings consistent with persistent peumonia and pneumonitis in the RML
   and RLL distribution.
   1)Acute Respiratory Failure-Do not see clear new overwhelming insult
   and ventilatory mechanics are reassuring
   -Pneumonia-
   Vanco/Levo/Flagyl x10 days is completed, continue for 2 week course
   total
   Will need to continue to follow CT scan to clearance of region because
   it is not completely typical for acute pneumonia in persistence
   -Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure-
   Change to PSV and attempt to wean
   Goal PCO2=40-45
   If ongoing aggressive measures are desired she will need trach to
   continue safe and effective care
   1.5)Altered Mental Status-
   -Continue Namenda/Aricept
   -Repeat neuro exam
   2)Leukocytosis-
   -Will check C. Diff
   -Continue to Rx pulmonary source for 4 days
   -Providencia has been treated with Amikacin
   -F/U Blood cultures
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Assure hydration

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer who was admitted to the medical ICU for respiratory failure. She has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in her condition. However, she experienced an episode of pulselessness and apnea, known as a respiratory arrest, which responded well to ACLS protocol.

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, hypercarbic respiratory failure, altered mental status, leukocytosis, and acute renal failure. The immediate medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, worsening pneumonia, persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure, worsening altered mental status, ongoing leukocytosis, and potential exacerbation of acute renal failure.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and appropriate management in the ICU setting. It is important to address each of these conditions promptly to prevent further deterioration in the patient's health status."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - no troponins were drawn, so unclear if primary process is cardiac,
   however CK-MBs were flat so unlikely that acute ischemic event
   - continue to trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Now s/p intubation with resolution
   in hypercarbia, no evidence of hypoxia.  Will wean oxygen as tolerated.
   Likely secondary to cardiopulonary arrest.
   - intubated, currently on pressure support of [**9-9**]. last rsbi > 100, so
   unlikely ready for extubation today, will continue to monitor
   -          will plan to wean fi02 today to 40% (from 50%)
   -          weak cough, no gag
   -          also suspect that extrapulmonary source of respiratory
   stable
   .
   # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 10 of ABX, but
   given poor clinical response will continue for additional 4 days
 - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. She presented to the ICU with pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and sepsis. She was previously admitted to the medical floor and then transferred back to the ICU after experiencing an episode of unresponsiveness and pulselessness.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. She has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), aspiration pneumonia, and sepsis. Her recent chest x-ray shows an endotracheal tube tip that may be 8 mm above the carina. She has a right PICC line in good position and a nasogastric tube in the stomach.

The patient's mental status has worsened since the last transfer, 48 hours after the event. She experienced cardiopulmonary arrest and was successfully resuscitated with epinephrine and CPR. The underlying cause of the arrest is believed to be worsening pulmonary edema due to the right lower lobe infiltrate, possibly with a mucous plug causing respiratory arrest.

She also has hypercarbic respiratory failure, which has improved since intubation. There is no evidence of hypoxia, and oxygen will be weaned to 40% today. She has weak cough and gag reflexes.

The patient has a history of urosepsis caused by extended-spectrum beta"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - no troponins were drawn, so unclear if primary process is cardiac,
   however CK-MBs were flat so unlikely that acute ischemic event
   - continue to trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Now s/p intubation with resolution
   in hypercarbia, no evidence of hypoxia.  Will wean oxygen as tolerated.
   Likely secondary to cardiopulonary arrest.
   - intubated, currently on pressure support of [**9-9**]. last rsbi > 100, so
   unlikely ready for extubation today, will continue to monitor
   -          will plan to wean fi02 today to 40% (from 50%)
   -          weak cough, no gag
   -          also suspect that extrapulmonary source of respiratory
   stable
   .
   # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 10 of ABX, but
   given poor clinical response will continue for additional 4 days
 - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and right lower lobe (RLL) aspiration pneumonia (PNA). The patient had a cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. 

The patient's current conditions include cardiopulmonary arrest, hypercarbic respiratory failure, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/aspiration PNA/sepsis, acute kidney failure, hypertension, dementia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). 

For the cardiopulmonary arrest, the patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. The plan is to wean FiO2 to 40% and continue monitoring. 

The hypercarbic respiratory failure has been resolved with intubation, and the patient is currently on pressure support ventilation. The plan is to continue monitoring and weaning FiO2 as tolerated. 

For the HAP/aspiration PNA/sepsis, the patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics since admission. The sputum gram stain shows gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, suggesting a possible Staphylococcus aureus infection. The preliminary respiratory culture is negative. The blood culture from 08/17 shows E.coli, which is now sensitive to most antibiotics except for ciproflox"

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. She presented to the ICU with pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and sepsis. The patient experienced an episode of unresponsiveness/pulselessness and was successfully resuscitated after cardiopulmonary arrest.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 146/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient's recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 22.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 26.8%, platelet count (Plt) of 583 K/uL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, lactate level of 4.6 mmol/L, and elevated troponin-T level of 0.14 ng/mL.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Cardiopulmonary Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest, most likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient was successfully resuscitated and intubated.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo female now with recurrent respiratory failure while being cared
   for on the medical floor.  She had subsequent PEA arrest and successful
   resuscitation with intubation.  The concerning issue is that the
   primary insult is likely recurrent aspiration in the setting of
   incapacity to protect her airway in the setting of what is likley
   background levels of secretions and persistenly impaired mental
   status.  We have not identified a new fully reversible insult and would
   expect her to remain at risk for acute respiratory failure going
   forward.
   1)Respiratory Failure Acute-
   -Will keep fluid balance negative
   -Avoid sedating medications
   -Persistent secretions noted with frequent suctioning
   -Will continue with antibiotics--Amikacin/Flagyl/Levofloxacin/Vanco
   -Barriers to extubation are primarily impaired mental status which has
   worsened following arrest event with persistent dense impairment of
   sensorium.  This is in addition to her pulmonary secretions.
   -Will need to clarify goals of care with family prior to extubation
   attempt.
   2)Anemia-Does have an acute change and will need to
   -OB stool
   -Repeat HCT today

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with recurrent respiratory failure who was intubated after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She has a history of impaired mental status, which makes it difficult for her to protect her airway. The main concern is recurrent aspiration due to her inability to protect her airway in the setting of background secretions and persistently impaired mental status. She has been on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 50%, and PEEP 5 cmH2O. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains at risk for acute respiratory failure. She also has anemia with a recent change and will need further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent respiratory failure is a significant concern. She may continue to be at risk for acute respiratory failure due to impaired mental status and potential aspiration.
2. Anemia: The patient has an acute change in anemia, which requires further evaluation. This could be related to blood loss, decreased production, or increased destruction of red blood cells.
3. Infection: The patient is on multiple antibiotics, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy accordingly is important.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prophylactic measures have been initiated to prevent DVT, as immobility and critical illness are risk factors.
5. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - no troponins were drawn, so unclear if primary process is cardiac,
   however CK-MBs were flat so unlikely that acute ischemic event
   - continue to trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Overnight with significant secretions needing frequent
   suctioning. Will continue to wean as tolerated to PS although not ready
   for extubation. Will discuss goals of care with niece this morning
   (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   -          Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS
   -          weak cough, no gag per RT
   .
   # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 10 of ABX, but
   given poor clinical response will continue for additional 4 days
 - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
      >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND

   - suspect that some of renal failure is likely due to poor forward flow
   and patient looks volume overloaded by physical exam

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension, and recent ICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL aspiration PNA. The patient presented from the medical floor after likely PEA arrest and now has worsening mental status 48 hours after the event.

The patient was found pulseless, ashen, and cool, down for no longer than 10 minutes. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation and 1gm epinephrine with CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most likely etiology respiratory arrest with mucous plug. No further events since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea while on PS.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Cardiopulmonary arrest: The patient experienced a likely PEA arrest, which was successfully resuscitated. The underlying cause of the arrest could be worsening pulmonary edema due to aspiration pneumonia (PNA) or respiratory failure.
2. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to a pulmonary etiology such as mucus plugging and apneic periods. She requires continued respiratory support with a ventilator.
3. HAP/Aspiration PNA/Sepsis: The patient has persistent right lower lobe infiltrate on"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - continue to trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   -CT head to evaluate for any acute insults that may be causing her
   apneic periods
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Overnight with significant secretions needing frequent
   suctioning. Will continue to wean as tolerated to PS although not ready
   for extubation. Will discuss goals of care with niece this morning
   (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   -          Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS
   -          weak cough, no gag per RT
   -          suction prn, nebs prn
   -          -d/w family re: trach
   .
   # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for suspected pulmonary embolism arrest and now presents with worsening mental status. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation due to episodes of apnea. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), aspiration pneumonia (AP), and sepsis. The patient's blood cultures have grown E.coli and GPC pairs/clusters in sputum. A CT scan showed persistent right lower lobe infiltrate. The patient's renal function has declined with an increase in creatinine from 0.6 to 1.1, and she is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She also has hypertension and dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory support may be insufficient, leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
2. HAP/Aspiration PNA/Sepsis: The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is a risk of antibiotic resistance or treatment failure due to ongoing infection.
3. Acute Kidney Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened, indicating a possible progression towards acute kidney failure.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications related"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - continue to trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   -CT head to evaluate for any acute insults that may be causing her
   apneic periods
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Overnight with significant secretions needing frequent
   suctioning. Will continue to wean as tolerated to PS although not ready
   for extubation. Will discuss goals of care with niece this morning
   (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   -          Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS
   -          weak cough, no gag per RT
   -          suction prn, nebs prn
   -          -d/w family re: trach
   .
   # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl, patient currently on day 11 of ABX, (3
   more days)
 - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU for suspected PEA arrest, which was successfully treated. She also has a history of E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has shown improvement in her mental status but still experiences episodes of apnea. The patient has developed acute kidney failure, likely due to prerenal causes, and is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). Her blood cultures have grown GPC pairs/clusters and E.coli in blood and urine. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and will continue for another three days. The patient's recent labs show an elevated white blood cell count with bands, elevated lactate levels, and mild hypokalemia. The patient's medical team is considering tracheostomy placement and plans to discuss this with her niece in the morning. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening pulmonary edema: The patient has underlying RLL infiltrate and recent worsening of pulmonary edema on the floor. This could lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications like pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Mucus plugging: The patient's episodes of apnea may be due to mucus plugging, which can compromise airway patency and"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - no troponins were drawn, so unclear if primary process is cardiac,
   however CK-MBs were flat so unlikely that acute ischemic event
   - continue to trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Overnight with significant secretions needing frequent
   suctioning. Will continue to wean as tolerated to PS although not ready
   for extubation. Will discuss goals of care with niece this morning
   (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   -          Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS
   -          weak cough, no gag per RT

   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension, and recent ICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and right lower lobe aspiration pneumonia. She was transferred from the medical floor after a likely pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and presents with worsening mental status. The patient has been intubated twice and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a protected spontaneous breathing trial (PS). She has persistent right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, new bands on the differential count, and positive gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters on sputum gram stain. She also has positive E.coli in blood and urine cultures. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics since admission, which include levofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole, and amikacin. Her creatinine has risen from a baseline of 0.6 to 1.1, indicating acute kidney failure, likely due to prerenal causes secondary to hypoperfusion. She has hypertension and dementia, and her sister will decide on tracheostomy in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HAP/Aspiration PNA/Sepsis: The patient has persistent right lower lobe infiltrate and positive gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters on sputum gram stain, indicating a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or aspiration pneumonia. She also has E"

   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Vanco/Levoflox/Flagyl
   -Continue with PSV support
   -Patient with continued oral secretions and incapacity to maintain gag
   reflex to prevent ongoing large volume of aspiration
   -Mental status remains primary barrier to extubation
   -Will need to consider goals of care prior to decision to extubate as

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
","The patient is an 82-year-old female with recurrent acute respiratory failure, persistent dementia, and secretions. She is currently unable to maintain a patent airway and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient's mental status has shown limited improvement, making extubation challenging. She also has increased opacities in the right lung's basal segments on imaging.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent acute respiratory failure indicates a high risk for continued respiratory distress and potential deterioration.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: Given the patient's inability to maintain a patent airway and ongoing large volume of aspiration, there is a risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at an increased risk for developing VAP.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing DVT.
5. Stress Ulcers: Prolonged ICU stay and critical illness increase the risk of stress ulcers.
6. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and dense impaired sensorium may progress to delirium, which can complicate the overall clinical picture.
7. Infection: The presence of recurrent fevers suggests a potential underlying infection, which needs to be identified and treated promptly.
8. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   -CT head to evaluate for any acute insults that may be causing her
   apneic periods - CT head done no official read uet
   .
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Started on scopolamine patch yesterday for secretions. still
   requiring frequent suctioning. Currently tachypneic and likely not
   candidate for extubation today. Will discuss goals of care with niece
   this morning (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   - outline goals of care
   - Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS as tolerate
   -  weak cough, no gag per RT
   - suction prn, nebs prn
    # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl patient currently on day 12 of ABX, (2 more
   days)
   - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
         >25 PMNs and <10 epithelial cells/100X field.
         1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI IN PAIRS AND
         CLUSTERS.
      RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.

   # Urosepsis: E.coli bacteremia, and e.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on amikacin, last day [**9-2**].
   - amikacin levels from [**8-24**] are still pending
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6 currently
   1.0 appears to be improving with some diuresis.  likely relative
   hypoperfusion.
   - suspect that some of renal failure is likely due to poor forward flow
   and patient looks volume overloaded by physical exam
   -          trend creatinine
   -  goal I/O is negative 1 liter per day, would give lasix as needed to
   achieve this (40 IV yesterday => -500 cc)
   - will start with 40 IV lasix this morning and then check afternoon
   # Hypertension: On lisinopril, metoprolol  as outpatient
   - increase lisinopril todya
   - lasix 40mg IV qd, monitor UOP
   - metoprolol 100 mg PO TID
   .
   # Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative medications.
   Concern for possible cerebral ischemic insult during her PEA arrest
   that may be causing her apnea.
   -          continue namenda and aricept
   -          -CT head as above
   - history of CVA - for secondary stroke prevention should be on aspirin
   and statin; currently on neither one will start statin today, listed as
   having aspirin allergy of unknown type in the chart, however on
   previous admissions appears to have taken it so will consider
   restarting it, although utility at this point given mental status
   likely low

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, and recent ICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and right lower lobe aspiration pneumonia. She presents from the medical floor after a likely pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is now with worsening mental status. The patient has been intubated twice and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiopulmonary Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, likely due to respiratory causes such as aspiration of mucus plugs. She was successfully resuscitated with intubation and epinephrine administration.
2. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypercarbia, which may lead to respiratory arrest due to pulmonary etiology, such as mucus plugging and apneic periods. She is being treated with a scopolamine patch to decrease secretions and frequent suctioning.
3. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP)/Aspiration Pneumonia (AP)/Sepsis: The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics since admission and has shown growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters in sputum culture. She also has E.coli bacteremia and urinary tract infection (UTI).
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have increased from a baseline"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Cardiopulmomary Arrest: Patient found pulseless, ashen, and cool,
   down for no longer than 10 minutes. Patient not monitored on telemetry
   at the time of the event. She quickly regained rhythm after intubation
   and 1gm epinephrine w/ CPR. In the setting of underlying RLL
   infiltrate, concern for worsening pulmonary edema on the floor, most
   likely etiology respiratory arrest w/ mucous plug. No further events
   since admission to ICU, although continues to have episodes of apnea
   while on PS.
   - treat underlying cause of PNA, provide respiratory support with
   ventilator for now
   - trend lactate
   - monitor on telemetry, patient appears to be hemodynamically stable
   -CT head to evaluate for any acute insults that may be causing her
   apneic periods - CT head done no official read uet
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Started on scopolamine patch yesterday for secretions. still
   requiring frequent suctioning. Currently tachypneic and likely not
   candidate for extubation today. Will discuss goals of care with niece
   this morning (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   - outline goals of care
   - Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS as tolerate
   -  weak cough, no gag per RT
   - suction prn, nebs prn
    # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl patient currently on day 12 of ABX, (2 more
   days)

   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6 currently

   and patient looks volume overloaded by physical exam
   -          trend creatinine
   -  goal I/O is negative 1 liter per day, would give lasix as needed to
   achieve this (40 IV yesterday => -500 cc)
   - will start with 40 IV lasix this morning and then check afternoon
   # Hypertension: On lisinopril, metoprolol  as outpatient
   - increase lisinopril todya
   - lasix 40mg IV qd, monitor UOP
   - metoprolol 100 mg PO TID
   .
   # Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative medications.
   Concern for possible cerebral ischemic insult during her PEA arrest
   that may be causing her apnea.
   -          continue namenda and aricept
   -          -CT head pending read
   - history of CVA - for secondary stroke prevention should be on aspirin
   and statin; currently on neither one will start statin today, listed as
   having aspirin allergy of unknown type in the chart, however on
   previous admissions appears to have taken it so will consider
   restarting it, although utility at this point given mental status
   likely low

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension.
- She presented initially with urosepsis and pneumonia and was transferred out of the unit. She was later re-transferred after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on the floor without significant improvement in mental status.
- The patient underwent a head CT, which did not show any acute insults.
- She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics since admission and has grown Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters in her sputum, as well as E. coli in her blood and urine.
- Her current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia (HAP), sepsis, acute kidney failure, hypertension, dementia, and urinary tract infection (UTI).
- The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation.
- She is receiving multiple medications, including scopolamine patch to decrease secretions, tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), lasix for diuresis, heparin for DVT prophylaxis, and PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C (99.8Â°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 171/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine levels.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,846 mL and output of 2,440 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 594 mL.
- The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 360 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include worsening of the respiratory failure, further deterioration of kidney function, progression of the UTI, and potential cardiac issues due to her history of CVA and hypertension."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. She presented initially with urosepsis and pneumonia, then transferred out of the unit, and re-transferred after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on the floor without significant improvement in mental status. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has a history of E. coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and right lower lobe aspiration pneumonia. She is also diagnosed with hypercarbic respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia/sepsis, acute kidney failure, hypertension, dementia, and received prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing episodes of apnea while on pressure support ventilation (PSV), indicating potential issues with oxygenation and ventilation. Continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters and ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation support is crucial.
2. Infection: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient still has positive cultures for gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, suggesting an ongoing infection. Cultures should be monitored, and antibiotic therapy may need to be adjusted based on sensitivities.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level has increased from 0.6 to 1.1,"

   82 yo female with persistent and recurrent respiratory failure in the
   setting of altered mental status and aspiration and recurrent
   respiratory failure.  She has failed to have any significant
   improvement in mental status to the point of being able to reasonably
   consider extubation.  In addition there has been a significant decrease
   in alertness and inability to establish response to even painful
   stimuli at this point.
   1)Respiratory Failure--Acute and Chronic-
   -PSV to continue for support as patient unable to support ventilation
   independently
   -Vanco/Amikacin/Flagyl
   2)Alteration of Awareness-
   -Medications in place
   -Will have to consider complete absence of meaningful improvement and
   with persistent absence of responsiveness that patient is likely to
   remain in this persistent state without reasonable expectation of
   meaningful improvement.
   3)Disposition---Family meeting needed and scheduled for today to
   discuss plan of care in the setting of current comatose state.  Current
   clinical decline would suggest that DNR status at a minimum is
   suggested to family in addition to consideration of CMO status

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has worsening tachypnea, encephalopathy, and decreased responsiveness. She has been on multiple antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Amikacin, and Metronidazole. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 175/74 to 133/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,769 mL, with outputs including 799 mL through the gastrointestinal tract, 640 mL through intravenous fluids, and 405 mL through urine. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 312 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 12 cmH2O, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen of 40%, and a respiratory system compliance index of 328. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 32 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen of 65 mmHg, oxygen saturation of 97%, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 163.

The patient's physical examination reveals general appearance as thin, with dullness and diminished breath sounds on the right side of the chest. The cardiovascular examination shows normal first heart sound and distant second heart sound. The peripheral vascular examination indicates absent pulses in both radial and distal pulses. The abdominal examination is soft and non-tender. The extremities show 1+ edema in both lower limbs. The neurologic examination reveals unresponsiveness with no assessed movement or tone.

Laboratory results include hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, leukocyte count of 781 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 148 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4.4 mEq/L, chloride of 102 mEq/L, glucose of 150 mg/dL, and magnesium of 1.9 mg/dL. Imaging studies show no acute infarct or bleeding on the CT head.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has persistent and recurrent respiratory failure in the setting of altered mental status and aspiration. The patient has failed to show significant improvement in mental status, making extubation unreasonable. The patient's condition has worsened with a decrease in alertness and inability to respond to painful stimuli. The plan includes continuing pressure support ventilation, maintaining current medications, and discussing the plan of care with the family due to the patient's persistent comatose state."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year old female with a history of breast cancer, CVA, hypertension
   with recent MICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and RLL
   aspiration PNA presents from medical floor after likely PEA arrest now
   with worsening mental status than on previous transfer now 48 hours
   after the event.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: S/p intubation x2.  Hypercarbic
   likely to arrest d/t pulmonary etiology (mucus plugging, apneic
   period). Started on scopolamine patch yesterday for secretions. still
   requiring frequent suctioning. Currently tachypneic and likely not
   candidate for extubation today. Will discuss goals of care with niece
   this morning (extubation, trach placement etc.)
   - family said patient is now DNR/DNI
   - Wean FIO2 as tolerated, to PS as tolerate
    # HAP/Aspiration PNA/sepsis: Patient on broad spectrum coverage since
   admission, has grown GPC pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood
   and urine. CT from [**8-25**] showed persistent RLL infiltrate. CBC showing
   new bands on diff in setting of code.
   - continue vanc/levo/flagyl patient currently on day 12 of ABX, (2 more
   days)
   - sputum from [**8-27**] - GRAM STAIN (Final [**2192-8-27**]):
    .
   # Urosepsis: E.coli bacteremia, and e.coli/providencia UTI. Repeat
   cultures have been negative. Has been on amikacin, last day [**9-2**].
   - amikacin levels from [**8-24**] are still pending
   .
   # Acute Kidney Failure: Creatinine 1.1 from baseline of 0.6 currently
   1.0 appears to be improving with some diuresis.  likely relative
   hypoperfusion.
   - suspect that some of renal failure is likely due to poor forward flow
   and patient looks volume overloaded by physical exam
   -          trend creatinine
   -  goal I/O is negative 1 liter per day, would give lasix as needed to
   achieve this (40 IV yesterday => -500 cc)
   - will start with 40 IV lasix this morning and then check afternoon
   # Hypertension: On lisinopril, metoprolol  as outpatient
   - increase lisinopril today to 10
   - lasix 40mg IV qd, monitor UOP
   - metoprolol 100 mg PO TID
   .# Dementia:  Currently intubated without need for sedative
   medications. No evidence of acute infarct on CT however suspect global
   anoxia as metabolic insult.
   - d/c namenda and aricept as likely not helpful anymore
   -
   FEN: tubes feeds, monitor electrolytes, repleted K aggressively this
   morning for K of 2.6, K now 4.4
   # Prophylaxis: SC heparin, d/c bowel regimen in the setting of
   persistent diarrhea, PPI
   .
   # Communcation: Sister [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 5333**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5334**].
   # Code: Plan. Now DNR/DNI. Plan to extubate today.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, and recent ICU stay for E.coli urosepsis, providencia UTI, and right lower lobe aspiration pneumonia. She presented from the medical floor after likely experiencing pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, now with worsening mental status 48 hours after the event. The patient's current conditions include hypercarbic respiratory failure, healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP)/aspiration pneumonia/sepsis, urosepsis, acute kidney failure, hypertension, and dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is likely due to pulmonary etiology such as mucus plugging and apneic periods. She requires frequent suctioning and may not be a candidate for extubation today.
2. HAP/Aspiration PNA/Sepsis: The patient has developed healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia with sepsis. She has been on broad-spectrum coverage since admission but has grown gram-positive cocci pairs/clusters in sputum and E.coli in blood and urine. The CT scan shows persistent right lower lobe infiltrate, and her CBC shows new bands on differential.
3. Urosepsis: The patient has urosepsis caused by E.coli bacteremia and E.coli/providencia urinary tract infection (UTI). Repeat cultures have been negative, and she has been on amikacin, last day [**9-2**].
4. Acute Kidney Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased from baseline of 0.6 to 1.1, indicating acute kidney failure. This could be due to hypoperfusion and volume overload.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which is currently being managed with lisinopril and metoprolol.
6. Dementia: The patient has dementia, and her mental status is worsening. She is intubated without the need for sedative medications.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo female with persistent respiratory failure in the setting of
   altered mental status with persistent and severe dementia and inability
   to maintain oral secreations.  She has had no findings to suggest new
   insult in CNS imaging despite worsening and persistent decline in
   responsiveness.  There is no reasonable expectation of a meaningful
   recovery based upon the patient's goals of care as expressed through
   her family and primarily through the health care proxy.  In this
   setting the patient has had continued venilatory support and discussion
   of the goals of care.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Amikacin/Levoflox/Flacyl
   -Maintain ventilatory support as patient unable to protect airway
   -She has increase in level of ventilatory support
   -Will move towards extubation and CMO as plan of care after family has
   had opportunity to finalize disussion and health care proxy status
   confirmed

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with persistent respiratory failure, altered mental status, and severe dementia. She has been unable to maintain oral secretions and is currently on ventilatory support. There are no new findings suggesting a CNS insult, and there is no reasonable expectation of meaningful recovery based on the patient's goals of care expressed through her family and healthcare proxy. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, altered mental status, and severe dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to maintain airway protection and inadequate oxygenation may lead to further respiratory failure. Continued ventilatory support is necessary.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Prophylactic measures should be implemented to reduce this risk.
3. Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI): The high tidal volume used during mechanical ventilation can cause barotrauma and volutrauma, leading to VILI. Adjusting the ventilator settings to minimize lung injury is crucial.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin should be administered.
5. Nosocomial Infections: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of"
