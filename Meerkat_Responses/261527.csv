   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Most likely etiology is hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. Discontinuation of dofetalide may also
   be contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome,
   which is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less
   likely in the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal
   phosphate. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately.
   - Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia stat
   - Recheck K and tumor lysis labs
   - Check TSH
   - If e/o increased tumor lysis will d/w hem/onc re slowing rate of
   chemotherapy
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Amiodarone bolus and drip
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - Lidocaine at bedside in case overdrive pacing fails
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec.
   - Continue Gleevec 400mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - [**Hospital1 **] tumor lysis labs
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 100mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (clarify with hem/onc
   if correct dose)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appears slightly
   hypervolemic. Would benefit from diuresis, however will hold off given
   v tach and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Hold on diuresis for now
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - Clarify with hem/onc why holding coumadin
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
   - Consider restarting dofetilide, will d/w EP in AM
   - Monitor Cr
   .
   # CAD: No active issues.
   - Continue asa
   - No statin due to myopathy
   .
   # DM: No active issues.
   - Glargine 23 HS
   - SSI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: No active issues.
   - Continue synthroid
   - Checking TSH
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac/diabetic diet
   .
   # ACCESS: 2 PIVs
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots for now
   -Pain management with acetaminophen
   -Bowel regimen with docusate/senna PRN

   # CODE:  DNR/DNI but ICD to remain active
   .
   # COMM:  HCP is her daughter [**Name (NI) 3353**] [**Name (NI) 12380**]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12382**].  She DOES

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CML), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), ventricular tachycardia (VT), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and hypothyroidism.
- She was admitted to the ICU for the management of ventricular tachycardia.
- The patient has been experiencing hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which may contribute to the development of VT.
- The medical team has started correcting these electrolyte imbalances.
- The patient's white blood cell count is decreasing after being on Gleevec for CML.
- The patient has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status but wishes to have her daughter notified about her current hospital admission.
- She is currently in the CCU for further management.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient is at risk of recurrent episodes of VT due to hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Continuous telemetry and amiodarone bolus and drip have been initiated to manage this condition.
2. Tumor lysis syndrome: Although less likely in this case, tumor lysis syndrome can cause cardiac dysrhythmias. Monitoring of tumor lysis labs and adjusting the"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, cancer (chronic myeloid leukemia), type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with vertigo and vomiting and was initially treated for a high white blood cell count believed to be due to untreated chronic myeloid leukemia. She is currently in the critical care unit (CCU) for management of ventricular tachycardia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia and is currently experiencing sustained ventricular tachycardia. The most likely etiology is hypokalemia in the setting of diuresis with Lasix. Discontinuation of dofetilide may also be contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome, which is known to cause cardiac dysrhythmias. However, this is less likely in the setting of hypokalemia and normal phosphate levels. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism is also a possibility.
2. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient appears slightly hypervolemic and would benefit from diuresis. However, it is being held off due to ventricular tachycardia and electrolyte abnormalities.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has stable and improved"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CML), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the hospital due to vertigo and vomiting and had a white blood cell count of 173, which was thought to be due to untreated CML.

The patient's current condition includes sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) that required override pacing attempts to revert to sinus rhythm. She has hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which need to be corrected stat. There is also a concern for tumor lysis syndrome, but it seems less likely given the normal phosphate levels.

The patient's goals of care include being ok with ICD shocks but not wanting any external interventions such as CPR or intubation, even if she becomes unstable. Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.

The patient's current medications include Gleevec for CML, metoprolol for heart failure, and other medications for her various conditions. Her electrolyte imbalances need to be corrected, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the sustained VT.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing sustained VT, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and potential cardiac arrest"

   with stable potassium level.  Discontinuation of dofetalide may also be
   contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome, which
   is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less likely in
   the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal phosphate.
   Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible, however TSH was normal.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately. Patient had another episode last night of
   slow v tach that was not paced out by her PM and required amiodarone +
   lidocaine gtt.
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - Daily tumor lysis labs

   Nutrition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), ventricular tachycardia (VT), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and hypothyroidism. She was initially admitted to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting, and her white count was elevated due to untreated CML. She is now in the CCU for management of VT.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from her current condition:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient experienced multiple episodes of VT, which were not responsive to initial treatments such as amiodarone and lidocaine. The cause of VT could be hypokalemia, discontinuation of dofetilide, or tumor lysis syndrome. Continuous telemetry should be maintained to monitor any further episodes.

2. CML: The patient's white count is coming down after Gleevec treatment, but it is still elevated at 87. She is not a good candidate for dasatinib due to QT prolongation. It is recommended to call the outpatient hematologist to discuss starting hydroxyurea if the patient refuses Gleevec. Tumor lysis labs should be done daily, and allopurinol should be given for tumor lysis prophylaxis.

   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Most likely etiology is hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. Discontinuation of dofetalide may also
   be contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome,
   which is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less
   likely in the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal
   phosphate. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately.
   - Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia stat
   - Recheck K and tumor lysis labs
   - Check TSH
   - If e/o increased tumor lysis will d/w hem/onc re slowing rate of
   chemotherapy
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Amiodarone bolus and drip
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - Lidocaine at bedside in case overdrive pacing fails
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation
   - per heme, should call outpatient hematologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4021**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5900**]) to see
   about starting hydroxyurea if patient refuses Gleevac
   - Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - coumaidn restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 85 bpm (range 84-126 bpm), blood pressure of 103/44 mmHg (range 58-123/34-74 mmHg), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (range 16-23 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of ventricular tachycardia, which was initially thought to be caused by hypokalemia due to diuresis with Lasix. However, other possible causes include tumor lysis syndrome and iatrogenic hyperthyroidism. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with low potassium and magnesium. Her tumor lysis labs are pending, and she is being closely monitored by the hematology/oncology team.

The patient has chronic systolic heart failure and is on metoprolol 25 mg PO BID. Her medications for chronic kidney"

   ICU Care
   Nutrition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and hypothyroidism. She was initially admitted to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting, and later transferred to the CCU for management of ventricular tachycardia.

The patient's recent events include an episode of ventricular tachycardia last night, despite relatively normalized potassium levels. This episode was managed with amiodarone and lidocaine. The etiology of the ventricular tachycardia is unclear, but it may be related to the discontinuation of dofetilide, a medication used to treat atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate ranging from 84 to 126 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 103/44 to 123/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula, and temperature within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities except for 1+ pre-tibial edema. Her neurological assessment is incomplete due to lack of response and movement.

Laboratory results indicate slightly elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, slightly elevated platelet count, mildly decreased creat"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease. She presented to the hospital with vertigo and vomiting and was initially treated for tumor lysis syndrome. The patient has been diagnosed with chronic systolic heart failure and has had multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which has been managed with pacing, amiodarone, and lidocaine. She is currently on the ICU for management of ventricular tachycardia. The patient also has a history of cancer (CML), dysuria, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, and CKD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has had multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
2. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient's initial presentation was thought to be due to tumor lysis syndrome, which is a group of metabolic complications that can occur after treatment for certain types of cancer.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels can lead to muscle cramps, weakness, and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Discontinuation of Dofetilide: The patient's atrial fibrillation medication, dofetilide, has been"

   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Etiology unclear although initial
   differential included tumor lysis syndrome, overdiuresis causing
   hypokalemia, discontinueation of dofetilide, hyperthyroidism.  However,
   the patient had another episode of v tach last night despite relatively
   normalized potassium levels making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less
   likely.  TSH was also checked and was normal.  Perhaps D/C of
   dofetilide is contributing. Per EP, pacer functioning appropriately. As
   above, last night the patient had v tach that was not paced out by her
   ATP function, so she received a large dose of amiodarone and was put on
   a lidocaine gtt, she was then manually overpaced by the EP fellow.
   - Continuous telemetry
   - stop lidocaine gtt
   - Continue amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide (may defer this
   question to a later date)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD set at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating attempts
   until shock
   - F/U with EP (input is much appreciated)
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.

   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation

   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
 have been stable
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily given hyperkalemia and elevated
   creatinine, but will plan to restart
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also was held for unclear reasons.
   - coumadin restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (Afib) on dofetilide, ventricular tachycardia (VT) status post pacemaker/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (PPM/ICD), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) on Gleevec but not currently taking it, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and dysuria. She was initially admitted to the Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) service with vertigo and vomiting and now transferred to the Critical Care Unit (CCU) for management of VT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a history of VT, which is currently being managed in the CCU. The etiology of the VT is unclear, with initial differentials including tumor lysis syndrome, overdiuresis causing hypokalemia, discontinuation of dofetilide, and hyperthyroidism. The patient had another episode of VT last night despite relatively normalized potassium levels, making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less likely. The use of amiodarone and lidocaine, as well as continuous telemetry monitoring, is recommended.

2. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient appeared slightly hypervolemic, and diuresis was initially held due to VT and electrolyte abnormalities."

   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Etiology unclear although initial
   differential included tumor lysis syndrome, overdiuresis causing
   hypokalemia, discontinueation of dofetilide, hyperthyroidism.  However,
   the patient had another episode of v tach last night despite relatively
   normalized potassium levels making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less
   likely.  TSH was also checked and was normal.  Perhaps D/C of
   dofetilide is contributing. Per EP, pacer functioning appropriately. As
   above, last night the patient had v tach that was not paced out by her
   ATP function, so she received a large dose of amiodarone and was put on
   a lidocaine gtt, she was then manually overpaced by the EP fellow.
   - Continuous telemetry
   - stopped lidocaine gtt yesterday
   - Continue amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide (may defer this
   question to a later date)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD set at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating attempts
   until shock
   - F/U with EP (input is much appreciated)
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation
   - Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
 have been stable
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Restart lasix 40mg PO Daily
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily given hyperkalemia and elevated
   creatinine, but will plan to restart
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also was held for unclear reasons.
   - coumadin restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)
   - daily INR
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # Dysuria:
   - Ceftriaxone 1gm IV Q24
   - D/C foley and use bedside commode
   - F/u culture
   .
   # CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
   - Monitor Cr

   # CAD: No active issues.
   - Continue asa
   - No statin due to myopathy

   # DM: No active issues.
   - Glargine 23 HS

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).

The patient initially presented to the hospital with vertigo and vomiting and was admitted to the BMT service. Her white blood cell count was elevated due to untreated CML. She was then transferred to the CCU for management of ventricular tachycardia (VTach). 

The etiology of VTach is unclear, but potential causes include tumor lysis syndrome, hypokalemia, discontinuation of dofetilide, or hyperthyroidism. The patient had another episode of VTach last night despite relatively normalized potassium levels, making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less likely. 

The patient received a large dose of amiodarone and was put on a lidocaine drip. She was also manually overpaced by the EP fellow. Continuous telemetry was continued, and the lidocaine gtt was stopped yesterday. 

The patient's goals of care were clarified, and she is DNR/DNI but okay with ICD shocks. Her cancer (CML) is being treated with Gleevec at a reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily.
