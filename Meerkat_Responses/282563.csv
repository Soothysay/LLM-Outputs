   Assessment and Plan
 CARDIAC ARREST:
   Ddx includes PE, mucous plug, no evidence for PTX, no hypoglycemia, no
   evidence for significant cardiac event (currently elevated cardiac
   markers more consistent with demand). Will perform CT PE, bronchoscopy.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   continue vent support, will eventually need trach change but will hold
   off on this today given event's overnight, will perform bronchoscopy
   and lavage to assess for plugging. Follow up ABG
 Seizure/unresponsiveness:
   Seizure this morning, getting EEG, neurology to see,also to be
   evaluated for cooling for neurological preservation.
 Hemodynamics: Requiring high dose pressors, but weaning down likely
   post arrest SIRS, trend lactate. change steroids to 100mg iv of
   hydrocort q8h. will give 500 iv saline and r/a monitor U/o and BP.
   Replace Central line, replace A-line. Start Vanco, cefepime, history of
   pseudomonas sensitive only to amikacin will hold off on this due to
   post arrest status and concern for renal failure.
 FRACTURE, OTHER
   Complex fracture s/p closed reduction and casting. Requires further
   reduction by ortho at risk for ulnar and median nerve entrapment.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has a history of several medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is an arm fracture and PEA (pulsus paradoxus) arrest. The patient was unresponsive and showed rhythmic quivering of the lips, tongue, and throat, which responded to 4mg of lorazepam. An EEG and neurology consult are pending.

The patient's past medical history includes multidrug-resistant pseudomonas, tracheomalacia with stenosis, COPD, and other chronic conditions. Allergies include codeine, Compazine, penicillins, metformin, and heparin agents.

The patient is currently on multiple ICU medications, including norepinephrine, hydromorphone, pantoprazole, tylenol, atrovent, RISS, calcium carbonate, ferrous sulfate, celexa, bactrim, prednisone, colace, vitamin D, lasix, mirapex, and senna.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory arrest overnight, likely related to a mucous plug. The patient has been unresponsive since the arrest. 

Vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, and low oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates high fluid intake and output balance. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, set at 400 mL tidal volume,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of arm fracture, PEA arrest, respiratory arrest, tracheomalacia, tracheostomy, COPD, multidrug-resistant pseudomonas, and multiple comorbidities. The patient has been unresponsive since the overnight respiratory arrest and has shown tonic activity with rhythmic quivering of the lips, tongue, and throat, which responded to 4mg of lorazepam. An EEG and neurology consult are pending. The patient's allergies include codeine, Compazine, penicillins, metformin, and heparin agents. The patient is currently receiving multiple infusions and medications in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced acute respiratory failure and is dependent on ventilator support. There is a concern for ongoing respiratory compromise due to mucous plugging, and further evaluation with bronchoscopy and lavage is planned.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient suffered a PEA arrest, and the cause is still under investigation. Immediate interventions were performed, but the cardiac markers are elevated, suggesting demand ischemia rather than significant cardiac events. A CT pulmonary embolism and bronchoscopy will be performed to rule out other potential causes.
3. Seizure/Unresponsiveness: The patient experienced a seizure this morning, and an EEG is being obtained to evaluate the underlying cause. Neurological preservation measures, such as cooling"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and post-cardiac arrest. The patient had a wrist fracture reduction and cast reapplied by orthopedics, bronchoscopy, and an arterial line placement. The patient's temperature is elevated at 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, indicating a fever. The patient's heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are within normal limits.

The patient's current medical conditions include seizure without status epilepticus, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, acute COPD exacerbation, and a wrist fracture. The patient is currently on sedation with propofol and has been cooled to 34 degrees Celsius for post-cardiac arrest syndrome management. Continuous EEG monitoring is being performed to monitor for any seizure activity.

The patient's respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia have improved with increased sedation and the addition of propofol. The patient is being ventilated with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 43 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's recent laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 30"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), now presenting with wrist fracture, severe pain, and requiring ventilator support in the MICU. The patient had a previous cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and a fall at a rehabilitation facility resulting in a fracture of the radius and ulna. The patient underwent wrist fracture reduction in the ER and has been on various medications for pain management, including narcotics.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 110/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.45, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 43 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 260, and oxygen saturation (SO2) of 100%. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is elevated at 14.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) is 30.6%, platelet count (Plt) is 230 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) is 0.8 mg/dL, troponin-T is 0.05 ng/mL, and lactic acid level is 1.2 mmol/L.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Seizure, without status epilepticus: The patient had some activity that looked like a possible seizure, but the neurologist did not confirm it as a seizure.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a previous pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.
3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient's severe COPD has worsened, leading to respiratory acidosis/hypercarbia/hypoxia. The patient is currently on ventilator support.
4. Fracture, other: The patient sustained a wrist fracture due to a traumatic mechanical fall at the rehabilitation facility. The fracture was reduced by orthopedics in the ER.
5. Anemia of iron deficiency: The patient has stable anemia of iron deficiency.
6. Depression: The patient has a history of depression.
7. History of ulcers: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal ulcers.
8. Hx of recent cellulitis: The patient completed a course of vancomycin for cellulitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and fever suggest a possible infection. The patient's history of recent cellulitis and ongoing immunosuppression increase the risk of infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure, exacerbated by severe COPD and increased narcotics, may continue to pose a risk.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's previous cardiac arrest and ongoing cardiac issues may predispose him to further cardiac complications.
4. Fracture complications: The patient's wrist fracture, in the context of chronic high-dose steroid use and osteoporosis, increases the risk of complications such as nonunion or malunion.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal ulcers and increased PPI use may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of right arm fracture and PEA arrest. The patient's respiratory acidosis improved with propofol infusion, and a tracheostomy was performed due to bronchospasm vs tracheomalacia. The patient also has a history of COPD, tracheomalacia, elevated right hemidiaphragm, and significant autopeep. They are currently on a cooling protocol for suspected non-accidental trauma and seizure management. The patient has been sedated and unresponsive throughout their ICU stay. They have multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to their history of COPD and tracheomalacia. The elevated right hemidiaphragm and significant autopeep indicate potential respiratory muscle weakness. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation, ABG analysis, and close observation of the patient's breathing pattern are necessary to prevent further respiratory failure.

2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest, which can be indicative of underlying cardiac pathology. The cause of the arrest is still under investigation, and the patient is currently on a cooling protocol. Continuous cardiac monitoring, regular EKG checks, and prompt intervention in case of any arrhythmias or hemodynamic instability are essential to prevent recurrent cardiac arrests.

3. Seizure Activity: The patient displayed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several medical complications. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD, tracheomalacia, and an elevated right hemidiaphragm, which indicates significant respiratory distress. This puts the patient at risk for further respiratory failure.

2. Seizure activity: There have been episodes of seizure-like activity observed on the EEG monitor. This needs to be evaluated further by the epilepsy team to determine if it is consistent with a seizure or another process.

3. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is currently on a cooling protocol. It is important to assess the duration of the cooling protocol and discuss with the cardiac arrest team.

4. Fracture: The patient has a right arm fracture that requires follow-up ortho recommendations. This may require surgical intervention or immobilization to promote healing.

5. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, but has shown improvement and is currently off pressors. However, monitoring and managing blood pressure remains crucial to prevent further complications.

6. Infection: The presence of GNR and GPC in the BAL suggests a possible infection. Blood and urine cultures have been obtained, and appropriate antibiotics have been initiated. Further evaluation and management are necessary based on the culture results.

7. Tracheomalacia: The patient's tracheomalacia could lead"

   # Tachycarida: had on admission, now returned after rewarming. Is a
   sinus tach. Concern for volume depletion vs pain related (but was tachy
   on fentanyl). Does not show evidence of bleeding. No PE on CTA. Concern
   for infection as cause, but on abx
   - goal to keep even I/Os today
   - given 500ml bolus NS now
   - hold lasix for now
   # Question of Seizure:  in setting of arrest, on cont EEG, neuro
   following. Per yesterday's eval, no evidence of seizure activity on
   EEG, but was on sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - EEG results
   - continue keppra for now
   # Chronic Diastolic HF:  Stable
   - hold lasix of now due to tachycarida
   - I/O goal: even
   # Wrist fracture/Osteoperosis: Pt had a traumatic mechanical fall at
   rehab prior to admission. Fracture of radius and ulna, reduced by ortho
   in ER. Has risk of bone fracture due to chronic high dose steriods.
   - ortho recs appreciated
   - dilaudid IV
   - tylenol 1g Q6H standing

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest yesterday morning and was subsequently placed on the Arctic Sun cooling protocol. The patient has a history of COPD, depression, anemia of iron deficiency, and gastric ulcers.

The patient's current assessment includes seizure without status epilepticus, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), fracture of the wrist, chronic diastolic HF, osteoporosis, type II DM, anemia of iron deficiency, depression, gastric ulcers, and cellulitis.

The plan includes weaning sedation to assess mental status, monitoring electrolytes, continuing EEG monitoring, adjusting the ventilator rate based on ABG results, providing albuterol and ipratropium nebs, changing to home steroids, and continuing vancomycin and cefepime. The patient will also receive Bactrim prophylaxis, and bisphosphonate therapy at discharge. Additionally, the patient's glycemic control, lines, nutrition, prophylaxis, and disposition will be managed accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has GNRs in the lungs, indicating a possible respiratory infection. This may require further evaluation and treatment.

2. Seizure: The patient had a seizure during the cardiac arrest, and EEG monitoring is ongoing. Further assessment and management of seizures may be necessary"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old male who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest yesterday morning. The patient has several medical conditions and complications that need to be considered.

1. Seizure: The patient had a seizure without status epilepticus, and continuous EEG monitoring is ongoing to evaluate mental status. There is no evidence of seizure activity on the EEG.

2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a PEA arrest, and rewarming was completed. Monitoring of electrolytes is being done every six hours, and sedation will be weaned in the morning to assess mental status.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and is currently on the Arctic Sun cooling protocol. The patient is overventilating due to severe COPD at baseline. Bronchoscopy revealed gram-negative rods (GNR) and gram-positive cocci (GPC), but no specific species have been identified yet. The plan is to decrease the rate to 16 breaths per minute and FiO2 to 40%. The patient will continue on vancomycin and cefepime, and follow-up sputum culture will be done. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium will also be administered.

4. Fever: The patient has a fever of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, which could be due to infection or acute stress/brain"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of severe tuberculosis (TBM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic tracheostomy, diastolic heart failure, and Parkinsonism. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and required resuscitation. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 114 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 100/65 to 91/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on the tracheostomy tube, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2,296 mL and output of 2,063 mL since 12 AM.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 12.4 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, blood glucose level of 92 mg/dL, sodium level of 138 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L, and a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 46 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 178 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 94%. The respiratory system examination reveals clear breath sounds with transmitted vent sounds and diminished breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.

The patient's neurological examination shows no spontaneous movement, constricted pupils, and a positive corneal reflex. The cardiac examination reveals a regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. The extremities examination shows no lower extremity edema but ecchymosis of the left hand. The skin examination is not assessed.

The patient's assessment and plan include seizure/change in mental status, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, pneumonia, tachycardia, fracture, and ICU care. The patient is being closely monitored, sedation is being weaned, and the ventilator settings are being adjusted as needed."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with severe tuberculosis (TBM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tracheostomy, and diastolic heart failure. He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) under close monitoring. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 114 beats per minute, blood pressure of 100/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), normal platelet count (Plt), elevated creatinine (Cr), and slightly low potassium levels (K+). The patient has been cooled overnight without any complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the ventilation settings need to be adjusted or if there are complications related to the tracheostomy.
2. Tach"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with severe tuberculosis (TBM), chronic tracheostomy, COPD, diastolic heart failure, and Parkinsonism. He experienced a PEA arrest and is currently on ventilation support in the ICU. The patient's medical history includes allergies to codeine, penicillins, metformin, and heparin agents. His last dose of antibiotics was on 09/21/2126 at 10:00 PM. The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 100/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of edema in both lower extremities and ecchymosis of the left hand.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still unresponsive and dependent on mechanical ventilation. Weaning sedation should be done carefully while monitoring closely for any signs of deterioration.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, but the exact cause is unclear. It may be related to pain or a response to fluid bolus. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. Awaiting speciation of bron"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and experienced a post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PEA) arrest on September 20th. The patient is currently on a cooling protocol for Arctic Sun cooling, showing intermittent responsiveness to commands with a tracheostomy tube in place and ventilator support. The patient has a history of severe COPD, and there is concern for anoxic brain injury due to the hypoxic event during the PEA arrest. The patient's mental status is being monitored off sedation, and EEG monitoring continues.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 119/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's CVP is 14 mmHg, with a total fluid intake of 4,424 mL and total fluid output of 1,425 mL. The patient is receiving fentanyl infusion and other ICU medications, including pantoprazole and ativan.

The patient has multiple allergies to codeine, Compazine, penicillins, metformin, and heparin agents. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. The patient's lab results indicate elevated WBC count, slightly decreased Hct, and normal platelet count. Other lab"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and cardiac arrest. He experienced a peri-arrest seizure and was treated with the Arctic Sun cooling protocol. The patient is sedated and not arousing to command. A repeat head CT showed no changes. 

The patient has severe COPD and an infiltrate on chest X-ray. He is on mechanical ventilation and receiving antibiotics for bronchial pseudomonas infection. His ABG results improved, but he still requires oxygen support. 

The patient had a fever prior to cooling and has pseudomonas in his lungs. He was given ciprofloxacin and continues to receive vancomycin and cefepime. 

The patient experienced tachycardia, which could be due to volume depletion, pain, or infection. He received a fluid bolus and his condition improved slightly. 

There is a question regarding a seizure during the cardiac arrest, and continuous EEG monitoring is ongoing. The neurologist is following up on this matter. 

The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure and a wrist fracture due to a traumatic mechanical fall at rehab. He also has osteoporosis from chronic high-dose steroids. 

The patient has a history of gastric ulcers, depression, iron-deficiency anemia, and cellulitis. 

The patient is currently on tube feeds and has re"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with a right arm fracture and experienced a post-cardiac arrest syndrome. The patient has shown some improvement in mental status but remains on ventilatory support. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/90 mmHg to 138/116 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's balance is within normal limits, and they are receiving various medications and treatments for their conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure caused by right lower lobe pneumonia. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening respiratory status.
2. Cardiac Arrest: Although the patient has undergone induced hypothermia, there is still a risk of recurrent cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
3. Neurological Impairment: The patient has neurological impairment post-cardiac arrest. There is a risk of further neurological deterioration or seizures.
4. Infection: The presence of pseudomonas in sputum and BAL indicates a potential infection. There is a risk of the infection spreading or developing antibiotic resistance.
5. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient is suspected to have diastolic heart failure. If not managed appropriately, there is a risk of worsening cardiac"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Seizure: The patient has a history of seizures and is currently on keppra for seizure prophylaxis. It is important to continue monitoring the patient for any further seizure activity.

2. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest in the past and underwent induced hypothermia. The patient is now more responsive but should continue to be closely monitored, especially since they are still on EEG monitoring.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to right lower lobe pneumonia. They are currently on vancomycin and cefepime for treatment. Follow-up sputum cultures will be needed to determine the effectiveness of the antibiotics. If the patient spikes a fever again, amikacin for pseudomonas may be started.

4. Fracture: The patient has a right wrist fracture, which has been reduced. It is important to monitor the patient's pulses and perfusion to the arm. The patient is being followed by orthopedics, and pain management with fentanyl is being provided.

5. Tachycardia: The patient exhibits tachycardia, which could be due to infection or pain. The cause of the tachycardia needs to be investigated further.

6. Diastolic heart failure: The patient has diastolic heart failure, and home lasix"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with wrist pain and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history is significant for allergies to codeine, Compazine, penicillins, metformin, and heparin agents. 

The patient has undergone several interventions, including a PICC line placement, which was stopped. A head CT was performed, showing no abnormalities. An EEG from the neuro note indicated a slow background but no epileptiform discharges. The neuro recommendations included discontinuing EEG monitoring, continuing keppra 500 mg po BID for now, and planning an MRI in the future to assess for infracts. However, it is unlikely to change the plan at this time and will defer until more stable.

The patient's medications were adjusted, with the addition of lasix 40 mg po BID (home dose), and discontinuation of the PICC line. The patient experienced 45 minutes of PS with RR 20s, diaphoretic, followed by being back to AC with ABG PO2 116, subsequently decreased Fi O2 to 30%. The sputum/BAL susceptibilities led to changing cefepime to meropenem.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/73 mmHg to 145/116 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breath"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo m admitted to MICU for respiratory distress and now s/p PEA
   arrest [**2126-9-20**] s/p Arctic Sun cooling protocol.
   # S/P PEA Arrest: Likely secondary to hypoxic event, mucus plug.
   Completed rewarming. Concern for anxoic brain injury. Pt off sedation
   and somewhat responsive to commands. [**9-22**] head Ct with no pathology.
   EEG completed per neuro and without epileptiform discharges. Not
   following commands. Not responding to pain, verbal stimuli.
   - monitor mental status off sedation
   - monitor on tele
   - continue keppra for now
   # Respiratory Alkalosis/Hypercarbia/Hypoxia: ABG improved. Bronch with
   pseudomonas and sensitive to meropenem. Has severe COPD at baseline.
   CXR with low lung volumes and concern for infiltrate. Also with
   evidence of bilateral effusions on CXR. Did not tolerate PS yesterday.
   Became tachpneic. O2 sats well. Desatted in setting of turn yesterday.
   Required recruitment maneuver. [**Month (only) 60**] still have component of of volume
   overload. Will further diurese prior to weaning down PEEP.
   - monitor ABGs
   - AC on vent for now, FiO2 slightly decreased to 30%
   - diurese with goal of
 2L today
   - continue meropenem x 8 day course
   - albuterol, ipratropium nebs
   - continue home steroids
   - continue bactrim ppx
   -
   # Fever: Had a fever prior to cooling, infection vs from acute
   stress/brain injury. Has pseudomonas in lungs.
   - given sputum susceptibilities, continue meropenem x 8 days, Day [**2-17**]
   today
   - monitor fever curve
   - d/c vanco
   # Tachycardia: had on admission, now returned after rewarming. Is a
   sinus tach. Does not show evidence of bleeding. No PE on CTA. Concern
   for infection as cause, but on abx.  Bolused  without improvement. No
   improvement with fentanyl.
   - monitor for now
   # Question of Seizure:  in setting of arrest, on cont EEG, neuro
   following. Per yesterday's eval, no evidence of seizure activity on
   EEG, but was on sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue keppra for now
   - MRI in future
   # Chronic Diastolic HF:  Stable
   - started lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **]
   - I/O goal: -1-2L
   # Wrist fracture/Rib fracture/Osteoperosis: Pt had a traumatic
   mechanical fall at rehab prior to admission. Fracture of radius and
   ulna, reduced by ortho in ER. Has risk of bone fracture due to chronic
   high dose steriods.
   - ortho recs appreciated
 not planning on surgery.
   - dilaudid IV
   - tylenol 1g Q6H standing
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   # DM, type II:
   - continue SSI from nursing home
   # Anemia of iron def: stable
   - monitor hct
   - continue iron tablets
   # Depression: stable
   - continue celexa
   # Hx of  gastric ulcers: no evidence of GI bleed at this time, no abd
   pain
   - can change to PPI once a day since now on home steroids dose
   # Hx of recent cellulitis: completed course of vanco
   - monitor for infection
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   # Code:  Full per HCP

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and subsequent PEA arrest. The patient has undergone an Arctic Sun cooling protocol and completed rewarming. There are concerns for anoxic brain injury, as the patient is somewhat responsive to commands but not following them and not responding to pain or verbal stimuli.

The patient has a history of severe COPD, and a CXR shows low lung volumes with concern for infiltrate and bilateral effusions. The patient did not tolerate proning yesterday and became tachypneic. Oxygen saturation remained well, but the patient desaturated during a turn and required a recruitment maneuver. The patient has a component of volume overload and will be further diuresed prior to weaning down PEEP.

The patient has a fever prior to cooling, which could be due to infection or acute stress/brain injury. The patient has pseudomonas in the lungs, and given the sputum susceptibilities, meropenem will be continued for 8 days. The patient's tachycardia is a sinus tachycardia and may be related to infection, but no improvement was seen with fentanyl.

The patient had a wrist fracture and rib fracture from a traumatic mechanical fall at rehab prior to admission. There is concern for osteoporosis due to chronic high-dose steroids. The patient's diabetes type II is stable, and the patient's anemia of iron deficiency is stable."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo m admitted to MICU for respiratory distress and now s/p PEA
   arrest [**2126-9-20**] s/p Arctic Sun cooling protocol.
   # S/P PEA Arrest: Likely secondary to hypoxic event, mucus plug.
   Completed rewarming. Concern for anxoic brain injury. Pt off sedation
   and somewhat responsive to commands. [**9-22**] head Ct with no pathology.
   EEG completed per neuro and without epileptiform discharges
   - monitor mental status off sedation
   - monitor on tele
   # Respiratory Alkalosis/Hypercarbia/Hypoxia: ABG improved. Bronch with
   pseudomonas and sensitive to meropenem. Has severe COPD at baseline.
   CXR with low lung volumes and concern for infiltrate.
   - monitor ABGs
   - AC on vent for now, FiO2 slightly decreased to 30%
   - continue meropenem x 8 day course
   - albuterol, ipratropium nebs
   - continue home steriods
   - continue bactrim ppx
   - trial of PS
   # Fever: Had a fever prior to cooling, infection vs from acute
   stress/brain injury. Has pseudomonas in lungs.
   - given sputum susceptibilities, continue meropenem x 8 days
   - monitor fever curve
   # Tachycardia: had on admission, now returned after rewarming. Is a
   sinus tach. Concern for volume depletion vs pain related (but was tachy
   on fentanyl). Does not show evidence of bleeding. No PE on CTA. Concern
   for infection as cause, but on abx.  Slight improvement with fluid
   bolus.
   - goal to keep even to -500 cc today
   - continue Lasix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   # Question of Seizure:  in setting of arrest, on cont EEG, neuro
   following. Per yesterday's eval, no evidence of seizure activity on
   EEG, but was on sedation
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue keppra for now
   # Chronic Diastolic HF:  Stable
   - started lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **]
   - I/O goal even to
 500 cc
   # Wrist fracture/Rib fracture/Osteoperosis: Pt had a traumatic
   mechanical fall at rehab prior to admission. Fracture of radius and
   ulna, reduced by ortho in ER. Has risk of bone fracture due to chronic
   high dose steriods.
   - ortho recs appreciated
 not planning on surgery.
   - dilaudid IV

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and subsequent PEA arrest. He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol and completed rewarming. The patient has a history of severe COPD, anoxic brain injury, wrist fracture, rib fracture, osteoporosis, type II diabetes mellitus, anemia of iron deficiency, depression, gastric ulcers, and recent cellulitis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and has been weaned off sedation. His vital signs are stable, but he remains tachycardic and has a fever. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, indicating possible infection. He has bronchitis with pseudomonas and is sensitive to meropenem. The patient's chest X-ray shows low lung volumes with concern for infiltrate. The plan is to continue meropenem for 8 days, monitor ABGs, maintain FiO2 at 30%, and trial of pressure support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and presence of pseudomonas in the lungs, there is a risk of developing VAP. Monitoring for changes in mental status, increased fever, worsening respiratory symptoms, and new infiltrates on chest X-ray would be important.
2. Delirium: The patient's anoxic brain injury puts him at risk"

   to monitor, appreciate neuro's recommendations. Will contact sister
   today.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Volume overload, + baseline severe COPD. Will diurese -1-2L, will
   perform ultrasoudn of bases to assess for size of effusions. Treating
   RLL pseudomonal pneumonia, continue meropenem x14days, will d/c
   vancomcyin.
 FRACTURE, OTHER
   R wrist, appreciate ortho's recommendations. Will likely need
   bisphosphonate before discharge.

   note above, including the assessment and plan.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6115**] again had an episode of respiratory distress this morning
   as his sedation was being weaned. He developed a significant leak
   around his trach and was exhaling most of each tidal volume through his
   mouth. We replaced the trach once to a similar size and the problem was
   not corrected. We contact[**Name (NI) **] the IP service and the trach was changed to
   a Bovona 6 and the leak has improved though is persistent. Efforts at
   correcting this are ongoing. Otherwise the plan remains vent support,
   antibiotics, COPD treatment and close following of his mental status.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill and has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Right arm fracture: The patient has a fracture in their right arm. If not properly managed, it may lead to complications such as non-union, malunion, or post-traumatic arthritis.

2. Hypercarbia: The patient has elevated levels of carbon dioxide in their blood (hypercarbia). If left untreated, this can lead to respiratory acidosis, which can affect various organ functions including the brain, heart, and kidneys.

3. PEA arrest: The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which is a type of cardiac arrest. Recurrence or progression of this condition can result in further deterioration of the patient's cardiovascular function and potentially lead to death.

4. Seizure: The patient has had a seizure, and there is a possibility of recurrent seizures. If not adequately controlled, seizures can cause brain injury and increase the risk of complications.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely due to volume overload and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). If not managed appropriately, this can lead to worsening hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and eventually respiratory arrest.

6. Pseudomonal pneumonia: The patient has an infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a type of bacteria. If not effectively treated, this infection can spread to other parts of"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6115**] again had an episode of respiratory distress this morning
   as his sedation was being weaned. He developed a significant leak
   around his trach and was exhaling most of each tidal volume through his
   mouth. We replaced the trach once to a similar size and the problem was
   not corrected. We contact[**Name (NI) **] the IP service and the trach was changed to
   a Bovona 6 and the leak has improved though is persistent. Efforts at
   correcting this are ongoing. Otherwise the plan remains vent support,
   antibiotics, COPD treatment and close following of his mental status.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe COPD and is currently experiencing respiratory distress with volume overload. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function and the need for continued ventilatory support.

2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonal pneumonia, which is a type of lung infection caused by the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This infection may require prolonged antibiotic treatment and could potentially lead to sepsis if not properly managed.

3. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and has been resuscitated. There is a risk of recurrent cardiac events, and the patient's neurological status remains unstable with ongoing sedation and lack of responsiveness.

4. Seizures: The patient had a seizure episode, and there is a risk of recurrent seizures due to the ongoing encephalopathy and sedation. Antiepileptic drugs may be necessary to prevent further seizures.

5. Fracture management: The patient has a right wrist fracture, which will require orthopedic consultation and potential surgical intervention. There is a risk of complications associated with surgery and immobilization of the limb.

6. Nutrition: The patient is currently receiving tube feeds, and there is a risk of inadequate nutrition and hydration, which can impact the patient's overall recovery and healing process.

7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis:"

The patient is currently sedated and encephalopathic, unable to provide any history. They have several allergies including codeine, Compazine (oral), penicillins, metformin, and heparin agents. 

The patient received various antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, Bactrim (SMX/TMP), cefepime, vancomycin, and meropenem. They are currently on a fentanyl drip and other ICU medications like fondaparinux. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/93 mmHg to 145/119 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. The blood glucose levels are within normal range. 

Imaging shows bilateral pleural effusion with more on the right side, which is stable. Microbiology results indicate the presence of pseudomonas in the sputum.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has several ongoing medical issues. The patient has tracheobronchomalacia, which is a condition characterized by weakness and collapse of the walls of the bronchial tubes. This can lead to breathing difficulties and recurrent infections.

The patient also experienced a seizure without status epilepticus, indicating a single episode of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Additionally, the patient had a cardiac arrest, which refers to the sudden stoppage of the heart's function. It is crucial to determine the cause of the cardiac arrest and any potential underlying heart conditions.

The patient is also struggling with respiratory failure, which means that their lungs are not adequately supplying oxygen to the body. This could be due to the tracheobronchomalacia or other factors. The note mentions that it is not ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), so it is likely related to the malacia.

Furthermore, the patient has a fracture described as ""other,"" but no specific details about the location or cause of the fracture are provided.

In terms of treatment, the patient has multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line and a multi-lumen line. These lines are used for monitoring and delivering medications or fluids. The patient is also receiving prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Overall, the patient's current conditions include tracheobronchomalacia, seizure"

   CXR [**9-24**]
   FINDINGS: In comparison to the previous study of the same date there
   are low
   lung volumes. Significant respiratory motion artifact is limiting
   evaluation;
   large bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged. The
   tracheostomy
   tube and right central venous line are unchanged. Accurate evaluation
   of the
   NG tube below the level of the diaphragm is not possible.
   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo m admitted to MICU for respiratory distress and now s/p PEA
   arrest [**2126-9-20**] s/p Arctic Sun cooling protocol.
   # Respiratory Distress: Had acute respiratory distress yesterday AM
   with hypertension, tachycardia in setting of shutting off Fentanyl
   gtt.  Wheezing on exam.  CXR did not show much change from previous of
   known large bilateral pleural effusions.  ABG throughout was unchanged,
   but pt continued to have increased WOB and forced expiration. Bronch
   without large mucus plug or secretions.  Found to have cuff leak and
   changed ETT without improvement; pt without much tracheal cartilage
   left and appears will have residual cuff leak.  Per RT last night,
   applied PEEP 0, and concern that PEEP is not having much effect.
   - continue current vent settings
   - continue sedation with Fentanyl and will wean propofol
   - continue to diurese with goal -1 to -2 L
   - continue meropenem x 8 day course, day 3
   - RTC albuterol, ipratroprium nebs
   - continue home steroids
   - continue bactrim ppx
   - start fentanyl patch
   # S/P PEA Arrest: Likely secondary to hypoxic event, mucus plug.
   Completed rewarming. Concern for anxoic brain injury.   [**9-22**] head Ct
   with no pathology. EEG completed per neuro and without epileptiform
   discharges. Follows simple commands- would stick out tounge and smile
   today. Not responding to pain, verbal stimuli today.
   - daily wake ups off sedation to monitor mental status
   - monitor on tele
   - continue keppra for now
   # Fever: Had a fever prior to cooling, infection vs from acute
   stress/brain injury. Has pseudomonas in lungs.
   - given sputum susceptibilities, continue meropenem x 8 days, Day [**3-17**]
   today
   - monitor fever curve
   - blood, urine, sptutum cx today (may not mount fever since on steriods
   and tylenol)
   # Leukocytosis: elevated today.  s/p complete course of abx for
   cellulitis; on meropenem for probably pna
   - continue abx
   - monitor fever curve
   - CIS
   # Hypernatremia: elevated to 147 today
   - increase free water flushes to 100 q6 hours
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Sinus Tachycardia: had on admission, now returned after rewarming.
   Does not show evidence of bleeding. No PE on CTA. Concern for infection
   as cause, but on abx.  Bolused without improvement. No improvement with
   fentanyl.
   - monitor for now
   # Question of Seizure:  in setting of arrest, neuro following.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue keppra for now
   - MRI in future
   # Chronic Diastolic HF:  Stable
   - continue lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **] and IV PRN
   - I/O goal: -1-2L
   # Wrist fracture/Rib fracture/Osteoperosis: Pt had a traumatic
   mechanical fall at rehab prior to admission. Fracture of radius and
   ulna, reduced by ortho in ER. Has risk of bone fracture due to chronic
   high dose steriods.
   - ortho recs appreciated
 not planning on surgery.
   - on fentanyl, will start patch
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 53-year-old male, was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient underwent active internal rewarming and is currently on mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy. He is being sedated with Fentanyl and Propofol. The patient has large bilateral pleural effusions, which have not shown significant change on chest X-ray. The respiratory culture revealed the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient is receiving meropenem for suspected pneumonia. The patient's mental status is fluctuating, with occasional responsiveness to commands. He does not respond to pain or verbal stimuli. The patient has leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and sinus tachycardia. There are concerns about seizure activity, chronic diastolic heart failure, wrist and rib fractures, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus type II, anemia of iron deficiency, depression, a history of gastric ulcers, and recent cellulitis. The patient's current medications include Fentanyl patch, meropenem, albuterol, ipratroprium nebs, home steroids, bactrim prophylaxis, and Keppra. The plan includes continuing current vent settings, weaning Propofol, diuresis, daily wake-ups to monitor mental status, and monitoring for infection and electrolyte imbalance."

   FINDINGS: In comparison to the previous study of the same date there
   are low

   evaluation;
   large bilateral pleural effusions are probably unchanged. The
   tracheostomy
   tube and right central venous line are unchanged. Accurate evaluation
   of the
   NG tube below the level of the diaphragm is not possible.
   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo m admitted to MICU for respiratory distress and now s/p PEA
   arrest [**2126-9-20**] s/p Arctic Sun cooling protocol.
   # Respiratory Distress: Had acute respiratory distress yesterday AM
   with hypertension, tachycardia in setting of shutting off Fentanyl
   gtt.  Wheezing on exam.  CXR did not show much change from previous of
   known large bilateral pleural effusions.  ABG throughout was unchanged,
   but pt continued to have increased WOB and forced expiration. Bronch
   without large mucus plug or secretions.  Found to have cuff leak and
   changed ETT without improvement; pt without much tracheal cartilage
   left and appears will have residual cuff leak.  Per RT last night,
   applied PEEP 0, and concern that PEEP is not having much effect.
   - continue current vent settings
   - continue sedation with Fentanyl and propofol ( would favor weaning
   propofol today)
   - continue to diurese with goal -1 to -2 L
   - continue meropenem x 8 day course
   - RTC albuterol, ipratroprium nebs
   - continue home steroids
   - continue bactrim ppx
   # S/P PEA Arrest: Likely secondary to hypoxic event, mucus plug.
   Completed rewarming. Concern for anxoic brain injury.   [**9-22**] head Ct
   with no pathology. EEG completed per neuro and without epileptiform
   discharges. Not following commands. Not responding to pain, verbal
   stimuli today.
   - daily wake ups off sedation to monitor mental status
   - monitor on tele
   - continue keppra for now
   # Fever: Had a fever prior to cooling, infection vs from acute
   stress/brain injury. Has pseudomonas in lungs.
   - given sputum susceptibilities, continue meropenem x 8 days, Day [**3-17**]
   today
   - monitor fever curve
   # Leukocytosis: elevated today.  s/p complete course of abx for
   cellulitis; on meropenem for probably pna
   - continue abx
   - monitor fever curve
   - CIS
   # Hypernatremia: elevated to 147 today
   - increase free water flushes to 100 q6 hours
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # Sinus Tachycardia: had on admission, now returned after rewarming.
   Does not show evidence of bleeding. No PE on CTA. Concern for infection
   as cause, but on abx.  Bolused without improvement. No improvement with
   fentanyl.
   - monitor for now
   # Question of Seizure:  in setting of arrest, neuro following.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue keppra for now
   - MRI in future
   # Chronic Diastolic HF:  Stable
   - continue lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **]
   - I/O goal: -1-2L
   # Wrist fracture/Rib fracture/Osteoperosis: Pt had a traumatic
   mechanical fall at rehab prior to admission. Fracture of radius and
   ulna, reduced by ortho in ER. Has risk of bone fracture due to chronic
   high dose steriods.
   - ortho recs appreciated
 not planning on surgery.
   - on fentanyl
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male who was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for respiratory distress and later experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol. He has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, depression, type II diabetes mellitus, anemia of iron deficiency, gastric ulcers, and recent cellulitis. The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress with wheezing, hypertension, tachycardia, fever, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, sinus tachycardia, and potential seizure activity. He also has chronic osteoporosis, wrist fracture, rib fracture, and a risk of bone fractures due to chronic high-dose steroids. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with tracheostomy, and there is a concern about cuff leak and large bilateral pleural effusions. He is also receiving multiple medications including sedatives, antibiotics, diuretics, and other supportive treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation and the presence of large bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Pseudomonal infection: The patient has pseudomonas aeruginosa in his lungs, which may lead to a worsening respiratory infection.
3. Cuff leak: The tracheostomy tube cuff leak can result in aspiration pneumonia and ventilator-associated complications"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of COPD, osteoporosis, and a recent wrist fracture. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a PEA arrest and is currently critically ill. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has undergone tracheostomy placement. He has had several episodes of tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypertension, which were attributed to the weaning of sedation. The patient's echocardiogram showed RV failure with stable pulmonary pressures compared to prior imaging, and the cardiology team is comparing current echo imaging to prior imaging to assess if RV failure is new. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the episode of tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypertension. 

Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA): The patient has intermittent leak around the tracheostomy tube despite placement yesterday.
2. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure, and levetiracetam (Keppra) has been continued. Neurological recommendations are being followed up.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, and final echo results showed that left ventricular function is within normal limits. The patient will be diuresed with intravenous Lasix and will follow up with daily weights.
4. Respiratory Failure, Acute ("

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6115**] has been stable from a respiratory standpoint. His cuff
   leak is positional and he is ventilating without difficulty. This
   morning his mental status was briefly improved though since then there
   has been more concern for seizures. The neurology service is involved
   and another EEG will be performed. We will continue to support him on
   the vent and hope that his mental status improves further.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of COPD, osteoporosis, wrist fracture, and PEA arrest. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been critically ill. The patient's condition has been stable from a respiratory standpoint, but there have been concerns about seizures. The neurology service is involved, and an EEG will be performed. The patient will continue to be supported on the ventilator and will be monitored for further improvement in mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and there is a concern for volume overload. Diuretics will be used to manage this condition.
2. Seizures: The patient has experienced seizures, and there is ongoing concern for seizure activity. The neurology service is involved, and further evaluation with an EEG is planned.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest, and it is being monitored closely. The final echo read showed that left ventricular function is within normal limits.
4. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has tracheobronchomalacia, which has led to intermittent leaks in the tracheostomy tube. This condition will require ongoing management.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, and free water repletion has been initiated to address this electrolyte imbalance.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count"

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate
   global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal
   motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
   The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. Normal regional
   and global left ventricular systolic function. No pathologic valvular
   abnormality seen. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2126-5-8**], the right ventricle is better seen on the current
   study and appears to be dilated and hypokinetic. It may have been
   dilated and hypokinetic on the prior study also but image quality
   limits interpretation. The other findings are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo m admitted to MICU for respiratory distress and now s/p PEA
   arrest [**2126-9-20**] s/p Arctic Sun cooling protocol.
   # Seizure:  Possible seizure yesterday for 5 minutes
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue keppra at increased dose
   - awaiting 24 hour EEG
   - MRI in future
   # Respiratory Distress: Likely due to large cuff leaf given little
   tracheal cartilage.
   - continue current vent settings
   - continue sedation with Fentanyl and attempt again to wean propofol
   - continue to diurese with goal -1 to -2 L
   - continue meropenem x 8 day course, day 4
   - RTC albuterol, ipratroprium nebs
   - continue home steroids
   - continue bactrim ppx
   - cont Fentanyl patch
 will likely need uptitration
   # S/P PEA Arrest: Likely secondary to hypoxic event, mucus plug.
   Completed rewarming. Concern for anxoic brain injury.   [**9-22**] head Ct
   with no pathology. EEG completed per neuro and without epileptiform
   discharges
   - daily wake ups off sedation to monitor mental status
   - monitor on tele
   - continue keppra
   # Fever: Had a fever prior to cooling, infection vs from acute
   stress/brain injury. Has pseudomonas in lungs.
   - given sputum susceptibilities, continue meropenem x 8 days, Day [**4-17**]
   today
   - monitor fever curve
   - f/u cultures
   # Leukocytosis: Decreased today from 15
 11.  s/p complete course of
   abx for cellulitis; on meropenem for probably pna
   - continue abx
   - monitor fever curve
   - CIS
   - f/u cultures
   # Hypernatremia: corrected to 140
   - decrease free water to 50 q 6 hours
   # Sinus Tachycardia: had on admission, now returned after rewarming.
   Does not show evidence of bleeding. No PE on CTA. Concern for infection
   as cause, but on abx.  Bolused without improvement. No improvement with
   fentanyl.
   - monitor for now
   # Chronic Diastolic HF:  Stable
   - continue lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **] and IV PRN
   - I/O goal: -1-2L
   # Wrist fracture/Rib fracture/Osteoperosis: Pt had a traumatic
   mechanical fall at rehab prior to admission. Fracture of radius and
   ulna, reduced by ortho in ER. Has risk of bone fracture due to chronic
   high dose steriods.
   - ortho recs appreciated
 not planning on surgery.
   - on fentanyl, will start patch
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   # DM, type II:
   - continue SSI from nursing home
   # Anemia of iron def: stable
   - monitor hct
   - continue iron tablets
   - active T&S
   # Depression: stable
   - continue celexa
   # Hx of  gastric ulcers: no evidence of GI bleed at this time, no abd
   pain
   - can change to PPI once a day since now on home steroids dose
   # Hx of recent cellulitis: completed course of vanco
   - monitor for infection
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   # Code:  Full per HCP

The patient was then placed back on propofol and fentanyl.

Allergies include codeine, unknown; Compazine (Oral) (Prochlorperazine Maleate), unknown; penicillins, rash; itchiness; metformin, nausea/vomiting; and heparin agents, unknown. The last dose of antibiotics was Bactrim (SMX/TMP) on 09/23/26 at 08:04 AM, cefepime on 09/23/26 at 10:03 AM, vancomycin on 09/24/26 at 08:00 AM, and meropenem on 09/26/26 at 12:00 AM.

The patient is currently on infusions of fentanyl (concentrate) at 100 mcg/hour and pantoprazole (Protonix) at 40 mg every 12 hours. Other medications include fentanyl, given at 12:30 PM on 09/25/26, and pantoprazole (Protonix), started at 12:00 AM on 09/26/26.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tmax: 37.6 C (99.6 F), Tcurrent: 37.4 C (99.4 F), HR: 101 (92 - 125) bpm, BP: 98/64 (76) mmHg, RR: 16 (10 - 23) inspiratory/min, and SpO2: 91%.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 9 (6 - 9) mmHg, with total in/out fluid balance being -1,135 mL (-1,135 mL) and total blood products out being 3,705 mL (705 mL). Respiratory support includes O2 delivery via tracheostomy tube, ventilator mode set at CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, Vt (set) at 550 (500 - 550) mL, RR (set) at 12, RR (spontaneous) at 1, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, PIP at 28 cmH2O, and plateau at 10 cmH2O. The ABG results show PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 154 and Ve at 5.6 L/min.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo m admitted to MICU for respiratory distress and now s/p PEA
   arrest [**2126-9-20**] s/p Arctic Sun cooling protocol.
   # Seizure:  Possible seizure yesterday for 5 minutes
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue keppra at increased dose
   - awaiting 24 hour EEG
   - MRI in future
   # Respiratory Distress: Likely due to large cuff leaf given little
   tracheal cartilage.
   - continue current vent settings
   - continue sedation with Fentanyl and attempt again to wean propofol
   - continue to diurese with goal -1 to -2 L
   - continue meropenem x 8 day course, day 4
   - RTC albuterol, ipratroprium nebs
   - continue home steroids
   - continue bactrim ppx
   - cont Fentanyl patch
 will likely need uptitration
   # S/P PEA Arrest: Likely secondary to hypoxic event, mucus plug.
   Completed rewarming. Concern for anxoic brain injury.   [**9-22**] head Ct
   with no pathology. EEG completed per neuro and without epileptiform
   discharges
   - daily wake ups off sedation to monitor mental status
   - monitor on tele
   - continue keppra
   # Fever: Had a fever prior to cooling, infection vs from acute
   stress/brain injury. Has pseudomonas in lungs.
   - given sputum susceptibilities, continue meropenem x 8 days, Day [**4-17**]
   today
   - monitor fever curve
   - f/u cultures
   # Leukocytosis: Decreased today from 15
 11.  s/p complete course of
   abx for cellulitis; on meropenem for probably pna
   - continue abx
   - monitor fever curve
   - CIS
   - f/u cultures
   # Hypernatremia: corrected to 140
   - decrease free water to 50 q 6 hours
   # Sinus Tachycardia: had on admission, now returned after rewarming.
   Does not show evidence of bleeding. No PE on CTA. Concern for infection
   as cause, but on abx.  Bolused without improvement. No improvement with
   fentanyl.
   - monitor for now
   # Chronic Diastolic HF:  Stable
   - continue lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **] and IV PRN
   - I/O goal: -1-2L
   # Wrist fracture/Rib fracture/Osteoperosis: Pt had a traumatic
   mechanical fall at rehab prior to admission. Fracture of radius and
   ulna, reduced by ortho in ER. Has risk of bone fracture due to chronic
   high dose steriods.
   - ortho recs appreciated
 not planning on surgery.
   - on fentanyl, will start patch
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   # DM, type II:
   - continue SSI from nursing home
   # Anemia of iron def: stable
   - monitor hct
   - continue iron tablets
   - active T&S
   # Depression: stable
   - continue celexa
   # Hx of  gastric ulcers: no evidence of GI bleed at this time, no abd
   pain
   - can change to PPI once a day since now on home steroids dose
   # Hx of recent cellulitis: completed course of vanco
   - monitor for infection

","The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and post-cardiac arrest. He underwent an Arctic Sun cooling protocol. The patient's medical history includes depression, type II diabetes mellitus, anemia of chronic disease, gastric ulcers, and a recent episode of cellulitis. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 98/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (15.2 K/uL), slightly decreased hematocrit (29.0%), and normal platelet count (293 K/uL). Other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient's recent imaging studies include a CT scan of the head, which showed no pathology, and a CTA that did not reveal any signs of pulmonary embolism.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:
1. Seizure: The patient had a possible seizure yesterday. Neurological recommendations include continuing Kendra at an increased dose, awaiting a 24-hour EEG, and considering an MRI in the future.
2. Respiratory Distress: The likely cause of the respiratory distress is a large cuff leak due to little tracheal cartilage. Current vent settings should be continued, along with sedation using Fentanyl"

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate
   global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal
   motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
   The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. Normal regional
   and global left ventricular systolic function. No pathologic valvular
   abnormality seen. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2126-5-8**], the right ventricle is better seen on the current
   study and appears to be dilated and hypokinetic. It may have been
   dilated and hypokinetic on the prior study also but image quality
   limits interpretation. The other findings are similar.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and post-cardiac arrest. The patient had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol. The patient experienced a seizure yesterday for about 5 minutes, and it is planned to follow up with neuro recommendations. The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to a large cuff leak given little tracheal cartilage. The plan is to continue current ventilator settings, continue sedation with fentanyl, attempt to wean propofol, continue diuresis with a goal of -1 to -2 liters, continue meropenem for an 8-day course, return albuterol and ipratroprium nebs, continue home steroids, continue bactrim prophylaxis, and continue fentanyl patch with likely uptitration.

The patient's post-PEA arrest is likely secondary to hypoxic events and mucus plug. The rewarming has been completed, and there is concern for anoxic brain injury. A head CT was performed on [**9-22**] with no pathology, and an EEG was completed per neuro and without epileptiform discharges. It is planned to have daily wake-ups off sedation to monitor mental status, monitor on tele, continue keppra, and monitor for infection.

The patient has leukocytosis, which decreased from 15 to 11.1 after completing a course of antibiotics for cellul"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions and complications. Here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Chief Complaint: Right arm fracture, PEA arrest.
   - The patient had a right arm fracture and experienced a PEA (Pulseless Electrical Activity) arrest, which indicates a life-threatening cardiac event.

2. Allergies:
   - The patient is allergic to codeine, Compazine (prochlorperazine maleate), penicillins, metformin, heparin agents, and Ativan (lorazepam).
   - Allergies can lead to adverse reactions if exposed to these allergens, potentially causing anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions.

3. 24-Hour Events:
   - The patient appeared to have several seizures with rigidity and arching of the back, which resolved with sedation.
   - An echocardiogram (echo) showed RV hypokinesis, but it is unclear if it is a new or old finding because RV was not well visualized on the prior echo.
   - The patient failed a trial of pressure support (PS) ventilation this morning.
   - Seizures, changes in heart function, and ventilatory support requirements indicate neurological, cardiac, and respiratory complications.

4. Infusions:
   - The patient is receiving Fentanyl (concentrate) at 100 mcg/hour and Propof"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and subsequent PEA arrest. The patient underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol.

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications:

1. Seizure: The patient had another likely seizure with rigidity, which was controlled with Ativan. Neurological assessments suggest that the patient could have a reasonable prognosis given his intermittent responsiveness to commands. Further neurologic follow-up is recommended, along with titrating up keppra on Saturday and Tuesday, obtaining a 24-hour EEG, and considering an MRI in the future.

2. Respiratory Distress: The underlying cause of the respiratory distress is likely COPD and cuff leak. The plan is to stop fentanyl gtt, continue patch, conduct a trial of pressure support (PS) this afternoon, continue diuresis with a goal of -1 to -2 L, continue meropenem x 14-day course starting on day 5, restart albuterol and ipratroprium nebs, continue home steroids, and continue bactrim ppx.

3. S/P PEA Arrest: There is concern for anoxic brain injury. A head CT performed on [**9-22**] showed no pathology. The plan is to continue following neurologic recommendations and follow-up report of EEG, monitor mental status, keep the patient on tele, continue keppra, and consider an MRI in the future.

4. Fever: The patient is being treated for pseudomonal ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Given sputum susceptibilities, meropenem will be continued for 14 days, starting today. The plan is to monitor the fever curve, follow-up cultures, and continue abx.

5. Leukocytosis: The white blood cell count is slightly up from yesterday (11 -> 13), and C. difficile is negative. The patient has completed a full course of antibiotics for cellulitis and is now on meropenem for presumed pneumonia. The plan is to continue abx, monitor fever curve, check CIS, and follow-up cultures.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated again, reaching 151 this morning. The plan is to increase free water to 150 ml Q4, consider diabetes insipidus, and correct the free water deficit with D5W today.

7. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient had sinus tachycardia on admission, which has now returned. There is no evidence of bleeding, and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed no pulmonary embolism (PE). The concern is infection as a cause, but the patient is already on antibiotics. The patient was bolused without improvement, and no improvement was seen with fentanyl.

8. Chronic Diastolic HF: The patient's chronic diastolic heart failure is stable. The plan is to continue lasix 60 IV BID and maintain an I/O goal of"

The patient has experienced multiple medical complications, including seizures, respiratory distress likely due to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), fever with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), leukocytosis, hypernatremia, sinus tachycardia, chronic diastolic heart failure, wrist and rib fractures, osteoporosis, type II diabetes mellitus, anemia of iron deficiency, depression, gastric ulcers, and recent cellulitis.

3. The patient has undergone various treatments and interventions, including cooling protocol for PEA arrest, administration of ativan for seizures, titration of keppra, MRI in the future, diuresis, meropenem for VAP, albuterol and ipratroprium nebs for respiratory distress, home steroids, bactrim prophylaxis, fentanyl patch, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation.

4. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/77 mmHg to 141/132 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 91%, and a central venous pressure ("

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Based on the provided progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is an ongoing issue with intermittent tracheal leak and increased resistance from a 6.0 long tracheostomy tube. The plan involves increasing PEEP to 8 and discontinuing fentanyl to attempt a pressure support trial later in the day.

2. Pseudomonal Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonal pneumonia, which is being treated with meropenem. However, the sputum culture still shows sparse gram-negative rods, indicating that the infection may not be fully controlled.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is being managed by repleting with intravenous D5W (5% dextrose in water) and per NG (nasogastric) tube. This suggests an electrolyte imbalance that needs correction.

4. Fracture: The patient has a right arm fracture, and repeat films are recommended to assess the fracture's progress.

5. Seizure: The patient experienced another episode of rigidity, indicating seizure activity. The plan involves increasing the dose of Keppra (levetiracetam) to 1g IV q12 (every 12 hours) to manage the seizures.

6. Cardiac Arrest: The patient has"

   add the following points:
   Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 8860**] seemed to be seizing when the sedation was weaned. EEG
   apparently not convincing for seizure activity. He remains on the vent.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill male with a right arm fracture and a previous episode of PEA arrest. The patient has been experiencing rigidity and did not tolerate a pressure support trial. The patient's allergies include codeine, Compazine, penicillins, metformin, heparin agents, and lorazepam. The last dose of antibiotics was meropenem at 12:00 AM on 9/27. The patient is currently on various medications including fentanyl, lorazepam, HISS, fondaparinux, colace, prednisone, senna, mirapex, vitamin D, ASA, Tylenol, Bactrim, celexa, calcium carbonate, atrovent, lasix, protonix, meropenem, and fentanyl patch.

24-hour events include the discontinuation of propofol, another episode of rigidity given 2 Ativan, recommendation for a short arm case, and getting a repeat X-ray of the arm. The patient's sputum showed sparse gram-negative rods, and there was an increase in the dose of Keppra to 1g. The patient has multiple medical complications such as tracheobronchomalacia, seizure, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, fracture, and others.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
- Heart rate: 110 bpm
- Blood pressure: 123/77 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 91%
- Central venous pressure: 8 mmHg

The patient's lab results show:
- Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
- White blood cell count: 342 K/uL
- Platelet count: 325 K/uL
- Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 140 mg/dL

The patient's imaging shows a stable chest X-ray with low lung volumes.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several ongoing issues including tracheobronchomalacia, seizure, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, hypernatremia, fracture, and others. The plan includes increasing PEEP to 8, discontinuing fentanyl, and repeating a pressure support trial. The patient will also be given IV D5W for hypernatremia and per NG tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia: This condition involves weakness and collapse of the walls of the trachea and bronchi. It can lead to respiratory distress and recurrent infections.
2. Seizure: The patient has experienced episodes of rigidity and has been on Keppra, an antiepileptic medication. Seizures can be caused by various factors, including brain injury or infection.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient had"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and cardiac arrest. He has a history of COPD, and his current condition is complicated by several medical complications.

1. Seizure: The patient had likely seizures, but EEG results were inconclusive. Neurological recommendations include following up on the final EEG results and considering an increase in lorazepam if necessary.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient likely has underlying COPD and cuff leak contributing to his respiratory distress. Recommendations include stopping fentanyl drip, continuing patch, trying pressure support again, and continuing diuresis with a goal of -1 to -2 liters of lasix drip per hour.

3. S/P PEA Arrest: The patient had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, and there is concern for anoxic brain injury. A head CT showed no pathology, and the patient should continue to follow neurological recommendations and follow-up EEG report.

4. Fever: The patient's fever spiked again, and he is being treated for pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The plan includes continuing meropenem for 14 days and monitoring the fever curve. Repeat cultures will be followed up.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated from the previous day, and C. difficile is negative. He completed a course of antibiotics for cellulitis and is now on meropenem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and now post-cardiac arrest. He has a history of seizure, respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, fracture, and other medical conditions. The patient's current medications include fentanyl, lasix, meropenem, ativan, pantoprazole, lorazepam, and keppra. He is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving 50% FiO2 and 8 cmH2O PEEP. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 107/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal electrolyte levels. The sputum gram stain reveals gram-negative rods and budding yeast with pseudohyphae. The patient has been treated for pneumonia and is being followed up for further cultures and assessment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and history of COPD increase the risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
2. Infection: The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and sputum gram stain indicating gram-negative rods suggest an ongoing infection. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, fever curve, and cultures is necessary"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Remains ventilated. Still having clonic movements when sedation
   lightened which has become a major impediment to accurately assessing
   mental status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of steroid-dependent COPD, tuberculous brain (TBM), diastolic heart failure, chronic tracheostomy, and wrist fracture. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial in nature. The patient has been sedated and altered, making it difficult to obtain a complete medical history. He has ongoing abnormal motor activity, which could potentially be a seizure. The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics for pneumonia, diuretics for heart failure, and antiepileptic drugs. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/71 mmHg to 154/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, trace edema in the lower extremities, and distended abdomen. His laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets, but elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, and potassium. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level. The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU, and his code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can be attributed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and subsequent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He has a history of depression, gastric ulcers, diabetes type II, anemia of iron deficiency, wrist fracture, rib fracture, osteoporosis, and long-term use of steroids. The patient's current condition includes intermittent responsiveness to commands, respiratory distress likely due to underlying COPD and cuff leak, agitation off all sedation, hypernatremia resolved to 143, sinus tachycardia, and fevers being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with pseudomonas.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient had a seizure in the past but did not require Ativan recently. Neurological recommendations suggest following up on the final EEG result.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory distress due to underlying COPD and cuff leak. He is currently on CPAP during the day and A/C at night, and the PEEP may need to be adjusted.
3. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has elevated bicarbonate levels indicating metabolic alkalosis. Further evaluation of the cause and appropriate management should be considered.
4. S/P PEA Arrest: The patient had a PEA arrest and is at risk for anoxic brain injury. Neurological recommendations and follow-up reports of EEG will help determine the extent of brain injury.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and cardiac arrest.
- He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol.
- The patient experienced a seizure and is currently on keppra.
- He has tracheobronchomalacia, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, a fracture, and a history of seizures, respiratory distress, and type II diabetes.
- The patient has been treated for VAP with meropenem and now also has a blood culture showing GPC.
- He has hypernatremia, sinus tachycardia, wrist fracture, rib fracture, osteoporosis, depression, a history of gastric ulcers, and is on multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and acute respiratory failure indicate a potential complication in his respiratory system. Close monitoring and management of the patient's ventilation and oxygenation parameters are essential.
2. Infection: The presence of fevers, positive blood cultures for GPC, and previous treatment for VAP suggest the possibility of ongoing or new infections. It is important to closely monitor the patient's temperature curve and follow up with repeat cultures to identify any changes or new pathogens.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels indicate hypernatremia. This condition can lead to"

   arrest [**2126-9-20**] s/p Arctic Sun cooling protocol.
   # Seizure:  Had last Sz activey on Friday. Yesterday did not required
   ativan. Neuro believes that he could have a reasonable prognosis given
   his intermittent responsiveness to commands.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - keppra was increased to 1000/1500mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - f/u on final EEG result
   - Bavona trach contains metal so pt. cannot get MRI
   - conitnue off fentanyl gtt
   # Respiratory Distress: Likely [**2-11**] underlying COPD and cuff leak. Also
   appears agitated off all sedation. Yesterday was started on propofol
   low dose.
   - fentanyl patch
   - Continue CPAP during day, A/C at night
   - check VBG
 consider decreasing PEEP
   - Restart lasix gtt with goal -1 L/day
   - continue meropenem x 14 day course, day 6
   - RTC albuterol, ipratroprium nebs
   - continue home steroids
   - continue bactrim ppx
   # Metabolic alkalosis: elevated bicarbonate
   - check PM lytes
   - K > 4.5 for goal
   # S/P PEA Arrest:  Concern for anxoic brain injury.   [**9-22**] head Ct with
   no pathology.  Will continue to follow neuro recs and follow up report
   of EEG. Will reassess goals of care on Tuesday with sister.
   - follow mental status
   - monitor on tele
   - continue keppra at increased dose
   # Fevers: Being treated for VAP with pseudamonas. Now also has a blood
   cx from [**9-27**] with GPC in one bottle. WBC is mproved today to 13.
   - given sputum susceptibilities, continue meropenem x 14 days, Day [**7-23**]
   today
   - started vanco after repeat blood cx on [**9-28**] for 14 day course, will
   stop if contaminent
   - monitor fever curve
   - f/u repeat cultures
   - continue CVL for now; if more BCx +, will d/c line and attempt PIV
   access
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved to 143
   - free water 150ml Q4 with tube feeds
   - check PM lytes
   # Sinus Tachycardia: had on admission, now returned after rewarming.
   Does not show evidence of bleeding. No PE on CTA. Concern for infection
   as cause, but on abx.  Bolused without improvement. No improvement with
   fentanyl.
   - monitor for now
   # Wrist fracture/Rib fracture/Osteoperosis: Per ortho does not need
   further operative mgmt. Will need to consider bisphosphonate for outpt.
   Given long Hx w/ steroids.
   - ortho recs appreciated
 not planning on surgery
   - Fentanyl patch
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge

 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS:
   no current evidence for seizure continue keppra.
 CARDIAC ARREST:
   mental status not recovering, may still be partly delirius in context
   of infection, and sedating medications. Continue to monitor on minimal
   sedation.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]);
   check VBG, consider decreasing PEEP and FIO2. Continue lasix drip, but
   aggressively replete Cl with KCL, target K 4.5.
 FRACTURE, OTHER:
   continue cast, need OR in near future
 Bacteremia: contaminant vs pathogen, follow up surveillance
   peripheral cultures, and organism ID. Contineu empiric vanco. Will
   assess for need for CVL removal.
 sedation: wean propfol to off, increase fentanyl patch to 75mcg/hr.

   Assessment and Plan
 TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA)
   with long trach, will consider surgical trach in am of larger caliber.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS:
   no current evidence for seizure continue keppra.
 CARDIAC ARREST:
   mental status not recovering, may still be partly delirius in context
   of infection, and sedating medications. Continue to monitor on minimal
   sedation.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]);
   check VBG, consider decreasing PEEP and FIO2. Continue lasix drip, but
   aggressively replete Cl with KCL, target K 4.5.
 FRACTURE, OTHER:
   continue cast, need OR in near future
 Bacteremia: contaminant vs pathogen, follow up surveillance
   peripheral cultures, and organism ID. Contineu empiric vanco. Will
   assess for need for CVL removal.
 sedation: wean propfol to off, increase fentanyl patch to 75mcg/hr.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and has since experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient underwent an Arctic Sun cooling protocol and is currently on CPAP with intermittent responsiveness to commands. He had a seizure last Friday, but no recent activity has been reported.

The patient is suspected to have underlying COPD and a cuff leak contributing to his respiratory distress. He is off all sedation, including fentanyl and propofol. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/76 to 92/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has been treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is currently on a 14-day course of meropenem. He also has a positive Clostridium difficile toxin and is being treated with flagyl IV and vancomycin PO. The patient's metabolic alkalosis is being managed with electrolyte monitoring and potassium repletion.

The patient has a history of anoxic brain injury, but a head CT showed no pathology. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is planned for further evaluation. The patient's sinus tachycardia returned after rewarming and is being monitored without improvement. No"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has a positive stool culture for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and is being treated with flagyl IV and vancomycin. This indicates an active infection in the gastrointestinal tract.

2. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows a total intake of 3,860 mL and a total output of 3,700 mL, resulting in a balance of 160 mL. The daily weight gain of 5.5 kg suggests fluid overload.

3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory support indicates the need for mechanical ventilation, specifically CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 526 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 6 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 93, indicating poor respiratory function.

4. Neurological issues: The patient has experienced a seizure and had an abnormal EEG. The neurologic examination findings are not assessed, indicating a need for further evaluation.

5. Cardiac concerns: The patient had a cardiac arrest, and the blood pressure readings are frequently low, suggesting possible cardiac dysfunction.

6. Gastrointestinal problems: The patient's review of systems mentions nausea and vomiting, and the laboratory results show an elevated white blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo m admitted to MICU for respiratory distress and now s/p PEA
   arrest [**2126-9-20**] s/p Arctic Sun cooling protocol.
   # Respiratory Distress: Likely [**2-11**] underlying COPD and cuff leak. Also
   appears agitated off all sedation. Off sedation currently
   - Continue sedation with propofol
   - fentanyl patch 72
   - continue pressure support
   - Restart lasix gtt with goal -1 L/day
 likely more room for diuresis
   given sedation now off; [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue meropenem x 14 day course, day 8
   - RTC albuterol, ipratroprium nebs
   - continue home steroids
   - continue bactrim ppx
   # Seizure:  Had last Sz activity on Friday. Neuro believes that he
   could have a reasonable prognosis given his intermittent responsiveness
   to commands.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - keppra was increased to 1000/1500mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Bavona trach contains metal so pt. cannot get MRI
   - continue off sedation (off fentanyl and propofol)
   # Fevers: Being treated for VAP with pseudamonas. Now also has a blood
   cx from [**9-27**] with GPC in one bottle, contaminant. Likely febrile from +
   c. diff infection.
   - given sputum susceptibilities, continue meropenem x 14 days, Day [**8-23**]
   today
   - will keep vancomycin on until 48h negative cultures. Surveillance cx
   today.
   - monitor fever curve
   - f/u repeat cultures
   # C. Diff Infection: + yesterday
   - on po vanco and IV flagyl Day #1
   # Metabolic alkalosis: elevated bicarbonate
   - check PM lytes
   - K > 4.5 for goal
   - [**Hospital1 **] 40 meq KCL standing
   # S/P PEA Arrest:  Concern for anxoic brain injury.   [**9-22**] head Ct with
   no pathology.  Will continue to follow neuro recs and follow up report
   of EEG. Will reassess goals of care on Tuesday with sister.
   - follow mental status
   - monitor on tele
   - continue keppra
   # Sinus Tachycardia: had on admission, now returned after rewarming.
   Does not show evidence of bleeding. No PE on CTA. Concern for infection
   as cause, but on abx.  Bolused without improvement. No improvement with
   fentanyl.
   - monitor for now
   # Wrist fracture/Rib fracture/Osteoperosis: Per ortho does not need
   further operative mgmt. Will need to consider bisphosphonate for outpt.
   Given long Hx w/ steroids.
   - ortho recs appreciated
 not planning on surgery, CT wrist if this is
   reasonable for goals of care
   - Fentanyl patch
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   # DM, type II:
   - continue SSI from nursing home
   # Anemia of iron def: stable,
   - monitor hct
   - continue iron tablets
   - active T&S
   - Minimize blood draws
   # Depression: stable
   - continue celexa
   # Hx of  gastric ulcers: no evidence of GI bleed at this time, no abd
   pain

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of PEA arrest and a right arm fracture. They are currently in the ICU and have been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, intermittent leak around trach, and tracheobronchomalacia. The patient has allergies to codeine, Compazine, penicillins, metformin, heparin agents, and Ativan. They have been receiving various medications including propofol, furosemide, pantoprazole, HISS, fondaparinux, colace, senna, mirapex, vitamin D, aspirin, bactrim, celexa, calcium, free water, ferrous sulfate, chlorhexidine, atrovent, prednisone, keppra, hydrocortisone cream, fentanyl patch, KCL, flagyl, and vancomycin.

24-hour events include being found C. difficile positive and having intermittent leaks around the tracheostomy. The patient's allergies, medications, medical and family history, review of systems, and physical examination findings are also documented.

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, Hct, and Plt, while TCO2 and Glucose levels are within normal range. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, Lactic Acid, Albumin, Ca++, Mg++, and PO4 are also provided. Imaging shows stable chest X-ray, and microbiology indicates a C. difficile positive result.

Assessment and plan include tracheobronchomalacia, seizure without status epilepticus, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, fracture, C. difficile infection, and CNS infection. The plan involves upsizing the tracheostomy, continuing Keppra, assessing mental status, weaning FiO2 and PEEP, providing pressure support, repleting Chloride with KCL, continuing meropenem, and monitoring for pseudomonal pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of tracheobronchomalacia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and further respiratory failure. There is also a risk of infection due to the presence of C. difficile and potential CNS infection. The patient's cardiac status should be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
 TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA):
   Consult thoracic surgery to upsize his tracheostomy today.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS:
   contineu Keppra no further evidence of clinical sz, EEG was negative.
 CARDIAC ARREST:
   contineu to assess mental status, worsened by infection, likely
   delirium underlying
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]):
   wean FiO2 to 50, and if tolerated wean PEEP to 5, Continue pressure
   support, follow VBG, rising PCO2 is in context of metabolic alkalosis
   from diuresis, will continue to replete Chloride with KCL goal K 4.5.
   Unlikely to tolerate trach mask without upsizing his trach. Will
   discuss with sister. Continue meropenem for pseudomonal pneumonia
 FRACTURE, OTHER:
   continue cast, CT arm needed down the line.
 C.diff: started on po vanco and flagyl
CNS in blood: contaminnant vs true infection, follow up cx from [**9-29**]
   if negative by tomorrow will d/c iv vanco, resend cultures today.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   He remains ventilated though is currently on PSV 5/0 with TVs in 300
   He continues to follow some commands at times but remains mostly
   non-interactive.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They were admitted to the ICU due to a PEA arrest and have a right arm fracture. The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, intermittent leak around the tracheostomy, and tracheobronchomalacia. They are currently on mechanical ventilation and have been experiencing episodes of seizures. The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to delirium or underlying infection. They have a history of cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, effusion, poor mental status, recent cardiac arrest, right arm fracture, and C. difficile infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has tracheobronchomalacia, which is a weakness in the walls of the trachea and bronchi. This condition can lead to airway collapse during breathing, causing respiratory distress.
2. C. difficile Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colon inflammation. This infection can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. This indicates significant lung dysfunction and the inability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Poor Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to delirium or underlying infection. Delirium is a serious condition that can lead to confusion, disorientation, and cognitive impairment."

   # Respiratory Distress: Likely [**2-11**] underlying COPD and cuff leak. Also
   appears agitated off all sedation.
   - Low dose propofol
   - Continue fentanyl patch 72
   - Uptitrate Seroquel to 100 TID while decreasing/shutting off propofol
   - CTS/IP for upsizing of trach
   - Continue pressure support; follow VBGs
   - continue pressure support
   - Restart lasix gtt with goal -1 L/day, [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue meropenem day [**9-23**], colistin and tobramycin for pseudomonal
   infection, ID following
   - RTC albuterol, ipratroprium nebs
   - continue home steroids
   - continue bactrim ppx
   # Seizure:  Had last Sz activity on Friday. Neuro believes that he
   could have a reasonable prognosis given his intermittent responsiveness
   to commands. Bavona trach contains metal so pt. cannot get MRI
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue keppra 1000/1500mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - daily wake ups to assess mental status
   # Fevers: Being treated for VAP with pseudamonas. Now also has a blood
   cx from [**9-27**] with GPC in one bottle, likely contaminant.  Also now
   found to have meropenem
 resistant pseudomonas.  Also with c.
   difficile infection
   - Continue meropenem, colistin, and tobramycin per ID
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u all culture
   - monitor fever curve
   - consider re-site CVL vs. PICC
   # C. Diff Infection:
   - on po vanco Day 2
   # Metabolic alkalosis: Elevated bicarbonate.
   - check PM lytes
   - K > 4.5 for goal
   - [**Hospital1 **] 40 meq KCL standing
   # S/P PEA Arrest:  Concern for anxoic brain injury.   [**9-22**] head CT with
   no pathology.  No MRI given metal in trach
   - address goals of care today with HCP
   - follow mental status
   - monitor on tele
   - continue keppra
   # Sinus Tachycardia: had on admission, now returned after rewarming.
   Does not show evidence of bleeding. No PE on CTA. Bolused without
   improvement. No improvement with fentanyl. Continues to be stable. [**Month (only) 60**]
   be due to brain injury / multiple infections.
   - monitor
   # Wrist fracture/Rib fracture/Osteoperosis: Per ortho does not need
   further operative mgmt. Will need to consider bisphosphonate for outpt.
   Given long Hx w/ steroids.
   - ortho recs appreciated
 not planning on surgery, CT wrist if this is
   reasonable for goals of care
   - Fentanyl patch
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   # DM, type II:
   - continue SSI from nursing home
   # Anemia of iron def: stable,
   - monitor hct
   - continue iron tablets

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 53-year-old male, was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol and has since been on mechanical ventilation. The patient appears agitated when not sedated and has intermittent responsiveness to commands.

The patient's current assessment includes respiratory distress due to likely underlying COPD and cuff leak, seizure activity, fever, Clostridium difficile infection, metabolic alkalosis, sinus tachycardia, wrist fracture, rib fracture, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus type II, anemia of chronic disease, depression, and a history of gastric ulcers.

The patient has been treated with various medications, including low-dose propofol, fentanyl patch, uptitrated Seroquel, tracheostomy with cuffed tracheostomy tube, pressure support, Lasix, meropenem, colistin, tobramycin, Bavona tracheostomy, albuterol and ipratroprium nebs, home steroids, bactrim ppx, keppra, and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 126 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/73 to 135/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose levels, and serum potassium.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. The presence of fever and positive blood culture for pseudomonas suggests a possible infection.

2. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, which can lead to severe diarrhea and colitis. Appropriate treatment with vancomycin should be continued.

3. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has elevated bicarbonate levels, indicating metabolic alkalosis. Monitoring potassium levels and adjusting electrolyte management is crucial to prevent complications such as cardiac arrhythmias.

4. Seizure activity: The patient has had seizure activity, and seizure prophylaxis with keppra should be continued.

5. Sinus tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be due to brain injury, multiple infections, or other underlying conditions. Monitoring the heart rate and addressing any potential causes is important.

6. Wrist fracture, rib fracture, and osteoporosis: The patient has sustained fractures and osteoporosis, which may increase the risk of further bone complications. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation, as well as considering bisphosphonate therapy at discharge, should be considered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and subsequent pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He underwent an Arctic Sun cooling protocol and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient appears agitated off all sedation and has a history of COPD. He also has a wrist fracture, rib fracture, and osteoporosis, which do not require further operative management. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including diabetes type II, anemia of chronic disease, depression, and a history of gastric ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Cultures have shown the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to certain antibiotics.
2. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI): The patient has been diagnosed with CDI, for which he is receiving oral vancomycin.
3. Fevers: The patient is experiencing fevers, likely due to the ongoing infection. Blood cultures have revealed gram-negative rods, possibly contaminants, and meropenem-resistant Pseudomonas.
4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has elevated bicarbonate levels, indicating metabolic alkalosis.
5. Sepsis: The patient's clinical presentation suggests sepsis due to the presence of multiple infections and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 53-year-old male, was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has a history of COPD and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He is also being treated for pseudomonal infection, C. difficile infection, and anemia of iron deficiency. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains agitated and has intermittent responsiveness to commands. He has multiple comorbidities including depression, diabetes type II, osteoporosis, and a history of gastric ulcers. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies show a small to moderate right pleural effusion and low lung volumes. The patient is expected to have a reasonable prognosis given his intermittent responsiveness to commands.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
2. Pseudomonal infection: The patient has a moderate growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in his respiratory culture, which is resistant to several antibiotics. There is a need for appropriate antibiotic therapy based on the sensitivity pattern.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient has a positive C. difficile test, indicating an infection. Treatment with vancomycin or other appropriate antibiotics should be initiated.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and cardiac arrest. He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol and has since been on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of COPD and shows signs of agitation off sedation. He was previously on sedation with propofol and fentanyl.

The patient has several medical complications including tracheobronchomalacia, seizure activity, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, fracture of the wrist and rib, and osteoporosis. He also has a diagnosis of type II diabetes, anemia of iron deficiency, depression, and a history of gastric ulcers.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 126 bpm, blood pressure of 106/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, bilateral bronchial sounds, and no abdominal tenderness.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and troponin T levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing sedation with propofol, restarting Lasix with a goal of -1 L/day, monitoring for seizure activity, treating for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with meropenem, managing Clostridium difficile infection, and monitoring electroly"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of PEA arrest, tracheobronchomalacia, seizure, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, bacteremia, C. difficile infection, and fracture. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 113/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is unresponsive and has poor mental status. He is receiving antibiotics for pseudomonal pneumonia and diuretics for fluid management. His white blood cell count is elevated, and he has a right pleural effusion on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised due to tracheobronchomalacia and pneumonia. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration and the need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection and bacteremia. There is a risk of ongoing or recurrent infections, particularly with the use of antibiotics.
3. Cardiac Issues: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, as indicated by the recent cardiac arrest. There is a risk of arrhythmias or further cardiac complications.
4. Neurological Status: The patient's mental status is poor, indicating possible neurological impairment. There is a risk of further neurological decline"

   HISTORY: Tracheostomy, to evaluate for change.
   FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**9-30**], there is little interval
   change.
   Right pleural effusion and low lung volumes are unchanged. Monitoring
   and
   support devices remain in place. Upper lungs are clear and there is no
   evidence of pneumothorax.
   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo m admitted to MICU for respiratory distress and now s/p PEA
   arrest [**2126-9-20**] s/p Arctic Sun cooling protocol, seizures, and
   pseudomanas-pneumonia.
   # Respiratory Distress: Likely [**2-11**] underlying COPD and cuff leak. Also
   appears agitated off all sedation.
   - Low dose propofol, try to wean
   - Continue fentanyl patch 72
   - Continue Seroquel to 100 TID while decreasing/shutting off propofol,
   f/u EKG for QT prolongation
   - appreciate ID recs: need to touch base about tobramycin dosing
   - IP for upsizing of trach in OR today
   - Continue pressure support; follow VBGs
   - attempt to decreased FiO2 today
   - Restart lasix gtt with goal -1 L/day, [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - continue meropenem day [**10-23**], colistin and tobramycin(day2) for
   pseudomonal infection, ID following
   - RTC albuterol, ipratroprium nebs
   - continue home steroids
   - continue bactrim ppx
   # Seizure:  Had last Sz activity last Friday. Neuro believes that he
   could have a reasonable prognosis given his intermittent responsiveness
   to commands. Bavona trach contains metal so pt. cannot get MRI
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue keppra 1000/1500mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - daily wake ups to assess mental status
   - family would like to pursue MRI if possible to assess neurological
   status
   # Fevers: Being treated for VAP with pseudamonas. Now also has a blood
   cx from [**9-27**] with GPC in one bottle, likely contaminant.  Also now
   found to have meropenem
 resistant pseudomonas.  Also with c.
   difficile infection
   - Continue meropenem, colistin, and tobramycin per ID
   - cont PO Vanc for Cdiff
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u all culture data
   - monitor fever curve
   -consider CTA in near future for ? PE if low grade fevers do not
   resolve
   # C. Diff Infection: Decreasing diarrhea overnight.
   - on po vanco Day 3
   # Metabolic alkalosis: Elevated bicarbonate.
   - check PM lytes
   - K > 4.5 for goal with K sliding scale
   # S/P PEA Arrest:  Concern for anxoic brain injury.   [**9-22**] head CT with
   no pathology.  No MRI given metal in trach currently, but family would
   like to pursue this if possible
   - follow mental status with decreasing sedation
   - monitor on tele
   - continue keppra
   # Sinus Tachycardia: had on admission, now returned after rewarming.
   Does not show evidence of bleeding. No PE on CTA. Bolused without
   improvement. No improvement with fentanyl. Continues to be stable. [**Month (only) 60**]
   be due to brain injury / multiple infections.
   - monitor
   #  Wrist fracture/Rib fracture/Osteoperosis: Per ortho does not need
   further operative mgmt. Will need to consider bisphosphonate for outpt.
   Given long Hx w/ steroids.
   - ortho recs appreciated
 not planning on surgery, CT wrist if this is
   reasonable for goals of care, likely await until after MRI
   - Fentanyl patch
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   # DM, type II:
   - continue SSI from nursing home
   # Anemia of iron def: stable,
   - monitor hct
   - continue iron tablets
   - active T&S
   - Minimize blood draws
   # Depression: stable
   - continue celexa
   # Hx of  gastric ulcers: no evidence of GI bleed at this time, no abd
   pain
   - home PPI

","The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress. He underwent an Arctic Sun cooling protocol, seizures, and pseudomonal pneumonia. The patient's medical history includes COPD, cuff leak, agitation off sedation, anxiety, depression, gastric ulcers, type II diabetes mellitus, anemia of iron deficiency, and osteoporosis. He has multiple comorbidities and is currently on various medications and treatments.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/69 mmHg to 117/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals minimal responsiveness to stimuli with moving eyes/mouth, distant heart sounds, bilateral bronchial sounds, and no abdominal pain or tenderness. His laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, low platelet count, and altered liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal a right pleural effusion and low lung volumes, but no pneumothorax.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory distress likely due to underlying COPD and cuff leak, seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, fevers treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with pseudomonas, C. difficile infection, metabolic alkalosis, anxiety brain injury, sinus tachycardia, wrist fracture, rib"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

1. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection or inflammatory response.

2. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has a weakened trachea and bronchi, which can lead to airway collapse and difficulty breathing.

3. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure, although the exact cause is not mentioned.

4. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, indicating a serious heart problem.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient is suffering from acute respiratory failure, which means they are not able to maintain adequate breathing function. The cause is not specified as ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).

6. Fracture: The patient has a fracture in an unspecified location.

The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia (fast heart rate), low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and medications to prevent blood clots and stress ulcers.

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. The blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with some readings being high and others within normal range. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, with multiple organ dysfunctions and complications. Immediate medical attention is required to address these"

   -consider CTA in near future for ? PE if low grade fevers do not
   resolve
   # C. Diff Infection: Decreasing diarrhea overnight.
   - on po vanco Day 3
   # Metabolic alkalosis: Elevated bicarbonate.
   - check PM lytes
   - K > 4.5 for goal with K sliding scale
   # S/P PEA Arrest:  Concern for anxoic brain injury.   [**9-22**] head CT with
   no pathology.  No MRI given metal in trach currently, but family would
   like to pursue this if possible
   - follow mental status with decreasing sedation
   - monitor on tele

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and previously suffered a PEA arrest. He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol, seizures, and pseudomonal pneumonia. The patient has several ongoing medical conditions and complications, including respiratory distress likely due to underlying COPD and cuff leak, agitation off all sedation, fever being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with pseudomonas, a blood culture showing GPC likely contaminant, and resistant pseudomonas. The patient also has a Clostridium difficile infection, metabolic alkalosis with elevated bicarbonate, sinus tachycardia without evidence of bleeding, wrist fracture, rib fracture, and osteoporosis. Other medical issues include type II diabetes mellitus, anemia of iron deficiency, depression, and a history of gastric ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen if there is a recurrence of underlying COPD exacerbation or cuff leak.
2. VAP with Pseudomonas: The patient's fever indicates an ongoing infection. If the current treatment is ineffective, the infection may progress, leading to worsening respiratory status and potential sepsis.
3. C. difficile Infection: The patient's diarrhea should be closely monitored. If not adequately controlled, it could lead to complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or toxic megacolon.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis:"

   could have a reasonable prognosis given his intermittent responsiveness
   to commands. Bavona trach contains metal so pt. cannot get MRI
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue keppra 1000/1500mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - daily wake ups to assess mental status
   - MRI today to assess neurological status
   # Fevers: Being treated for VAP with pseudamonas. Now also has a blood
   cx from [**9-27**] with GPC in one bottle, likely contaminant.  Also now
   found to have meropenem
 resistant pseudomonas.  Also with c.
   difficile infection

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and has since experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, seizures, and pseudomonal pneumonia.
- The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, agitation off all sedation, low dose propofol, continuous fentanyl patch, Seroquel at 75mg QID, tracheostomy, and mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has been treated for various infections including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with pseudomonas, a blood culture contamination, and Clostridium difficile infection.
- The patient has a history of COPD, cuff leak, and is being evaluated for potential brain injury due to anoxic events.
- Other medical issues include metabolic alkalosis, wrist fracture, rib fracture, osteoporosis, type II diabetes mellitus, anemia of iron deficiency, depression, and a history of gastric ulcers.
- The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and a recent increase in temperature.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Imaging studies reveal a right pleural effusion and low lung volumes.
- The patient's care plan includes upsizing the tracheostomy, continuing antibiotic therapy, weaning off sedation, attempting to decrease FiO2, and monitoring for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already been treated for VAP, but there is a risk of recurrent or worsening infection due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Pseudomonal infection: The patient has resistant pseudomonas infection, which can be challenging to treat and may lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.
3. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis if not treated effectively.
4. Seizures: The patient has had seizure activity in the past, and there is a risk of recurrence, especially if the underlying cause is not addressed.
5. Brain injury: The patient's anoxic brain injury may lead to long-term neurological complications, including cognitive impairment and memory loss.
6. Gastric ulcers: The patient has a history of gastric ulcers, which can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding if not managed properly.
7. Osteoporosis: The patient has osteoporosis, which can increase the risk of fractures and bone pain.
8. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has type II diabetes, which requires careful management to prevent hyperglycemia and associated complications.
9. Anemia: The patient has anemia of iron deficiency, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
10. Depression: The patient has depression, which can affect overall well-being and quality of life if"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Trach upsized today following dilation. Stable on vent following
   procedure. Continues to awaken at times and moves though is still not
   doing anything purposeful and not following commands.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been weaned as tolerated. The RSBI (respiratory system resistance index) is within normal limits, indicating that the patient's respiratory function is being supported.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonas pneumonia and is receiving intravenous tobramycin and colistin. It is crucial to monitor the patient's response to the antibiotics and watch for any signs of worsening infection.

3. Tracheobronchomalacia (Tracheomalacia, Bronchomalacia): The patient's tracheostomy tube has been upsized today in the operating room. This condition involves weakness in the cartilage of the trachea and bronchi, leading to collapse of the airways. The upsizing of the tracheostomy tube aims to improve airway stability and support breathing.

4. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest previously and underwent cooling for targeted temperature management. An MRI post tracheostomy change is planned for prognostication. It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's cardiac function and address any arrhythmias promptly.

5. Fracture: The patient has a fracture that requires further evaluation, likely through imaging studies such as a CT scan. Proper management of the fracture is necessary to prevent complications related"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and post-cardiac arrest.
- The patient underwent an Arctic Sun cooling protocol, seizures, and pseudomonal pneumonia.
- Current concerns include respiratory distress, likely due to underlying COPD and cuff leak, as well as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient is agitated off all sedation.
- Other issues include seizure activity, fever, Clostridium difficile infection, metabolic alkalosis, and a history of peptic ulcer disease.
- The patient has a wrist fracture, rib fracture, and osteoporosis, with orthopedic consultation suggesting no further operative management.
- The patient has diabetes mellitus type II, anemia of iron deficiency, and depression, with ongoing treatment and monitoring.
- The patient's code status is full code, and there is no mention of disposition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially necessitate intubation or mechanical ventilation.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is being treated for VAP, which can be a serious complication of mechanical ventilation and may require antibiotic therapy and other interventions.
3. Pseudomonal Infection: The patient has a pseudomonal infection, which is resistant to meropenem. This could lead to treatment challenges and the need for alternative antibiotic"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation and a tracheostomy. They have a history of cardiac arrest, seizure, altered mental status, tracheobronchomalacia, Clostridium difficile infection, fracture, hypernatremia, and multiple medical comorbidities. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for pseudomonas pneumonia and has had multiple imaging studies and laboratory tests performed.

Potential Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Measures are in place to prevent VAP, such as head-of-bed elevation and daily wake-up trials.
2. Tracheostomy-related complications: The patient recently underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy, which carries risks such as bleeding, infection, and tracheomalacia.
3. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of seizures, and while on keppra, their seizure control needs to be closely monitored.
4. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to infection or other factors. Delirium can complicate the clinical course and increase the risk of complications.
5. C. difficile infection: The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile infection, which can recur and lead to severe colitis. Prophylactic vancomycin is being administered.
6. Fracture: The patient has"

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and platelet count, and normal kidney function. Imaging reveals a possible pontine injury on the head MRI and worsening infiltrate in the right upper lobe on the chest X-ray. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and further treatment. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Continuous monitoring and ventilatory support may be necessary.

2. Pneumonia: The presence of worsening infiltrate in the right upper"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and previously experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol, seizures, and treatment for pseudomonal pneumonia.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has severe emphysema, an endotracheal tube (ETT) placed 3.7 cm from the carina, and right middle lobe (RML) and right lower lobe (RLL) consolidative opacity suggestive of pneumonia. The patient is being treated with peep, antibiotics for pseudomonal infection, and other respiratory support measures.

2. Agitation/Delirium: The patient is experiencing agitation and delirium, which may be due to pain, ICU delirium, or an infection. Propofol and haloperidol are being used for sedation, and pain management with fentanyl patch is ongoing.

3. Seizure: The patient had a seizure episode last Friday, and an MRI showed pontine hyperdensity without acute stroke. The patient is on keppra for seizure control.

4. Fevers: The patient has fevers being treated for bacterial sepsis with pseudomonal infection. There is also a possible contaminant in one blood culture bottle and resistant pseudomonas infection. Clostridium difficile infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress. He has undergone an Arctic Sun cooling protocol, seizures, and treatment for pseudomonal pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 0 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 10, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 97%. He is also on multiple IV medications including furosemide, fentanyl, haloperidol, and pantoprazole.

Assessment:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient likely has underlying COPD and a cuff leak. He is being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and appears agitated off all sedation.
2. Seizure: The patient had a seizure last Friday, and an MRI showed hyperdensity in the pons but no acute stroke. Neurological assessment suggests potential for reasonable prognosis given intermittent responsiveness.
3. Fevers: The patient is being treated for VAP with pseudomonas and now has a blood culture from 9/27 with GPC in one bottle, likely contaminant. He also has meropenem-resistant pseudomonas and Clostridium difficile infection.
4. C. Diff Infection: The patient's diarrhea is decreasing overnight, and he is on PO vancomycin Day 5.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
     No convincing improvement with respect to his [**Year (4 digits) 10369**]/agitation. It
   remains the major hurdle to imrprovement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress, who has undergone an Arctic Sun cooling protocol, seizures, and pseudomonal pneumonia. He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is now being treated for various conditions including COPD, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), agitation, delirium, anemia, seizure, fevers, Clostridium difficile infection, metabolic alkalosis, wrist fracture, rib fracture, osteoporosis, hypernatremia, and sinus tachycardia. The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, iron-deficiency anemia, depression, gastric ulcers, and is currently receiving multiple medications and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of COPD and current treatment for VAP, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as worsening lung function, pneumonia, or ventilator dependence.
2. Infection: The patient is being treated for pseudomonal pneumonia and has also tested positive for resistant pseudomonas and Clostridium difficile infection. There is a risk of ongoing or recurrent infections, which may require adjustments in antibiotic therapy.
3. Seizure Activity: The patient had a seizure episode, and there is a possibility of recurrent seizures due to underlying brain injury or ongoing infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress, post-cardiac arrest, and pseudomonal pneumonia. He has a history of COPD, seizures, and is currently being treated for VAP, pseudomonal infection, and C. difficile infection. The patient's recent medical history includes PEA arrest, anemia, wrist fracture, rib fracture, and osteoporosis. He has multiple comorbidities including type II DM, depression, gastric ulcers, and iron-deficiency anemia. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, blood pressure ranging from 139/63 to 166/85 mmHg, heart rate between 86-121 bpm, respiratory rate of 15-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation via CPAP/PSV mode. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,781 mL and output of 930 mL over the past 24 hours. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and glucose levels. Imaging shows near resolution of multifocal pneumonia, severe emphysema, and stable dilation of the main pulmonary artery. The patient has ongoing infections, including pseudomonas, C. difficile, and a potential PE. He is also dealing with agitation, delirium, anemia, seizures, metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, and a wrist fracture requiring potential operative management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonal infection: The patient is being treated for a pseudomonal infection, which can be a serious and potentially life-threatening complication if not properly managed.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient has a C. difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis, leading to complications such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is being treated for VAP, which is a type of lung infection that can occur in critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation.
4. Potential PE: The patient has low-grade fevers that have not resolved, and there is a consideration for a computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the near future for a possible pulmonary embolism.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, respiratory failure, altered mental status, and a C. difficile infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and antipsychotics. They have a tracheostomy cuff leak and edema in both lower extremities. The patient's vital signs are stable, but their lab results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests. They have a planned procedure for fracture fixation next Monday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should closely monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider changing the antibiotic regimen if necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and edema in the lower extremities increase the risk of DVT. The patient is receiving prophylactic subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, which is appropriate, but close monitoring for signs and symptoms of DVT is essential.
3. Seizure: The patient has a history of seizure, and ongoing monitoring for seizure activity is necessary. The healthcare team should follow up with keppra level checks as indicated.
4. Wound infection: The patient's surgical"

   > Anemia: Hct down to 24 from 27-29 range. No obvious source, will
   repeat as a first step.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC: keep TBB even to slightly negative.  On
   vent for now as he is PEEP dependent in part [**2-11**] chronic illness and
   deoconditioning, volume overload, chronic infections and underlying
   COPD.  An trial trach mask with PEEP vent.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM);
   ICU delirium, not tolerating haldol [**2-11**] prolonged Qtc. On propofol for
   agitation for now, working on titrating down and finding stable
   regimen.   Unclear what underlying etiology is. He has not responded to
   seroquel in the past.  Can try prn benzodiazepine.  Could also be an
   effect of rising CO2 level esp in the setting of his sedation
   Will check an ABG today (looks like his baseline CO2 is in the high
   80
s) to see if this is contributing.

   I saw and examined Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 10383**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1162**], whose note above
   reflects my input.  78yo M with TBM, steroid-dependent COPD and
   diastolic heart failure as well as chronic trach (not on vent
   chronically) who p/w comminuted wrist fracture and in setting of pain
   meds developed hypercarbic resp failure.  Course complicated by
   hypoxemic PEA when transitioning from vent to trach mask, mucous
   plugging vs bronchospasm. now s/p cooling with slowly improving mental
   status.  Had some cuff leak overnight, now improved.  Sedation weaning
   has been challenging and complicated by tachypnea.  On exam, moving
   reasonable air.  Left arm splinted.  Coarse breath sounds.  Soft
   abdomen.  We will plan to try to wean sedation slowly; if unsuccessful,
   might be reasonable to trial dexmedetomidine in next couple of days.
   In addition, tidal volumes are relatively small.  [**Month (only) 60**] reflect air
   trapping, TBM, etc.  However, would check NIF in a.m. given steroids
   and being on aminoglycoside.  Continue present antibiotics for highly
   resistant pneumonia. Suspect CNS in blood was a contaminant, but
   following.  Also continue to treat c diff.  Other issues as per Dr.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of tracheostomy, steroid-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diastolic heart failure. He is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas, which is already being treated with antibiotics. There is a risk of worsening infection or development of antibiotic resistance.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation and has chronic respiratory failure. Weaning off sedation and extubation may be challenging due to underlying COPD, deconditioning, volume overload, chronic infections, and the risk of hypercarbic arrest.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing delirium, which may be caused by sedatives, rising CO2 levels, or an underlying etiology. Proper management of agitation and sedation is crucial to prevent further complications.

4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation: The patient's COPD is acute on chronic, and there is a risk of further exacerbation. Proper management of airway, oxygenation, and ventilation is necessary.

5. C. difficile infection: The patient has an ongoing C. difficile infection, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued to prevent worsening of the condition.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas. This infection needs to be closely monitored and treated with appropriate antibiotics.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing chronic respiratory failure, which requires ongoing ventilator support. The underlying causes include volume overload, chronic infections, and underlying COPD.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is showing signs of altered mental status, possibly due to ICU delirium. The patient is not tolerating haloperidol and has a prolonged QTc interval. Propofol has been started for agitation, but the underlying cause of the altered mental status is unclear. It may be related to rising CO2 levels or an effect of sedation.

4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and there is an acute exacerbation present. The use of a tracheostomy mask with PEEP valve will be attempted cautiously due to the question of hypercarbic arrest in the past.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress. He has a history of PEA arrest, seizures, and pseudomonal pneumonia. The patient's current conditions include respiratory distress, likely due to underlying COPD, as well as VAP. He is also agitated off all sedation, with CT scans showing improvement in right middle lobe and right lower lobe opacifications. The patient is being treated for pseudomonal infection with meropenem and tobramycin. He is also being monitored for PCP, AFB, and gram stain in his sputum culture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and underlying COPD may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is already being treated for VAP, but it remains a potential complication if appropriate measures are not taken.
3. Pseudomonal Infection: The patient has a pseudomonal infection, which can be life-threatening if not effectively treated.
4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing agitation and delirium, which can worsen his overall condition and prolong his ICU stay.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may require further investigation and treatment.
6. Seizures: The patient had a seizure episode, and there is a risk of recurrent seizures if not properly managed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions and complications. They are currently in the ICU and have been diagnosed with pneumonia, respiratory failure, altered mental status, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient also has a history of seizure and a fracture. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia, which can be caused by various pathogens, including multidrug-resistant organisms like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This type of infection can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and potential complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing chronic respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation support. This condition can lead to further lung damage, pulmonary hypertension, and increased risk of infections.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is exhibiting altered mental status, which may be due to various factors including sedation, delirium, or underlying neurological issues. This can affect the patient's ability to communicate, make decisions, and follow medical instructions.

4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has a pre-existing diagnosis of COPD, which is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. Acute exacerbations of COPD can lead to respiratory failure, increased carbon dioxide levels, and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. They have pneumonia, respiratory failure, altered mental status, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a history of seizure, C. difficile infection, and a fracture. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and medications for glycemic control and stress ulcer prophylaxis. They are receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and have a PICC line and another IV line. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, fever, and low oxygen saturation. Their labs indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis, but there is still a risk of developing stress ulcers due to the critical illness and medication use.
4. C. difficile infection: The patient is already infected with C. difficile, and there is a risk of recurrence or worsening of symptoms.
5. Wound infection: The patient has a fracture and may have undergone surgical procedures, which can increase the risk of wound infection"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia, specifically non-ventilator-associated pneumonia (NVAP). This indicates an infection in the lungs, which can potentially lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic infection.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing chronic respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation support. This suggests that the patient's lungs are not adequately providing oxygen to the bloodstream, potentially due to underlying conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and deconditioning.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is exhibiting signs of altered mental status, which may be due to ICU delirium. This condition can impair cognitive function, memory, and attention. The use of propofol for agitation may further contribute to sedation and confusion.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have decreased from 27-29% to 24%. Anemia can result in decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, leading to fatigue, weakness, and other systemic symptoms.

5. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI): The patient has been diagnosed with CDI, a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea and colitis. It is important to continue treatment with oral vancomycin to manage this condition.

6. Fracture: The patient has a fracture in their left arm"

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 57**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP): resolved on Chest
   CT (Pseudomonas),. No change to Abx regimen (tobra IV and meropenem
   total course for two weeks)
   > Fever: this AM. Pan clx today no change to empiric coverage as he is
   clinically stable. Currently covering c. dif and pseudomonas. Pan scan
   CT today (including sinus)
   > Anemia: Hct down to 24 from 27-29 range. No obvious source, will
   repeat as a first step.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC: keep TBB even to slightly negative.
   On vent for now as he is PEEP dependent in part [**2-11**] chronic illness and
   deoconditioning, volume overload, chronic infections and underlying
   COPD.  An trial trach mask with PEEP vent.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM);
   ICU delirium, not tolerating haldol [**2-11**] prolonged Qtc. On propofol for
   agitation for now, working on titrating down and finding stable
   regimen.   Unclear what underlying etiology is. He has not responded to
   seroquel in the past.  Can try prn benzodiazepine.  Could also consider
   using dexmetomidate as an alternative [**Doctor Last Name **]..
   ABG [**10-5**] did not reveal evidence of CO2 different from baseline (high
   80's)
   - Slow wean of propofol, goal 15 today.

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION:will try trach mask with Peep valve, but
   cautiously follow given question of hypercarbic arrest in the past.
   Persistent hypoxemic and tachyxcardia,r/o PE (increased incidence in
   COPD patients).

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia, which is a serious infection of the lungs acquired during hospitalization.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation and has chronic respiratory failure. This may be due to underlying conditions such as COPD, volume overload, chronic infections, and deconditioning.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be caused by delirium or another underlying etiology. The patient is not tolerating haloperidol and has an extended QTc interval, so alternative medications are being considered.

4. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and there is an acute exacerbation of this condition. There is a concern for hypercarbic arrest, so caution is advised when weaning off mechanical ventilation.

5. Clostridium difficile infection (C. difficile): The patient is being treated for C. difficile infection, and vancomycin is being continued orally.

6. Fracture: The patient has a fracture, and surgical fixation is planned for Monday.

7. Potential complications from prolonged ICU stay: Critically ill patients in the ICU are at risk for various complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress. The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, seizures, and pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. He is currently being treated for several conditions, including a blood culture positive for GPC (likely a contaminant), coag-negative Staphylococcus, and resistant Pseudomonas. The patient also has Clostridium difficile infection and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to underlying COPD, and there has been improvement in right middle lobe and right lower lobe opacifications on a recent CT scan. The patient's blood cultures show resistant Pseudomonas, and he is being treated with meropenem and tobramycin.

The patient is also experiencing agitation and delirium, which may be related to pain, ICU delirium, or other factors. He is currently on propofol, but it will be weaned today, and he may receive additional doses of ativan as needed. The patient's seizure activity has decreased, and he is being monitored closely.

The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile infection, which is being treated with oral vancomycin. He also has a wrist fracture, rib fracture, and osteoporosis, with potential operative management for the wrist/elbow fractures.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress and post-cardiac arrest. He has a history of pseudomonal pneumonia, GPC in blood culture, and C. difficile infection. The patient is currently being treated with meropenem and tobramycin for pseudomonal infection, and PO Vanc for C. difficile. He is also being monitored for VAP and has shown improvement in his RML and RLL opacifications on CT scan. The patient is agitated off all sedation and has a history of seizures, for which he is on keppra. He has a wrist fracture, rib fracture, and osteoporosis, and potential operative management is being considered. The patient's mental status is being monitored with decreasing sedation, and he is on a fentanyl patch. He has sinus tachycardia and anemia of iron deficiency. The patient's medical history includes depression, gastric ulcers, and type II diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonal infection: The patient is currently being treated with meropenem and tobramycin for pseudomonal infection. However, he has developed resistance to meropenem. The potential complication could be worsening of the infection or spread to other organs.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient is being treated with PO Vanc for C. difficile. If not properly managed, the infection could lead to severe diarrhea, colitis"

   Agitation/?delirium has been a major factor limiting ability to wean.
   Prior cranial imaging has been unrevealing.  We will try adding
   clonidine and weaning propofol, while focusing on ensuring adequate
   pain control.  Will try to avoid BZD if possible.  Reportedly, little
   prior success with haldol (increased QT).
   Check NIF to exclude weakness as a cause of failure to wean.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including tracheobronchomalacia (TBM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diastolic heart failure, and a wrist fracture. The patient has been critically ill and has experienced several complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure, in the setting of COPD and TBM, puts him at risk for continued respiratory distress. Agitation and possible delirium have limited the ability to wean him off sedation.

2. Infection: The patient has been treated for a highly resistant pneumonia, which suggests a risk of hospital-acquired infections. Additionally, he has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and is currently on vancomycin.

3. Cardiac Issues: The patient has diastolic heart failure, which may contribute to his overall critical condition. Monitoring his cardiac function and managing any associated complications will be important.

4. Neurological Impairment: The patient has had a seizure and there is a concern for anoxic brain damage. However, MRI results did not show evidence of this. The patient's altered mental status may be due to a combination of pain and delirium.

5. Wrist Fracture: The patient underwent surgery to repair his wrist fracture, which was uncomplicated. However, this may still require ongoing management and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of PEA arrest and a right arm fracture. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including hypernatremia (high sodium levels), pneumonia (hospital-acquired, non-ventilator-associated), respiratory failure (chronic), altered mental status, anoxic brain damage, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, a history of seizure, tracheobronchomalacia, Clostridium difficile infection, and a fracture.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 162/91 mmHg to 170/138 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 94%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates a sinus tachycardia rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,102 mL and an output of 2,450 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,652 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator in assist-control mode with a tidal volume set at 400 mL and peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O. The patient is also receiving supplemental oxygen through a tracheostomy tube.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, altered mental status, anoxic brain damage, a history of cardiac arrest, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), seizure, tracheobronchomalacia, Clostridium difficile infection, and multiple fractures. The patient underwent surgery for right elbow fixation and wrist plating. Medications include propofol, fentanyl, clonidine, keppra, fondaparinux, furosemide, pantoprazole, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they exhibit tachycardia and low oxygen saturation. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,628 mL and output of 1,615 mL. Respiratory support is provided through a tracheostomy tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The patient's blood work indicates elevated WBC count, slightly low platelet count, normal electrolytes, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies are pending. The patient's condition remains unchanged since admission, with ongoing management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by pneumonia and tracheobronchomalacia. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise due to the current hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's low oxygen saturation and elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y.o. M admitted to MICU for respiratory distress s/p PEA arrest
   [**2126-9-20**] then completed Arctic Sun cooling protocol, course complicated
   by seizures, pseudomanas-pneumonia, agitation/delirium.
   # Agitation/Delirium: Currently treating pseudomonas in blood and
   sputum cultures. [**Month (only) 60**] be due to pain, particularly in pos-operative
   setting, ICU delirium, infectious (although treating).
   - attempt to wean propofol today, use Fentanyl boluses, ativan prn
   - continue fentanyl patch for pain
   - hold haldol due to prolonged QTc
   - continue clonidine
   - touch base with neuro regarding keppra dosing and duration
 may
   contribute to delirium?
   # Fevers: Being treated for Bcx with pseudamonas. Now also has a blood
   cx from [**9-27**] with GPC in one bottle, likely contaminant, and cath tip
   culture [**10-1**] coag neg staph but surveillance cultures negative.  Also
   now found to have meropenem
 resistant pseudomonas.  + C. difficile
   infection.  Pan-CT scan did not show any other source of infection.
   - Continue meropenem and tobramycin per ID for 2 weeks (last day of abx
   [**2126-10-13**])
   - cont PO Vanc for Cdiff day (last day of abx [**2126-10-13**])
   - f/u all culture data
   - monitor fever curve
   # Respiratory Distress: Likely [**2-11**] underlying COPD. Also treating VAP.
   Also appears agitated off all sedation.
   CT [**10-3**] showed interval improvement of RML and RLL opacifications.
   - maintaining on 10 of Peep, obtain valve on Monday
   - continue to treat blood cultures with pseudomonas
 meropenem,
   tobramycin for pseudomonal infectio
   - sputum culture
 for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1156**], AFB, gram stain
 NGTD but the PCP
   was insufficient for culture
   - RTC albuterol, ipratropirum nebs
   - I/O even , [**Hospital1 **] lytes if actively diuresing
   - continue home steroids
   - continue bactrim ppx
   #  Wrist fracture: s/p ex-fix and ORIF of R elbow and wrist yesterday
   [**10-7**]
   - appreciate ortho recs: c/s OT for R wrist orthoplast splint
   - ROM for R fingers/elbow, wrist to remain in splint
   - ortho to do dressing changes
   - pain control with Fentanyl patch
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   # Seizure:  No seizures for > 1 week. Neuro believes that he could have
   a reasonable prognosis given his intermittent responsiveness to
   commands. MRI with pons hyperdensity, no acute stroke.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u keppra level
   - continue keppra at reduced dose
   - daily wake ups to assess mental status
   # C. Diff Infection: Decreasing diarrhea.
   - continue po vancomycin x 2 weeks
   # S/P PEA Arrest:  Concern for anxoic brain injury although MRI [**10-2**]
   showed pons pathology that neuro says could be possibly reversible.
   - follow mental status with decreasing sedation
   - monitor on tele
   - continue keppra
 will touch base with neuro about sz ppx dosing and
   duration
   # Anemia of iron def: trending down from baseline in ICU of 27, now 25
   but may be due to some operative blood loss
   - monitor hct
   - continue iron tablets
   - active T&S
   - guiaic all stools
   - Minimize blood draws
   # Sinus Tachycardia: had on admission, now returned after rewarming.
   Does not show evidence of bleeding. No PE on CTA. Bolused without
   improvement. No improvement with fentanyl. Continues to be stable. [**Month (only) 60**]
   be due to brain injury / multiple infections.
   - monitor
   # DM, type II:
   - continue SSI from nursing home
   # Depression: holding Celexa so as not to contribute to mental status

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a post-cardiac arrest (PEA arrest) and subsequent treatment with the Arctic Sun cooling protocol. The patient's course has been complicated by seizures, pseudomonas pneumonia, agitation/delirium, fevers, respiratory distress, wrist fracture, C. difficile infection, anoxic brain injury, and iron deficiency anemia.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:
1. Agitation/Delirium: Treating pseudomonas in blood and sputum cultures, using Fentanyl boluses, Ativan PRN, and continuing Clonidine.
2. Fevers: Being treated for Bcx with pseudomonas, blood cx from 9/27 likely contaminant, catheter tip culture showing coag negative staph but surveillance cultures negative. Also, now found to have meropenem-resistant pseudomonas and C. difficile infection. Pan-CT scan did not show any other source of infection.
3. Respiratory Distress: Likely underlying COPD. Also treating VAP. Appears agitated off all sedation. CT showed interval improvement of right middle lobe and right lower lobe opacifications.
4. Wrist fracture: Post-operative fixation and rigid internal fixation (ORIF) of right elbow and wrist yesterday. Ortho recs: change dressing, ROM for right fingers/elbow, wrist to remain"

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on 09/20/20. He underwent an Arctic Sun cooling protocol and experienced seizures, pseudomonas pneumonia, and agitation/delirium. The patient's current condition includes agitation/delirium, infectious disease, respiratory failure, tracheostomy, wrist fracture, seizure, Clostridium difficile infection, anoxic brain injury, anemia of iron deficiency, sinus tachycardia, depression, and type II diabetes mellitus.

The patient has multiple medical complications that require ongoing management. These include:

1. Agitation/Delirium: The patient is currently being treated for pseudomonas infection in blood and sputum cultures. The cause of his delirium may be due to pain, particularly in the post-operative setting, ICU delirium, or infectious causes, despite being on appropriate antibiotics. Propofol weaning will be attempted today using fentanyl boluses, and 2 mg q30 minutes until sedated, followed by turning off propofol. Fentanyl patches will continue for pain management.

2. Infectious Disease: The patient will continue on meropenem and tobramycin per Infectious Disease (ID) for 2 weeks, with the last day of antibiotic therapy on 10/13/20. PO Vanc will be continued for C. diff until the same date. Culture data will be monitored, along with fever curves.

3. Respiratory Failure/Tracheostomy: The patient will have VBG and NIF checks. PEEP will be maintained at 10 cmH2O. Blood cultures will be treated with meropenem and tobramycin for pseudomonal infection. Sputum culture will be done for PCP, AFB, and gram stain. Albuterol and ipratropium nebs will be continued. I/O even and electrolytes will be managed, along with home steroids. Bactrim prophylaxis will also be continued.

4. Wrist Fracture: The patient underwent ex-fix and ORIF of the right elbow and wrist yesterday. Ortho recs include c/s OT for right wrist orthoplast splint, ROM for right fingers/elbow, and wrist to remain in splint. Ortho will do dressing changes, and pain control will be managed with fentanyl patches. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation will be continued, and bisphosphonate therapy at discharge will be considered.

5. Seizure: The patient has not had seizures for over a week. Neurology believes he has a reasonable prognosis given intermittent responsiveness to commands. MRI showed pons hyperdensity but no acute stroke. Neuro recs will be followed, and keppra levels will be monitored. Keppra will be continued at a reduced dose, with daily wake-ups to assess mental status.

6. C. Diff Infection: The patient's diarrhea is decreasing. PO vancomycin will be continued for 2 weeks.

7. S/P PEA Arrest: There is concern for anoxic brain injury, although MRI showed pons pathology that may be reversible. Mental status will be monitored with decreasing sedation. Tele will be monitored, and keppra will be continued. Neuro consultation will be sought regarding seizure prophylaxis dosing and duration.

8. Anemia of Iron Deficiency: The patient's hct is trending down from baseline in the ICU, but may be due to operative blood loss. Iron tablets will be continued, along with active T&S. Guaiac all stools, minimize blood draws, and monitor hct.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of COPD, OSA, chronic tracheostomy, and multiple comorbidities. The patient was admitted for management of a wrist/elbow fracture and experienced hypoxemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest during the course of treatment.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient remains agitated and delirious, which could be due to ICU psychosis, pain, anoxic brain injury, pain medication withdrawal, propofol withdrawal, or seizures. The plan is to continue weaning propofol and use Ativan to manage agitation. Fentanyl patch will be continued for pain management.

2. Fevers: The patient has fevers, likely due to a presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) infection. Antibiotics (TobraDox and Vancomycin) have been continued until October 13th.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) due to respiratory failure, possibly secondary to right lower lobe infiltrate and atelectasis. The plan includes continuing antibiotics, using bronchodilators (Albuterol and Atrovent), obtaining a chest X-ray, and continuing home steroid dose.

4. Orthopedic: The patient underwent an elbow/wrist surgery (Procedure 1423). Physical therapy is planned, along with dressing"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of COPD, OSA, and chronic tracheostomy, who presented with hypoxemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest during management of a wrist/elbow fracture. The patient remains agitated and delirious, and potential causes include ICU psychosis, pain, anoxic brain injury, pain, propofol withdrawal, and Keppra withdrawal. Propofol is being weaned off, and Ativan is being used to manage agitation. The patient also has fevers, likely due to a presumed nosocomial infection, and is being treated with antibiotics. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). There are concerns about the contribution of subdural hematoma (SZR) to the patient's mental status, and Keppra is being downtitrated. There are also issues with depression, sinus tachycardia, and potential muscle weakness. The patient requires ICU care, including tube feeds, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a PEA arrest and subsequent Arctic Sun cooling protocol. He has had a course complicated by seizures, pseudomonas pneumonia, and agitation/delirium. His current medications include propofol, fentanyl, lorazepam, meropenem, tobramycin, clonidine, and pantoprazole. The patient has several medical issues including anemia of iron deficiency, depression, diabetes mellitus type II, and sinus tachycardia. He also has a wrist fracture that required ORIF surgery. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels. The respiratory culture is negative for any significant growth except for sparse yeast and pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is being treated for pseudomonas pneumonia and c.difficile infection. Close monitoring of fever curve and culture data is necessary to ensure these infections are adequately treated.
2. Seizure: Although the patient has not had any seizures for over a week, neurologic follow-up is required to assess the prognosis and determine the appropriate dosage and duration of keppra.
3. Wrist Fracture: The patient requires orthopedic recommendations for ROM of fingers, no ROM of the right wrist, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress after a PEA arrest. He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol and experienced seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, and agitation/delirium. He is currently being treated for pseudomonal pneumonia and has had multiple antibiotic changes. The patient's agitation/delirium may be due to pain, particularly in the post-operative setting, ICU delirium, or infectious causes (although he is being treated). The plan is to wean off propofol and use fentanyl boluses to manage pain. He will continue on a fentanyl patch for pain control, hold haloperidol due to prolonged QTc, continue clonidine, and touch base with neuro regarding keppra dosing and duration.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Agitation/Delirium: The patient is currently treating pseudomonal infection in blood and sputum cultures. It is believed that the agitation/delirium may be due to pain, particularly in the post-operative setting, ICU delirium, infectious causes (although being treated), or a combination of these factors. The plan is to attempt to wean propofol today, use fentanyl boluses until sedated, turn off propofol, continue fentanyl patch for pain, hold haldol due to prolonged QTc, continue clonidine, and touch base with neuro regarding keppra dosing and duration.

2. Infectious Disease:
- Continue meropenem and tobramycin per ID for 2 weeks (last day of abx [2126-10-13]).

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 10383**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5651**], whose note reflects my
   input.  78yo M with TBM, steroid-dependent COPD and diastolic heart
   failure as well as chronic trach (not on vent chronically) who p/w
   comminuted wrist fracture and in setting of pain meds developed
   hypercarbic resp failure.  Course complicated by hypoxemic PEA when
   transitioning from vent to trach mask.
   Didn
t tolerate NIF (hypoxemia).  Propofol off with ativan coverage.
   Other data as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5651**]
s note.
   Assessment and Plan
   78-year-old man with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure in the
   setting of COPD, TBM, and diastolic CHF.
   Agitation/?delirium/?encephalopathy continues to be major factor
   limiting ability to wean. Some progress compared with yesterday. Pain
   seems likely controlled given operative intervention and fentanyl.
   Prior cranial imaging has been unrevealing.  Added clonidine two days
   ago and lorazepam yesterday. Reportedly, little prior success with
   haldol (increased QT).  Appreciate neurology
s help.
   Resp failure:  blood gas actually better than prior.  Continue rx for
   resistant GNR pneumonia.  Working to get delirium under better control.
   From an ID standpoint, continue present antibiotics for highly
   resistant pneumonia. Suspect CNS in blood was a contaminant, but
   following.  Also continue to treat c diff.
   Anemia: no evidence of clinical bleeding; follow Hct.
   Other issues as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5651**]
s note today.
   He is critically ill: 30 minutes
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 149**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 832**], MD
   on:[**2126-10-9**] 21:53 ------
","The patient is a 78-year-old man with a complex medical history including COPD, diastolic heart failure, and tuberculosis. He is currently critically ill in the ICU due to acute-on-chronic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing agitation, tachycardia, and mental status changes, which have been partially controlled with medication.

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to pneumonia caused by a highly resistant gram-negative organism (GNR) on top of his underlying COPD. He has been receiving appropriate antibiotics for the pneumonia, but it appears to be resistant. The patient also has anemia, which may be related to the multiple blood draws in the ICU.

Other issues include diabetes mellitus type 2, renal failure, and restless leg syndrome. The patient is on several medications, including insulin for glycemic control, anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further mental status changes, and potential complications from the patient's underlying conditions such as heart failure and diabetes."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of COPD, DHF, respiratory failure/PEA after wrist fracture, currently experiencing VAP and mental status changes. The patient is critically ill and requires intensive care unit (ICU) care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function and the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Mental status changes: The patient is experiencing agitation and tachycardia, which may be related to delirium or other mental status changes. There is a risk of worsening confusion, agitation, or development of seizures.

3. Pseudomonas infection: The patient has a confirmed pseudomonas infection. There is a risk of antibiotic resistance and further spread of the infection.

4. Stroke: The patient's mental status changes may be indicative of a stroke. There is a risk of neurological deterioration and potential need for neurosurgical intervention.

5. Anemia: The patient's blood work shows anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

6. Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2, which may require management with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.

   - appreciate ortho recs: c/s OT for R wrist orthoplast splint
   - ROM for R fingers/elbow, wrist to remain in splint
   - ortho to do dressing changes
   - pain control with Fentanyl patch
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   # Seizure:  No seizures for > 1 week. Neuro believes that he could have
   a reasonable prognosis given his intermittent responsiveness to
   commands. MRI with pons hyperdensity, no acute stroke.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Pseudomonas infection: The patient is currently being treated for pseudomonas infection in both blood and sputum cultures. This indicates a serious infection that may require prolonged antibiotic therapy.

2. Respiratory failure/tracheostomy: The patient's respiratory failure remains unclear at this point. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment accordingly.

3. Agitation/delirium: The patient is experiencing agitation and delirium, which can be attributed to various factors such as pain, ICU environment, or underlying infection. Appropriate measures are being taken to manage this, including the use of sedatives and analgesics.

4. Wrist fracture: The patient recently underwent surgery for a wrist fracture, and proper post-operative care is crucial to ensure healing and prevent complications.

5. Seizure: Although the patient has not had seizures for over a week, it is important to continue monitoring their neurological status due to the presence of an MRI abnormality in the pons.

6. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff infection, and treatment with vancomycin is ongoing.

7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, which could be due to operative blood loss. Close monitoring and appropriate management of iron levels are necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a PEA arrest. He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol and experienced seizures, pseudomonas pneumonia, and agitation/delirium. The patient is currently being treated for pseudomonas in blood and sputum cultures, and his agitation/delirium is likely due to pain, the ICU setting, or underlying infection. His recent history includes a wrist fracture with ORIF and fixation, elbow ORIF, and respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Agitation/Delirium: The patient is at risk for continued delirium due to pain, ICU setting, or underlying infection. He is currently on PRN lorazepam for withdrawal symptoms, fentanyl patch for pain, and clonidine for agitation. EEG is planned to assess for seizures.

2. Infectious Disease: The patient is being treated for pseudomonas infection with meropenem and tobramycin. He also has a C. difficile infection, for which he is receiving oral vancomycin. Monitoring fever curve and following up with all culture data are essential.

3. Respiratory Failure/Trach: The patient's respiratory failure requires ongoing support with 10 cmH2O PEEP. He has marked weakness, and his sputum culture is pending. He will continue to be treated for pseudomonal infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a cardiac arrest. He underwent therapeutic hypothermia and had a course complicated by seizures, pneumonia, agitation/delirium, and a wrist fracture. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics for Pseudomonas infection, sedatives for agitation/delirium, pain management, and seizure prophylaxis. He also has ongoing issues with hypernatremia, anemia of iron deficiency, sinus tachycardia, diabetes mellitus type II, and depression. The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and he is still on EEG monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonas infection: The patient has been treated with meropenem and tobramycin for this infection. It is important to monitor his response to the antibiotics and ensure that the appropriate duration of treatment is maintained.
2. Respiratory failure/tracheostomy: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is an unclear etiology for his respiratory failure. A bronchoscopy is planned to evaluate the airways for dynamic collapse. It is crucial to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation while minimizing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) risks.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a significant free water deficit, and careful fluid management is necessary to correct the hypernatremia gradually and prevent neurological complications.
4. Anemia of iron deficiency: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-inch, 77.1 kg male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of tachycardia. The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tmax 37.6°C, Tcurrent 36.9°C, HR 107 bpm, BP 116/64 mmHg, RR 23 insp/min, and SpO2 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a Vt of 324 mL, PS 8 cmH2O, RR spontaneous, PEEP 10 cmH2O, FiO2 35%, and ABG results of ///44/. The patient's physical examination reveals the presence of a tracheostomy tube, central venous access line, and various drains. Lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and elevated Cr levels. The patient has an ongoing infection indicated by the wound culture sensitivity report showing sensitivity to vancomycin. The patient's chest x-ray reveals right pleural effusion with adjacent basilar atelectasis and small left pleural effusion. The patient is receiving nutrition through Fibersource HN at 60 mL/hour. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient underwent therapeutic hypothermia (Arctic Sun cooling protocol) but developed seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, agitation, and delirium. The patient's current condition includes agitation/delirium, infection, respiratory failure, tracheostomy, wrist fracture, seizure disorder, Clostridium difficile infection, hypernatremia, anemia of iron deficiency, sinus tachycardia, diabetes mellitus type II, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Agitation/Delirium: The patient is currently being treated for pseudomonal infection, which may no longer be the cause of his agitation/delirium. Other potential causes include pain management, ICU delirium, or other underlying infections.
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonal infection in his blood and sputum cultures. Treatment includes meropenem and tobramycin for two weeks, and vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection.
3. Respiratory Failure/Tracheostomy: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to an unclear etiology. Maintaining PEEP at 10 cmH2O and monitoring sputum culture for PCP, AFB, and gram stain is recommended.
4. Wrist Fracture: The patient underwent ORIF"

   by seizures, pseudomanas-pneumonia, agitation/delirium.
   # Agitation/Delirium: Currently treating pseudomonas in blood and
   sputum cultures, though likely this is no longer due to underlying
   infection. [**Month (only) 60**] be due to pain, particularly in post-operative setting,
   ICU delirium, infectious (although treating).
   - propofol off,  continue to hold lorazepam as EEG monitoring on
   - d/c bolus fentanyl, continue fentanyl patch
   - hold haldol due to prolonged QTc
   - continue clonidine 0.2 mg PO TID

   - monitor fever curve
   # Respiratory Failure / Trach: Unclear etiology at this point.  NIF
   check unable to be adequately performed due to pt desat..  Maintaining
   on 10 of PEEP.
   - Will plan on bronchoscopy today to evaluate airways for dynamic
   collapse
   - continue to treat blood cultures with pseudomonas
 meropenem,
   tobramycin for pseudomonal infection
   - sputum culture
 for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1156**], AFB, gram stain

   - I/O even
   - continue home steroids
   - continue bactrim ppx
   #  Wrist fracture: s/p ex-fix and ORIF of R elbow and wrist [**10-7**]
   - appreciate ortho recs
   - ROM for R fingers/elbow, wrist to remain in splint
   - pain control with Fentanyl patch and oxycodone liquid prn
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   # Seizure:  No seizures for > 1 week. Neuro believes that he could have
   a reasonable prognosis given his intermittent responsiveness to
   commands. MRI with pons hyperdensity, no acute stroke.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u keppra level
   - continue keppra per Neuro
   - daily wake ups to assess mental status

   (free water deficit 960 cc), [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   # S/P PEA Arrest:  Concern for anxoic brain injury although MRI [**10-2**]
   showed pons pathology that neuro says could be possibly reversible.
   - follow mental status with decreasing sedation
   - monitor on tele
   - continue keppra
 will need to ask neuro for duration of this

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a PEA arrest. The patient underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol but experienced seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, and agitation/delirium. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for the infection. The patient's agitation/delirium may be due to pain, the post-operative setting, ICU delirium, or underlying infection. The patient is currently afebrile with leukocytosis trending down. The cause of the patient's respiratory failure/tracheostomy is unclear, and a bronchoscopy is planned to evaluate the airways for dynamic collapse. The patient continues to be treated for pseudomonal infection with meropenem and tobramycin. The patient also has a wrist fracture with an external fixator and ORIF of the right elbow and wrist. The patient's seizure disorder has improved, and no seizures have been observed for over a week. The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, hypernatremia, anemia of iron deficiency, sinus tachycardia, depression, and type II diabetes. The patient's mental status is being closely monitored with decreasing sedation."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a PEA arrest. He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol and had a course complicated by seizures, pseudomonas pneumonia, agitation/delirium, and now presents with fevers for two days.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.7°F (Tmax), heart rate of 84 bpm (within normal range), blood pressure of 106/65 mmHg (within normal range), respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (within normal range), and oxygen saturation of 93% on CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15.1 K/uL and a differential that includes C.diff, drug fever, and DVT. Imaging studies show evidence of megacolon. The patient's blood cultures are pending, while sputum and urine cultures have shown growth of gram-negative rods. His mycologic cultures, galactomannan, and glucan are also pending.

The patient is currently being treated for pseudomonas in blood and sputum cultures, and the medical team suspects that the agitation/delirium may be due to pain, particularly in the post-operative setting, ICU delirium, or infectious etiology. EEG monitoring shows changes consistent with encephalopathy.

The patient's respiratory failure/tracheostomy is of unclear etiology at this point,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a PEA arrest. He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol, but his course was complicated by seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, agitation/delirium, and now shows slightly improving mental status. 

The patient has a history of fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures for pseudomonal infection. He has been treated with antibiotics but continues to grow moderate pseudomonas in his sputum culture. The antibiotics were discontinued after completing an 8-day course for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

His allergies include codeine, Compazine (oral), penicillins, metformin, heparin agents, and Ativan (oral). 

The patient has received various medications including tobramycin, meropenem, vancomycin, furosemide, and others. 

His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 101/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds, soft abdomen, and no lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, glucose, and troponin-T levels.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been receiving antibiotics for an assumed infection. The sputum culture shows moderate growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common pathogen in hospital-acquired infections. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 101/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 15.1 K/uL, and there are signs of infection in the blood culture. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, but liver enzymes are slightly elevated. The patient has a history of colitis and abdominal distention, and an abdominal X-ray reveals no evidence of megacolon or intestinal obstruction. The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and is being monitored for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's sputum culture shows moderate growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating a possible VAP. This can be a serious infection that may require more aggressive treatment.
2. Pseudomonas infection: P"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He underwent therapeutic hypothermia and had complications including seizures, pneumonia, agitation/delirium, and now shows slightly improving mental status. The patient's medical history includes type II diabetes mellitus, depression, and anemia of unknown etiology. He has multiple comorbidities and is currently being treated for pseudomonas infection in both blood and sputum cultures. The patient has a wrist fracture with external fixation and ORIF of right elbow and wrist, as well as a tracheostomy in place. He requires continued pain management and physical therapy. There are concerns about possible anoxic brain injury, which is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pseudomonas infection: The patient is currently being treated for pseudomonas infection in both blood and sputum cultures. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or antibiotic resistance.
2. Anoxic brain injury: The patient had a PEA arrest and underwent therapeutic hypothermia. There are concerns about possible anoxic brain injury, which is being monitored closely. Regular neurologic assessments should be performed to evaluate mental status and potential neurological deficits.
3. Wrist fracture: The patient has a wrist fracture with external fixation. Regular assessment of the fracture site and proper immobilization are necessary to prevent complications such as infection or malunion"

   Assessment and Plan:
   53 y.o. M admitted to MICU for respiratory distress s/p PEA arrest
   [**2126-9-20**] then completed Arctic Sun cooling protocol, course complicated
   by seizures, pseudomanas-pneumonia, agitation/delirium, now with
   slightly improving mental status.
   .
   # Fever: Fever curve improved, leukocytosis decreasing.
   - cont PO Vanc for Cdiff (at least two weeks, earliest end date [**10-27**])
   - f/u all culture data
   - f/u mycolytic cultures , galactomannan, glucan
   - consider LP if continues to spike fevers
   - continue terbinafine for rash - if does not improve, will consult
   derm
   # Agitation/Delirium: Improved with pt following simple commands after
   decreasing narcotics. Currently treating pseudomonas in blood and
   sputum cultures, though likely this is no longer due to underlying
   infection. [**Month (only) 60**] be due to pain, particularly in post-operative setting,
   too much narcotics, ICU delirium, infectious. EEG shows changes c/w
   encephalopathy
   - continue fentanyl patch at decreased dose at 100 mcg q 72 hours,
   - continue decreased oxycodone 10mg q4 hours prn
   - hold haldol due to prolonged QTc
   - continue clonidine 0.2 mg PO TID
   - continue Keppra 250 mg po BID, d/c tomorrow
   # Respiratory Failure / Trach: Unclear etiology at this point.  NIF
   check unable to be adequately performed due to pt desat. Maintaining on
   10 of PEEP. Sputum culture with persistent pseudomonas s/p complete
   treatment; ? colonization.
   - goal 1L negative diuresis with 20mg iv lasix now.
   - attempt PS 5/5 with ABG afterwards
   - cont steroids 15 mg po daily
   - continue bactrim ppx
   #  Wrist fracture: s/p ex-fix and ORIF of R elbow and wrist [**10-7**]
   - repeat xray
   - appreciate ortho recs
   - ROM for R fingers/elbow, wrist to remain in splint
   - pain control with Fentanyl patch and oxycodone liquid prn
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   # Seizure:  No seizures for > 2 week. Neuro believes that he could have
   a reasonable prognosis given his intermittent responsiveness to
   commands. MRI with pons hyperdensity, no acute stroke. Repeat EEG c/w
   encephalopathy, still with brain activity.
   - f/u neuro recs - ? duration of AED
   - continue Keppra 250 mg po BID
   # C. Diff Infection:
   - continue po vancomycin x 2 weeks (earliest end date [**2126-10-27**])
   # S/P PEA Arrest:  Concern for anxoic brain injury although MRI [**10-2**]
   showed pons pathology that neuro says could be possibly reversible.
   - follow mental status with decreasing sedation and narcotics
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue keppra per neuro
   # Anemia of iron def: s/p 1 unit transfusion [**10-12**]
   - monitor hct
   - continue iron tablets
   - active T&S
   - guiaic all stools
   - Minimize blood draws
   - transfuse for Hct < 21 or active bleeding
   # Sinus Tachycardia: had on admission, now returned after rewarming.
   Does not show evidence of bleeding. No PE on CTA. Bolused without
   improvement. No improvement with fentanyl. Continues to be stable. [**Month (only) 60**]
   be due to brain injury / multiple infections.
   - monitor
   # DM, type II:
   - continue SSI from nursing home
   # Depression: holding Celexa so as not to contribute to mental status

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a prolonged episode of cardiac arrest. He underwent therapeutic hypothermia and experienced seizures, pneumonia, agitation/delirium, and now shows slightly improving mental status. The patient's fever curve has improved, and leukocytosis is decreasing. He is being treated for Clostridium difficile infection, pseudomonas in blood and sputum cultures, and a rash. 

The patient's agitation/delirium has improved with reduced narcotics. An EEG showed changes consistent with encephalopathy. 

The cause of the patient's respiratory failure/tracheostomy is unclear. He is being weaned off mechanical ventilation and maintained on 10 cm H2O PEEP. Sputum cultures still show persistent pseudomonas despite complete treatment. 

The patient had a wrist fracture, elbow, and wrist surgery on 10/7. Orthopedic recommendations are being followed, including range of motion exercises for the right fingers/elbow and wrist, while the wrist will remain in a splint. Pain control is being provided with a fentanyl patch and oxycodone liquid as needed. 

The patient had a seizure, but no seizures have occurred for over two weeks. Neurological evaluation believes the patient has a reasonable prognosis given intermittent responsiveness to commands. An MRI showed pons hyperdensity, but no acute stroke. A repeat EEG showed ongoing brain activity. 

The patient is being treated for C. Diff infection with vancomycin for at least two weeks. 

Other issues include anemia of iron deficiency, sinus tachycardia, depression, diabetes type II, and wrist fracture. 

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition remains in the ICU."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall and 77.1 kg heavy individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note.

The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, seizure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tracheobronchomalacia, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and fracture. They are currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, using CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 456-688 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%, respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 73, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (Tobramycin, Meropenem, Vancomycin), anticoagulant (Fondaparinux), diuretic (Furosemide), and antiepileptic (Keppra). The patient is also on a nutrition regimen with Fibersource HN and has a PICC line inserted.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate (HR) of 94 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 121/68 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 17 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 100%. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and creatinine (Cr) levels, while their platelet count (Plt) is within normal range. Other lab results show abnormalities in liver enzymes (ALT/AST), electrolytes (Na+/K+/Cl-), glucose, and kidney function tests (BUN/Cr).

The patient's physical examination reveals impaired peripheral pulses in the upper extremities and diminished skin assessment. Neurological examination is not assessed due to the patient's impaired arousal, attention, and cognition.

The patient's assessment and plan include impaired skin integrity, fever of unknown origin, impaired ventilation, range of motion impairment, motor function impairment, altered mental status, anoxic brain damage, chronic respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, tracheobronchomalacia, Clostridium difficile infection, and fracture.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include pneumonia, respiratory failure, delirium, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and further deterioration of the patient's neurological status."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y.o. M admitted to MICU for respiratory distress s/p PEA arrest
   [**2126-9-20**] then completed Arctic Sun cooling protocol, course complicated
   by seizures, pseudomanas-pneumonia, agitation/delirium, now with
   slightly improving mental status.
   # Seizure: Clinical seizure observed yesterday by neurology. Given
   absence of prior seizure activity, we had tapered the keppra off
   earlier in the week. We will obtain EEG this morning to look for
   seizure activity now that he is off keppra (prior EEG showed no
   epileptiform activity). Restarted keppra per neuro, will f/u neurology
   recommendations.
   # Vomiting/Aspiration event: Aspiration pneumonitis seen on cxr. Will
   follow fever curve clinically and defer antibiotics.
   Will continue on assist/control, elevated FiO2
   # Respiratory Failure / Trach:
   - AC; bronchoscopy today
   - cont steroids 15 mg po daily
 would decrease in future
   - continue bactrim ppx
   # Nutrition: Needs consistent method of nutrition.
   - Pt pulled NGT, replaced and pending cxr verification
   - consult IP for PEG tube pending sister
s decision/consent.
   .
   # C. difficile : Fever curve improved, leukocytosis decreasing.
   - cont PO Vanc for Cdiff (at least two weeks, earliest end date [**10-27**])
   # Agitation/Delirium:
   Acute worsening overnight likely related to aspiration event, dyspnea.
   Had been improving with pain treatment and decreasing keppra, now c/b
   seizure activity.
   - continue fentanyl patch at decreased dose at 75 mcg q 72 hours
   - continue decreased oxycodone 10mg q4hours prn
   - hold haldol due to prolonged QTc
   - continue clonidine 0.2 mg PO TID
   #  Wrist fracture: s/p ex-fix and ORIF of R elbow and wrist [**10-7**]
   - appreciate ortho recs and OT recs
   - ROM for R fingers/elbow, wrist to remain in splint
   - pain control with Fentanyl patch and oxycodone liquid prn as above
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   # S/P PEA Arrest:  Concern for anxoic brain injury although MRI [**10-2**]
   showed pons pathology that neuro says could be possibly reversible.
   - follow mental status with decreasing sedation and narcotics
   # Anemia of iron def: s/p 1 unit transfusion [**10-12**]
   - monitor hct
   - continue iron tablets
   - active T&S
   - guiaic all stools
   - Minimize blood draws
   - transfuse for Hct < 21 or active bleeding
   # Sinus Tachycardia: Resolving today with HR in 70-90s
   - monitor
   # DM, type II:
   - continue SSI from nursing home
   # Depression: holding Celexa so as not to contribute to mental status

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a PEA arrest. He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol but experienced seizures, pseudomonas pneumonia, agitation/delirium, and now shows slightly improving mental status. The patient has been on assist/control ventilation and elevated FiO2. He has been pulled from the NGT and replaced it with a new one pending confirmation on the chest X-ray. Nutrition is being provided through a PEG tube pending the sister's decision and consent. The patient has a history of C. difficile, which is being treated with PO Vanc for at least two weeks. He is also on fentanyl patch, oxycodone, clonidine, and calcium/vitamin D supplements. The patient underwent ex-fix and ORIF of the right elbow and wrist on 10/7. Physical therapy will focus on ROM for the right fingers/elbow and wrist, while the wrist will remain in a splint. Pain control will be maintained with fentanyl patch and oxycodone liquid prn. The patient is concerned for anoxic brain injury, but an MRI on 10/2 showed reversible pons pathology. Mental status will be monitored with decreasing sedation and narcotics. The patient received a blood transfusion on 10/12 and is being monitored for anemia of iron deficiency. His sinus tachycardia is resolving, and he is being closely monitored for any"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y.o. M admitted to MICU for respiratory distress s/p PEA arrest
   [**2126-9-20**] then completed Arctic Sun cooling protocol, course complicated
   by seizures, pseudomanas-pneumonia, agitation/delirium, now with
   slightly improving mental status.
   # Seizure: Clinical seizure observed yesterday by neurology. Given
   absence of prior seizure activity, we had tapered the keppra off
   earlier in the week. We will obtain EEG this morning to look for
   seizure activity now that he is off keppra (prior EEG showed no
   epileptiform activity). Restarted keppra per neuro, will f/u neurology
   recommendations.
   # Aspiration event: Aspiration pneumonitis seen on cxr. Will follow
   fever curve clinically and defer antibiotics.
   # Nutrition: Needs consistent method of nutrition.
   - pull NGT
   - consult IP for PEG tube pending sister
s decision/consent.
   .
   # C. difficile : Fever curve improved, leukocytosis decreasing.
   - cont PO Vanc for Cdiff (at least two weeks, earliest end date [**10-27**])
   # Agitation/Delirium:
   Had been improving with pain treatment and decreasing keppra, now c/b
   seizure activity.
   - continue fentanyl patch at decreased dose at 75 mcg q 72 hours
   - continue decreased oxycodone 10mg q4hours prn
   - hold haldol due to prolonged QTc
   - continue clonidine 0.2 mg PO TID
   # Respiratory Failure / Trach:
   - attempted PS 0/0 yesterday briefly, did okay but became more
   agitated.
   - cont steroids 15 mg po daily
 would decrease in future
   - continue bactrim ppx
   #  Wrist fracture: s/p ex-fix and ORIF of R elbow and wrist [**10-7**]
   - appreciate ortho recs and OT recs
   - ROM for R fingers/elbow, wrist to remain in splint
   - pain control with Fentanyl patch and oxycodone liquid prn as above
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   # S/P PEA Arrest:  Concern for anxoic brain injury although MRI [**10-2**]
   showed pons pathology that neuro says could be possibly reversible.
   - follow mental status with decreasing sedation and narcotics
   # Anemia of iron def: s/p 1 unit transfusion [**10-12**]
   - monitor hct
   - continue iron tablets
   - active T&S
   - guiaic all stools
   - Minimize blood draws
   - transfuse for Hct < 21 or active bleeding
   # Sinus Tachycardia: Resolving today with HR in 70-90s
   - monitor
   # DM, type II:
   - continue SSI from nursing home
   # Depression: holding Celexa so as not to contribute to mental status

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a PEA arrest. He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol and had seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, agitation/delirium, and now shows slightly improving mental status.

The patient had an aspiration event with aspiration pneumonitis seen on chest X-ray. He also has a history of C. difficile infection, for which he is being treated with Vancomycin. His agitation/delirium is being managed with pain treatment, decreased keppra, and continued clonidine.

The patient's respiratory failure and tracheostomy are being closely monitored. He attempted PS 0/0 yesterday but became more agitated. He is continuing steroids, bactrim prophylaxis, and other medications as before.

The patient also has a wrist fracture with ex-fix and ORIF of the right elbow and wrist on 10/7. He is receiving occupational therapy recommendations and will undergo ROM for the right fingers/elbow, while keeping the wrist in a splint.

There is concern for anoxic brain injury due to the recent PEA arrest, although an MRI on 10/2 showed pons pathology that neurology believes could be reversible. The patient's mental status will be followed with decreasing sedation and narcotics.

Additionally, the patient has anemia of iron deficiency, sinus tach"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a PEA arrest and subsequent Arctic Sun cooling protocol. He has experienced seizures, pseudomonas pneumonia, agitation/delirium, and recurrent seizures. The patient underwent bronchoscopy yesterday and is colonized with gram-negative rods (GNR), likely pseudomonas. His sputum cultures are still pending, along with fungal and Legionella cultures. He has been treated for 14 days for pseudomonal bacteremia/pneumonia. The patient's NG tube tip needs to be advanced, and there are bilateral pleural effusions on the portable chest X-ray. A CTA showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism but revealed a new small left effusion and slightly increased right lower lobe atelectasis. The patient's medical history includes anemia of iron deficiency, depression, diabetes mellitus type II, sinus tachycardia, wrist fracture, and PEA arrest with possible anoxic brain injury. His current medications include fentanyl patch, oxycodone liquid prn, clonidine, Keppra, bactrim ppx, and vancomycin for Clostridium difficile. The patient requires consistent nutrition, pain management, seizure control, and treatment for his various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure/Tracheostomy: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and he is on ventilatory support. There"

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y.o. M admitted to MICU for respiratory distress s/p PEA arrest
   [**2126-9-20**] then completed Arctic Sun cooling protocol, course complicated
   by seizures, pseudomanas-pneumonia, agitation/delirium, now with ?
   recurrent sz activity.
   # Seizure: Clinical seizure observed by neurology. Given absence of
   prior seizure activity, we had tapered the keppra off earlier in the
   week.
   - f/u EEG
   - continue Keppra dosing per Neuro
   - appreciate Neurology input
   # Respiratory Failure / Trach:  s/p bronchoscopy yesteday. Sputum
   cultures still with 3+ GNR, likely he is colonized with pseudomonas and
   is s/p 14 day treatment for pseudomonal bacteremia/pneuonia.
   Additionally, + galactomannan, PCP and fungal cultures still pending
   from bronch.  Mycolytic BCx negative to date.
   - for now, hold on abx and antifungals until culture evidence of
   infection
   - cont steroids 15 mg po daily - would decrease in future, likely early
   next week
   - continue bactrim ppx
   - change to PS today from AC
   # Nutrition: Needs consistent method of nutrition.
   - consult IP for PEG
   .
   # C. difficile : Fever curve improved, leukocytosis decreasing.
   - cont PO Vanc for Cdiff (at least two weeks, earliest end date [**10-27**])
   # Agitation/Delirium: Acute worsening two nights ago likely related to
   aspiration event, dyspnea. Had been improving with pain treatment and

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a prolonged cardiac arrest. He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol, but the course was complicated by seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, agitation/delirium, and recurrent seizure activity. The patient's current condition includes clinical seizures observed by neurology, respiratory failure with tracheostomy, colonization with pseudomonas, treatment for pseudomonal bacteremia/pneumonia, and ongoing cultures for fungal infection. The patient also has a history of C. difficile infection, agitation/delirium, wrist fracture with external fixation and ORIF of right elbow and wrist, anoxic brain injury, anemia of iron deficiency, sinus tachycardia, type II diabetes mellitus, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure Activity: The patient has recurrent seizure activity, which may indicate ongoing neurological complications or an underlying condition causing seizures.
2. Pseudomonal Infection: The patient is colonized with pseudomonas and has received treatment for pseudomonal bacteremia/pneumonia. There is a risk of recurrence or development of resistance to antibiotics.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains compromised, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. Weaning from the ventilator and ensuring adequate oxygenation may pose challenges.
4. C. difficile Infection: The patient has a history of C."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical conditions and complications. He has impaired skin integrity, fever of unknown origin, impaired ventilation, impaired range of motion, impaired motor function, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired transfers, pneumonia acquired in the hospital, chronic respiratory failure, altered mental status, anoxic brain damage, history of cardiac arrest, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation, history of seizure, tracheobronchomalacia, Clostridium difficile infection, and a fracture. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with propofol infusion. He has been receiving various medications and treatments for his conditions. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but he has had fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's physical examination reveals multiple bruises on his body and signs of malnutrition. The patient's current assessment and plan include impaired skin integrity, fever of unknown origin, impaired ventilation, and other pre-existing conditions. The patient's overall condition remains unstable, and he requires close monitoring and management of his various medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has developed hospital-acquired pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and increased risk of infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y.o. M admitted to MICU for respiratory distress s/p PEA arrest
   [**2126-9-20**] then completed Arctic Sun cooling protocol, course complicated
   by seizures, pseudomanas-pneumonia, agitation/delirium, now with ?
   recurrent sz activity.
   # Seizure: Clinical seizure observed by neurology. Given absence of
   prior seizure activity, we had tapered the keppra off earlier in the
   week.
   - f/u EEG
   - continue Keppra dosing per Neuro
   - appreciate Neurology input
   # Respiratory Failure / Trach:  s/p bronchoscopy yesteday. Sputum
   cultures still with 3+ GNR, likely he is colonized with pseudomonas and
   is s/p 14 day treatment for pseudomonal bacteremia/pneuonia.
   Additionally, + galactomannan, PCP and fungal cultures still pending
   from bronch.  Mycolytic BCx negative to date.
   - for now, hold on abx and antifungals until culture evidence of
   infection
   - cont steroids 15 mg po daily - would decrease in future, likely early
   next week
   - continue bactrim ppx
   - change to PS today from AC
   # Nutrition: Needs consistent method of nutrition.
   - consult IP for PEG
   .
   # C. difficile : Fever curve improved, leukocytosis decreasing.
   - cont PO Vanc for Cdiff (at least two weeks, earliest end date [**10-27**])
   # Agitation/Delirium: Acute worsening two nights ago likely related to
   aspiration event, dyspnea. Had been improving with pain treatment and
   decreasing keppra, now c/b seizure activity.
   - continue fentanyl patch at decreased dose at 75 mcg q 72 hours
   - continue decreased oxycodone 10mg q4hours prn
   - hold haldol due to prolonged QTc
   - continue clonidine 0.2 mg PO TID
   - continue Keppra per Neuro
   - f/u EEG
   #  Wrist fracture: s/p ex-fix and ORIF of R elbow and wrist [**10-7**]
   - appreciate ortho recs and OT recs
   - ROM for R fingers/elbow, wrist to remain in splint
   - pain control with Fentanyl patch and oxycodone liquid prn as above
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   # S/P PEA Arrest:  Concern for anxoic brain injury although MRI [**10-2**]
   showed pons pathology that neuro says could be possibly reversible.
   - follow mental status with decreasing sedation and narcotics
   # Anemia of iron def: s/p 1 unit transfusion [**10-12**]
   - monitor hct
   - continue iron tablets
   - active T&S
   - guiaic all stools
   - Minimize blood draws
   - transfuse for Hct < 21 or active bleeding
   # Sinus Tachycardia: Resolving today with HR in 70-90s
   - monitor
   # DM, type II:
   - continue SSI from nursing home
   # Depression: holding Celexa so as not to contribute to mental status

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a PEA arrest on 09/20/2126. He underwent therapeutic hypothermia and had complications including seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, agitation/delirium, and now recurrent seizure activity.
- The patient's current condition includes a wrist fracture with external fixation and ORIF of the right elbow and wrist on 10/07/2126. He is experiencing recurrent clinical seizures observed by neurology, respiratory failure/tracheostomy, potential C. difficile infection, agitation/delirium, anemia of unknown etiology, sinus tachycardia, type II diabetes mellitus, and depression.
- The patient is currently on multiple medications including propofol infusion, Keppra, bactrim prophylaxis, fentanyl patch, oxycodone, clonidine, and calcium/vitamin D supplements.
- The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of up to 15.8 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.9 C (100.2 F), heart rate in the 80-110 bpm range, blood pressure ranging from 115/57 to 145/94 mmHg, respiratory rate around 22 breaths per minute,"

   - ortho recs: nwb rue, okay to begin ROM of fingers and elbow, OT may
   unlock ex-fix for ROM, pin-care with h2O2/Nacl
   - neuro recs: propofol overnight masks seizure activity; keep on doing
   keppra --> 750 mg po BID as they don't believe that pt is sedated from
   keppra. Events are much less than prior on EEG. have not yet reviewed
   push-buttons, but appears that he is having clincal seizures
   - IP consulted for PEG, placed consult on hold for now
   - pt projectile vomited hemeoccult/gastroccult + emesis, stat hct 28,
   KUB with dilated loops of small bowel measuring up to 3.5 cm with air
   fluid levels, though air seen in the rectum, could represent ileus or
   early obstruction --> consulted surgery, likely ileus

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol, but his course was complicated by seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, agitation/delirium, and now recurrent seizure activity. The patient has a history of anemia of iron deficiency and diabetes mellitus type II. He also has a wrist fracture with external fixation and ORIF of the right elbow and wrist. The patient's current condition includes ileus, seizure activity, respiratory failure/tracheostomy, possible colonization with pseudomonas, and colonization with Clostridium difficile. His nutritional status is being monitored, and he is NPO due to ileus. The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and he is at risk for anoxic brain injury. He has a history of depression and sinus tachycardia, which is resolving. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 70-90 beats per minute.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ileus: The patient is showing signs of a possible ileus, which is characterized by dilated loops of small bowel on abdominal film. This can lead to obstruction, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention.
2. Seizure Activity: The patient is experiencing recurrent seizure activity, which requires further investigation and management. This can be potentially life-threatening if not controlled.

   [**2126-9-20**] then completed Arctic Sun cooling protocol, course complicated
   by seizures, pseudomanas-pneumonia, agitation/delirium, now with ?
   recurrent sz activity.
   # Ileus: Pt vomited yesterday and early in the week, surgery following,
   dilated loops of bowel on abd film. Electrolytes are all within normal
   limits.
   - appreciate [**Doctor First Name 458**] involvement
   - NGT to suction
   -NPO, advance when BM
   -serial bowel exams
   # Seizure: Clinical seizure observed by neurology. Given absence of
   prior seizure activity, we had tapered the keppra off earlier in the
   week.
   - f/u EEG
   - continue Keppra dosing per Neuro at lowest dose possible.
   - appreciate Neurology input
   # Respiratory Failure / Trach:  s/p bronchoscopy [**10-16**]. Sputum cultures
   still with 3+ GNR, likely he is colonized with pseudomonas and is s/p
   14 day treatment for pseudomonal bacteremia/pneuonia.  Additionally, +
   glucan, and PCP and fungal cultures still pending from bronch.
   Mycolytic BCx negative to date.
   - for now, hold on abx and antifungals until culture evidence of
   infection
   - cont steroids 15 mg po daily (12mg methylprednisone daily while NPO)-
   would decrease in future, likely early next week
   - continue bactrim ppx
   - change to PS today from AC
   # Nutrition: NPO for ileues
   - needs PEG but will hold on it for now
   .
   # C. difficile : Fever curve improved, leukocytosis decreasing.
   -while NPO add on flagyl IV
   - hold PO Vanc for Cdiff for now (earliest end date [**10-27**])
   # Agitation/Delirium: Acute worsening two nights ago likely related to
   aspiration event, dyspnea, and hypoxia. Had been improving with pain
   treatment and decreasing keppra, now c/b seizure activity.  Required
   propofol overnight.
   - continue fentanyl patch at decreased dose at 75 mcg q 72 hours
   - continue decreased oxycodone 10mg q4hours prn
   - hold haldol due to prolonged QTc
   - continue clonidine 0.2 mg PO TID
   - continue Keppra per Neuro
   - f/u EEG
   #  Wrist fracture: s/p ex-fix and ORIF of R elbow and wrist [**10-7**]
   - appreciate ortho recs and OT recs
   - ROM for R fingers/elbow, wrist to remain in splint
   - pain control with Fentanyl patch and oxycodone liquid prn as above
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   - bacitracin for pin hygiene
   # S/P PEA Arrest:  Concern for anxoic brain injury although MRI [**10-2**]
   showed pons pathology that neuro says could be possibly reversible.
   - follow mental status with decreasing sedation and narcotics
   # Anemia of iron def: s/p 1 unit transfusion [**10-12**]
   - monitor hct
   - continue iron tablets
   - active T&S
   - guiaic all stools
   - Minimize blood draws
   - transfuse for Hct < 21 or active bleeding
   # Sinus Tachycardia: Resolving today with HR in 70-90s
   - monitor
   # DM, type II:
   - continue SSI from nursing home

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a cardiac arrest. He underwent cooling therapy and experienced seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, agitation/delirium, and now has recurrent seizure activity. The patient also has ileus, with dilated loops of bowel seen on abdominal film. Electrolytes are within normal limits. The patient is currently NPO and has a nasogastric tube in place. He is on ventilatory support through a tracheostomy tube. Bronchoscopy was performed on 10/16, and sputum cultures still show 3+ GNR, likely indicating colonization with Pseudomonas. The patient previously received 14 days of treatment for pseudomonal bacteremia/pneumonia. Glucan, PCP, and fungal cultures are pending from bronchoalveolar lavage. Mycolytic blood cultures are negative to date. The patient is being held on antibiotics and antifungals until culture evidence of infection. He is also receiving steroids, bactrim prophylaxis, and has been changed from acetaminophen to propofol for sedation. The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection and is receiving flagyl IV. He has a history of agitation/delirium, which has worsened due to an aspiration event, dyspnea, and hypoxia. He has required propofol for sedation overnight. The patient's wrist"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male who was admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a cardiac arrest. The patient underwent therapeutic hypothermia and subsequently developed seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, agitation/delirium, and now has recurrent seizure activity. The patient also has an ileus that has improved with the initiation of tube feeds and is now stooling. Other issues include respiratory failure/tracheostomy, C. difficile infection, wrist fracture with external fixation and ORIF, potential anoxic brain injury, iron deficiency anemia, sinus tachycardia, depression, and the need for restraints.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent seizures: The patient is experiencing recurrent seizure activity despite being on antiepileptic medication (Keppra). This indicates a potential for further seizure episodes and the need for close monitoring and appropriate seizure management.
2. Pseudomonal infection: The patient has previously had a pseudomonal bacteremia/pneumonia and remains colonized with GNR. There is a risk of recurrent pseudomonal infection, especially if the patient's immune system remains compromised.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient has a current C. difficile infection, and appropriate treatment should be continued to resolve the infection and prevent complications such as colitis or dissemination.
4. Wrist fracture healing: The patient has a wrist fracture with external fixation and ORIF. Monitoring for proper healing and complications such as non-union or mal"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of impaired motor function, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, fever of unknown origin, and impaired ventilation. The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, seizure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tracheobronchomalacia, Clostridium difficile infection, and fracture. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's impaired ventilation and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and decreased blood flow can increase the risk of DVT formation.
3. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity and prolonged immobility increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and impaired arousal, attention, and cognition may progress to delirium.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen due to impaired ventilation.
6. C. difficile Infection: The patient's history of C. difficile infection increases the risk of recurrence or worsening symptoms.
7. Seizure: The patient's history of seizure increases the risk of recurrent seizures.
8. Hypotension: The patient's bradycardia and history of cardiac arrest may predispose him to hypotension.

   53 y.o. M admitted to MICU for respiratory distress s/p PEA arrest
   [**2126-9-20**] then completed Arctic Sun cooling protocol, course complicated
   by seizures, pseudomanas-pneumonia, agitation/delirium, now with ?
   recurrent sz activity.
   # Ileus: Pt vomited yesterday and early in the week, surgery following,
   dilated loops of bowel on abd film, likely etiology is Cdiff
   - appreciate [**Doctor First Name 458**] involvement
   - NGT to suction
   -NPO
   -serial bowel exams
   # Seizure: Clinical seizure observed by neurology. Given absence of
   prior seizure activity, we had tapered the keppra off earlier in the
   week.
   - f/u EEG
   - continue Keppra dosing per Neuro
   - appreciate Neurology input
   # Respiratory Failure / Trach:  s/p bronchoscopy [**10-16**]. Sputum cultures
   still with 3+ GNR, likely he is colonized with pseudomonas and is s/p
   14 day treatment for pseudomonal bacteremia/pneuonia.  Additionally, +
   galactomannan, PCP and fungal cultures still pending from bronch.
   Mycolytic BCx negative to date.
   - for now, hold on abx and antifungals until culture evidence of
   infection
   - cont steroids 15 mg po daily (12mg methylprednisone daily while NPO)-
   would decrease in future, likely early next week
   - continue bactrim ppx
   - change to PS today from AC
   # Nutrition: NPO for ileues
   - needs PEG but will hold on it for now
   .
   # C. difficile : Fever curve improved, leukocytosis decreasing.
   -while NPO add on flagyl IV
   - hold PO Vanc for Cdiff for now (at least two weeks, earliest end date
   [**10-27**])
   # Agitation/Delirium: Acute worsening two nights ago likely related to
   aspiration event, dyspnea, and hypoxia. Had been improving with pain
   treatment and decreasing keppra, now c/b seizure activity.  Required
   propofol overnight.
   - continue fentanyl patch at decreased dose at 75 mcg q 72 hours
   - continue decreased oxycodone 10mg q4hours prn
   - hold haldol due to prolonged QTc
   - continue clonidine 0.2 mg PO TID
   - continue Keppra per Neuro
   - f/u EEG
   #  Wrist fracture: s/p ex-fix and ORIF of R elbow and wrist [**10-7**]
   - appreciate ortho recs and OT recs
   - ROM for R fingers/elbow, wrist to remain in splint
   - pain control with Fentanyl patch and oxycodone liquid prn as above
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   - bacitracin for pin hygiene
   # S/P PEA Arrest:  Concern for anxoic brain injury although MRI [**10-2**]
   showed pons pathology that neuro says could be possibly reversible.
   - follow mental status with decreasing sedation and narcotics
   # Anemia of iron def: s/p 1 unit transfusion [**10-12**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a PEA arrest. He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol but developed seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, agitation/delirium, and now has recurrent seizure activity. The patient also has an ileus with likely C. difficile infection, tracheostomy, and is on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of wrist fracture with ex-fix and ORIF of the right elbow and wrist, anxiety, depression, type II diabetes mellitus, and anemia of iron deficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure activity: The patient is experiencing recurrent seizures, which require further evaluation and management. An EEG should be followed up to assess the underlying cause.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient's ileus and fever curve suggest a possible C. difficile infection. Treatment includes discontinuing unnecessary antibiotics and starting oral Flagyl. It is important to monitor the patient's response to treatment.
3. Respiratory failure/tracheostomy: The patient has a tracheostomy and is on mechanical ventilation. Monitoring his respiratory status and ensuring adequate oxygenation is crucial. Cultures should be pending from bronchoscopy, and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be required if infection is confirmed.
4. Pseudomonal colonization: The patient is colonized with pseudomonas, which has been previously treated. Continuous monitoring for any signs of pseudomonal infection is necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
 ANOXIC BRAIN DAMAGE (ANOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, HYPOXIC ISCHEMIC)
   His mental status has overall improved, but he continues to wax and
   wane over the past week. He has had a reassuring EEG and MRI this
   hospitalization. The most likely explanation for his persistent altered
   mental status appears to be medication effects in the setting of acute
   illness. We have decreased the dose of opiates that he had been on,
   specifically his Fentanyl patch has been decreased from 112 to 100 to
   75mcg ([**10-15**].) Continue oxycodone 10mg q6h PRN with a preference to use
   Tylenol first. He is now on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] although there is no EEG
   evidence of seizing, Neuro is concerned that clinically he is having
   seizing episodes. His perceived anxiety, tachycardia and increased
   movements may have been [**2-11**] respiratory distress as it appears that the
   majority of these episodes were in the setting of hypoxia. The etiology
   of his respiratory distress may be secondary to an aspiration
   pneumonitis in the setting of his emesis on [**10-15**] and again on [**10-17**]. He
   is s/p CTA (no clot, increased bibasilar opacities) and bronch (studies
   pending) on [**10-16**].  Doing well now off propafol.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
            -stable on the vent.  On home dose of prednisone.  Continue
   present settings.
 TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA)
   He has been on PS for the several days this week, but went back on A/C
   on the evening of [**10-15**] after receiving Ativan and oxycodone. He did
   tolerate PS 0/0 for several minutes on [**10-14**] with good tidal volumes and
   respiratory rate. As his clinical status allows, we will pursue trach
   mask trials. Currently on Prednisone 15mg q24h (down from alternating
   20mg / 15mg.). Will attempt PSV when he is off of Propofol this
   morning.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 57**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Completed a course of antibiotics for Pseudomonas. He continues to have
   positive sputum cultures which likely represent colonization. Would not
   treat for sputum culture data alone; rather, would treat only in the
   appropriate clinical context.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continue PO vanc for ~2 weeks after having completed antibiotics (i.e.,
   ~[**2126-10-27**].)  IV flagyl added due to ileus. Restarting po vanco now that
   had BM, and will d/c flagyl this afternoon if tolerating po still

   Assessment and Plan
 ANOXIC BRAIN DAMAGE (ANOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, HYPOXIC ISCHEMIC)
   His mental status has overall improved, but he continues to wax and
   wane over the past week. He has had a reassuring EEG and MRI this
   hospitalization. The most likely explanation for his persistent altered
   mental status appears to be medication effects in the setting of acute
   illness. We have decreased the dose of opiates that he had been on,
   specifically his Fentanyl patch has been decreased from 112 to 100 to
   75mcg ([**10-15**].) Continue oxycodone 10mg q6h PRN with a preference to use
   Tylenol first. He is now on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] although there is no EEG
   evidence of seizing, Neuro is concerned that clinically he is having
   seizing episodes. His perceived anxiety, tachycardia and increased
   movements may have been [**2-11**] respiratory distress as it appears that the
   majority of these episodes were in the setting of hypoxia. The etiology
   of his respiratory distress may be secondary to an aspiration
   pneumonitis in the setting of his emesis on [**10-15**] and again on [**10-17**]. He
   is s/p CTA (no clot, increased bibasilar opacities) and bronch (studies
   pending) on [**10-16**].  Doing well now off propafol.
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
            -stable on the vent.  On home dose of prednisone.  Continue
   present settings.
 TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA)
   He has been on PS for the several days this week, but went back on A/C
   on the evening of [**10-15**] after receiving Ativan and oxycodone. He did
   tolerate PS 0/0 for several minutes on [**10-14**] with good tidal volumes and
   respiratory rate. As his clinical status allows, we will pursue trach
   mask trials. Currently on Prednisone 15mg q24h (down from alternating
   20mg / 15mg.). Will attempt PSV when he is off of Propofol this
   morning.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 57**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Completed a course of antibiotics for Pseudomonas. He continues to have
   positive sputum cultures which likely represent colonization. Would not
   treat for sputum culture data alone; rather, would treat only in the
   appropriate clinical context.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continue PO vanc for ~2 weeks after having completed antibiotics (i.e.,
   ~[**2126-10-27**].)  IV flagyl added due to ileus. Restarting po vanco now that
   had BM, and will d/c flagyl this afternoon if tolerating po still
 FRACTURE, OTHER
   Stable from an Orthopedic perspective. Pain control as above. Hardware
   will be in place for ~6 weeks. Elbow / wrist x-ray performed each
   Monday per Ortho; will f/u Ortho recs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old man with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, steroid-dependent COPD, diastolic heart failure, chronic tracheostomy, and recent wrist fracture. He presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and subsequently developed hypoxemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA). He has been on mechanical ventilation and now is being weaned off. The patient has had episodes of altered mental status, which are believed to be caused by medication effects and acute illness. He has also had episodes of suspected seizures, for which he is being treated with Keppra. The patient's respiratory distress may be due to aspiration pneumonitis. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an acute exacerbation, chronic respiratory failure, tracheobronchomalacia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, and a recent fracture. His sodium levels are high, and he has been experiencing ileus. He is currently on multiple medications and is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient's episodes of altered mental status and respiratory distress may be secondary to aspiration pneumonitis due to emesis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has hospital-acquired pneumonia, which may worsen if not treated appropriately.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, steroid-dependent COPD, diastolic heart failure, chronic tracheostomy, and a recent comminuted wrist fracture. The patient developed hypercarbic respiratory failure after pain medications and experienced hypoxemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA) when transitioning from mechanical ventilation to tracheostomy mask. The patient has been on Keppra for possible seizures versus abnormal motor movements.

24-hour events include an EKG on 10/19/2126 at 12:00 AM and various medication infusions. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 37.8 to 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 104 and 55 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 137/71 mmHg to 105/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's weight is 77.1 kg, and height is 65 inches.

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,026 mL and output of 710 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,316 mL. Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, spontaneous Vt of 427 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O"

 ANOXIC BRAIN DAMAGE (ANOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, HYPOXIC ISCHEMIC)
   His mental status has overall improved, but he continues to wax and
   wane over the past week. He has had a reassuring EEG and MRI this
   hospitalization. The most likely explanation for his persistent altered
   mental status appears to be medication effects in the setting of acute
   illness. We have decreased the dose of opiates that he had been on,
   specifically his Fentanyl patch has been decreased from 112 to 100 to
   75mcg ([**10-15**].) Continue oxycodone 10mg q6h PRN with a preference to use
   Tylenol first. He is now on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] although there is no EEG
   evidence of seizing, Neuro is concerned that clinically he is having
   seizing episodes. His perceived anxiety, tachycardia and increased
   movements may have been [**2-11**] respiratory distress as it appears that the
   majority of these episodes were in the setting of hypoxia. The etiology
   of his respiratory distress may be secondary to an aspiration
   pneumonitis in the setting of his emesis on [**10-15**] and again on [**10-17**]. He
   is s/p CTA (no clot, increased bibasilar opacities) and bronch (studies
   pending) on [**10-16**]. He is obviously calm on Propofol and has awakened
   appropriately off it; will wean it this morning. Will continue to
   attempt to decrease the quantity of narcotics he is receiving; would
   consider decreasing clonidine in the near future as well.

 .H/O CARDIAC ARREST
   He has been on PS for the several days this week, but went back on A/C
   on the evening of [**10-15**] after receiving Ativan and oxycodone. He did
   tolerate PS 0/0 for several minutes on [**10-14**] with good tidal volumes and
   respiratory rate. As his clinical status allows, we will pursue trach
   mask trials. Currently on Prednisone 15mg q24h (down from alternating
   20mg / 15mg.) Will change to Solumedrol 12mg IV q24h while he is NPO.
   Will attempt PSV when he is off of Propofol this morning.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 57**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Completed a course of antibiotics for Pseudomonas. He continues to have
   positive sputum cultures which likely represent colonization. Would not
   treat for sputum culture data alone; rather, would treat only in the
   appropriate clinical context.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)

   Stable from an Orthopedic perspective. Pain control as above. Hardware
   will be in place for ~6 weeks. Elbow / wrist x-ray performed each

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old man with tracheobronchomalacia, steroid-dependent COPD, diastolic heart failure, chronic tracheostomy, and a recent wrist fracture. He presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and subsequently developed hypoxemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA) during transition from mechanical ventilation to tracheostomy mask. He was treated with cooling and showed slowly improving mental status. Imaging studies ruled out stroke and anoxic brain injury but revealed microvascular changes or demyelination in the pons. The patient has been on Keppra for possible seizures or abnormal motor movements.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including anoxic brain damage, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation and respiratory failure, tracheobronchomalacia, a history of cardiac arrest, hospital-acquired pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, a comminuted wrist fracture, hypernatremia, and possibly aspiration pneumonitis.

Plan:

1. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient's mental status has improved, but he continues to experience fluctuations. Medication effects are likely contributing to his altered mental status, so the dose of opiates has been decreased. He will continue on oxycodone 10mg q6h PRN, with preference for Tylenol first. Keppra 500mg has been started, although there is no EEG evidence of seizing. The"

   Assessment and Plan
 ANOXIC BRAIN DAMAGE (ANOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, HYPOXIC ISCHEMIC)
   His mental status has overall improved, but he continues to wax and
   wane over the past week. He has had a reassuring EEG and MRI this
   hospitalization. The most likely explanation for his persistent altered
   mental status appears to be medication effects in the setting of acute
   illness. We have decreased the dose of opiates that he had been on,
   specifically his Fentanyl patch has been decreased from 112 to 100 to
   75mcg ([**10-15**].) Continue oxycodone 10mg q6h PRN with a preference to use
   Tylenol first. He is now on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] although there is no EEG
   evidence of seizing, Neuro is concerned that clinically he is having
   seizing episodes. His perceived anxiety, tachycardia and increased
   movements may have been [**2-11**] respiratory distress as it appears that the
   majority of these episodes were in the setting of hypoxia. The etiology
   of his respiratory distress may be secondary to an aspiration
   pneumonitis in the setting of his emesis on [**10-15**] and again on [**10-17**]. He
   is s/p CTA (no clot, increased bibasilar opacities) and bronch (studies
   pending) on [**10-16**]. He is obviously calm on Propofol and has awakened
   appropriately off it; will wean it this morning. Will continue to
   attempt to decrease the quantity of narcotics he is receiving; would
   consider decreasing clonidine in the near future as well.
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA)
 .H/O CARDIAC ARREST
   He has been on PS for the several days this week, but went back on A/C
   on the evening of [**10-15**] after receiving Ativan and oxycodone. He did
   tolerate PS 0/0 for several minutes on [**10-14**] with good tidal volumes and
   respiratory rate. As his clinical status allows, we will pursue trach
   mask trials. Currently on Prednisone 15mg q24h (down from alternating
   20mg / 15mg.) Will change to Solumedrol 12mg IV q24h while he is NPO.
   Will attempt PSV when he is off of Propofol this morning.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 57**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Completed a course of antibiotics for Pseudomonas. He continues to have
   positive sputum cultures which likely represent colonization. Would not
   treat for sputum culture data alone; rather, would treat only in the
   appropriate clinical context.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continue PO vanc for ~2 weeks after having completed antibiotics (i.e.,
   ~[**2126-10-27**].)
 FRACTURE, OTHER
   Stable from an Orthopedic perspective. Pain control as above. Hardware
   will be in place for ~6 weeks. Elbow / wrist x-ray performed each
   Monday per Ortho; will f/u Ortho recs.
 HYPERNATREMIA
   Sodium 147 this morning. He is not getting free H2O [**2-11**] his bowel rest.
   [**Month (only) 60**] provide him D5W to correct his hypernatremia. Follow electrolytes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with tracheobronchomalacia, steroid-dependent COPD, diastolic heart failure, chronic tracheostomy, and a recent comminuted wrist fracture. He presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and subsequently developed hypoxemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA) while transitioning from mechanical ventilation to tracheostomy mask. The patient has been off and on Keppra for possible seizures versus abnormal motor movements. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/71 mmHg to 105/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. He is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 17 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. 

The patient has undergone several tests and procedures, including an EKG, EEG, head CT, MRI, chest X-ray, and various blood tests. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and increased troponin-T levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal range.

","The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol and had seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, and agitation/delirium. Currently, the patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure with tracheostomy, ileus, seizure activity, nutrition, C. difficile infection, agitation/delirium, wrist fracture with external fixation and open reduction internal fixation (ORIF), post-PEA arrest with possible anoxic brain injury, anemia of iron deficiency, sinus tachycardia, and diabetes mellitus type II.

The patient's medical history is significant for a wrist fracture with ORIF, PEA arrest, seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, agitation/delirium, C. difficile infection, anemia of iron deficiency, diabetes mellitus type II, and sinus tachycardia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 35%, and a pulse oximetry reading of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, normal heart sounds, bilateral pleural eff"

   Heart is enlarged. There is mild congestive failure. Essentially, no
   change
   from the prior study.
   EEG: [**2126-10-18**]: This is an abnormal video EEG due to low voltage and
   slowing of the background activity. There were no epileptiform
   discharges or electrographic seizures. This telemetry captured three
   pushbutton activations, two involving sudden elevation of the arm(s)
   without obvious EEG correlate. These findings are consistent with a
   moderate to severe encephalopathy secondary to anoxic injury. On video,
   abrupt episode of bilateral arm elevation with sustained elevation for
   a couple of seconds suggests frontal seizure activity that may not be
   detected on current study. Clinical correlation is recommended.
   Compared to EEG from prior 24 hours, this study is unchanged.

The patient, a 53-year-old male, is currently admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a previous PEA arrest. He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol and has since experienced seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, and agitation/delirium. The patient's mental status has improved significantly, with the ability to answer yes and no questions and know his location. 

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure/tracheostomy, ileus (resolved), seizure activity, nutrition, C. difficile infection, agitation/delirium, wrist fracture with external fixation and ORIF of right elbow and wrist, previous PEA arrest with possible anoxic brain injury, anemia of iron deficiency, sinus tachycardia, and type II diabetes mellitus.

The patient is currently receiving various treatments and medications, including steroids, bactrim prophylaxis, PS (possibly physiotherapy or pulmonary hygiene), tube feeds, flagyl for C. difficile, fentanyl patch for pain management, oxycodone, haldol (held due to prolonged QTc), clonidine, Keppra for seizures, calcium and vitamin D supplements, bacitracin for pin hygiene, bisphosphonate at discharge, iron tablets, and blood transfusion as needed. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 113/63 mm"

   [**2126-9-20**] then completed Arctic Sun cooling protocol, course complicated
   by seizures, pseudomanas-pneumonia, agitation/delirium, now with ?
   recurrent sz activity.
   # Respiratory Failure / Trach:  s/p bronchoscopy [**10-16**]. Sputum cultures
   still with 3+ GNR, likely he is colonized with pseudomonas and is s/p
   14 day treatment for pseudomonal bacteremia/pneuonia.  Additionally, +
   glucan, and PCP and fungal cultures still pending from bronch.
   Mycolytic BCx negative to date.
   - for now, hold on abx and antifungals until culture evidence of
   infection
   - cont steroids 15 mg po daily would decrease in future, likely early
   next week
   - continue bactrim ppx
   - change to PS today from AC
   # Ileus: Improved, now stooling
   - appreciate [**Doctor First Name 458**] involvement
   - advance tube feeds slowly
   -switch meds to PO from IV
   # Seizure: Clinical seizure observed by neurology. Given absence of
   prior seizure activity, we had tapered the keppra off earlier in the
   week.
   - f/u EEG
   - continue Keppra dosing per Neuro
   - appreciate Neurology input
   # Nutrition:
   -resuming tube feeds, follow residuals
   - needs PEG but will hold on it for now
   .
   # C. difficile : Fever curve improved, leukocytosis decreasing.
   -cont IV flagyl until tolerating PO well
   - PO Vanc for Cdiff for now (earliest end date [**10-27**])
   # Agitation/Delirium: Acute worsening two nights ago likely related to
   aspiration event, dyspnea, and hypoxia. Had been improving with pain
   treatment and decreasing keppra, now c/b seizure activity.  Required
   propofol overnight.
   - continue fentanyl patch at decreased dose at 50 mcg q 72 hours([**10-19**])
   - continue decreased oxycodone 10mg q4hours prn
   - hold haldol due to prolonged QTc
   - continue clonidine 0.2 mg PO TID
   - continue Keppra per Neuro
   - f/u EEG
   #  Wrist fracture: s/p ex-fix and ORIF of R elbow and wrist [**10-7**]
   - appreciate ortho recs and OT recs
   - ROM for R fingers/elbow, wrist to remain in splint
   - pain control with Fentanyl patch and oxycodone liquid prn as above
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   - bacitracin for pin hygiene
   # S/P PEA Arrest:  Concern for anxoic brain injury although MRI [**10-2**]
   showed pons pathology that neuro says could be possibly reversible.
   - follow mental status with decreasing sedation and narcotics
   # Anemia of iron def: s/p 1 unit transfusion [**10-12**]
   - monitor hct
   - continue iron tablets
   - active T&S
   - guiac all stools
   - Minimize blood draws
   - transfuse for Hct < 21 or active bleeding
   # Sinus Tachycardia: Resolving today with HR in 70-90s
   - monitor
   # DM, type II:
   - continue SSI from nursing home

   Assessment and Plan
 ANOXIC BRAIN DAMAGE (ANOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, HYPOXIC ISCHEMIC)
   His mental status has overall improved, but he continues to wax and
   wane over the past week. He has had a reassuring EEG and MRI this
   hospitalization. The most likely explanation for his persistent altered
   mental status appears to be medication effects in the setting of acute
   illness. We have decreased the dose of opiates that he had been on,
   specifically his Fentanyl patch has been decreased from 112 to 100 to
   75mcg ([**10-15**].) Continue oxycodone 10mg q6h PRN with a preference to use
   Tylenol first. He is now on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] although there is no EEG
   evidence of seizing, Neuro is concerned that clinically he is having
   seizing episodes. His perceived anxiety, tachycardia and increased
   movements may have been [**2-11**] respiratory distress as it appears that the
   majority of these episodes were in the setting of hypoxia. The etiology
   of his respiratory distress may be secondary to an aspiration
   pneumonitis in the setting of his emesis on [**10-15**] and again on [**10-17**]. He
   is s/p CTA (no clot, increased bibasilar opacities) and bronch (studies
   pending) on [**10-16**].  Doing well now off propafol.
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
            -stable on the vent.  On home dose of prednisone.  Continue
   present settings.
 TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA)
   He has been on PS for the several days this week, but went back on A/C
   on the evening of [**10-15**] after receiving Ativan and oxycodone. He did
   tolerate PS 0/0 for several minutes on [**10-14**] with good tidal volumes and
   respiratory rate. As his clinical status allows, we will pursue trach
   mask trials. Currently on Prednisone 15mg q24h (down from alternating
   20mg / 15mg.). Will attempt PSV when he is off of Propofol this
   morning.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 57**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Completed a course of antibiotics for Pseudomonas. He continues to have
   positive sputum cultures which likely represent colonization. Would not
   treat for sputum culture data alone; rather, would treat only in the
   appropriate clinical context.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continue PO vanc for ~2 weeks after having completed antibiotics (i.e.,
   ~[**2126-10-27**].)  IV flagyl added due to ileus. Restarting po vanco now that
   had BM, and will d/c flagyl this afternoon if tolerating po still
 FRACTURE, OTHER
   Stable from an Orthopedic perspective. Pain control as above. Hardware
   will be in place for ~6 weeks. Elbow / wrist x-ray performed each
   Monday per Ortho; will f/u Ortho recs.
 HYPERNATREMIA
   Sodium better at 144 today.  Daily lytes
   -ILEUS:  all po feeds/meds held due to ileus, but now moving his bowels
   so restarting feeds and po meds.  Will monitor closely to make sure he
   tolerates.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old man with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, steroid-dependent COPD, and diastolic heart failure. He presented with a comminuted wrist fracture and developed hypercarbic respiratory failure. He also experienced hypoxemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA) when transitioning from mechanical ventilation to tracheostomy mask, with mucous plugging versus bronchospasm. The patient has been on cooling therapy and shows slowly improving mental status. Imaging studies, including a head CT and MRI, have been negative for stroke or anoxic brain injury but show microvascular changes versus demyelination in the pons. The patient has been on Keppra for possible seizures versus abnormal motor movements. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient's persistent altered mental status is likely due to medication effects in the setting of acute illness. Decreasing the dose of opiates has been done, and the patient is now on Keppra for possible seizures.
2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation with Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress may be secondary to aspiration pneumonitis in the setting of emesis. He is stable on the ventilator and receiving home dose of prednisone.
3. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has been on positive pressure support for several days and tolerated spontaneous breathing trials. Trache"

   Assessment and Plan
 ANOXIC BRAIN DAMAGE (ANOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, HYPOXIC ISCHEMIC)
   His mental status has overall improved, but he continues to wax and
   wane over the past week. He has had a reassuring EEG and MRI this
   hospitalization. The most likely explanation for his persistent altered
   mental status appears to be medication effects in the setting of acute
   illness. We have decreased the dose of opiates that he had been on,
   specifically his Fentanyl patch has been decreased from 112 to 100 to
   75mcg ([**10-15**].) Continue oxycodone 10mg q6h PRN with a preference to use
   Tylenol first. He is now on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] although there is no EEG
   evidence of seizing, Neuro is concerned that clinically he is having
   seizing episodes. His perceived anxiety, tachycardia and increased
   movements may have been [**2-11**] respiratory distress as it appears that the
   majority of these episodes were in the setting of hypoxia. The etiology
   of his respiratory distress may be secondary to an aspiration
   pneumonitis in the setting of his emesis on [**10-15**] and again on [**10-17**]. He
   is s/p CTA (no clot, increased bibasilar opacities) and bronch (studies
   pending) on [**10-16**].  Doing well now off propafol, and respiratory status
   now improved.  Stable on [**10-14**].
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
     -secondary to COPD, tracheobronchomalacia (severe), complicated by
   VAP, which has been treated.  Now stable on PSV, weaning pressure
   support.  Will try [**5-14**] today
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 57**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Completed a course of antibiotics for Pseudomonas. He continues to have
   positive sputum cultures which likely represent colonization. Would not
   treat for sputum culture data alone; rather, would treat only in the
   appropriate clinical context.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continue PO vanc for ~2 weeks after having completed antibiotics (i.e.,
   ~[**2126-10-27**].)  IV flagyl added due to ileus. Restarting po vanco now that
   had BM, and will d/c flagyl this afternoon if tolerating po still
 FRACTURE, OTHER
   Stable from an Orthopedic perspective. Pain control as above. Hardware
   will be in place for ~6 weeks. Elbow / wrist x-ray performed each
   Monday per Ortho; will f/u Ortho recs.

   care.  Mr [**Known lastname 6115**] is comfortable on the vent today and interactive,
   showing significant improvement in hypoxic encephalopathy. Narcotics
   being weaned but efforts so far to get him down to PSV 5/5 have been
   unsuccessful. Bowel sounds excellent and NGT feedings have been
   resumed. WBC has greadually improved and pt is now on p.o Vanco for C

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, steroid-dependent COPD, diastolic heart failure, chronic tracheostomy, and a recent comminuted wrist fracture. The patient presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and subsequently developed hypoxemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA) when transitioning from mechanical ventilation to tracheostomy mask. The patient also experienced mucous plugging versus bronchospasm and was treated with cooling, which led to an improvement in mental status. Head CT and MRI results were negative for stroke but showed a lesion in the pons, suggesting microvascular changes versus demyelination.

The patient's allergies include codeine, Compazine (oral), penicillins, metformin, and heparin agents. The last dose of antibiotics administered was Vancomycin orally.

The patient's current medications include iron sulfate, calcium, bactrim DC, vitamin D, senna, fondaparinux, albuterol, RISS (possibly referring to a medication regimen), clonidine, coalce (likely referring to a medication), lansoprazole, fentanyl patch 50 mcg, and Keppra 750mg orally twice a day.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the development of hypercarbic respiratory failure and subsequent hypoxemic PEA. The patient's vital signs"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old man with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, steroid-dependent COPD, diastolic heart failure, and chronic tracheostomy. He presented with a comminuted wrist fracture and developed hypercarbic respiratory failure after pain medication. The course of treatment was complicated by hypoxemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA) during the transition from ventilator to tracheostomy mask, mucous plugging versus bronchospasm. He has been improving slowly with mental status improvement, but still experiences episodes of altered mental status. Head CT and MRI were negative for stroke, but showed a lesion in the pons with microvascular changes versus demyelination. The patient is currently on Keppra for possible seizures versus abnormal motor movements. 

The patient has a history of ileus, which has now resolved. He is receiving tube feeds and oral medications again. He has multiple allergies, including codeine, Compazine, penicillins, metformin, and heparin agents. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 113/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and sinus rhythm. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. Other lab results,"

   Assessment and Plan
 ANOXIC BRAIN DAMAGE (ANOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, HYPOXIC ISCHEMIC)
   His mental status has overall improved, but he continues to wax and
   wane over the past week. He has had a reassuring EEG and MRI this
   hospitalization. The most likely explanation for his persistent altered
   mental status appears to be medication effects in the setting of acute
   illness. We have decreased the dose of opiates that he had been on,
   specifically his Fentanyl patch has been decreased from 112 to 100 to
   75mcg ([**10-15**].) Continue oxycodone 10mg q6h PRN with a preference to use
   Tylenol first. He is now on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] although there is no EEG
   evidence of seizing, Neuro is concerned that clinically he is having
   seizing episodes. His perceived anxiety, tachycardia and increased
   movements may have been [**2-11**] respiratory distress as it appears that the
   majority of these episodes were in the setting of hypoxia. The etiology
   of his respiratory distress may be secondary to an aspiration
   pneumonitis in the setting of his emesis on [**10-15**] and again on [**10-17**]. He
   is s/p CTA (no clot, increased bibasilar opacities) and bronch (studies
   pending) on [**10-16**].  Doing well now off propafol, and respiratory status
   now improved.  Stable on [**10-14**].
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
     -secondary to COPD, tracheobronchomalacia (severe), complicated by
   VAP, which has been treated.  Now stable on PSV, weaning pressure
   support.  Will try [**5-14**] today
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 57**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Completed a course of antibiotics for Pseudomonas. He continues to have
   positive sputum cultures which likely represent colonization. Would not
   treat for sputum culture data alone; rather, would treat only in the
   appropriate clinical context.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continue PO vanc for ~2 weeks after having completed antibiotics (i.e.,
   ~[**2126-10-27**].)  IV flagyl added due to ileus. Restarting po vanco now that
   had BM, and will d/c flagyl this afternoon if tolerating po still
 FRACTURE, OTHER
   Stable from an Orthopedic perspective. Pain control as above. Hardware
   will be in place for ~6 weeks. Elbow / wrist x-ray performed each
   Monday per Ortho; will f/u Ortho recs.

He presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and later developed hypoxemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA) when transitioning from mechanical ventilation to tracheostomy mask. He also had mucous plugging versus bronchospasm, and his mental status improved slowly after cooling. Head CT was negative for stroke, and MRI showed microvascular changes versus demyelination in the pons. The patient has been on Keppra for possible seizures versus abnormal motor movements.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), a heart rate of 74 bpm with a range of 53-101 bpm, a blood pressure of 113/63 mmHg with a range of 110-135/56-98 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with a range of 15-27 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 35%. He is on CPAP/PSV with a peak inspiratory pressure of 17 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) showing pH 7.35, partial"

 ANOXIC BRAIN DAMAGE (ANOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, HYPOXIC ISCHEMIC)
   His mental status has overall improved, but he continues to wax and
   wane over the past week. He has had a reassuring EEG and MRI this
   hospitalization. The most likely explanation for his persistent altered
   mental status appears to be medication effects in the setting of acute
   illness. We have decreased the dose of opiates that he had been on,
   specifically his Fentanyl patch has been decreased from 112 to 100 to
   75mcg ([**10-15**].) Continue oxycodone 10mg q6h PRN with a preference to use
   Tylenol first. He is now on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] although there is no EEG
   evidence of seizing, Neuro is concerned that clinically he is having
   seizing episodes. His perceived anxiety, tachycardia and increased
   movements may have been [**2-11**] respiratory distress as it appears that the
   majority of these episodes were in the setting of hypoxia. The etiology
   of his respiratory distress may be secondary to an aspiration
   pneumonitis in the setting of his emesis on [**10-15**] and again on [**10-17**]. He
   is s/p CTA (no clot, increased bibasilar opacities) and bronch (studies
   pending) on [**10-16**].  Doing well now off propafol, and respiratory status
   now improved.  Stable on [**10-14**].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including tracheobronchomalacia, steroid-dependent COPD, diastolic heart failure, chronic tracheostomy, and a recent wrist fracture. The patient presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and subsequently developed hypoxemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA) during the transition from mechanical ventilation to tracheostomy mask. 

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status with intermittent improvement, seizures, respiratory distress, pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, and a fractured wrist. The patient has been on several medications including fentanyl patch, Keppra for possible seizures, and prednisone for COPD.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate ranging from 64-86 bpm, blood pressure between 116/70-141/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12-28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation above 99%, and temperature within normal range.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and normal platelet count. Kidney function is within normal limits, while liver enzymes and electrolytes are also normal.

Radiological imaging reveals no evidence of stroke or anoxic brain injury, but there is a lesion in the pons indicating microvascular changes or demyelination.

The patient's assessment and plan include anoxic brain damage, chronic respiratory failure secondary to"

   Assessment and Plan
 ANOXIC BRAIN DAMAGE (ANOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, HYPOXIC ISCHEMIC)
   His mental status has overall improved, but he continues to wax and
   wane over the past week. He has had a reassuring EEG and MRI this
   hospitalization. The most likely explanation for his persistent altered
   mental status appears to be medication effects in the setting of acute
   illness. We have decreased the dose of opiates that he had been on,
   specifically his Fentanyl patch has been decreased from 112 to 100 to
   75mcg ([**10-15**].) Continue oxycodone 10mg q6h PRN with a preference to use
   Tylenol first. He is now on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] although there is no EEG
   evidence of seizing, Neuro is concerned that clinically he is having
   seizing episodes. His perceived anxiety, tachycardia and increased
   movements may have been [**2-11**] respiratory distress as it appears that the
   majority of these episodes were in the setting of hypoxia. The etiology
   of his respiratory distress may be secondary to an aspiration
   pneumonitis in the setting of his emesis on [**10-15**] and again on [**10-17**]. He
   is s/p CTA (no clot, increased bibasilar opacities) and bronch (studies
   pending) on [**10-16**].  Doing well now off propafol, and respiratory status
   now improved.  Stable on [**10-14**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old man with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, steroid-dependent COPD, diastolic heart failure, and chronic tracheostomy. He presented with a comminuted wrist fracture and developed hypercarbic respiratory failure. The course was complicated by hypoxemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA) during transition from mechanical ventilation to tracheostomy mask, mucous plugging versus bronchospasm. The patient has shown slowly improving mental status after cooling and has negative head CT for stroke. MRI showed a lesion in the pons with microvascular changes versus demyelination. He is currently on Keppra for possible seizures versus abnormal motor movements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure secondary to COPD and tracheobronchomalacia. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to underlying lung disease and potential aspiration events.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for Pseudomonas pneumonia but continues to have positive sputum cultures, which may indicate colonization. There is a risk of developing another hospital-acquired pneumonia.
3. Anoxic Brain Damage: The patient has anoxic encephalopathy with persistent altered mental status. There is a risk of further neurological decline if the underlying cause is not addressed.
4. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has been treated for C."

   Assessment and Plan
 ANOXIC BRAIN DAMAGE (ANOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, HYPOXIC ISCHEMIC)
   His mental status has overall improved, but he continues to wax and
   wane over the past week. He has had a reassuring EEG and MRI this
   hospitalization. The most likely explanation for his persistent altered
   mental status appears to be medication effects in the setting of acute
   illness. We have decreased the dose of opiates that he had been on,
   specifically his Fentanyl patch has been decreased from 112 to 100 to
   75mcg ([**10-15**].) Continue oxycodone 10mg q6h PRN with a preference to use
   Tylenol first. He is now on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] although there is no EEG
   evidence of seizing, Neuro is concerned that clinically he is having
   seizing episodes. His perceived anxiety, tachycardia and increased
   movements may have been [**2-11**] respiratory distress as it appears that the
   majority of these episodes were in the setting of hypoxia. The etiology
   of his respiratory distress may be secondary to an aspiration
   pneumonitis in the setting of his emesis on [**10-15**] and again on [**10-17**]. He
   is s/p CTA (no clot, increased bibasilar opacities) and bronch (studies
   pending) on [**10-16**].  Doing well now off propafol, and respiratory status
   now improved.  Stable on [**10-14**].
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
     -secondary to COPD, tracheobronchomalacia (severe), complicated by
   VAP, which has been treated.  Now stable on PSV, weaning pressure
   support.  Will try [**5-14**] today
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 57**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Completed a course of antibiotics for Pseudomonas. He continues to have
   positive sputum cultures which likely represent colonization. Would not
   treat for sputum culture data alone; rather, would treat only in the
   appropriate clinical context.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continue PO vanc for ~2 weeks after having completed antibiotics (i.e.,
   ~[**2126-10-27**].)  IV flagyl added due to ileus. Restarting po vanco now that
   had BM, and will d/c flagyl this afternoon if tolerating po still
 FRACTURE, OTHER
   Stable from an Orthopedic perspective. Pain control as above. Hardware
   will be in place for ~6 weeks. Elbow / wrist x-ray performed each

He has been experiencing respiratory failure, pneumonia, anoxic brain damage, and Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's mental status has been improving overall but continues to fluctuate. The most likely explanation for his persistent altered mental status appears to be medication effects in the setting of acute illness.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old man with tracheobronchomalacia, steroid-dependent COPD, diastolic heart failure, and chronic tracheostomy. He presented with a comminuted wrist fracture and developed hypercarbic respiratory failure. His course was complicated by hypoxemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA) during the transition from mechanical ventilation to tracheostomy mask, as well as mucous plugging versus bronchospasm. The patient underwent cooling and showed slowly improving mental status. Head CT and MRI were negative for stroke and anoxic brain injury, but MRI revealed a lesion in the pons with microvascular changes versus demyelination. He has been on Keppra for possible seizures versus abnormal motor movements. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Anoxic brain damage: The patient's mental status has improved but continues to fluctuate. Medication effects and acute illness may be contributing to his persistent altered mental status.
2. Respiratory failure, chronic: The patient has severe tracheobronchomalacia and COPD, which can lead to chronic respiratory failure. Additionally, he experienced ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) that was treated. He is currently stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is being weaned off pressure support.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for Pseudomonas but continues to have positive sputum cultures, indicating"

   Assessment and Plan
 ANOXIC BRAIN DAMAGE (ANOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, HYPOXIC ISCHEMIC)
   His mental status has overall improved, but he continues to wax and
   wane over the past week. He has had a reassuring EEG and MRI this
   hospitalization. The most likely explanation for his persistent altered
   mental status appears to be medication effects in the setting of acute
   illness. We have decreased the dose of opiates that he had been on,
   specifically his Fentanyl patch has been decreased from 112 to 100 to
   75mcg ([**10-15**].) Continue oxycodone 10mg q6h PRN with a preference to use
   Tylenol first. He is now on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] although there is no EEG
   evidence of seizing, Neuro is concerned that clinically he is having
   seizing episodes. His perceived anxiety, tachycardia and increased
   movements may have been [**2-11**] respiratory distress as it appears that the
   majority of these episodes were in the setting of hypoxia. The etiology
   of his respiratory distress may be secondary to an aspiration
   pneumonitis in the setting of his emesis on [**10-15**] and again on [**10-17**]. He
   is s/p CTA (no clot, increased bibasilar opacities) and bronch (studies
   pending) on [**10-16**].  Doing well now off propafol, and respiratory status
   now improved.  Stable on [**10-14**].
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
     -secondary to COPD, tracheobronchomalacia (severe), complicated by
   VAP, which has been treated.  Now stable on PSV, weaning pressure
   support.  Will try [**5-14**] today
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 57**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Completed a course of antibiotics for Pseudomonas. He continues to have
   positive sputum cultures which likely represent colonization. Would not
   treat for sputum culture data alone; rather, would treat only in the
   appropriate clinical context.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continue PO vanc for ~2 weeks after having completed antibiotics (i.e.,
   ~[**2126-10-27**].)  IV flagyl added due to ileus. Restarting po vanco now that
   had BM, and will d/c flagyl this afternoon if tolerating po still
 FRACTURE, OTHER
   Stable from an Orthopedic perspective. Pain control as above. Hardware
   will be in place for ~6 weeks. Elbow / wrist x-ray performed each
   Monday per Ortho; will f/u Ortho recs.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old man with a history of tracheobronchomalacia, steroid-dependent COPD, diastolic heart failure, chronic tracheostomy, and a recent wrist fracture. He presented with hypercarbic respiratory failure and subsequent hypoxemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA) during the transition from mechanical ventilation to tracheostomy mask. The patient's mental status has been slowly improving after cooling, with negative head CT and MRI for stroke or anoxic brain injury. However, there are microvascular changes in the pons, which could indicate demyelination or other conditions. The patient has been on Keppra for possible seizures or abnormal motor movements. 

The patient has multiple allergies, including codeine, Compazine, penicillins, metformin, heparin agents, and Ativan. His last doses of antibiotics were metronidazole and vancomycin on October 20th, 2026. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/70 to 141/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume of 77 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2"

   Assessment and Plan
 ANOXIC BRAIN DAMAGE (ANOXIC ENCEPHALOPATHY, HYPOXIC ISCHEMIC)
   His mental status has overall improved, but he continues to wax and
   wane over the past week. He has had a reassuring EEG and MRI this
   hospitalization. The most likely explanation for his persistent altered
   mental status appears to be medication effects in the setting of acute
   illness. We have decreased the dose of opiates that he had been on,
   specifically his Fentanyl patch has been decreased from 112 to 100 to
   75mcg ([**10-15**].) Continue oxycodone 10mg q6h PRN with a preference to use
   Tylenol first. He is now on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] although there is no EEG
   evidence of seizing, Neuro is concerned that clinically he is having
   seizing episodes. His perceived anxiety, tachycardia and increased
   movements may have been [**2-11**] respiratory distress as it appears that the
   majority of these episodes were in the setting of hypoxia. The etiology
   of his respiratory distress may be secondary to an aspiration
   pneumonitis in the setting of his emesis on [**10-15**] and again on [**10-17**]. He
   is s/p CTA (no clot, increased bibasilar opacities) and bronch (studies
   pending) on [**10-16**].  Doing well now off propafol, and respiratory status
   now improved.  Stable on [**10-14**].
           -head CT done last night after fall
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
     -secondary to COPD, tracheobronchomalacia (severe), complicated by
   VAP, which has been treated.  Now stable on PSV, weaning pressure
   support.  Does not do well with daily trials of [**5-14**], but very stable on
   [**10-14**].  Will need slow wean at pulm rehab.  Decreased prednisone to 10mg
   daily.  Continuing inhalers
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 57**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Completed a course of antibiotics for Pseudomonas. He continues to have
   positive sputum cultures which likely represent colonization. Would not
   treat for sputum culture data alone; rather, would treat only in the
   appropriate clinical context.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continue PO vanc for ~2 weeks after having completed antibiotics (i.e.,
   ~[**2126-10-27**].)  IV flagyl added due to ileus. Now back on po vanco and off
   flagyl
 FRACTURE, OTHER
   Stable from an Orthopedic perspective. Pain control as above. Hardware
   will be in place for ~6 weeks. Elbow / wrist x-ray performed each
   Monday per Ortho; will f/u Ortho recs.  Fell out of bed last night and
   dislodged pin, but ortho was able to replace it at bedside
   -GI-Ileus last week, now resolved.  PEG in am.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.  To that I would add the
   following:  Mr. [**Known lastname 6115**] fell from bed overnight and had to have
   external orthopedic hardware adjusted.  Despite this, his mental status
   is significantly improved today.  He is alert and interactive. Will try

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with tracheobronchomalacia, steroid-dependent COPD, and diastolic heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU after developing hypercarbic respiratory failure following a comminuted wrist fracture. The patient's condition was complicated by hypoxemic pulseless electrical activity (PEA) during a transition from mechanical ventilation to tracheostomy mask, as well as mucous plugging versus bronchospasm. He underwent cooling therapy and showed a slowly improving mental status. Head CT and MRI results were negative for stroke and anoxic brain injury, but an MRI showed a lesion in the pons with microvascular changes versus demyelination. The patient has been on Keppra for possible seizures versus abnormal motor movements. 

24-hour events include a failed trial of extubation yesterday and a fall from the bed overnight, requiring adjustment of orthopedic hardware. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/70 to 141/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is alert and more interactive, with no jugular venous distention or murmurs. Chest X-ray shows bilateral clear to mildly increased markings. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels, while other lab"

   agitation/delirium.
    # Respiratory Failure / Trach:  s/p bronchoscopy [**10-16**]. Sputum cultures
   still with 3+ GNR, likely he is colonized with pseudomonas and is s/p
   14 day treatment for pseudomonal bacteremia/pneuonia.  Additionally, +
   glucan, and PCP and fungal cultures still pending from bronch.
   Mycolytic BCx negative to date.
   - for now, hold on abx and antifungals until culture evidence of
   infection
   - cont steroids 10 mg po daily
   - continue bactrim ppx
   - continue PS
   - PEG tomorrow
   # Ileus: Resolved, now stooling
   - advance tube feeds slowly
   - switch meds to PO from IV
   # Seizure: Clinical seizure observed by neurology. Given absence of
   prior seizure activity, we had tapered the keppra off earlier in the
   week.
   - EEG still without epileptiform activity.
   - continue Keppra dosing per Neuro
   - appreciate Neurology input
   # Nutrition:
   -NPO at midnight
   - resuming tube feeds, follow residuals
   - needs PEG, likely on Tuesday but need to follow up with IP Last
   albumin 3.1
   # C. difficile : Fever curve improved, leukocytosis decreasing.
   - PO Vanc for Cdiff for now (earliest end date [**10-27**])
   # Agitation/Delirium: Overall improved! Able to communicate/mouth words
   appropriately
   - continue fentanyl patch at decreased dose at 50 mcg q 72 hours([**10-19**])
   - continue decreased oxycodone 10mg q4hours prn
   - hold haldol due to prolonged QTc
   - continue clonidine 0.2 mg PO TID
   - continue Keppra per Neuro
   #  Wrist fracture: s/p ex-fix and ORIF of R elbow and wrist [**10-7**]
   - appreciate ortho recs and OT recs
   - ROM for R fingers/elbow, wrist to remain in splint
   - pain control with Fentanyl patch and oxycodone liquid prn as above
   - continue calcium and vitamin D
   - will need to be on bisphosphonate at discharge
   - bacitracin for pin hygiene
   # S/P PEA Arrest:  Concern for anxoic brain injury although MRI [**10-2**]
   showed pons pathology that neuro says could be possibly reversible.
   - follow mental status with decreasing sedation and narcotics
   # Anemia of iron def: s/p 1 unit transfusion [**10-12**]
   - monitor hct
   - continue iron tablets
   - active T&S
   - guaiac all stools
   - Minimize blood draws
   - transfuse for Hct < 21 or active bleeding

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress following a PEA arrest. The patient has undergone cooling therapy, seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, agitation/delirium, and has been treated with various medications and interventions.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Respiratory failure/tracheostomy: The patient had bronchoscopy and sputum cultures still pending. He is colonized with pseudomonas and has completed a 14-day treatment for pseudomonal bacteremia/pneumonia. Antibiotic and antifungal treatments have been held until evidence of infection is present.
- Ileus: Resolved, now stooling. The patient will advance tube feeds slowly and switch medications from IV to PO.
- Seizure: Clinical seizure observed by neurology. The patient was tapered off Kendra due to absence of prior seizure activity. EEG still without epileptiform activity. Continue Keppra dosing per Neuro.
- Nutrition: NPO at midnight, resume tube feeds, follow residuals, and consider percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tomorrow.
- C. difficile: Fever curve improved, leukocytosis decreasing. Continue PO Vanc for Cdiff until [**10-27**].
- Agitation/Delirium: Overall improved! Able to communicate/mouth words appropriately. Continue fentanyl patch at decreased dose at 50 mcg q 72 hours (["

","The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress after experiencing a PEA arrest on [**2126-9-20**]. He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol and had seizures, pseudomonal pneumonia, and agitation/delirium. The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, tracheobronchomalacia, C. difficile infection, impaired motor function, altered mental status, anoxic brain damage, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, seizure disorder, and a wrist fracture.

Assessment and plan:
1. Respiratory Failure / Trachea: The patient has been treated for pseudomonal bacteremia/pneumonia and is currently colonized with pseudomonas. Glucan and fungal cultures from bronchial samples are growing yeast, but mycolytic BCx is negative. Hold on antibiotics and antifungals until there is evidence of infection. Continue steroids, bactrim prophylaxis, and PS.
2. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count is due to stress reaction from the fall and steroids. There is no evidence of acute infection.
3. Ileus: The ileus has resolved, and the patient is now stooling. Advance tube feeds slowly after PEG placement and switch medications to oral from intravenous.
4. Seizure: The patient had a clinical seizure observed by neurology. The EEG showed no epilept"

   His mental status has overall improved, but he continues to wax and
   wane over the past week. He has had a reassuring EEG and MRI this
   hospitalization. The most likely explanation for his persistent altered
   mental status appears to be medication effects in the setting of acute
   illness. We have decreased the dose of opiates that he had been on,
   specifically his Fentanyl patch has been decreased from 112 to 100 to
   75mcg ([**10-15**].) Continue oxycodone 10mg q6h PRN with a preference to use
   Tylenol first. He is now on Keppra 500mg [**Hospital1 **] although there is no EEG
   evidence of seizing, Neuro is concerned that clinically he is having
   seizing episodes. His perceived anxiety, tachycardia and increased
   movements may have been [**2-11**] respiratory distress as it appears that the
   majority of these episodes were in the setting of hypoxia. The etiology
   of his respiratory distress may be secondary to an aspiration
   pneumonitis in the setting of his emesis on [**10-15**] and again on [**10-17**]. He
   is s/p CTA (no clot, increased bibasilar opacities) and bronch (studies
   pending) on [**10-16**]. Will continue to attempt to decrease the quantity of
   narcotics he is receiving;
 H/O CARDIAC ARREST
   He has been on PS for the several days this week, but went back on A/C
   on the evening of [**10-15**] after receiving Ativan and oxycodone. He did
   tolerate PS 0/0 for several minutes on [**10-14**] with good tidal volumes and
   respiratory rate. As his clinical status allows, we will pursue trach
   mask trials. Currently on Prednisone 15mg q24h (down from alternating
   20mg / 15mg.) Will change to Solumedrol 12mg IV q24h while he is NPO.
   Will attempt PSV when he is off of Propofol this morning.
 PNEUMONIA, [**Hospital 57**] HOSPITAL ACQUIRED (NON-VAP)
   Completed a course of antibiotics for Pseudomonas. He continues to have
   positive sputum cultures which likely represent colonization. Would not
   treat for sputum culture data alone; rather, would treat only in the

","Based on the provided medical progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia and is currently being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and gentamicin. There is a concern for persistent pneumonia, as indicated by the fever and leukocytosis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. The recent increase in PEEP to 10 cmH2O is aimed at recruiting collapsed right lower lobe on the chest X-ray.

3. C. difficile infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, and the fever curve has improved. The patient is being treated with oral vancomycin for now.

4. Seizures: The patient experienced a clinical seizure observed by neurology. The EEG still shows no epileptiform activity. The patient is being continued on Keppra dosing per Neurology.

5. Agitation/Delirium: The patient has shown improvement in agitation/delirium and is able to communicate appropriately. The patient's fentanyl patch dose has been decreased, and other medications such as haldol and oxycodone have been adjusted accordingly.

6. Wrist fracture: The patient has a wrist fracture and underwent ORIF on [**10-7**]. The patient is advised to have ROM for right fingers/elbow, wrist to remain in spl"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory distress after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on [**2126-9-20**]. He underwent the Arctic Sun cooling protocol.
- The patient's course has been complicated by seizures, pseudomonas pneumonia, agitation/delirium, and possible aspiration prior to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.
- He had a fever spike yesterday and was found to have decreased breath sounds at the bases. Sputum cultures grew 4+ GNRs, and he was treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and gentamicin for a total of 8-day course.
- He also had positive glucan and fungal cultures growing yeast, but mycobytic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was negative. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) cultures from bronch are pending.
- The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest persistent pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration during vomiting episodes.
- His fungal rash is improving, and it is unlikely to be the source of infection.
- Other issues include impaired skin integrity, impaired motor function, impaired arousal, attention, and cognition, impaired transfers, chronic respiratory failure, altered mental status, anoxic brain damage, history of cardiac arrest, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, seizure without status epilepticus"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure following a post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PEA arrest) on [**2126-9-20**]. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by several medical conditions, including anoxic brain injury, seizure disorder, pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile colitis, and a fall.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, tracheostomy tube in place, and supplemental oxygen. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/67 to 151/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The imaging shows stable bilateral pleural effusions and right basilar atelectasis.

The patient's assessment and plan include several ongoing issues:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is unable to be weaned off mechanical ventilation due to copious secretions and VAP. He will continue to receive vancomycin, cefepime, and gentamicin for a total of 8 days, and his gentamicin trough levels will be monitored."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for respiratory failure following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest on [**2126-9-20**]. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by anoxic brain injury, seizure disorder, pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, and a fall.

Current Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still unable to be weaned off mechanical ventilation due to copious secretions and VAP. Antibiotics will be continued for a total of 8 days, and steroids will be tapered.
2. VAP: Although the patient's fever has subsided, the white blood cell count is increasing, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Gram-negative rods (GNR) have been identified in sputum gram stain and preliminary culture. Antibiotic therapy will be continued, and follow-up sputum cultures are planned.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): Multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli has been identified, which should be covered by the current antibiotic regimen.
4. Ileus: The patient has developed ileus post-percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. Tube feeds will be continued.
5. Anoxic Brain Injury with Seizure Disorder: Clinical seizures have been observed, and the"

","The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure after experiencing a PEA arrest and treated with a cooling protocol. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by anoxic brain injury, seizure disorder, pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile colitis, and a fall.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation via a tracheostomy and is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to respiratory failure. He has copious secretions, which are a barrier to weaning. The patient is being continued on vancomycin, cefepime, and gentamicin for a total of an 8-day course. The gentamicin trough level needs to be checked, and the patient is also on steroids for a slow taper.

The patient has a history of VAP with a rising white blood cell count, and Gram-negative rods were found on sputum gram stain and preliminary culture. The patient is being continued on cefepime and gentamicin, as the prior isolate was multidrug-resistant pseudomonas, and the gentamicin trough level is adequate at less than 1. Vancomycin is to be discontinued, and follow-up sputum cultures and sensitivities will be performed.

The patient also has an ileus secondary to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and is being continued on tube feeds. The patient has an anoxic brain injury complicated by"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure after experiencing a PEA arrest. He has had a complex ICU course, complicated by anoxic brain injury, seizure disorder, pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile colitis, and a fall. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy and is stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but has copious secretions, which are barriers to weaning. He has a multiresistant (MDR) gram-negative rod in his sputum and urine, and his white blood cell count is rising. The patient's wrist fracture has been treated with external fixation and open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and his right elbow and wrist are immobilized. He also has an anoxic brain injury, seizure disorder, and a history of diabetes mellitus type II. The patient is scheduled for transfer to a rehabilitation/long-term care facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and there are concerns about weaning him off mechanical ventilation due to copious secretions. The presence of VAP with an MDR gram-negative rod further complicates the situation.
2. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a seizure disorder that is a complication of the anoxic brain injury. It is important to continue seizure prophylaxis and closely monitor for any seizure activity.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure following a PEA arrest on 9/20/2126. The patient's ICU course has been complicated by anoxic brain injury, seizure disorder, pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff colitis), and a fall. The patient's current medical problems include respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, seizure disorder, tracheobronchomalacia, C. difficile infection, and a wrist fracture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilation, impaired: The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to respiratory failure, but has copious secretions which are a barrier to weaning. There is a concern for continued dependence on mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia, hospital-acquired: The patient has a preliminary sputum culture showing a Gram-negative rod, suggestive of a hospital-acquired pneumonia. Further incubation is required to determine the presence or absence of commensal respiratory flora.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) identified in the urine culture. This requires appropriate antibiotic coverage based on the sensitivities.
4. Anoxic brain injury: The patient has suffered an anoxic brain injury due to the cardiac arrest. There may be ongoing neurological impairment and"
