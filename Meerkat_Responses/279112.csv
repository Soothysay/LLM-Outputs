   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo M with PMH of CAD s/p CABG, atrial fibrillation, diastolic
   dysfunction, COPD here for evaluation of GI bleed who developed
   respiratory distress requiring intubation along with cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Likely had pulmonary edema in the setting of
   getting IVF during the procedure vs aspiration pneumonitis (although
   unwitnessed but CXR suggests this). But precipitant for episode is
   unclear- tachycardia causing flash pulm edema, preload dropping off
   sedation from procedure causing flash. DDX also includes aspiration
   pneumonitis (although no witnessed event), aspiration pneumonia, AMI
   (did not complain of CP prior to event as far as we know), PE (unlikely
   given CXR showing edema but he does have afib and is off coumadin for
   the procedure).
   -diuresis-- put out 1L from 40mg furosemide prior to code but still
   significantly volume overloaded.
   ----continue diuresis with boluses of furosemide as BP allows, consider
   furosemide gtt if needed.
   -ECHO to evaluate valves and heart function
   -monitor on tele
   -send cardiac enzymes- expect first set to be elevated given CPR, but
   interested in trend
   -EKG to look for signs of ischemia
   -continue to ween vent as tolerated with hope to extubate in AM.
   Currently on PS 8/5 and 40% FIO2. Blood gas nl. As he diureses, will
   lower PS and try to ween peep as well to SBT in AM
   .
   # bandemia: WBC low but near his baseline. He has 11% bands currently
   but likely stress reaction in setting of just having a code. No signs
   of infection currently, but will continue to monitor.
   -send diff in the AM
   -if hemodyamics change and he is unstable, will pan culture and cover
   with broad spectrum antibiotics
   .
   # CHF diastolic- currently acute on chronic: Last ECHO per OSH records
   showed EF 55% with significant valvular dysfunction.
   -diuresis as above
   -ECHO
   -on [**Last Name (un) 239**] at home- hold for now given borderline pressure; not on BB
   likely given h/o of sick sinus syndrome
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: monitoring for ischemia as above with EKG and CE.
   -holding asa currently given procedure. will restart in AM if stable
   -on [**Last Name (un) 239**] at home- hold for now.
   -not on BB likely given history of SSS
   -holding imdur for now- likely restart in AM
   -continue statin (on lovastatin 60mg at home- use atorvastatin here)
   .
   # atrial fibrillation: currently rate controlled not on meds for
   control at home. Wife says his HR is normally low in the 60s. Off
   coumadin given GI procedure
   -hold coumadin for now
   -not on rate control [**Doctor Last Name **] at home likely given h/o SSS
   .
   # HTN: on losartan, imdur at home. Currently normotensive.
   -hold meds for now and likely restart in the AM
   .
   # GI bleed: chronic. has h/o AVMs throughout GI tract. Had gastric
   polyps removed today along with AVM cauderizations.
   -monitor closely for bleeding
   -T&C 4units PRBCs given history of bleeding post-procedure in the past
   .
   # AAA: stable per OSH records at 5.3cm.
   .
   # Myelodysplastic syndrome: transfusion dependent. HCT stable
   currently. WBC currently stable.
   .
   # CRI: baseline Cr 1.6-1.8. Currently at baseline. Unknown cause but
   could be HTN, DM. Also has myelodysplastic syndrome--could have MGUS vs
   MM
   -renally dose meds
   -consider sending SPEP and UPEP if not worked up elsewhere
   .
   # DM2: patient without formal diagnosis of diabetes but medication list
   from his wife has glimepiride suggesting he has diabetes.
   -fingersticks and ISS for now.
   -hold oral agents while NPO
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now with hope to extubate tomorrow. Otherwise diabetic
   heart healthy diet
   .
   # PPX: pneumoboots for DVT ppx. holding heparin in setting of GIB, PPI

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was admitted for evaluation of a gastrointestinal bleed and developed respiratory distress requiring intubation and cardiac arrest. 

Upon reviewing the patient's progress note, several potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient had respiratory distress requiring intubation. The cause is unclear, but possible causes include pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonitis, or pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory function and oxygenation is essential.

2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and diastolic dysfunction. His most recent echocardiogram showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, low normal left ventricular systolic function, significantly depressed right ventricular free wall contractility, and mild aortic valve stenosis.

3. GI bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding due to arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) throughout the GI tract. He underwent gastric polyp removal and AVM cauterizations today. Close monitoring for bleeding and appropriate transfusion management are necessary.

4. Myelodysplastic syndrome: The patient is transfusion-dependent and has stable hematocrit and white blood cell counts. Renal function is also stable, but further evaluation may be needed to determine the cause of chronic kidney disease.

5. Diabetes"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was admitted for evaluation of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and developed respiratory distress requiring intubation and cardiac arrest. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress with evidence of flash pulmonary edema and possible aspiration event. The patient's temperature spiked overnight, leading to the initiation of vancomycin and cefepime for possible aspiration. The precipitant for the episode is unclear, with possibilities including tachycardia causing flash pulmonary edema or preload dropping off sedation from a procedure causing flash. Differential diagnosis also includes aspiration pneumonitis, aspiration pneumonia, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 

The patient's cardiac status reveals right ventricular (RV) dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) yesterday. The patient was weaned off the ventilator and extubated this morning. Diurese is being held due to improved respiratory function and an increase in creatinine (Cr) level. Cardiac consult is appreciated for recommendations. 

The patient also has a history of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) and is currently not on any rate control medications for atrial fibrillation. The patient underwent gastric polyps removal and AVM cauterizations today. 

Other medical issues include chronic GI bleeding, stable abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), myelodysplastic syndrome requiring transfusion dependency, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). 

Preventive measures include pneumoboots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, holding heparin in the setting of GI bleeding, and chlorhexidine for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 79 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 87/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.6 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 27 mg/dL, increased creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.9 mmol/L. The patient's blood cultures are pending. 

The patient's chest X-ray shows diffuse left-sided airspace opacity. The TTE reveals mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, low normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50-55%, significantly depressed RV free wall contractility, moderately dilated"

   respiratory distress requiring intubation along with cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Likely had pulmonary edema in the setting of
   getting IVF during the procedure vs aspiration pneumonitis (although
   unwitnessed but CXR suggests this). But precipitant for episode is
   unclear- tachycardia causing flash pulm edema, preload dropping off
   sedation from procedure causing flash. DDX also includes aspiration
   pneumonitis (although no witnessed event), aspiration pneumonia, AMI
   (did not complain of CP prior to event as far as we know), PE (unlikely
   given CXR showing edema but he does have afib and is off coumadin for
   the procedure).
   -diuresis-- put out 1L from 40mg furosemide prior to code but still
   significantly volume overloaded.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted for the evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding and developed respiratory distress requiring intubation and cardiac arrest. The patient has multiple medical complications including congestive heart failure (CHF), bandemia, chronic kidney disease (CRI), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and myelodysplastic syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient likely had pulmonary edema due to fluid overload during the procedure or aspiration pneumonitis. The cause of the respiratory distress is unclear, but possible precipitants include flash pulmonary edema or aspiration pneumonia. Other differential diagnoses include pulmonary embolism (PE) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

2. Bandemia: The patient has a low white blood cell count with an increased percentage of bands. This may indicate a stress reaction or infection. Monitoring is recommended, and a differential count will be sent in the morning.

3. CHF Diastolic: The patient has acute-on-chronic diastolic heart failure. Diuretics should be continued, and an echocardiogram will be performed to evaluate heart function.

4. CAD s/p CABG: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Monitoring for"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was admitted for the evaluation of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and developed respiratory distress, requiring intubation and cardiac arrest. The patient underwent one round of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and received epinephrine for an unclear rhythm. Upon arrival at the hospital, he experienced a short episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT) but did not require intervention.

The patient has been weaned off the ventilator and extubated, now satting well on room air. He has a history of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). His cardiac enzymes are negative for myocardial infarction (MI), but there is a concern for pulmonary embolism (PE) given his history of atrial fibrillation and being off coumadin for the procedure. A lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI) was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's kidney function has improved, and diuretics have been held due to a rise in creatinine. He has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), with baseline creatinine levels of 1.6-1.8. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is within normal limits. He is being held for possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to the cardiac arrest yesterday. His fluid analysis indicates a high osmolarity.

The patient has a history of chronic GI bleed, with a history of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) throughout the GI tract. He underwent gastric polyp removal and cauterization of AVMs. He will restart aspirin and coumadin as per GI recommendations.

The patient also has a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), stable at 5.3 cm. He has myelodysplastic syndrome, requiring transfusion-dependent support, and his hematocrit (HCT) and white blood cell count (WBC) are currently stable. He is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and will restart oral medications prior to discharge. He has a history of sick sinus syndrome (SSS).

The patient's plan includes restarting aspirin and isordil, holding diuretics, restarting coumadin, and continuing statin therapy. He will follow up with his outpatient cardiologist early next week for possible ischemic workup. The patient prefers to be discharged from the hospital today and will leave for [State] immediately upon discharge."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was admitted for evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding and developed respiratory distress requiring intubation and cardiac arrest. The patient underwent one round of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and received epinephrine for an unclear rhythm. He also had a short episode of ventricular tachycardia (VT) but did not require intervention. The patient was extubated this morning.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 115/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's physical examination revealed crackles in the left lower lobe of the lungs, a systolic murmur, and absent pulses in both lower extremities. His neurologic examination was not assessed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13,100 cells/mm³, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 112 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 2.5 mg/dL, lactate level of 1.9 mmol/L, potassium (K+) of 5.3 mEq/L, and magnesium (Mg++) of 2.3 mg/dL. The patient's troponin T level was negative, and imaging showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's diagnosis includes flash pulmonary edema, possible aspiration event, cardiac arrest, diastolic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), acute kidney injury (AKI) likely secondary to hypoperfusion during cardiac arrest, history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation, and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding with a history of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) throughout the gastrointestinal tract.

The plan includes weaning off ventilatory support, restarting aspirin and isordil, obtaining lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI) to rule out DVT, holding diuretics due to improved respiratory function and a rise in creatinine, transitioning from vancomycin and cefepime to vancomycin and levofloxacin, considering sending serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) if urine lytes are unrevealing, monitoring for ischemia with EKG and cardiac enzymes, restarting ASA, monitoring for bleeding due to chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, and considering sending serum and urine electrolytes."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented to the ICU with respiratory arrest. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent a CABG surgery. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulation therapy. The patient's breathing has improved, and most of the pulmonary edema has resolved. However, the cause of the pulmonary edema is still unknown. The patient's kidney function has improved, but there is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to recent use of contrast. The patient's hemoglobin levels are stable, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is no longer a concern. The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, but they are expected to improve with time. The patient expresses a desire to be discharged and return to Florida, where he will see his cardiologist immediately upon return.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of recent contrast use raise concerns for ATN. It is important to monitor the patient's kidney function closely and provide appropriate supportive care.
2. Pulmonary Edema: Although the patient's breathing has improved, the underlying cause of the pulmonary edema remains unclear. Further investigation may be necessary to prevent future episodes.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): Although GIB is currently not a concern, it is essential to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and maintain"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory arrest and is now showing improvement. The patient has a history of pulmonary edema, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), recent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and atrial fibrillation. He is currently breathing comfortably and most of the edema has resolved. The cause of the pulmonary edema is still unclear, but it may have been due to transient left ventricular noncompliance. His hemoglobin (Hct) levels are stable, and he is ready to have Coumadin restarted. The patient wishes to be discharged and return to Florida, but will see his cardiologist immediately upon return.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient had an episode of pulmonary edema, which can be caused by various factors such as heart failure, fluid overload, or allergic reactions. It is important to monitor for any signs of recurrence and manage it promptly to prevent respiratory distress.
2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient has ATN, which can lead to kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further complications like electrolyte imbalances or acute kidney injury.
3. Recent CABG Surgery: As the patient recently underwent CABG surgery, there is a risk of post-operative complications such as infection, bleeding, or sternal wound dehiscence."
