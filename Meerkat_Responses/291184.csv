","Summary:
The patient is in the ICU with a neck hematoma. They have been stable overnight with improved neck exam. The arterial line was started on 04/17/2195 at 03:09 PM and called out. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and sulfonamides. They received clindamycin until 04/18/2195 at 04:00 AM. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105-150 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on atrial fibrillation and has a history of chronic renal failure, recent neck dissection, and is currently on PCA for pain management. The plan is to transfer the patient to the floor with continued monitoring by the surgical team, discontinuing the arterial line, holding Coumadin, and starting boots. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, with normal glucose levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits except for a mild elevation in potassium. The patient's kidney function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has an arterial line in place, which can increase the risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-dialysis, atrial fibrillation (Afib), and hypertension (HTN). He presents for post-operative monitoring after hematoma evacuation. The patient has undergone radical neck dissection for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma and is planned for chemoradiation therapy. He also has a history of renal transplant and is on immunosuppressive medication. Additionally, he has a radial fracture, gout, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and moderate aortic stenosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has no signs of infection at present, but due to his immunocompromised state and recent surgery, he is at risk of developing post-operative infections.
2. Bleeding: As the patient had a hematoma that required evacuation, there is a risk of bleeding, especially considering his history of ESRD and anticoagulant use.
3. Renal function: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, as he has a history of ESRD and is on immunosuppressive medication which can affect kidney function.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient has atrial fibrillation and moderate aortic stenosis. His cardiac status needs to be closely monitored, especially during peri-operative periods.
5. Gout: The patient is on allopurinol for g"
