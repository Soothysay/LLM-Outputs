","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. However, the 24-hour events indicate that the patient received IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin, with stable cardiac enzyme levels (trop 1.00 <-- 1.03 -->  1.04), improved creatinine levels (Cr improved 1.4 --> 1.3 --> 1.2), and transfusion of 1 unit of PRBCs due to anemia, NSTEMI, and hypotension. The patient also received 1L NS bolus twice for low urine output and low CVP.

The patient has allergies to metronidazole and vancomycin, both given recently. The patient is currently on several infusions including norepinephrine, fentanyl, and midazolam (Versed). Other ICU medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, along with pantoprazole, Flagyl, fentanyl/versed, Lipitor, Celexa, aspirin, levophed rip, and others.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is an 87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, dementia,
   h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea, intubated and
   on Levophed.
   .
   1.  Hypotension.  Patient with profound and persistent hypotension in
   setting of diarrhea and poor PO intake.  Hypotension likely secondary
   to severe dehdyration.  Stool cultures from today at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**]
   already positive for C. diff.  Given ?8 L of IVF yesterday, 1 unit
   PRBCs, and Levophed is being weaned down.  Also with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock.
   - IVF boluses for hypotension, low UOP, low CVP
   - monitor UOP
   - wean levophed if possible
   - maintain MAPS > 60
   - f/u cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool).
   - continue vanco/flagyl for severe C. diff
   - hold antihypertensives
   .
   2.  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting
   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so will treat
   with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Abdominal exam currently benign, but
   patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis.
   - continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - f/u final read of abd/pelvis CT from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**]
   - surgery consult
   - TID lytes and replete prn
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  Patient found to have leukocytosis with 40% bands on
   admission. Likely secondary to C. diff, but will evaluate for other
   etiologies with blood and urine cultures.
   - contive flagyl/vanco
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - follow wbc, fever curve
   .
   4.  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Currently on minimal vent support with FIO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5.
   - wean FIO2 if possible
   - continue mechanical venitllation
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   - will need diuresis in future when hemodynamically stable for
   pulmonary edema
   .
   5.  [**Location (un) **].  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF.
   - echo to evaluate cardiac function
   - continue home aspirin, statin
   - no BB due to hypotension
   - daily EKGs
   .
   6.  Type II diabetes.  On metformin at home.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - ISS
   - follow finger sticks
   .
   7.  PUD.  Patient has history of PUD.  Found to have H. pylori.
   Recently started on clarithryomycin and amoxicillin.
   - hold clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   .
   8.  Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF,
   likely prerenal versus ATN in setting of hypotension and dehydration.
   - continue IVF boluses for low UOP
   - urine lytes
   - follow UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   9.  Hyponatremia.  Patient has hypovolemic hyponatrmia.  Hyponatremia
   improving with IVFs.
   - urine osms
   - IVF boluses for hydration
   .
   7.  Depression.
   - celexa

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with type II DM, asthma, and dementia admitted to the ICU for severe C. diff diarrhea. She has been intubated and is on Levophed due to profound hypotension and dehydration. The patient has leukocytosis with 40% bands, evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis, and elevated troponins. She also has respiratory failure with pulmonary edema, hyponatremia, renal failure (ARF), and a history of PUD with H. pylori infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's profound hypotension is likely secondary to severe dehydration. She has received IV fluids, PRBCs, and Levophed is being weaned down. Monitoring UOP, weaning Levophed if possible, maintaining MAPS > 60, and following up with cultures are part of the management plan.

2. C. diff: The patient has severe C. diff, which may lead to complications such as abdominal pain, fever, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of mortality. Treatment with IV flagyl and PO vanco will be continued, along with monitoring fever curve and WBC.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pulmonary edema. Weaning FIO2 if possible, continuing mechanical ventilation, and planning for diuresis when hemodynamically stable are part of the"

   setting of diarrhea and poor PO intake.  Hypotension likely secondary
   to severe dehdyration.  Stool cultures from today at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**]
   already positive for C. diff.  Given ?8 L of IVF yesterday, 1 unit
   PRBCs, and Levophed is being weaned down.  Also with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] may
   have a component of cardiogenic shock.  Start vanco/zosyn for GPCs in
   sputum and infiltrate on CXR suggestive of HAP.
   - IVF boluses for hypotension, low UOP, low CVP
   - monitor UOP

   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so will treat
   with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Abdominal exam currently benign, but
   patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis.
   - continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - f/u final read of abd/pelvis CT from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**]
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops abdominal symptoms
   - TID lytes and replete prn
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  Patient found to have leukocytosis with 40% bands on
   admission. Likely secondary to C. diff, but will evaluate for other
   etiologies with blood and urine cultures.  Now with infiltrate on CXR
   and GPCs in sputum.
   - contive flagyl/vanco
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - follow wbc, fever curve
   .
   4.  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Currently on minimal vent support with FIO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5.
   Now with GPCs in sputum and infiltrate on CXR>
   - wean FIO2 if possible
   - continue mechanical venitllation
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   - will need diuresis in future when hemodynamically stable for
   pulmonary edema
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   .
   5.  [**Location (un) **].  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF.
   - echo to evaluate cardiac function in future when sepsis is resolved
   - continue home aspirin, statin
   - no BB due to hypotension
   - daily EKGs
   .
   6.  Type II diabetes.  On metformin at home.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - ISS
   - follow finger sticks
   .
   7.  PUD.  Patient has history of PUD.  Found to have H. pylori.
   Recently started on clarithryomycin and amoxicillin.
   - hold clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   .
   8.  Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF,
   likely prerenal versus ATN in setting of hypotension and dehydration.
   - continue IVF boluses for low UOP
   - urine lytes
   - follow UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   9.  Hyponatremia.  Patient has hypovolemic hyponatrmia.  Hyponatremia
   improving with IVFs.
   - urine osms
   - IVF boluses for hydration

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, dementia, h/o gastric
   ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea, intubated and on Levophed
   and also with concern for VAP/HCAP
   >  Hypotension/ C. dif colitis: .  Patient with profound and persistent
   hypotension in setting of diarrhea [**2-26**] colitis, and VAP.  Stool
   cultures from today at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] already positive for C. dif with
   addiitonal component of NSTEMI (may have a component of cardiogenic
   shock).  Start vanco/zosyn for GPCs in sputum and infiltrate on CXR
   suggestive of HAP.
   - IVF boluses for hypotension, low UOP
   - monitor UOP
   - wean levophed if possible
   - maintain MAPS > 60
   - f/u cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool).
   - continue vanco/flagyl for severe C. diff
   - hold antihypertensives
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP pneumonia
   >  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting with
   diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so will treat
   with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Abdominal exam currently benign, but
   patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis. If lactate
   increases will consider re-imaging and [**Doctor First Name 91**] consult.
   - continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops abdominal symptoms, cont
   to follow bladder pressures.
   - TID lytes and replete prn
   >  Leukocytosis.  Patient found to have leukocytosis with 40% bands on
   admission. Likely secondary to C. diff, but will evaluate for other
   etiologies with blood and urine cultures.  Now with infiltrate on CXR
   and GPCs in sputum will treat for VAP as well.
   - contive flagyl/vanco
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - follow wbc, fever curve
   >  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Now with GPCs in sputum and infiltrate on CXR would cont Vanco
   and Pip-Tazo for HCAP Pna
   - Cont abx
   - wean FIO2 if possible
   - continue mechanical venitllation
   - Minimize sedation and change to PS
   - will need diuresis in future when hemodynamically stable for
   pulmonary edema
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   >NSTEMI.  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF now with improving troponins
   - echo to evaluate cardiac function in future when sepsis is resolved
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - no BB due to hypotension
   - daily EKGs
   >Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF, likely
   prerenal versus ATN in setting of hypotension and dehydration and
   falling HCO3 with a UAG of 0 which suggests diarrhea as the source
   would favor HCO3 repletion for now
   - continue IVF with LR
   - renally dose all meds
   >  Hyponatremia.  Patient has hypovolemic hyponatrmia.  Hyponatremia
   improving with IVFs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, and dementia. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea and subsequently intubated. The patient is currently being treated for several medical complications, including hypotension/C. diff colitis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), C. diff infection, leukocytosis, respiratory failure, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), renal failure, and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/C. diff colitis: The patient has profound and persistent hypotension in the setting of diarrhea and C. diff colitis. There is a concern for cardiogenic shock due to the presence of NSTEMI.
2. VAP/HCAP: The patient has an infiltrate on chest X-ray suggestive of HAP, and GPCs in sputum. Therefore, she is being treated for both VAP and HCAP.
3. C. diff infection: The patient has severe C. diff after presenting with diarrhea and hypotension. She will be treated with both IV flagyl and PO vancomycin.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with 40% bands on admission. It is likely secondary to C. diff but will evaluate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, dementia, and a previous gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea and subsequently intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient has been on norepinephrine (Levophed) for hypotension, fentanyl, and midazolam (Versed) for sedation. 

Key Findings and Assessment:
1. Hypotension/C. diff colitis: The patient has profound and persistent hypotension, which is likely due to severe C. diff colitis. Stool cultures have tested positive for C. diff.
2. NSTEMI: The patient presents with signs of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI), including T-wave inversions and lateral ST depressions. Elevated troponin levels are also present.
3. HAP (Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia): The patient has developed pneumonia, as indicated by infiltrates on chest X-ray and Gram-positive cocci in sputum.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with 40% bands, likely secondary to C. diff infection. Blood and urine cultures have been obtained to evaluate for other etiologies.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced respiratory failure, necessitating mechanical ventilation. She is currently on minimal vent support"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, dementia, h/o gastric
   ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea, intubated and on Levophed
   and also with concern for VAP/HCAP
   >  Hypotension/ C. dif colitis: .  Patient with profound and persistent
   hypotension in setting of diarrhea [**2-26**] colitis, and VAP.  Stool
   cultures from today at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] already positive for C. dif with
   addiitonal component of NSTEMI (may have a component of cardiogenic
   shock).  Start vanco/zosyn for GPCs in sputum and infiltrate on CXR
   suggestive of HAP.
   - IVF boluses for hypotension, low UOP
   - monitor UOP
   - wean levophed if possible
   - maintain MAPS > 60
   - f/u cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool).
   - continue vanco/flagyl for severe C. diff
   - hold antihypertensives
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP pneumonia
   >  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting with
   diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so will treat
   with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Abdominal exam currently benign, but
   patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis. If lactate
   increases will consider re-imaging and [**Doctor First Name 91**] consult.
   - continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops abdominal symptoms, cont
   to follow bladder pressures.
   - TID lytes and replete prn
   >  Leukocytosis.  Patient found to have leukocytosis with 40% bands on
   admission. Likely secondary to C. diff, but will evaluate for other
   etiologies with blood and urine cultures.  Now with infiltrate on CXR
   and GPCs in sputum will treat for VAP as well.
   - contive flagyl/vanco
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - follow wbc, fever curve
   >  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Now with GPCs in sputum and infiltrate on CXR would cont Vanco
   and Pip-Tazo for HCAP Pna
   - Cont abx
   - wean FIO2 if possible
   - continue mechanical venitllation
   - Minimize sedation and change to PS
   - will need diuresis in future when hemodynamically stable for
   pulmonary edema
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   >NSTEMI.  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF now with improving troponins
   - echo to evaluate cardiac function in future when sepsis is resolved
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - no BB due to hypotension
   - daily EKGs
   >Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF, likely
   prerenal versus ATN in setting of hypotension and dehydration and
   falling HCO3 with a UAG of 0 which suggests diarrhea as the source
   would favor HCO3 repletion for now
   - continue IVF with LR
   - renally dose all meds
   >  Hyponatremia.  Patient has hypovolemic hyponatrmia.  Hyponatremia
   improving with IVFs.

   1.  Hypotension.  Patient with profound and persistent hypotension in
   setting of diarrhea and poor PO intake.  Hypotension likely secondary
   to severe dehdyration.  Stool cultures from today at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] was
   C. diff positive, though negative here.  Also with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] may have
   a component of cardiogenic shock.  Start vanco/zosyn for GPCs in sputum
   and infiltrate on CXR suggestive of HAP.
   - IVF boluses for hypotension, low UOP, low CVP
   - monitor UOP
   - wean levophed if possible
   - maintain MAPS > 60
   - f/u cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool).
   - continue vanco/flagyl for severe C. diff
   - hold antihypertensives
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP pneumonia

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient's current condition, and the various medical complications that can arise, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

Summary:
- The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, asthma, dementia, and gastric ulcer.
- She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea and is currently intubated on levophed due to hypotension.
- The patient has multiple comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, respiratory failure, renal failure, and hyponatremia.
- She is also experiencing leukocytosis, pneumonia, and possible cardiogenic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has profound and persistent hypotension, likely secondary to severe dehydration. It is important to monitor urine output and continue IV fluid boluses to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.
2. C. diff infection: The patient has severe C. diff, which may require treatment with both IV flagyl and PO vancomycin. Close monitoring of fever curve and white blood cell count is necessary. Surgical consultation may be needed if the patient develops abdominal symptoms.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with 40% bands on admission. This could be secondary to C. diff, but other etiologies should be evaluated with blood and urine cultures. Start vancom"

   .
   2.  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting
   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so will treat
   with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Abdominal exam currently benign, but
   patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis.
   - continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - f/u final read of abd/pelvis CT from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**]
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops abdominal symptoms
   - TID lytes and replete prn
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  Patient found to have leukocytosis with 40% bands on
   admission. Likely secondary to C. diff, but will evaluate for other
   etiologies with blood and urine cultures.  Now with infiltrate on CXR
   and GPCs in sputum.
   - contive flagyl/vanco
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - follow wbc, fever curve
   .
   4.  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Currently on minimal vent support with FIO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5.
   Now with GPCs in sputum and infiltrate on CXR>
   - wean FIO2 if possible
   - continue mechanical venitllation
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   - will need diuresis in future when hemodynamically stable for
   pulmonary edema
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   .
   5.  [**Location (un) **].  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF.
   - echo to evaluate cardiac function in future when sepsis is resolved
   - continue home aspirin, statin
   - no BB due to hypotension
   - daily EKGs
   .
   6.  Type II diabetes.  On metformin at home.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - ISS
   - follow finger sticks
   .
   7.  PUD.  Patient has history of PUD.  Found to have H. pylori.
   Recently started on clarithryomycin and amoxicillin.
   - hold clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   .
   8.  Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF,
   likely prerenal versus ATN in setting of hypotension and dehydration.
   - continue IVF boluses for low UOP
   - urine lytes
   - follow UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   9.  Hyponatremia.  Patient has hypovolemic hyponatrmia.  Hyponatremia
   improving with IVFs.
   - urine osms

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with type II diabetes, asthma, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea and is currently intubated and on norepinephrine (Levophed). The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, C. diff infection, leukocytosis, respiratory failure, potential cardiac issues, type II diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, renal failure, hyponatremia, and depression. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing profound and persistent hypotension, likely secondary to severe dehydration. She has received IV fluids and a blood transfusion, and Levophed is being weaned down.
2. C. diff infection: The patient has severe C. diff infection, which is confirmed by positive stool cultures. She is being treated with both IV flagyl and PO vancomycin.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with 40% bands on admission, likely secondary to C. diff, but other etiologies are also being evaluated with blood and urine cultures.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient became tachypneic and hypoxic during aggressive fluid hydration, with a CXR consistent with pulmonary edema. She is on minimal vent support with FIO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5.
5. Cardiac issues: The patient has TWI and lateral ST depressions in the setting of hypotension, with elevated troponins. A previous echo showed normal ejection fraction.
6. Type II diabetes: The patient is on metformin at home, but it is being held due to her current condition.
7. Peptic ulcer disease: The patient has a history of PUD and was recently started on clarithromycin and amoxicillin for H. pylori gastritis. These medications are being held, and she is receiving IV PPI.
8. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely prerenal or due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension and dehydration.
9. Hyponatremia: The patient has hypovolemic hyponatremia, which is improving with IV fluids.
10. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is being treated with celexa.

Overall, the patient's medical condition is complex, with multiple organ systems affected, including gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and endocrine systems. She requires close monitoring and management of these various complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is an 87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, dementia,
   h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea, intubated and
   on Levophed.
   .
   1.  Hypotension.  Patient with profound and persistent hypotension in
   setting of diarrhea and poor PO intake.  Hypotension likely secondary
   to severe dehdyration.  Stool cultures from today at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] was
   C. diff positive, though negative here.  Also with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] may have
   a component of cardiogenic shock.  Start vanco/zosyn for GPCs in sputum
   and infiltrate on CXR suggestive of HAP.
   - IVF boluses for hypotension, low UOP, low CVP
   - monitor UOP
   - wean levophed if possible
   - maintain MAPS > 60
   - f/u cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool).
   - continue vanco/flagyl for severe C. diff
   - hold antihypertensives
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP pneumonia
   .
   2.  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting
   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so will treat
   with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Abdominal exam currently benign, but
   patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis.
   - continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - f/u final read of abd/pelvis CT from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**]
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops worsening abdominal exam
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes and replete prn
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  Patient found to have leukocytosis with 40% bands on
   admission. Likely secondary to C. diff, but will evaluate for other
   etiologies with blood and urine cultures.  Now with infiltrate on CXR
   and GPCs in sputum.
   - contive flagyl/vanco
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - follow wbc, fever curve
   .
   4.  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Currently on minimal vent support with FIO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5.
   Now with GPCs in sputum and infiltrate on CXR.
   - wean FIO2 if possible
   - continue mechanical venitllation
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   - wean sedation and give PS trial if possible (failed SBT in AM due to
   apnea)
   - will need diuresis in future when hemodynamically stable for
   pulmonary edema
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   .
   5.  [**Hospital1 **].  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF.
   - echo to evaluate cardiac function in future
   - continue home aspirin, statin
   - no BB due to hypotension
   - daily EKGs
   .
   6.  Type II diabetes.  On metformin at home.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - ISS
   - follow finger sticks
   .
   7.  PUD.  Patient has history of PUD.  Found to have H. pylori.
   Recently started on clarithryomycin and amoxicillin as outpatient.
   - hold clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   .
   8.  Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF.
   Urine lytes consistent with pre-renal ARF.  Has ongoing diarrhea due to
   c. diff and third spacing.
   - continue IVF boluses for low UOP
   - urine lytes
   - follow UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   9.  Depression.
   - celexa

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, asthma, dementia, and gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea and is currently intubated and on Levophed. The patient has profound and persistent hypotension, likely secondary to severe dehydration. Stool cultures are positive for C. diff. The patient also has leukocytosis with 40% bands, likely secondary to C. diff, but will evaluate for other etiologies with blood and urine cultures. She has an infiltrate on CXR and GPCs in sputum, suggestive of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, leading to respiratory failure, and she is currently on minimal vent support with FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5. There is evidence of pancolitis on CT abdomen/pelvis, and she has evidence of cardiac dysfunction, including ST depressions in TWI and lateral leads, elevated troponins, and a history of normal ejection fraction. The patient has a history of PUD and was recently started on clarithromycin and amoxicillin for H. pylori gastritis. She is also experiencing renal failure with ongoing diarrhea due to C. diff and third spacing. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ dysfunctions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension due to severe dehydration"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient has been started on IV flagyl and vancomycin, as well as IV zoysn for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient has been receiving liter boluses throughout the day and requires 0.36mcg levophed in the evening. The patient's heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are within normal limits. The patient's CVP, bladder pressure, and fluid balance are also within normal limits. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with controlled ventilation. The patient's ABG results indicate a slightly low pH, low PaCO2, normal HCO3-, normal PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and adequate ventilation. The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds and no signs of distress. The patient's neurological status is described as follows simple commands, responds to movement, tone, and skin assessment not assessed. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, normal hemoglobin, and slightly elevated creatinine and lactate levels. The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. The patient's code status is full code, and the ICU disposition is noted as well.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is an 87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, dementia,
   h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea, intubated and
   on Levophed.
   .
   1.  Hypotension.  Patient with profound and persistent hypotension in
   setting of diarrhea and poor PO intake.  Hypotension likely secondary
   to severe dehdyration.  Stool cultures from today at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] was
   C. diff positive, though negative here.  Also with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] may have
   a component of cardiogenic shock.  Start vanco/zosyn for GPCs in sputum
   and infiltrate on CXR suggestive of HAP.
   - IVF boluses for hypotension, low UOP, low CVP
   - monitor UOP
   - wean levophed if possible
   - maintain MAPS > 60
   - f/u cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool).
   - continue vanco/flagyl for severe C. diff
   - hold antihypertensives
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP pneumonia
   .
   2.  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting
   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so will treat
   with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Abdominal exam currently benign, but
   patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis.
   - continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - f/u final read of abd/pelvis CT from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**]
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops worsening abdominal exam
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes and replete prn
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  Patient found to have leukocytosis with 40% bands on
   admission. Likely secondary to C. diff, but will evaluate for other
   etiologies with blood and urine cultures.  Now with infiltrate on CXR
   and GPCs in sputum.
   - contive flagyl/vanco
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - follow wbc, fever curve
   .
   4.  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Currently on minimal vent support with FIO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5.
   Now with GPCs in sputum and infiltrate on CXR.
   - wean FIO2 if possible
   - continue mechanical venitllation
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   - wean sedation and give PS trial if possible (failed SBT in AM due to
   apnea)
   - will need diuresis in future when hemodynamically stable for
   pulmonary edema
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   .
   5.  [**Hospital1 **].  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF.
   - echo to evaluate cardiac function in future
   - continue home aspirin, statin
   - no BB due to hypotension
   - daily EKGs
   .
   6.  Type II diabetes.  On metformin at home.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - ISS
   - follow finger sticks
   .
   7.  PUD.  Patient has history of PUD.  Found to have H. pylori.
   Recently started on clarithryomycin and amoxicillin as outpatient.
   - hold clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   .
   8.  Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF.
   Urine lytes consistent with pre-renal ARF.  Has ongoing diarrhea due to
   c. diff and third spacing.
   - continue IVF boluses for low UOP
   - urine lytes
   - follow UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   9.  Depression.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, asthma, dementia, and gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea and is currently intubated and on norepinephrine (Levophed) for hypotension. The patient has been treated with intravenous (IV) flagyl and oral vancomycin for C. diff, as well as IV vancomycin and aztreonam for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). She requires liter boluses of IV fluids due to hypotension, low urine output, and low central venous pressure (CVP). The patient's blood cultures from [**Hospital1 5**] were positive for C. diff, although negative at our facility. Her abdominal exam is currently benign, but she has evidence of pancolitis on CT abdomen/pelvis. There is concern for worsening abdominal exam, and a surgery consult has been requested. The patient also has leukocytosis with 40% bands, likely secondary to C. diff, but other etiologies are being evaluated with blood and urine cultures. She developed respiratory failure after aggressive fluid hydration, leading to pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. She is currently on minimal vent support with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5. The patient has"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, dementia, h/o gastric
   ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea, intubated and on Levophed
   and also with concern for VAP/HCAP.
    >  Hypotension/ C. dif colitis: .  Patient with profound and
   persistent hypotension in setting of diarrhea [**2-26**] colitis, and VAP.
   Stool cultures from today at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] already positive for C. dif
   with addiitonal component of NSTEMI (may have a component of
   cardiogenic shock).  Start vanco/zosyn for GPCs in sputum and
   infiltrate on CXR suggestive of HAP.
   - IVF boluses for hypotension, low UOP
   - monitor UOP
   - f/u cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool).
   - continue vanco/flagyl for severe C. diff
   - hold antihypertensives
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP pneumonia
   >  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting with
   diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so will treat
   with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Abdominal exam currently benign, but
   patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis. If lactate
   increases will consider re-imaging and [**Doctor First Name 91**] consult.
   - continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops abdominal symptoms, cont
   to follow bladder pressures.
   - TID lytes and replete prn
   >  Leukocytosis.  Patient found to have leukocytosis with 40% bands on
   admission. Likely secondary to C. diff, but will evaluate for other
   etiologies with blood and urine cultures.  Now with infiltrate on CXR
   and GNRs in sputum will treat for VAP as well.  Also with aspergillus
   (rare in the sputum). For now we can stop IV vanco (no evidence of GPC
   in blood and although present oin stain did not grow out), would think
   aspergillus is likely to be contaminant as opposed to infectious.
   - contive flagyl/vanco for c. dif
   - cont /zosyn for HAP
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - follow wbc, fever curve
   >  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Now with GNR in the sputum which we are treating, the GPC are
   probable contaminants as are the aspergillus
   - Cont abx, stop Vanco
   - wean FIO2 if possible
   - trial PS as she wakes up
   - Minimize sedation and change to PS when more awake.
   - will need diuresis in future when hemodynamically stable for
   pulmonary edema
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   >NSTEMI.  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF now with improving troponins, repeat TTE with some
   worsening of TR and pulm htn, but no change in LV function.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - no BB due to hypotension
   >Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF, likely
   prerenal versus ATN in setting of hypotension and dehydration and
   falling HCO3 with a UAG of 0 which suggests diarrhea as the source
   would favor HCO3 repletion for now., although she may not have good
   absorption. Would favor trying to diurese her gently today if she can
   tolerate
   - cont PO HCO3
   - renally dose all meds
    >  Hyponatremia.  Patient has hypovolemic hyponatrmia.  Hyponatremia
   improving with IVFs.
   - urine osms
   - IVF boluses for hydration

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea and is currently intubated. The patient also has hypotension, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), leukocytosis, respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, and renal failure. She has been treated with various medications including piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, metronidazole, heparin, pantoprazole (Protonix), and regular insulin. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.8°C, heart rate 87 bpm, blood pressure 133/47 mmHg, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. The patient's condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/C. diff colitis: The patient has profound and persistent hypotension in the setting of diarrhea and VAP. Stool cultures have tested positive for C. diff, which can lead to severe colitis and potential complications.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has an infiltrate on chest X-ray suggestive of HAP, and GNRs in the sputum are being treated"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, dementia, h/o gastric
   ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea, intubated and on Levophed
   and also with concern for VAP/HCAP.
    >  Hypotension/ C. dif colitis: .  Patient with profound and
   persistent hypotension in setting of diarrhea [**2-26**] colitis, and VAP.
   Stool cultures from today at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] already positive for C. dif
   with addiitonal component of NSTEMI (may have a component of
   cardiogenic shock).  Start vanco/zosyn for GPCs in sputum and
   infiltrate on CXR suggestive of HAP.
   - IVF boluses for hypotension, low UOP
   - monitor UOP
   - f/u cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool).
   - continue vanco/flagyl for severe C. diff
   - hold antihypertensives
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP pneumonia
   >  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting with
   diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so will treat
   with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Abdominal exam currently benign, but
   patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis. If lactate
   increases will consider re-imaging and [**Doctor First Name 91**] consult.
   - continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops abdominal symptoms, cont
   to follow bladder pressures.
   - TID lytes and replete prn
   >  Leukocytosis.  Patient found to have leukocytosis with 40% bands on
   admission. Likely secondary to C. diff, but will evaluate for other
   etiologies with blood and urine cultures.  Now with infiltrate on CXR
   and GNRs in sputum will treat for VAP as well.  Also with aspergillus
   (rare in the sputum). For now we can stop IV vanco (no evidence of GPC
   in blood and although present oin stain did not grow out), would think
   aspergillus is likely to be contaminant as opposed to infectious.
   - contive flagyl/vanco for c. dif
   - cont /zosyn for HAP
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - follow wbc, fever curve
   >  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Now with GNR in the sputum which we are treating, the GPC are
   probable contaminants as are the aspergillus
   - Cont abx, stop Vanco
   - wean FIO2 if possible
   - trial PS as she wakes up
   - Minimize sedation and change to PS when more awake.
   - will need diuresis in future when hemodynamically stable for
   pulmonary edema
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   >NSTEMI.  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF now with improving troponins, repeat TTE with some
   worsening of TR and pulm htn, but no change in LV function.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - no BB due to hypotension
   >Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF, likely
   prerenal versus ATN in setting of hypotension and dehydration and
   falling HCO3 with a UAG of 0 which suggests diarrhea as the source
   would favor HCO3 repletion for now., although she may not have good
   absorption. Would favor trying to diurese her gently today if she can
   tolerate
   - cont PO HCO3
   - renally dose all meds
    >  Hyponatremia.  Patient has hypovolemic hyponatrmia.  Hyponatremia
   improving with IVFs.
   - urine osms
   - IVF boluses for hydration

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. The patient was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea and subsequently intubated. 

The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues:

1. Hypotension/C. diff colitis: The patient has profound and persistent hypotension in the setting of diarrhea and C. diff colitis. Stool cultures have been positive for C. diff. Treatment includes IV fluids for hypotension, low urine output monitoring, and follow-up cultures. Vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam have been started for gram-positive cocci in the sputum and infiltrate on chest X-ray suggestive of hospital-acquired pneumonia.

2. C. diff: The patient has severe C. diff, which is likely secondary to recent antibiotic use for urinary tract infection and H. pylori gastritis. Treatment includes both IV metronidazole and oral vancomycin. If lactate levels increase, surgery consultation may be considered.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient initially presented with leukocytosis with 40% bands on admission. This may be secondary to C. diff, but other etiologies are being evaluated with blood and urine cultures. The presence of an infiltrate on chest X-ray and gram-negative rods in"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is an 87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, dementia,
   h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea, intubated and
   on Levophed.
   .
   1.  Hypotension.  Patient with profound and persistent hypotension in
   setting of diarrhea and poor PO intake.  Hypotension likely secondary
   to severe dehdyration.  Stool cultures from today at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] was
   C. diff positive, though negative here.  Also with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] may have
   a component of cardiogenic shock.  Start vanco/zosyn for GPCs in sputum
   and infiltrate on CXR suggestive of HAP.
   - IVF boluses for hypotension, low UOP, low CVP
   - monitor UOP
   - wean levophed if possible
   - maintain MAPS > 60
   - f/u cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool).
   - continue vanco/flagyl for severe C. diff
   - hold antihypertensives
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP pneumonia
   .
   2.  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting
   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so will treat
   with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Abdominal exam currently benign, but
   patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis.
   - continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - f/u final read of abd/pelvis CT from [**Hospital1 5**]-[**Location (un) 3**]
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops worsening abdominal exam
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes and replete prn
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  Patient found to have leukocytosis with 40% bands on
   admission. Likely secondary to C. diff, but will evaluate for other
   etiologies with blood and urine cultures.  Now with infiltrate on CXR
   and GPCs in sputum.
   - contive flagyl/vanco
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - follow wbc, fever curve
   .
   4.  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Currently on minimal vent support with FIO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5.
   Now with GPCs in sputum and infiltrate on CXR.
   - wean FIO2 if possible
   - continue mechanical venitllation
   - fentanyl/versed for sedation
   - wean sedation and give PS trial if possible (failed SBT in AM due to
   apnea)
   - will need diuresis in future when hemodynamically stable for
   pulmonary edema
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   .
   5.  [**Hospital1 **].  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF.
   - echo to evaluate cardiac function in future
   - continue home aspirin, statin
   - no BB due to hypotension
   - daily EKGs
   .
   6.  Type II diabetes.  On metformin at home.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - ISS
   - follow finger sticks
   .
   7.  PUD.  Patient has history of PUD.  Found to have H. pylori.
   Recently started on clarithryomycin and amoxicillin as outpatient.
   - hold clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   .
   8.  Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF.
   Urine lytes consistent with pre-renal ARF.  Has ongoing diarrhea due to
   c. diff and third spacing.
   - continue IVF boluses for low UOP
   - urine lytes
   - follow UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   9.  Depression.
   - celexa
   FEN: tube feeds, MVI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with type II DM, asthma, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea and is currently intubated on Levophed. The patient's medical conditions include hypotension, C. diff infection, leukocytosis, respiratory failure, possible heart attack, type II diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, renal failure, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has profound and persistent hypotension, likely secondary to severe dehydration. Measures have been taken to address this, including IVF boluses, monitoring urine output, weaning Levophed if possible, maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60, and following up with cultures.
2. C. diff infection: The patient has severe C. diff after presenting with diarrhea and hypotension. Treatment with both IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin has been initiated. The patient will be monitored for fever curve, WBC count, and abdominal exam. Consideration for surgery consult will be made if the patient develops worsening abdominal exam.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with 40% bands on admission, likely secondary to C. diff. Other etiologies will be evaluated with blood and urine cultures. Now with infiltrate on chest X-ray (CXR) and Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) in sputum"

   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so will treat
   with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Abdominal exam currently benign, but
   patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis.
   - continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops worsening abdominal exam
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes and replete prn
   .
   3.  Metabolic acidosis.  Likely secondary to bicarb losses from
   diarrhea and RTA.
   - sodium bicarb PO
   - follow bicarb
   .
   4.  Hyponatremia.  Hypervolemica hyponatremia.
   - lasix drip for fluid removal
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  Patient found to have leukocytosis with 40% bands on
   admission. Likely secondary to C. diff and pneumonia.
   - contive flagyl/vanco
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - follow wbc, fever curve
   .
   4.  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema and pneumonia.  Currently on minimal vent support with FIO2 of
   40%, PEEP of 5.
   - continue mechanical venitllation
   - wean sedation give PS trial if possible (failed SBT in AM due to
   apnea)
   - initiate diuresis with lasix drip today
   - continue zosyn for HAP
   .
   5.  [**Hospital1 **].  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF, most recent echo with preserved EF.
   - continue home aspirin, statin
   - no BB due to hypotension
   - daily EKGs
   .
   6.  Type II diabetes.  On metformin at home.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - ISS
   - follow finger sticks
   .
   7.  PUD.  Patient has history of PUD.  Found to have H. pylori.
   Recently started on clarithryomycin and amoxicillin as outpatient.
   - hold clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   - transfuse to 25
   .
   8.  Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF,
   likely secondary to ATN given urine lytes.
   - lasix drip
   - follow UOP
   - renally dose all meds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of type II diabetes, asthma, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, likely secondary to severe dehydration. Stool cultures have tested positive for C. diff at another hospital, although negative at this facility. The patient also has evidence of pancolitis on CT abdomen/pelvis and is being treated with both IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin for severe C. diff.

Other medical complications include metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, leukocytosis, respiratory failure, and possible cardiogenic shock. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, and there are TWI and lateral ST depressions on EKGs, indicating potential myocardial injury or ischemia. The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and was recently started on clarithromycin and amoxicillin for H. pylori gastritis. However, these medications have been held due to the development of severe C. diff.

The patient also has renal failure, with a rise in creatinine from 0.8 to 1.4, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given the presence of urine lytes. Additionally, the patient has depression and is on citalopram (Celexa). The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU for continued management and support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's profound and persistent hypotension may be secondary to severe dehydration due to diarrhea and poor oral intake. It is essential to monitor urine output and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.
2. C. diff colitis: The patient has severe C. diff infection, which requires treatment with both IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin. Stool cultures have tested positive for C. diff at another hospital, indicating the need for further monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient likely has metabolic acidosis secondary to bicarbonate losses from diarrhea and renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Sodium bicarbonate therapy should be continued, and the patient's bicarbonate levels should be closely monitored.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hypervolemic hyponatremia, which may require careful management with lasix drip for fluid removal.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with 40% bands on admission, likely secondary to C. diff and pneumonia. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures should be followed up, and the patient should be treated appropriately based on the results.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, dementia, h/o gastric
   ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea, intubated and on Levophed
   and also with concern for VAP/HCAP.
    >  Hypotension/ C. dif colitis: .  Patient with profound and
   persistent hypotension in setting of diarrhea [**2-26**] colitis, and VAP.
   Stool cultures from today at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] already positive for C. dif
   with addiitonal component of NSTEMI (may have a component of
   cardiogenic shock).  Start vanco/zosyn for GPCs in sputum and
   infiltrate on CXR suggestive of HAP.
   - IVF boluses for hypotension, low UOP
   - monitor UOP
   - f/u cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool).
   - continue vanco/flagyl for severe C. diff
   - hold antihypertensives
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP pneumonia
   >  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting with
   diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so will treat
   with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Abdominal exam currently benign, but
   patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis. If lactate
   increases will consider re-imaging and [**Doctor First Name 91**] consult.
   - continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops abdominal symptoms, cont
   to follow bladder pressures.
   - TID lytes and replete prn
   >  Leukocytosis.  Patient found to have leukocytosis with 40% bands on
   admission. Likely secondary to C. diff, but will evaluate for other
   etiologies with blood and urine cultures.  Now with infiltrate on CXR
   and GNRs in sputum will treat for VAP as well.  Also with aspergillus
   (rare in the sputum). For now we can stop IV vanco (no evidence of GPC
   in blood and although present oin stain did not grow out), would think
   aspergillus is likely to be contaminant as opposed to infectious.
   - contive flagyl/vanco for c. dif
   - cont /zosyn for HAP
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - follow wbc, fever curve
   >  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Now with GNR in the sputum which we are treating, the GPC are
   probable contaminants as are the aspergillus
   - Cont abx, stop Vanco
   - wean FIO2 if possible
   - trial PS as she wakes up
   - Minimize sedation and change to PS when more awake.
   - will need diuresis in future when hemodynamically stable for
   pulmonary edema
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   >NSTEMI.  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF now with improving troponins, repeat TTE with some
   worsening of TR and pulm htn, but no change in LV function.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - no BB due to hypotension
   >Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF, likely
   prerenal versus ATN in setting of hypotension and dehydration and
   falling HCO3 with a UAG of 0 which suggests diarrhea as the source
   would favor HCO3 repletion for now., although she may not have good
   absorption. Would favor trying to diurese her gently today if she can
   tolerate
   - cont PO HCO3
   - renally dose all meds
    >  Hyponatremia.  Patient has hypovolemic hyponatrmia.  Hyponatremia
   improving with IVFs.
   - urine osms
   - IVF boluses for hydration

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, dementia, and gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea, intubated, and on Levophed. The patient also has concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). She is currently being treated for multiple medical complications including hypotension, C. diff colitis, NSTEMI, leukocytosis, respiratory failure, renal failure, hyponatremia, and possible HAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/C. diff colitis: The patient's profound and persistent hypotension in the setting of diarrhea and VAP increases the risk of further hypotension and worsening of C. diff colitis.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has evidence of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which may have a component of cardiogenic shock. There is a risk of cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could progress, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis with 40% bands may indicate a bacterial infection, and there is a risk of progression or development of sepsis.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea, hypotension, and concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). The patient is intubated and on Levophed. She is now volume overloaded.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe C. diff: The patient has severe C. diff, for which she is being treated with both IV Flagyl and PO Vancomycin. Close monitoring of symptoms, fever curve, and white blood cell count is important. If there is an increase in lactate, re-imaging and consultation with a doctor may be necessary.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient became tachypneic and hypoxic during aggressive fluid hydration, leading to pulmonary edema as seen on chest X-ray. Treatment includes a 7-day course of Piperacillin-Tazobactam (Pip-tazo) for GNR in the sputum, cautious diuresis, and re-trying pressure support in the morning.

3. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient has troponin elevations, lateral ST depressions, and T-wave inversions (TWI) in the setting of hypotension. Despite an initial normal ejection fraction (EF"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type II diabetes, asthma, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea, hypotension, and concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). The patient is intubated, on Levophed, and is now volume overloaded.

Assessment and Plan:
1. C. diff: The patient has severe C. diff, likely due to recent use of clarithromycin and amoxicillin for urinary tract infection (UTI) and Helicobacter pylori gastritis. She will be treated with both IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin. Abdominal exam is currently benign, but the patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abdomen/pelvis. If lactate increases, consider re-imaging and consult with Dr. [Doctor's First Name].

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient became tachypneic and hypoxic during aggressive fluid hydration. Chest X-ray is consistent with pulmonary edema. Gram-negative rods (GNR) are present in the sputum, which we are treating with a 7-day course of piperacillin-tazobactam (Pip-tazo). Gram-positive cocci (GPC) are probable contaminants as are Aspergillus. Consider putting her back on volume control"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea, hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on Levophed. She has evidence of volume overload and increasing bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely prerenal or acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and elevated troponin levels suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Other issues include severe C. diff infection, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe C. diff infection: The patient has a severe case of C. diff, which can lead to complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially toxic megacolon leading to bowel perforation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to hypoxia and pulmonary edema. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration, leading to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte disturbances, and uremic symptoms.
4. NSTEMI: The patient has evidence of an acute myocardial infarction, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is an 87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, dementia,
   h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea, intubated,
   now weaned off pressors.
   .
   1.  Hypotension.  Patient with profound and persistent hypotension in
   setting of diarrhea and poor PO intake.  Hypotension likely secondary
   to severe dehdyration.  Stool cultures from today at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] was
   C. diff positive, though negative here.  Also with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] may have
   a component of cardiogenic shock.  Was on Vanco/zosyn, but will taper
   to zosyn only today.
   - monitor UOP
   - maintain MAPS > 60
   - f/u cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool).
   - continue vanco/flagyl for severe C. diff
   - hold antihypertensives
   - continue zosyn for HAP pneumonia
   .
   2.  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting
   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so will treat
   with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Abdominal exam currently benign, but
   patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis.
   - continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops worsening abdominal exam
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes and replete prn
   .
   3.  Metabolic acidosis.  Likely secondary to bicarb losses from
   diarrhea and RTA.
   - sodium bicarb PO
   - follow bicarb
   .
   4.  Hyponatremia.  Hypervolemica hyponatremia.
   - lasix drip for fluid removal
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  Patient found to have leukocytosis with 40% bands on
   admission. Likely secondary to C. diff and pneumonia.
   - contive flagyl/vanco
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - follow wbc, fever curve
   .
   4.  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema and pneumonia.  Currently on minimal vent support with FIO2 of
   40%, PEEP of 5.
   - continue mechanical venitllation
   - wean sedation give PS trial if possible (failed SBT in AM due to
   apnea)
   - initiate diuresis with lasix drip today
   - continue zosyn for HAP
   .
   5.  [**Hospital1 **].  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF, most recent echo with preserved EF.
   - continue home aspirin, statin
   - no BB due to hypotension
   - daily EKGs
   .
   6.  Type II diabetes.  On metformin at home.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - ISS
   - follow finger sticks
   .
   7.  PUD.  Patient has history of PUD.  Found to have H. pylori.
   Recently started on clarithryomycin and amoxicillin as outpatient.
   - hold clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   - transfuse to 25
   .
   8.  Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF,
   likely secondary to ATN given urine lytes.
   - lasix drip
   - follow UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   9.  Depression.
   - celexa
   FEN: tube feeds, MVI
   PPx: hold HSQ due to elevated PTT, pneumoboots

   Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is an 87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, dementia,
   h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea, intubated,
   now weaned off pressors.
   .
   1.  Hypotension.  Patient with profound and persistent hypotension in
   setting of diarrhea and poor PO intake.  Hypotension likely secondary
   to severe dehdyration.  Stool cultures from today at [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] was
   C. diff positive, though negative here.  Also with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] may have
   a component of cardiogenic shock.  Was on Vanco/zosyn, but will taper
   to zosyn only today.
   - monitor UOP
   - maintain MAPS > 60
   - f/u cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool).
   - continue vanco/flagyl for severe C. diff
   - hold antihypertensives
   - continue zosyn for HAP pneumonia
   .
   2.  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting
   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so will treat
   with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Abdominal exam currently benign, but
   patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis.
   - continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops worsening abdominal exam
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes and replete prn
   .
   3.  Metabolic acidosis.  Likely secondary to bicarb losses from
   diarrhea and RTA.
   - sodium bicarb PO
   - follow bicarb
   .
   4.  Hyponatremia.  Hypervolemica hyponatremia.
   - lasix drip for fluid removal
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  Patient found to have leukocytosis with 40% bands on
   admission. Likely secondary to C. diff and pneumonia.
   - contive flagyl/vanco
   - start vanco/zosyn for HAP
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - follow wbc, fever curve
   .
   4.  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema and pneumonia.  Currently on minimal vent support with FIO2 of
   40%, PEEP of 5.
   - continue mechanical venitllation
   - wean sedation give PS trial if possible (failed SBT in AM due to
   apnea)
   - initiate diuresis with lasix drip today
   - continue zosyn for HAP
   .
   5.  [**Hospital1 **].  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF, most recent echo with preserved EF.
   - continue home aspirin, statin
   - no BB due to hypotension
   - daily EKGs
   .
   6.  Type II diabetes.  On metformin at home.
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - ISS
   - follow finger sticks
   .
   7.  PUD.  Patient has history of PUD.  Found to have H. pylori.
   Recently started on clarithryomycin and amoxicillin as outpatient.
   - hold clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   - transfuse to 25
   .
   8.  Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF,
   likely secondary to ATN given urine lytes.
   - lasix drip
   - follow UOP
   - renally dose all meds

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, asthma, dementia, and gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea and was intubated. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, possibly due to severe dehydration. Her creatinine levels have risen to 1.7 from 1.4, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. The patient also has evidence of pancolitis on CT abdomen/pelvis, suggesting severe C. diff infection. Other medical conditions include metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, leukocytosis, respiratory failure, and possible cardiac issues indicated by TWI and lateral ST depressions with elevated troponins.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's profound and persistent hypotension may worsen if fluid overload is not managed properly.
2. C. diff: The patient's severe C. diff infection may progress and lead to complications such as sepsis or toxic megacolon.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's bicarb losses from diarrhea and RTA may worsen, leading to further acidosis and potential organ dysfunction.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hypervolemic hyponatremia may deteriorate if fluid balance is not maintained.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory condition may worsen if mechanical ventilation is not appropriately managed.
6. Cardiac issues: The patient's elevated tro"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is an 87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, dementia,
   h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea, intubated,
   now weaned off pressors.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure:  recent tachypnea and hypoxia in setting of
   aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR still shows persistent pulmonary edema
   and ? pneumonia.  Was acidotic and hypoventilating on PS 15/5 this
   morning.
   - switch back to AC for improved ventilation
   - continue diuresis as below
   - continue pip-tazo for presumed HAP
   # Volume overload: secondary to aggressive IVF. Furosemide gtt was
   started yesterday. Cr trending up, but urine output still low.
   - transfuse with pRBCs
   - continue furosemide gtt
   - check pm lytes; replete as needed

","Summary:
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of type II diabetes, asthma, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, volume overload, C. diff colitis, recent hypotension, metabolic acidosis, possible cardiac issues, type II diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, renal failure, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recent tachypnea and hypoxia indicate respiratory failure. Persistent pulmonary edema seen on CXR suggests ongoing fluid overload.
2. Volume Overload: Aggressive IV fluid administration has led to fluid overload, as evidenced by increased CVP and bladder pressure.
3. C. diff Colitis: The patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abdomen/pelvis, indicating severe C. diff infection. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances and dehydration.
4. Renal Failure: Rising creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury (ATN), possibly secondary to dehydration and sepsis.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: Bicarb losses from RTA have resulted in metabolic acidosis. Sodium bicarb supplementation is needed.
6. Possible Cardiac Issues: Elevated troponins and ST depressions indicate potential cardiac involvement. Further investigation with echocardiogram is recommended.

   still shows persistent pulmonary edema and ? pneumonia.  Was again
   acidotic and hypoventilating on PS 15/5 this morning.
   - switch back to AC for improved ventilation
   - continue diuresis as below
   - continue pip-tazo for presumed HAP
   # Volume overload: secondary to aggressive IVF. Furosemide gtt was
   started [**12-20**], currently at 16 mg/hr. Cr trending up slowly, 1.9 today.
   Urine output 80-150 ml/hr.
   - continue furosemide gtt
   - add chlorothiazide
   - check lytes, Cr tid; replete as needed
   - monitor I/O closely
   #  C. diff colitis: with hypotension on presentation. Before admission,
   patient had been on clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H.
   pylori gastritis. Evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis.
   - continue IV metronidazole, PO vancomycin
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops worsening abdominal exam
   #  Recent hypotension: BP now stable.  Initiatl hypotension likely
   secondary to dehydration and sepsis in setting of C. diff colitis and
   poor PO intake.  C. diff from [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] was positive but negative
   here.
   - monitor UOP
   - maintain MAPS > 60
   - f/u cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool).
   - continue vanco/flagyl for severe C. diff and pip-tazo for HAP
   - hold antihypertensives
   #  Metabolic acidosis.  Likely secondary to bicarb losses from RTA.
   - sodium bicarb PO
   - follow bicarb
   # NSTEMI: TWI and lasteral ST depressions in setting of hypotension;
   elevated troponins.  Last echo in [**2121**] with normal EF, most recent echo
   with preserved EF.
   - continue home aspirin, statin
   - no BB due to hypotension
   #  Type II diabetes:  On metformin at home.
   - continue to hold oral hypoglycemics
   - ISS; follow finger sticks
   .
   # PUD.  Patient has history of PUD.  Found to have H. pylori.  Recently
   started on clarithryomycin and amoxicillin as outpatient.
   - hold clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   #  Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF, likely
   secondary to ATN given urine lytes and ongoing furosemide gtt.
   - continue furosemide gtt for now but monitor renal labs closely
   - follow UOP
   - renally dose all meds

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including type II diabetes, asthma, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea and subsequently intubated. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, volume overload, C. diff colitis, recent hypotension, metabolic acidosis, NSTEMI, type II diabetes, PUD, and renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory failure. Complications may include ventilator-associated pneumonia, barotrauma, or ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Volume overload: The patient has been receiving aggressive IV fluids, leading to volume overload. Complications may include pulmonary edema, heart failure, or renal dysfunction.

3. C. diff colitis: The patient has been treated with metronidazole and vancomycin for C. diff colitis. Complications may include worsening abdominal exam, sepsis, or perforation.

4. Recent hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension may recur if she becomes dehydrated or develops sepsis. Complications may include shock or organ dysfunction.

5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to bicarb losses from RTA. Complications may include worsening renal function or electrolyte imbalances.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is an 87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, dementia,
   h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea, intubated,
   now weaned off pressors.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure:  recent tachypnea and hypoxia in setting of
   aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR still shows persistent pulmonary edema
   and ? pneumonia.  Was acidotic and hypoventilating on PS 15/5 this
   morning.
   - switch back to AC for improved ventilation
   - continue diuresis as below
   - continue pip-tazo for presumed HAP
   # Volume overload: secondary to aggressive IVF. Furosemide gtt was
   started yesterday. Cr trending up, but urine output still low.
   - transfuse with pRBCs
   - continue furosemide gtt
   - check pm lytes; replete as needed
   - monitor I/O closely
   #  C. diff colitis: with hypotension on presentation. Before admission,
   patient had been on clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H.
   pylori gastritis. Evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis.
   - continue IV metronidazole, PO vancomycin
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops worsening abdominal exam
   #  Recent hypotension: BP now stable.  Initiatl hypotension likely
   secondary to dehydration and sepsis in setting of C. diff colitis and
   poor PO intake.  C. diff from [**Hospital1 5**] [**Location (un) 3**] was positive but negative
   here.
   - monitor UOP
   - maintain MAPS > 60
   - f/u cultures (blood, urine, sputum, stool).
   - continue vanco/flagyl for severe C. diff and pip-tazo for HAP
   - hold antihypertensives
   #  Metabolic acidosis.  Likely secondary to bicarb losses from RTA.
   - sodium bicarb PO
   - follow bicarb
   .
   .
   # NSTEMI: TWI and lasteral ST depressions in setting of hypotension;
   elevated troponins.  Last echo in [**2121**] with normal EF, most recent echo
   with preserved EF.
   - continue home aspirin, statin
   - no BB due to hypotension
   #  Type II diabetes:  On metformin at home.
   - continue to hold oral hypoglycemics
   - ISS; follow finger sticks
   .
   # PUD.  Patient has history of PUD.  Found to have H. pylori.  Recently
   started on clarithryomycin and amoxicillin as outpatient.
   - hold clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   #  Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF, likely
   secondary to ATN given urine lytes. Cr trended up overnight, likely due
   to furosemide
   - continue furosemide gtt
   - follow UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   #  Depression:
   - continue citalopram

   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so will treat
   with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Abdominal exam currently benign, but
   patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis. If lactate
   increases will consider re-imaging and [**Doctor First Name 91**] consult.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type II diabetes mellitus (DM), asthma, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea, intubated, and on Levophed. There is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).

The patient has severe C. diff, likely secondary to recent antibiotic use for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and Helicobacter pylori gastritis. She is being treated with both intravenous (IV) metronidazole and oral vancomycin for severe C. diff. The abdominal exam is currently benign, but the patient has evidence of pancolitis on a CT abdomen/pelvis. If lactate levels increase, a repeat imaging and consultation with a doctor will be considered.

The patient also has respiratory failure due to fluid overload and pulmonary edema. She is being treated with piperacillin-tazobactam for a 7-day course, and cautious diuresis is being continued. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is being re-tried in the morning.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure, likely pre-renal or acute tubular necrosis (ATN), with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. This may be related to hypotension"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, legal blindness, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea in the setting of triple antibiotic therapy for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The patient was intubated for respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload, and now has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)/hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. She was admitted to the ICU with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated and on levophed due to respiratory failure. There are concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). The patient is volume overloaded and has evidence of pancolitis on CT abdomen/pelvis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. C. diff: The patient has severe C. diff, so she will be treated with both IV flagyl and PO vancomycin. If there is an increase in lactate, a surgery consult may be considered, and re-imaging might be done.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient became tachypneic and hypoxic during aggressive fluid hydration. A chest X-ray is consistent with pulmonary edema. The sputum culture shows growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR), which will be treated for a 7-day course. Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and Aspergillus are considered probable contaminants. The patient will be put back on mechanical ventilation with higher PEEP to recruit airways. Cautious diuresis will continue, and a repeat attempt at pronation will be made in the morning.
3. NSTEMI: The patient has TWI"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea, which led to hypotension and subsequent intubation for respiratory failure. The patient also has a urinary tract infection and possible pneumonia, for which she is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. 

The patient's current condition includes severe C. diff infection, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Her vital signs show hypertension and tachypnea. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and abnormalities in electrolytes and liver function tests. Imaging reveals right perihilar opacity, bilateral effusions, and atelectasis versus consolidation on chest X-ray.

Plan and Assessment:
1. C. diff infection: Continue treatment with IV flagyl and PO vancomycin.
2. Respiratory failure: Consider surgery consult if patient develops abdominal symptoms, continue cautious diuresis with lasix GTT, and add diuril today. Perform pressure support trial.
3. NSTEMI: Continue aspirin and statin therapy, and hold beta-blocker due to recent off-pressors status.
4. Acute renal failure: Replete HCO3, dose medications renally, and follow creatinine closely.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 2914**] is an 87 year old female with type II DM, asthma,
   dementia, h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea,
   intubated, now weaned off pressors.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure:  in setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR
   still shows persistent pulmonary edema.  Has been on AC yesterday and
   overnight.
   - PS trial given good diuresis yesterday
   - continue pip-tazo for presumed HAP
   # Volume overload: secondary to aggressive IVF. Furosemide gtt was
   started [**12-20**], currently at 16 mg/hr. Cr plateaued at around 1.9-2.0.
   Chlorothiazide added yesterday with excellent urine output. Negative
   1.1 L yesterday.
   - continue furosemide gtt and chlorothiazide
   - check lytes, Cr tid; replete as needed
   - monitor I/O closely
   #  C. diff colitis: with hypotension on presentation. Before admission,
   patient had been on clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H.
   pylori gastritis. Evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis.
   - continue IV metronidazole, PO vancomycin
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops worsening abdominal exam
   #  Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF, likely
   secondary to ATN given urine lytes and ongoing furosemide gtt.
   Metabolic acidosis likely secondary to bicarb losses from RTA.
   - continue furosemide gtt for now but monitor renal labs closely
   - follow UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   - continue sodium bicarb PO
   # NSTEMI: TWI and lasteral ST depressions in setting of hypotension;
   elevated troponins.  Last echo in [**2121**] with normal EF, most recent echo
   with preserved EF. Metoprolol added yesterday.
   - continue aspirin, statin, metoprolol
   #  Type II diabetes:  On metformin at home. Glargine added yesterday.
   - continue to hold oral hypoglycemics
   - ISS; follow finger sticks
   .
   # PUD.  Patient has history of PUD.  Found to have H. pylori.  Recently
   started on clarithryomycin and amoxicillin as outpatient.
   - hold clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   #  Depression:
   - continue citalopram

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still experiencing persistent pulmonary edema as seen on the chest X-ray, indicating ongoing respiratory distress. Aggressive fluid hydration may contribute to this issue. 

2. Volume overload: The patient has been receiving aggressive IV fluids, leading to fluid overload. This is evident from the negative fluid balance of 1.1 liters yesterday. Diuretics such as furosemide and chlorothiazide are being used to manage this condition.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis: The patient has evidence of pancolitis on CT abdomen/pelvis and a history of recent antibiotic use, which increases the risk of C. diff infection. Metronidazole and oral vancomycin are being used to treat this condition.

4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 0.8 to 1.9-2.0, indicating renal dysfunction. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is likely contributing to renal failure, possibly secondary to hypotension and the use of nephrotoxic medications.

5. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient has elevated troponin levels and ECG changes consistent with NSTEMI. Medications such as aspirin, statins, and metoprolol are being used to manage this"

   Ms. [**Known lastname 2914**] is an 87 year old female with type II DM, asthma,
   dementia, h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea,
   intubated, now weaned off pressors.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure:  in setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR
   still shows persistent pulmonary edema.  Has been on AC yesterday and
   overnight.
   - PS trial given good diuresis yesterday
   - continue pip-tazo for presumed HAP
   # Volume overload: secondary to aggressive IVF. Furosemide gtt was
   started [**12-20**], currently at 16 mg/hr. Cr plateaued at around 1.9-2.0.
   Chlorothiazide added yesterday with excellent urine output. Negative
   1.1 L yesterday.
   - continue furosemide gtt and chlorothiazide
   - check lytes, Cr tid; replete as needed
   - monitor I/O closely
   #  C. diff colitis: with hypotension on presentation. Before admission,
   patient had been on clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H.
   pylori gastritis. Evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis.
   - continue IV metronidazole, PO vancomycin
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops worsening abdominal exam
   #  Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF, likely
   secondary to ATN given urine lytes and ongoing furosemide gtt.
   Metabolic acidosis likely secondary to bicarb losses from RTA.
   - continue furosemide gtt for now but monitor renal labs closely
   - follow UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   - continue sodium bicarb PO
   # NSTEMI: TWI and lasteral ST depressions in setting of hypotension;
   elevated troponins.  Last echo in [**2121**] with normal EF, most recent echo
   with preserved EF. Metoprolol added yesterday.
   - continue aspirin, statin, metoprolol
   #  Type II diabetes:  On metformin at home. Glargine added yesterday.
   - continue to hold oral hypoglycemics
   - ISS; follow finger sticks
   .
   # PUD.  Patient has history of PUD.  Found to have H. pylori.  Recently
   started on clarithryomycin and amoxicillin as outpatient.
   - hold clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   #  Depression:
   - continue citalopram

","Summary of the Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2914**] is an 87-year-old female admitted to the ICU with severe C. diff diarrhea, intubated, and now weaned off pressors. She has a medical history of type II DM, asthma, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. The patient is currently being treated for multiple conditions including respiratory failure, volume overload, C. diff colitis, renal failure, NSTEMI, type II diabetes, and peptic ulcer disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's persistent pulmonary edema and ongoing need for AC suggests ongoing respiratory issues. Continued monitoring and management of respiratory support may be necessary.
2. Volume overload: The patient's aggressive fluid hydration and high intake/output balance indicate potential volume overload. Close monitoring of fluid status and continued use of diuretics may be required.
3. C. diff colitis: The patient's symptoms and CT findings suggest active C. diff infection. Treatment with IV metronidazole and oral vancomycin should be continued, and a surgical consult may be necessary if there is worsening abdominal exam.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and ongoing furosemide infusion suggest acute kidney injury (ATN). Frequent monitoring of renal labs, adjustment of medication dosages based on renal function, and continuation of sodium bicarb PO may be necessary.
5. NSTEMI: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 2914**] is an 87 year old female with type II DM, asthma,
   dementia, h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea,
   intubated, now weaned off pressors.
   .
   #  Respiratory failure:  in setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR
   still shows persistent pulmonary edema.  Has been on AC yesterday and
   overnight.
   - PS trial given good diuresis yesterday
   - continue pip-tazo for presumed HAP
   # Volume overload: secondary to aggressive IVF. Furosemide gtt was
   started [**12-20**], currently at 16 mg/hr. Cr plateaued at around 1.9-2.0.
   Chlorothiazide added yesterday with excellent urine output. Negative
   1.1 L yesterday.
   - continue furosemide gtt and chlorothiazide
   - check lytes, Cr tid; replete as needed
   - monitor I/O closely
   #  C. diff colitis: with hypotension on presentation. Before admission,
   patient had been on clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H.
   pylori gastritis. Evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis.
   - continue IV metronidazole, PO vancomycin
   - consider surgery consult if patient develops worsening abdominal exam
   #  Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF, likely
   secondary to ATN given urine lytes and ongoing furosemide gtt.
   Metabolic acidosis likely secondary to bicarb losses from RTA.
   - continue furosemide gtt for now but monitor renal labs closely
   - follow UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   - continue sodium bicarb PO
   # NSTEMI: TWI and lasteral ST depressions in setting of hypotension;
   elevated troponins.  Last echo in [**2121**] with normal EF, most recent echo
   with preserved EF. Metoprolol added yesterday.
   - continue aspirin, statin, metoprolol
   #  Type II diabetes:  On metformin at home. Glargine added yesterday.
   - continue to hold oral hypoglycemics
   - ISS; follow finger sticks
   .
   # PUD.  Patient has history of PUD.  Found to have H. pylori.  Recently
   started on clarithryomycin and amoxicillin as outpatient.
   - hold clarithromycin and amoxicillin

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea and required intubation due to respiratory failure. The patient has been weaned off pressors, indicating that her blood pressure is now stable.

The patient's current health progress includes the following potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to show persistent pulmonary edema as seen on the chest X-ray. Despite aggressive fluid hydration, the respiratory failure persists. The healthcare team is continuing with aggressive diuresis using furosemide and considering other interventions as necessary.

2. Volume Overload: The patient has experienced volume overload secondary to aggressive intravenous fluid administration. Furosemide has been started and increased to 16 mg/hr to manage the fluid overload. Additionally, chlorothiazide has been added to promote diuresis and help eliminate excess fluid.

3. C. diff Colitis: The patient has evidence of pancolitis on computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis, indicating C. diff infection. The healthcare team is continuing with intravenous metronidazole and oral vancomycin to treat the infection. If the patient's condition worsens, a surgery consult may be considered.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have risen from 0."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, legally blind, dementia,
   h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea (40% bands,
   pancolitis) in setting of triple-ABX therapy for UTI/PUD. Intubated for
   respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload, now with
   VAP/HAP.  Now off levophed [**12-21**].
    >  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting
   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so being
   treated with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Patient has evidence of
   pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis. Current abdominal exam with  distension,
   but non-tender, but If lactate increases will consider re-imaging and
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] consult.
   -          continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   -          consider surgery consult if patient develops abdominal
   symptoms, cont to follow bladder pressures.
   -          TID lytes and replete prn
   >  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Now with Klebsiella in the sputum which we are treating for 7
   day course, the GPC are probable contaminants as is the aspergillus.
   Failed PS trial 2x due to acidemia (7.26/46), likely [**2-26**] low lung
   volumes. Put back on AC with improvement
   -          Pip-tazo for 7 day course (last day is [**12-25**])
   -          Good diuresis with lasix gtt and diuril.
   -          PS trial in AM, failed past two days with low tidal volumes,
   but now that diuresing, will try again
   > NSTEMI.  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF now with improving troponins, repeat TTE with some
   worsening of TR and pulm htn, but no change in LV function.
   -          continue aspirin, statin, BB
   >Acute renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF,
   likely prerenal versus ATN in setting of hypotension and dehydration
   and falling HCO3 with a UAG of 0 which suggests diarrhea as the source
   would favor HCO3 repletion for now., although she may not have good
   absorption. We still need to get volume off and continue
   -          cont PO HCO3
   -          renally dose all meds
   -          Follow creatinine closely
   Other issues per ICU resident note.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, legally blind, dementia,
   h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea (40% bands,
   pancolitis) in setting of triple-ABX therapy for UTI/PUD. Intubated for
   respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload, now with
   VAP/HAP.  Now off levophed [**12-21**].
    >  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting
   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so being
   treated with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Patient has evidence of
   pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis. Current abdominal exam with  distension,
   but non-tender, but If lactate increases will consider re-imaging and
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] consult.
   -          continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   -          consider surgery consult if patient develops abdominal
   symptoms, cont to follow bladder pressures.
   -          TID lytes and replete prn
   >  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Now with Klebsiella in the sputum which we are treating for 7
   day course, the GPC are probable contaminants as is the aspergillus.
   Failed PS trial 2x due to acidemia (7.26/46), likely [**2-26**] low lung
   volumes. Put back on AC with improvement
   -          Pip-tazo for 7 day course (last day is [**12-25**])
   -          Good diuresis with lasix gtt and diuril.
   -          PS trial in AM, failed past two days with low tidal volumes,
   but now that diuresing, will try again
   > NSTEMI.  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF now with improving troponins, repeat TTE with some
   worsening of TR and pulm htn, but no change in LV function.
   -          continue aspirin, statin, BB
   >Acute renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF,
   likely prerenal versus ATN in setting of hypotension and dehydration
   and falling HCO3 with a UAG of 0 which suggests diarrhea as the source
   would favor HCO3 repletion for now., although she may not have good
   absorption. We still need to get volume off and continue
   -          cont PO HCO3
   -          renally dose all meds
   -          Follow creatinine closely

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, legal blindness, and dementia. The patient was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea in the setting of triple antibiotic therapy for a urinary tract infection and peptic ulcer disease. She subsequently developed respiratory failure and was intubated, possibly due to volume overload. The patient now has ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP). 

The patient has severe C. diff and is being treated with both intravenous (IV) metronidazole and oral vancomycin. There is evidence of pancolitis on the abdominal CT scan. The patient's abdominal exam shows distension, but it is non-tender. 

The patient also has acute renal failure, likely pre-renal versus acute tubular necrosis in the setting of hypotension and dehydration. Her creatinine level has increased from 0.8 on 06/02 to the current value. 

Additionally, the patient has an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with troponin elevation, ST depressions, and T-wave inversions on the electrocardiogram (ECG). 

The patient's current plan includes continuing IV flagyl and PO vancomycin for severe C. diff, considering a surgery consult if the patient develops abdominal symptoms, continuing bladder pressure monitoring, giving TID"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, legal blindness, and dementia. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea and hypotension, possibly due to volume overload. The patient was intubated for respiratory failure and is now diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP).

The patient's recent medical history includes being treated with clarithromycin and amoxicillin for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and Helicobacter pylori gastritis. She also resides in a nursing home.

The patient has severe C. diff and is being treated with both intravenous (IV) flagyl and oral vancomycin. She has evidence of pancolitis on computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis. Her current abdominal examination shows distension but is non-tender.

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to aggressive fluid hydration, leading to pulmonary edema. She is being treated with a 7-day course of antibiotics for Klebsiella in the sputum, which are probable contaminants along with Aspergillus. The patient has undergone two positive pressure ventilation (PS) trials but failed due to acidemia. She is now on assisted control (AC) ventilation with improvement.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, legally blind, dementia,
   h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea (40% bands,
   pancolitis) in setting of triple-ABX therapy for UTI/PUD. Intubated for
   respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload, now with
   VAP/HAP.  Now off levophed [**12-21**].
    >  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting
   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so being
   treated with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Patient has evidence of
   pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis. Current abdominal exam with  distension,
   but non-tender, but if lactate increases will consider re-imaging and
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] consult.
   -          continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   -          consider surgery consult if patient develops abdominal
   symptoms, cont to follow bladder pressures.
   -          TID lytes and replete prn
   >  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Now with Klebsiella in the sputum which we are treating for 7
   day course, the GPC are probable contaminants as is the aspergillus.
   Failed PS trial 2x due to acidemia (7.26/46), likely [**2-26**] low lung
   volumes. Put back on AC with improvement.
   -          Pip-tazo for 7 day course (last day is [**12-25**])
   -          Good diuresis with lasix gtt and diuril.  CXR improved with
   decreased effusions.
   -          PS trial in AM, failed past two days with low tidal volumes,
   but now that diuresing, will try again
   > NSTEMI.  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF now with improving troponins, repeat TTE with some
   worsening of TR and pulm htn, but no change in LV function.
   -          continue aspirin, statin, BB (started [**12-22**])
   >Acute renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF,
   likely prerenal versus ATN in setting of hypotension and dehydration.
   Falling HCO3 with a UAG of 0 which suggests diarrhea as the source.
   Would favor HCO3 repletion for now, although she may not have good
   absorption. We still need to get volume off.
   -          cont PO HCO3
   -          renally dose all meds
   -          Follow creatinine closely
   Other issues per ICU resident note.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of type II diabetes, asthma, legal blindness, and dementia. She was admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea and hypotension, which led to intubation for respiratory failure. The patient also has VAP/HAP, severe C. diff colitis, and a history of gastric ulcer. She has been treated with triple-ABX therapy for UTI/PUD, IV flagyl, and PO vanco for severe C. diff. The patient's current condition includes abdominal distension but is non-tender, and she is showing signs of improvement with diuresis and decreased effusions on CXR. She has had an NSTEMI with elevated troponins, but her troponin levels are improving, and she has worsening TR and pulm htn on TTE. The patient also has acute renal failure with a falling HCO3 and UAG of 0, suggesting diarrhea as the source. She is being treated with PO HCO3 and renal dosing of all medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff colitis: The patient has severe C. diff colitis, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload. She now has VAP/HAP and requires continued aggressive management.
3. NSTEMI: The patient"

   pancolitis) in setting of triple-ABX therapy for UTI/PUD. Intubated for
   respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload, now with
   VAP/HAP.  Now off levophed [**12-21**].
     >  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting
   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so being
   treated with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Patient has evidence of
   pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis. Current abdominal exam with  distension,
   but non-tender, but If lactate increases will consider re-imaging and
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] consult.
   -          continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   -          consider surgery consult if patient develops abdominal
   symptoms, cont to follow bladder pressures.
   -          TID lytes and replete prn
   >  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Now with Klebsiella in the sputum which we are treating for 7
   day course, the GPC are probable contaminants as is the aspergillus.
   Failed PS trial yesterday due to acidemia (7.26/46), likely [**2-26**] low
   lung volumes. Put back on AC with improvement (7.35/33).
   -          Pip-tazo for 7 day course (last day is [**12-25**])
   -          cont cautious diuresis with lasix GTT. Will add diuril
   today.
   -          PS trial in AM, failed past two days with low tidal volumes
   -          Likely bilateral pleural effusions. Will try to obtain decub
   xrays and if unable, would consider CT chest +/- tap
    >NSTEMI.  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF now with improving troponins, repeat TTE with some
   worsening of TR and pulm htn, but no change in LV function.
   -          continue aspirin, statin
   -          holding BB given recently off pressors
   >Acute renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF,
   likely prerenal versus ATN in setting of hypotension and dehydration
   and falling HCO3 with a UAG of 0 which suggests diarrhea as the source
   would favor HCO3 repletion for now., although she may not have good
   absorption. We still need to get volume off and continue
   -          cont PO HCO3
   -          renally dose all meds
   -          Follow creatinine closely

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, legal blindness, and dementia. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea and hypotension, possibly due to recent triple antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infection (UTI) and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The patient required intubation for respiratory failure, which could be attributed to volume overload. Additionally, she developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP).

The patient has severe C. diff infection, treated with intravenous (IV) metronidazole and oral vancomycin. She also has evidence of pancolitis on computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis. Her abdominal examination reveals distension but is non-tender. If her lactate levels increase, a surgical consult may be considered, and re-imaging may be done.

The patient's respiratory failure was likely due to aggressive fluid hydration. Chest X-ray findings were consistent with pulmonary edema. Klebsiella species were identified in the sputum, and the patient is being treated with a 7-day course of antibiotics. Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and Aspergillus are considered probable contaminants. Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) trials have failed due to acidemia and likely low lung volumes. The patient has been placed back on assist-control (AC)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has been on a Lasix drip and was able to spend 12 hours on pressure support (PS) before resting on assisted ventilation (AC). The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient received antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Metronidazole, Piperacillin, and Vancomycin. The patient is currently on Furosemide (Lasix) infusion and also taking Pantoprazole (Protonix). The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for pain, which the patient does not experience. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/45 mmHg to 155/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 44 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm, and his weight has increased from 60 kg at admission to 75 kg currently. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 5 mmHg, and his bladder pressure is 6 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,808 mL, including 975 mL through the mouth, 874 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TF), and 1,699 mL through intravenous fluids (IVF). Output includes 4,300 mL of urine, 1,380 mL of blood products, -1,492 mL through nasogastric (NG) drainage, and -1,205 mL through drains. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 70, and oxygen partial pressure/partial pressure of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio of 315. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits, and his blood glucose level is elevated at 243 mg/dL. Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished, with no abnormalities noted in the cardiovascular, respiratory, or neurological systems. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased hemoglobin (Hct), elevated platelet (Plt) count, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and lactic acid levels. The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, dementia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, myocardial infarction, septic shock, and other conditions. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 2914**] is an 87 year old female with type II DM, asthma,
   dementia, h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea,
   intubated, now weaned off pressors.
   #  Respiratory failure:  in setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR
   still shows persistent pulmonary edema.  Has been on AC yesterday and
   overnight.
   - PS trial again today, patient failed SBT pulled tidal volumes 300 ml
   and declining
   - Continue pip-tazo for presumed HAP to last day [**12-25**]
   # Volume overload: secondary to aggressive IVF. Furosemide gtt was
   started [**12-20**]. Cr plateaued at around 1.9-2.1. Chlorothiazide added
   [**12-22**] with excellent urine output.
   - Continue furosemide gtt and chlorothiazide, goal UOP 125-150 ml/hr
   - Check lytes, Cr tid; replete as needed
   - Monitor I/O closely
   #  C. diff colitis: with hypotension on presentation. Before admission,
   patient had been on clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H.
   pylori gastritis. Evidence of pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis.
   - Continue IV metronidazole, PO vancomycin
   - Consider surgery consult if patient develops worsening abdominal exam
   #  Renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF, likely
   secondary to ATN given urine lytes and ongoing furosemide gtt.
   Metabolic acidosis likely secondary to bicarb losses from RTA.
   - Continue furosemide gtt for now but monitor renal labs closely
   - Follow UOP
   - Renally dose all meds
   - Continue sodium bicarb PO
   # NSTEMI: TWI and lasteral ST depressions in setting of hypotension;
   elevated troponins.  Last echo in [**2121**] with normal EF, most recent echo
   with preserved EF. Metoprolol added yesterday.
   - Continue aspirin, statin, metoprolol
   #  Type II diabetes:  On metformin at home. Glargine added [**12-22**].
   - Continue to hold oral hypoglycemics
   - Increase glargine and sliding scale given patient mostly in mid 200s;
   follow finger sticks
   # PUD.  Patient has history of PUD.  Found to have H. pylori.  Recently
   started on clarithryomycin and amoxicillin as outpatient.
   - Hold clarithromycin and amoxicillin
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   #  Depression:
   - Continue citalopram

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer.
- She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea and required intubation due to respiratory failure.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a set tidal volume of 450 mL and spontaneous tidal volume ranging from 162-401 mL.
- She has shown improvement in oxygenation, with an SpO2 of 100% on FiO2 of 40%.
- The patient's blood pressure is within normal range, but there are concerns about volume overload, which has been managed with diuretics.
- Her renal function has deteriorated from a baseline creatinine of 0.8 to around 2.1, indicating acute renal failure likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- Metabolic acidosis is present, possibly due to bicarbonate losses from renal tubular acidosis (RTA).
- The patient has a history of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), but her most recent echocardiogram showed preserved ejection fraction.
- Her diabetes management includes holding oral hypoglycemics and increasing insulin therapy.
- She has a history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and was recently treated for Hel"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned, but the note includes information about allergies, medication administration, vital signs, fluid balance, respiratory support, physical examination, lab results, and assessment and plan.

The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), dementia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, acute myocardial infarction, septic shock, and other conditions. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening of renal function leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, progression of respiratory failure resulting in further deterioration of lung function, exacerbation of C. diff infection leading to severe colitis, development of new cardiac complications, and potential progression of septic shock.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical status to promptly identify and manage any potential complications. Timely interventions such as appropriate antibiotic therapy for C. diff, fluid management for renal failure, and respiratory support for respiratory failure may be necessary to prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, legally blind, dementia,
   h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea (40% bands,
   pancolitis) in setting of triple-ABX therapy for UTI/PUD. Intubated for
   respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload, now with
   VAP/HAP.  Now off levophed [**12-21**].
    >  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting
   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so being
   treated with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Patient has evidence of
   pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis. Current abdominal exam with  distension,
   but non-tender, but if lactate increases will consider re-imaging and
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] consult.
   -          continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   -          consider surgery consult if patient develops abdominal
   symptoms, cont to follow bladder pressures.
   -          TID lytes and replete prn
   >  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Now with Klebsiella in the sputum which we are treating for 7
   day course, the GPC are probable contaminants as is the aspergillus.
   Failed PS trial 2x due to acidemia (7.26/46), likely [**2-26**] low lung
   volumes. Put back on AC with improvement.
   -          Pip-tazo for 7 day course (last day is [**12-25**])
   -          Good diuresis with lasix gtt and diuril
 will titrate
   down.  CXR improved with decreased effusions.
   -          Tolerating PS during the day at lower values ([**10-30**]), but did
   not tolerate SBT (TV 150-220)
   -          [**Month (only) 8**] be close to extubation in next few days
   > NSTEMI.  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF now with improving troponins, repeat TTE with some
   worsening of TR and pulm htn, but no change in LV function.
   -          continue aspirin, statin, BB (started [**12-22**])
   >Acute renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF,
   likely prerenal versus ATN in setting of hypotension and dehydration.
   Falling HCO3 with a UAG of 0 which suggests diarrhea as the source.
   Would favor HCO3 repletion for now, although she may not have good
   absorption. We still need to get volume off.
   -          cont PO HCO3
   -          renally dose all meds
   -          Follow creatinine closely
   Other issues per ICU resident note.

The patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, legal blindness, and dementia. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea and hypotension. The patient was recently on triple antibiotic therapy for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). She was intubated for respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload, and now has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). The patient's current medications include Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Metronidazole, Vancomycin, Furosemide (Lasix), Pantoprazole (Protonix), and Aspirin.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 149/55 mmHg to 155/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for severe C. diff diarrhea.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is well-nourished, overweight/obese, with diminished breath sounds at the bases. Her cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and her peripheral vascular examination reveals trace"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, legally blind, dementia,
   h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea (40% bands,
   pancolitis) in setting of triple-ABX therapy for UTI/PUD. Intubated for
   respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload, now with
   VAP/HAP.  Now off levophed [**12-21**].
    >  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting
   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so being
   treated with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Patient has evidence of
   pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis. Current abdominal exam with  distension,
   but non-tender, but if lactate increases will consider re-imaging and
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] consult.
   -          continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   -          consider surgery consult if patient develops abdominal
   symptoms, cont to follow bladder pressures.
   -          TID lytes and replete prn
   >  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Now with Klebsiella in the sputum which we are treating for 7
   day course, the GPC are probable contaminants as is the aspergillus.
   Failed PS trial 2x due to acidemia (7.26/46), likely [**2-26**] low lung
   volumes. Put back on AC with improvement.
   -          Pip-tazo for 7 day course (last day is [**12-25**])
   -          Good diuresis with lasix gtt and diuril
 will titrate
   down.  CXR improved with decreased effusions.
   -          Tolerating PS during the day at lower values ([**10-30**]), but did
   not tolerate SBT (TV 150-220)
   -          [**Month (only) 8**] be close to extubation in next few days
   > NSTEMI.  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF now with improving troponins, repeat TTE with some
   worsening of TR and pulm htn, but no change in LV function.
   -          continue aspirin, statin, BB (started [**12-22**])
   >Acute renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF,
   likely prerenal versus ATN in setting of hypotension and dehydration.
   Falling HCO3 with a UAG of 0 which suggests diarrhea as the source.
   Would favor HCO3 repletion for now, although she may not have good
   absorption. We still need to get volume off.
   -          cont PO HCO3
   -          renally dose all meds
   -          Follow creatinine closely

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, legal blindness, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. She was admitted to the ICU for severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea, which occurred after receiving triple antibiotic therapy for a urinary tract infection and peptic ulcer disease. The patient was also intubated for respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload, and now has ventilator-associated pneumonia/hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP/HAP).

The patient has been treated with intravenous (IV) metronidazole and oral vancomycin for severe C. diff. She exhibits signs of pancolitis on abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. Her current abdominal examination reveals distension but is non-tender. If her lactate levels increase, a surgical consult may be considered.

The patient's respiratory failure was likely caused by aggressive fluid hydration. She developed tachypnea and hypoxia, and her chest X-ray showed pulmonary edema. Klebsiella was found in her sputum, which is being treated with a 7-day course of antibiotics. The healthcare providers consider the gram-positive cocci (GPC) and Aspergillus as probable contaminants.

The patient failed two pressure support (PS) trials due to acidemia, likely low lung volumes. She was put back on assisted ventilation with improvement. The plan is to continue with IV piperacillin/tazob"

   reduced the PSV to [**5-30**]. She appeared comfortable with slight increase
   in respiratory rate from 20 to 22 and mild decline in tidal volume.
   Blood pressure has been stable today. CVP is [**3-30**] with ongoing diuresis.
   On exam, patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She does

   Diarrhea improving. Patient has been getting bicarbonate replacement
   and serum bicarbonate now normal. Completing course of antibiotics for
   C diff and for pneumonia.
   Oxygenation improved. As negative fluid balance has been achieved,
   respiratory mechanics seem to be improving. Patient tolerating lower

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, legal blindness, and dementia. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea in the setting of triple antibiotic therapy for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The patient was intubated for respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload, and now presents with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). She has evidence of pancolitis on CT abdomen/pelvis.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1. C. diff: The patient is being treated with both IV metronidazole and PO vancomycin for severe C. diff. If abdominal symptoms develop, a surgery consult will be considered, and bladder pressures will be continued to be monitored.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to volume overload, as indicated by the presence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. She is being treated with a 7-day course of piperacillin/tazobactam (Pip-tazo) for VAP/HAP. Lasix and diuril will be titrated down due to good diuresis, and she is tolerating pressure support during the day at lower values but did not tolerate spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) with tidal volume (TV) 150-220.
3. NSTEMI: The patient has TWI and lateral ST depressions in the setting of hypotension, with elevated troponins. An echo in 2121 showed normal ejection fraction (EF), but a repeat TTE revealed worsening of TR and pulmonary hypertension, although no change in LV function. The patient will continue on aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker (BB).
4. Acute renal failure: The patient had a creatinine level of 0.8 in 06/02 but now presents with ARF, likely pre-renal versus acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension and dehydration. Falling HCO3 with a UAG of 0 suggests diarrhea as the source. HCO3 repletion will be continued, and all medications will be renally dosed. Creatinine levels will be closely monitored.

Other issues include nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and measures to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, legal blindness, dementia, and a history of gastric ulcer. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea in the setting of triple antibiotic therapy for a urinary tract infection and peptic ulcer disease. The patient became severely hypotensive and was intubated for respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload, and now presents with ventilator-associated pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient has been treated with both intravenous metronidazole and oral vancomycin for severe C. diff, along with aggressive fluid hydration. She has shown good diuresis with lasix and diuril, and her chest X-ray has improved with decreased effusions. The plan is to continue IV flagyl and PO vancomycin for severe C. diff, titrate down and discontinue diuril, and consider extubation.

Additionally, the patient had an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with ST depressions and troponin elevation, but with improving troponin levels and stable cardiac function on repeat TTE. She has been started on aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker therapy.

The patient also presented with acute renal failure, likely pre-renal versus acute tubular necrosis, in the setting of hypotension and dehydration. Her serum creatinine has worsened from 0.8 to"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, legally blind, dementia,
   h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea (40% bands,
   pancolitis) in setting of triple-ABX therapy for UTI/PUD. Intubated for
   respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload, now with
   VAP/HAP.  Now off levophed [**12-21**].
    >  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting
   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so being
   treated with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Patient has evidence of
   pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis. Current abdominal exam with  distension,
   but non-tender, but if lactate increases will consider re-imaging and
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] consult.
   -          continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   -          TID lytes and replete prn
   >  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Now with Klebsiella in the sputum which we are treating for 7
   day course, the GPC are probable contaminants as is the aspergillus.
   Failed PS trial 2x due to acidemia (7.26/46), likely [**2-26**] low lung
   volumes. Put back on AC with improvement.
   -          Pip-tazo for 7 day course completed today
   -          Good diuresis with lasix gtt and diuril
 will titrate down
   and d/c diuril.  CXR improved with decreased effusions.

 will extubate
   > NSTEMI.  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in

   worsening of TR and pulm htn, but no change in LV function.
   -          continue aspirin, statin, BB (started [**12-22**])
   >Acute renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF,
   likely prerenal versus ATN in setting of hypotension and dehydration.
   Falling HCO3 with a UAG of 0 which suggests diarrhea as the source.
   Would favor HCO3 repletion for now, although she may not have good
   absorption.  Now stable with diuresis at 2.0.

   87 year old female with type II DM, asthma, legally blind, dementia,
   h/o gastric ulcer, admitted with severe C. diff diarrhea (40% bands,
   pancolitis) in setting of triple-ABX therapy for UTI/PUD. Intubated for
   respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload, now with
   VAP/HAP.  Now off levophed [**12-21**].
    >  C. diff.  Patient found to have severe C. diff after presenting
   with diarrhea and hypotension.  Patient was recently started on
   clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and H. pylori gastritis and
   resides in a nursing home.  Patient has severe C. diff, so being
   treated with both IV flagyl and PO vanco.  Patient has evidence of
   pancolitis on CT abd/pelvis. Current abdominal exam with  distension,
   but non-tender, but if lactate increases will consider re-imaging and
   [**Doctor First Name 91**] consult.
   -          continue IV flagyl, PO vanco for severe C. diff
   -          TID lytes and replete prn
   >  Respiratory failure.  Patient became tachypneic and hypoxic in
   setting of aggressive fluid hydration.  CXR consistent with pulmonary
   edema.  Now with Klebsiella in the sputum which we are treating for 7
   day course, the GPC are probable contaminants as is the aspergillus.
   Failed PS trial 2x due to acidemia (7.26/46), likely [**2-26**] low lung
   volumes. Put back on AC with improvement.
   -          Pip-tazo for 7 day course completed today
   -          Good diuresis with lasix gtt and diuril
 will titrate down
   and d/c diuril.  CXR improved with decreased effusions.
   -          Tolerated 0/5 x 1 hour with TV 250-300
 will extubate
   > NSTEMI.  Patient noted to have TWI and lasteral ST depressions in
   setting of hypotension.  Patient with elevated troponins.  Last Echo in
   [**2121**] with normal EF now with improving troponins, repeat TTE with some
   worsening of TR and pulm htn, but no change in LV function.
   -          continue aspirin, statin, BB (started [**12-22**])
   >Acute renal failure.  Patient had Cr of 0.8 in [**6-2**].  Now with ARF,
   likely prerenal versus ATN in setting of hypotension and dehydration.
   Falling HCO3 with a UAG of 0 which suggests diarrhea as the source.
   Would favor HCO3 repletion for now, although she may not have good
   absorption.  Now stable with diuresis at 2.0.
   -          cont PO HCO3
   -          renally dose all meds
   -          Follow creatinine closely

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, legal blindness, and dementia. She was admitted with severe Clostridium difficile (C. diff) diarrhea in the setting of triple antibiotic therapy for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The patient was intubated for respiratory failure, possibly due to volume overload, and now presents with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). 

The patient has been treated with both IV metronidazole and PO vancomycin for severe C. diff. She also received a 7-day course of piperacillin-tazobactam, which was completed today. Good diuresis with Lasix and diuril has been achieved, with plans to titrate down and discontinue diuril. The patient tolerated spontaneous breathing for 1 hour with a tidal volume (TV) of 250-300 mL and is expected to be extubated soon.

The patient has a history of gastric ulcer and was recently started on clarithromycin and amoxicillin for UTI and Helicobacter pylori gastritis, residing in a nursing home. She has severe C. diff and is being treated with both IV flagyl and PO vanco. 

In addition to the above medical issues, the patient has acute renal failure, likely prerenal versus acute tubular"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including Clostridium difficile infection, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, dementia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, acute myocardial infarction, septic shock, and others. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 132/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned conditions. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, diminished breath sounds at the bases of the lungs, soft non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both extremities, and normal neurologic function. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with the need for mechanical ventilation and evidence of respiratory failure. The patient's overall condition indicates multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, development of additional infections, and cardiovascular complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of C Difficile colitis and hypoxemic respiratory failure from volume overload. The patient was started on diuretics (Lasix and Diuril) and pressure support overnight. An attempt at extubation was made this morning but failed due to hypercapnea, resulting in reintubation.

The patient has no known drug allergies and has received antibiotics including Piperacillin, Metronidazole, and Vancomycin. The patient is currently receiving Furosemide (Lasix) at a rate of 8 mg/hour and Pantoprazole (Protonix).

Review of systems is unchanged from admission, and the patient's medical and family history remains unchanged. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging between 127/56 mmHg and 140/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 10 mmHg, and fluid balance reveals an input of 2,386 mL and output of 4,975 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,589 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with hypovolemic shock due to severe C Difficile colitis, now with hypoxemic respiratory failure following aggressive IVF resuscitation. The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, C Difficile colitis, acute renal failure (possibly ATN from initial shock), NSTEMI, and DM2.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: This condition is already present and may lead to further respiratory distress or the need for mechanical ventilation support.

2. C Difficile colitis: If not properly treated, this infection can lead to worsening colitis, sepsis, and potentially death.

3. Acute renal failure (ATN): If not managed appropriately, ATN can progress to chronic renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload.

4. NSTEMI: Without appropriate management, there is a risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or heart failure.

5. DM2: Poor glycemic control in the context of diabetes mellitus can lead to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, which can have various systemic effects and complications.

It is important to closely monitor and manage these conditions to prevent further complications and optimize the patient's outcome."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple medical conditions and complications. The summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU includes the following:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient initially experienced hypoxemic respiratory failure following aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation. This condition was complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and resulted in failed extubation due to hypercapnea.

2. C Difficile colitis: The patient is suffering from Clostridium difficile (C Diff) colitis, which initially led to hypovolemic shock. Treatment includes metronidazole and vancomycin, with a 14-day course starting on December 26th.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from initial shock. Despite aggressive diuresis, the patient's creatinine levels remain stable.

4. Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's troponin levels were elevated earlier, indicating an NSTEMI. The patient is likely experiencing demand ischemia in the setting of shock. Treatment includes aspirin, metoprolol, and a statin.

5. Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2): The patient's diabetes is being managed by titrating insulin. Oral medications for DM2 are currently being held.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [**Known Last Name 2914**], an 87-year-old female, is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. She has hypoxemic respiratory failure following aggressive IVF resuscitation, complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and failed extubation due to hypercapnea. She also has severe C. difficile colitis, initially presenting in hypovolemic shock, for which she is receiving metronidazole and vancomycin therapy. Additionally, she has acute renal failure, possibly due to ATN from initial shock, and is being managed with diuretics and sodium bicarbonate for possible renal tubular acidosis. Lastly, she had an acute myocardial infarction with non-ST elevation (NSTEMI), likely caused by demand ischemia in the setting of shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory condition is worsening despite aggressive fluid resuscitation. This could lead to further respiratory distress and potential need for intubation.
2. C. difficile colitis: The patient's severe C. difficile infection may progress and lead to worsening colitis, electrolyte imbalances, and systemic complications.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys may continue to deteriorate, leading to further impairment of renal function and potential need for dialysis.
4. NSTEMI: The patient's cardiac condition may worsen, resulting in decreased cardiac output"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of multiple medical complications, including Clostridium difficile infection, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and dementia. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, such as antibiotics for the C. difficile infection, renal support, respiratory support, and nutrition support. The patient's vital signs and lab results are being closely monitored, and the healthcare team is working towards resolving the patient's conditions and improving their overall health status.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. C. difficile Infection: The patient is currently being treated for a C. difficile infection. If not effectively managed, this infection can lead to severe diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and even sepsis.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which means their kidneys are not functioning properly. This can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, increased toxic substance levels in the body, and potentially life-threatening complications.

3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is also dealing with acute respiratory failure, which can be caused by various factors such as pneumonia, sepsis, or muscle weakness. If not properly managed, this condition can lead to respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and ultimately respiratory arrest.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypovolemic shock due to severe Clostridium difficile (C. Difficile) colitis. She also experienced hypoxemic respiratory failure following aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation. The patient has been treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and attempted extubation today failed due to hypercapnea. She is currently being managed for C. Difficile colitis, acute renal failure possibly secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and a previous non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Failure to wean off mechanical ventilation: The patient's initial extubation attempt failed due to hypercapnea, indicating difficulty in weaning off the ventilator. This can be a sign of underlying respiratory distress or inadequate respiratory function.
2. Recurrence of C. Difficile infection: Despite treatment, there is a risk of recurrence of C. Difficile infection, which can lead to further complications such as severe colitis, sepsis, and potentially death.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. This puts her at risk of developing AKI, which may require dialysis and can have long-term implications on renal function.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to hypovolemic shock caused by severe Clostridium difficile colitis. She also experienced hypoxemic respiratory failure after aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation and developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient failed extubation today due to hypercapnea and underwent prolonged mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis from initial shock. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating uncontrolled diabetes mellitus type 2. Her troponin levels were elevated earlier, suggesting a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) during the shock state. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including diuretics, antibiotics, and anticoagulants. She is receiving total parenteral nutrition and has a multi-lumen central venous line. The patient's code status is full code, and her current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already developed VAP, which is a common complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. It is essential to continue implementing appropriate measures to prevent further infections, such as elevating the head of bed, performing daily oral care, and considering early weaning from mechanical ventilation when appropriate.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with hypovolemic shock due to severe C. difficile colitis. She has experienced hypoxemic respiratory failure following aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation and then failed extubation with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has muscle weakness contributing to her respiratory issues, complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) after completing a seven-day course of Zosyn. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of both hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. If she remains unable to extubate, there is a risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation or the need for a tracheostomy.
2. C. difficile Colitis: The patient has severe C. difficile colitis, which initially presented in hypovolemic shock. It is important to continue the appropriate antibiotic treatment with metronidazole and vancomycin for the required 14-day course to prevent further complications.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine levels have increased from 1.3-1.4 to 1.7, indicating acute renal failure. This could be due to initial acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from initial shock or a new baseline. Close monitoring of renal function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly is necessary.
4. NSTEMI: The patient likely experienced demand ischemia in the setting of shock, leading to non"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes who presented with hypovolemic shock due to severe C. difficile colitis and subsequent respiratory failure. The patient underwent aggressive IV fluid resuscitation but failed extubation with hypercarbic respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at PS 5/PEEP 5 since yesterday. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including severe C. difficile colitis, acute on chronic renal failure, NSTEMI, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced hypoxemic respiratory failure following aggressive IVF resuscitation and subsequently developed hypercarbic respiratory failure after failed extubation. The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring, and tracheostomy placement may be considered due to the inability to extubate.

2. Severe C. difficile Colitis: The patient presented with hypovolemic shock due to severe C. difficile colitis. Although the colitis has been resolved, the patient will continue on a 14-day course of metronidazole/vancomycin and PEG tube placement may be necessary.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure, likely due to ATN from initial shock. However, the renal failure has resolved, and baseline creatinine levels have"

   Disposition: Pending extubation/decision for tracheostomy
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with severe C. difficile colitis and shock. The patient also has respiratory failure, likely due to muscle weakness contributing to failed extubation with hypercarbic respiratory failure. There is a history of VAP after completing a seven-day course of Zosyn. The patient has acute renal failure with an elevated baseline creatinine level, and it is now considered a new baseline. There is also a suspicion of NSTEMI without a known history of CAD, likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of shock. Additionally, the patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and is currently hyperglycemic. 

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening of respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, development of new infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), progression of C. difficile colitis leading to perforation or sepsis, and possible cardiac events given the suspicion of NSTEMI. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, renal function, glycemic control, and cardiovascular status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. He was found unresponsive in his home with poor respiratory effort and low oxygen saturation. The patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated upon admission. He failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to acute renal failure. The patient has a recent diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection, for which he is receiving vancomycin and metronidazole. His current medications include furosemide, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/38 mmHg to 139/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 200 mg/dL. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 306 K/uL and an elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL. The patient's renal function is improving, and his respiratory failure is multifactorial, likely due to weakness and mild volume overload. The patient is planned to have a tracheostomy and"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan, written by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   [**Location (un) 3012**]. I would emphasize and add the following points: 87F c. diff c/b
   volume overload, respiratory failure and resolving ARF. TBB negative
   yesterday, now +5L/LOS.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.8 BP 115/50 HR 92 RR 18 with sat 99 on PSV 10/5,
   RSBI 85. Frail woman, NAD on vent. Diminished BS B bases. RRR s1s2, abd
   is softer today. 2+ edema. Labs notable for WBC 7.6K, HCT 30, K+ 3.4,
   Cr 1.2, HCO3 38.
   Agree with plan to continue diuresis and discuss with son re trach and
   [**Name (NI) 3014**] placement as she has multifactorial respiratory failure with
   elements of volume overload, weakness, extrinsic restriction, and
   possible aspiration pneumonia. Will contact IP after family meeting.

 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continuing to treat with flagyl/po vanco for her 14 day course. WBC
   remains stable.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Creatinine has improved considerably over the last several days and is
   now within normal range. Follow for change.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Respiratory status is improving. On pressure support and able to
   continue to decrease support for her. Will continue to do so. See below
   re goals of care.
   - plan to aim towards extubation in next 1-2 days
 HYPERNATREMIA
   She is having increasing BUN, increasing sodium, suggesting that she is
   becoming somewhat hypovolemic intravascularly. This is fine for the
   moment given that the goal is to extubate her in an enduring way;
   making sure she is absolutely as dry as possible in her lungs is worth
   some mild electrolyte abnormalities for a short time. However, should
   increase free water boluses once extubated.
   GOALS OF CARE
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 103**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 749**], MICU attending, discussed goals of care with son. [**Name (NI) **] his
   notes re this. Son, [**Name (NI) 3036**], will want to be present for extubation. I
   will call Mr [**Known lastname 2812**] to explain plan to extubate tomorrow if all continues
   to go well.

1. C. diff colitis: The patient is being treated for C. diff infection with vancomycin. This condition can cause severe diarrhea and electrolyte imbalances due to the loss of fluids and electrolytes from diarrhea.
2. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by an overwhelming immune response to infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not appropriately managed.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved over the last few days but were previously elevated. Acute renal failure can occur due to various reasons, including sepsis, and can lead to fluid and"

 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continuing to treat with flagyl/po vanco for her 14 day course. WBC
   remains stable.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Creatinine has improved considerably over the last several days and is
   now within normal range. Follow for change.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Respiratory status is improving. On pressure support and able to
   continue to decrease support for her. Will continue to do so. See below
   re goals of care.
   - plan to aim towards extubation in next 1-2 days
 HYPERNATREMIA
   She is having increasing BUN, increasing sodium, suggesting that she is
   becoming somewhat hypovolemic intravascularly. This is fine for the
   moment given that the goal is to extubate her in an enduring way;
   making sure she is absolutely as dry as possible in her lungs is worth
   some mild electrolyte abnormalities for a short time. However, should
   increase free water boluses once extubated.
   GOALS OF CARE
   [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 103**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 749**], MICU attending, discussed goals of care with son. [**Name (NI) **] his
   notes re this. Son, [**Name (NI) 3036**], will want to be present for extubation. I
   will call Mr [**Known lastname 2812**] to explain plan to extubate tomorrow if all continues
   to go well.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with C diff colitis and sepsis. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 123/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen, and temperature within normal range. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 2,109 mL over the past 24 hours. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 344 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and hyponatremia. The patient is being treated with flagyl and vancomycin for C diff infection, and the WBC count remains stable. The patient's respiratory status is improving, and the plan is to aim towards extubation in the next 1-2 days. Goals of care have been discussed with the son, and the patient will be extubated tomorrow if all continues to go well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing nosocomial pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated events: The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation puts him at risk for ventilator-associated events such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), acute renal failure, and acute respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been deemed critically ill. The patient's family has expressed their desire to avoid tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and instead opt for extubation with a focus on comfort-centered care if she experiences recurrent respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Respiratory Failure: Given the patient's current acute respiratory failure and the decision to pursue comfort-centered care, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure upon extubation. This could lead to further deterioration in her condition and potential need for reintubation.
2. Worsening Renal Function: Although the patient's renal failure has resolved, there is still a possibility of deterioration in renal function. Monitoring fluid balance and adjusting medications accordingly will be important to prevent further renal impairment.
3. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient is already infected with CDI, and the treatment plan includes vancomycin and metronidazole. It is crucial to monitor for any worsening symptoms or complications related to the infection, such as pseudomembranous colitis or sepsis.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobilization in the ICU. Prophyl"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/49 to 136/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is sedated and not fully assessed neurologically. The patient has been receiving various medications including furosemide, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,109 mL and output of 2,545 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 436 mL. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 381 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.8, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 32 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 29.4 mEq/L. The patient's white blood cell count is 6.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level is 10.1 g/dL, platelet count is 344 K/uL, creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, and glucose level is 173 mg/dL. The patient's blood cultures were positive for Gram-positive cocci in chains on December 25th and 27th. The patient's WBC count has been fluctuating between 6.9 and 8.5 K/uL. The patient's Hct levels have been ranging from 28.7% to 30.4%. The patient's PT/INR levels are within normal range. The patient's family meeting was held yesterday regarding the possibility of tracheostomy and peg tube placement. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and cultures will be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin should be continued.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding is important.
4. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient is already diagnosed with C. difficile infection. Continued treatment with oral vancomycin and metronidazole is necessary. Monitoring for symptoms of colitis is important.

   hypovolemic shock due to severe C. difficile colitis, s/p hypoxemic
   respiratory failure following aggressive IVF resuscitation and then
   failed extubation with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure: Initially hypoxemic following aggressive IVF
   resuscitation and now status post failed extubation with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.   Multifactorial including prior pulmonary
   infection, muscle weakness, extrinsic compression from scoliosis.
   Status post completion of seven-day course of Zosyn for VAP. Patient
   diuresed over many days on lasix drip.
   - family wishes are extubation to DNR/DNI status.  Patient is currently
   DNR.
   - no further lasix drip, as patient with metabolic contraction
   alkalosis
   - monitor VBGs and patient mental status for planned extubation in next
   1-2 days
   2. Severe C. difficile colitis: Presented in hypovolemic shock, now
   resolved.
   - Continue metronidazole/vancomycin for 14-day course started
   [**12-26**](after completion of Zosyn for VAP)
   3 Acute on chronic renal failure: Resolved.  Baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.4.  ARF initially likely ATN from initial shock, now consider new
   baseline.
   - Continue to monitor and renally dose medications
   4 NSTEMI: No known history of CAD.  Likely demand ischemia in setting
   of shock.
   - Continue aspirin, metoprolol, statin
   5 DM2: Currently hyperglycemic in the setting of infection.
   - cont glargine and insulin sliding scale
   6 Anemia: Normocytic.  Likely anemia of chronic disease and chronic
   renal failure.  Stable.

","The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes presenting with hypovolemic shock due to severe C. difficile colitis, status post hypoxemic respiratory failure following aggressive IVF resuscitation, and failed extubation with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including prior pulmonary infection, muscle weakness, and extrinsic compression from scoliosis.

The patient's family wishes are extubation to DNR/DNI status. The patient is currently DNR and will be monitored for planned extubation in the next 1-2 days. There are no further plans for lasix drip as the patient has metabolic contraction alkalosis.

The patient also has severe C. difficile colitis, which presented in hypovolemic shock but has now resolved. Metronidazole and vancomycin will be continued for a 14-day course started on [**12-26**], after completion of Zosyn for VAP.

Additionally, the patient has acute on chronic renal failure, which has resolved. Baseline creatinine levels were 1.3-1.4, and acute renal failure initially likely arose from initial shock. The patient's baseline creatinine should be considered anew. Medications will continue to be monitored"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been aggressively diuresed in preparation for extubation and has been given a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 127/60 to 145/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 387 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 39 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 24 mEq/L. The patient's labs indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 7.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 30.3 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 359 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.5 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 160 to 200 mg/dL. The patient's medical history includes a diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome), dementia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, acute myocardial infarction, septic shock, and others. The patient's current treatment includes glyceride control, prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, as well as ventilation support. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and they are currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications for this patient may include worsening respiratory failure due to the patient's current condition and DNR/DNI status, further deterioration of renal function, development of new infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), electrolyte imbalances, and possible progression of C. difficile infection."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with a Clostridium difficile infection, respiratory failure, and septic shock. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/60 mmHg to 108/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation support through an endotracheal tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): This bacterial infection can cause severe diarrhea and colitis, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. The patient may require specific treatment for C. diff, such as oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of worsening respiratory distress or failure, which could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Septic shock: Although the patient's septic shock has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrence due to the presence of an active infection. Close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and timely intervention are crucial to prevent another episode of septic shock.

4. Fluid imbalance: The patient has had a significant fluid input-output imbalance, with more fluids being administered than excreted."

   respiratory failure following aggressive IVF resuscitation and then
   failed extubation with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   1. Respiratory failure: Initially hypoxemic following aggressive IVF
   resuscitation and now status post failed extubation with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure.   Multifactorial including prior pulmonary
   infection, muscle weakness, extrinsic compression from scoliosis.
   Status post completion of seven-day course of Zosyn for VAP. Patient
   diuresed over many days on lasix drip. Held lasix drip and contraction
   alkalosis has resolve.
   - family wishes are extubation to DNR/DNI status.  Patient is currently
   DNR.
   - patient requiring increasing vent settings, hypoventilating, off
   sedation
 with elevated bicarb. Will attempt acetazolamide to see if
   can decrease bicarb and improve respiratory drive.
   - monitor VBGs
   2. Severe C. difficile colitis: Presented in hypovolemic shock, now
   resolved.
   - Continue metronidazole/vancomycin for 14-day course started
   [**12-26**](after completion of Zosyn for VAP)
   3 Acute on chronic renal failure: Resolved.  Baseline creatinine
   1.3-1.4.  ARF initially likely ATN from initial shock, now consider new
   baseline.
   - Continue to monitor and renally dose medications
   4 NSTEMI: No known history of CAD.  Likely demand ischemia in setting
   of shock.
   - Continue aspirin, metoprolol, statin

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes, presenting with hypovolemic shock due to severe C. difficile colitis. She experienced hypoxemic respiratory failure following aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation and failed extubation with hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has completed a seven-day course of Zosyn for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has diuresed over many days on lasix drip, resulting in contraction alkalosis, which has resolved. The patient's family wishes are extubation to do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status, and the patient is currently DNR. She requires increasing ventilator settings, hypoventilating, and is off sedation with elevated bicarbonate levels. An attempt will be made to administer acetazolamide to decrease bicarbonate levels and improve respiratory drive. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 132/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially experienced hypoxemic respiratory failure and then failed extubation with hypercarbic respiratory failure. Factors contributing to this condition include prior pulmonary infection, muscle weakness, and extrinsic compression from scoliosis. The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for V"

2. Severe C. difficile Colitis: The patient presented in hypovolemic shock due to severe C. difficile colitis. Even though her condition has improved, there is a risk of recurrence or complications related to the infection.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient experienced acute renal failure initially, which may have been due to acute tubular necrosis from initial shock. Now, her baseline creatinine level needs to be considered, and medication dosing should be monitored based on renal function.

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Not doing well in terms of independence from vent though CXR and vent
   settings would suggest that she should be improving in terms of
   respiratory capacity. Suggests neurologic problem.
   - minimize sedation
   - no extubation today
   - still trying to optimize status for extubation; did talk to son who
   understands that if she does not improve on vent would need to be
   extubated nonetheless, also understands that if this were the case this
   would be terminal extubation
   - we will assess for improvement over today and tonight, consider
   holding tube feeds tonight in prep for extubation tomorrow
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continuing to treat w flagyl/PO vanc.
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Worsening erythematous and weeping area on face may be poor skin
   integrity secondary to long-term venting/taping/etc; consider treating
   as skin infection if does not improve with ongoing nursing care.
   GOALS OF CARE
   Affirmed with son this AM that goal is DNR/DNI, he understands she can
   not be vented forever, understands that we are awaiting improvement but
   at some point may need to extubate even if we think she will not do
   well off the vent.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with C. diff colitis and respiratory failure. She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has not improved, and she continues to rely heavily on the ventilator. She has been receiving treatment for C. diff infection with metronidazole and vancomycin. The patient's skin integrity on her face is deteriorating due to long-term venting, and there are concerns about potential infections. The patient's family has confirmed that her goals of care are DNR/DNI, meaning she does not want to be kept on life support indefinitely. The medical team is waiting for improvement but may need to consider extubation if the patient does not show signs of recovery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, she is at risk for developing VAP, which can lead to further respiratory complications.
2. Skin infection: The worsening erythematous and weeping area on the patient's face may indicate impaired skin integrity and a potential infection. If left untreated, it could progress and cause additional complications.
3. C. difficile infection: Although the patient is receiving treatment for C. diff, there is still a risk of complications such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea or worsening colitis.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows a positive balance, indicating fluid overload. This"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with C. diff colitis and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been unstable, with unsuccessful extubation attempts due to failing spontaneous breathing trials. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, acetazolamide for metabolic alkalosis, and restarting tube feeds. The patient is on multiple medications, including dextrose and pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. The patient's weight has increased from 60 kg at admission to 75 kg currently. The patient has received a significant amount of fluid resuscitation, with a total fluid input of 1,788 mL and output of 1,011 mL. The patient is still on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume setting. Laboratory results indicate some abnormalities in electrolytes and kidney function. The patient's blood culture results are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff colitis - The patient's initial admission was due to C. diff infection, which can lead to severe diarrhea, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Respiratory failure - The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, and he is still dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Fluid overload - The patient has received a significant amount of fluid resuscitation, leading to fluid overload. This"

   Assessment and Plan
   87F PMH dementia initially admitted with hypovolemic / septic shock and
   respiratory failure. Failed extubation last week (RSBI had been in the
   80s) due to hypoventilation / hypercapnea. Remains dependent on
   ventilatory support.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   The patient has decreased respiratory drive likely due to ICU
   myopathy.  Her prognosis for a successful extubation is poor.
   Extubation was attempted last week with reintubation due to hypercarbia
   after one hour and a half.  I discussed her prognosis with her son,
   [**Name (NI) 3036**], who is aware of the situation and would like to be here for
   extubation; he will call back later today regarding the timing.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Presented in shock but now hemodynamically stable for greater than one
   week.  Continuing to treat with flagyl IV and vancomycin PO for a
   14-day course to end [**2130-1-8**].
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Opens eyes to voice and following simple commands. Chronic issue but
   concern that toxic-metabolic insults (infection, alkalosis) may be
   contributing to her altered mental status.
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (NSTEMI)
   Demand ischemia rather than acute coronary artery thrombus.  Currently
   on aspirin, metoprolol, statin.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   Resolved from admission.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of dementia, initially admitted with hypovolemic/septic shock and respiratory failure. She failed extubation last week due to hypoventilation/hypercapnea and remains dependent on ventilatory support. The primary issue is decreased central respiratory drive, which may be metabolic or structural in nature. The patient's prognosis for successful extubation is poor. She has been treated for C. difficile infection and is currently on flagyl and PO vanc. The patient has a history of dementia, acute myocardial infarction, acute renal failure (resolved), impaired skin integrity, and NSTEMI. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's continued dependence on ventilatory support indicates the ongoing risk of respiratory failure. The decreased central respiratory drive poses challenges in weaning her off the ventilator.
2. C. difficile Infection: The patient is being treated for C. difficile infection, which can lead to severe diarrhea and colitis. It is important to monitor for worsening symptoms and ensure appropriate treatment.
3. Dementia: The patient's pre-existing dementia may contribute to her altered mental status, and there is a concern that toxic-metabolic insults (such as infection or alkalosis) may exacerbate this condition.
4. Myocardial Infarction: Although the patient is on medication for coronary artery disease, there is a risk of recurrent myocardial infarction"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Primary issue still appears to be decreased central respiratory drive.
   Unclear if the process is metabolic or structural (i.e., central
   lesion, CVA, etc.) We started initiated Diamox yesterday in an effort
   to address her significant metabolic alkalosis
 her bicarb is improved
   today, but her respiratory drive remains depressed. She may have some
   improvement over the next day as she equilibrates from an acid/base
   stand-point. However, her prognosis for a successful extubation is
   poor. Will need to discuss with her family about extubation and her
   prognosis. Can consider central respiratory stimulant
   Affirmed with son this AM that goal is DNR/DNI, he understands she can
   not be vented forever, understands that we are awaiting improvement but
   at some point may need to extubate even if we think she will not do
   well off the vent.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continuing to treat w flagyl/PO vanc.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Opens eyes to voice, but not following commands. Chronic issue but
   concern that toxic-metabolic insults (infection, alkalosis) may be
   contributing to her altered mental status.
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (NSTEMI)
   On Lipitor, aspirin, hemodynamically stable. Suspect demand ischemia
   rather than acute coronary artery thrombus.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   Resolved from admission.
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Worsening erythematous and weeping area on face may be poor skin
   integrity secondary to long-term venting/taping/etc; consider treating
   as skin infection if does not improve with ongoing nursing care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. 

1. Shock due to C. difficile: The patient has a confirmed C. difficile infection, which is being treated with flagyl and PO vanc.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The primary issue is decreased central respiratory drive, possibly metabolic or structural in nature. Efforts have been made to address the metabolic alkalosis, but the patient's respiratory drive remains depressed.

3. Dementia: The patient has chronic dementia and recent toxic-metabolic insults may be contributing to her altered mental status.

4. Myocardial infarction, acute (NSTEMI): The patient is on Lipitor and aspirin, and there is suspicion of demand ischemia rather than an acute coronary artery thrombus.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has resolved from admission.

6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has worsening erythematous and weeping areas on the face, which may be due to poor skin integrity secondary to long-term venting/taping. It is being treated as a potential skin infection if it does not improve with nursing care.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Not doing well in terms of independence from vent though CXR and vent
   settings would suggest that she should be improving in terms of
   respiratory capacity. Suggests neurologic problem.
   - minimize sedation
   - no extubation today
   - still trying to optimize status for extubation; did talk to son who
   understands that if she does not improve on vent would need to be
   extubated nonetheless, also understands that if this were the case this
   would be terminal extubation
   - we will assess for improvement over today and tonight, consider
   holding tube feeds tonight in prep for extubation tomorrow

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with shock due to C. difficile infection and respiratory failure. The patient's mental status and level of participation in breathing make it unsafe to extubate her. The son understands that the patient may need to be extubated even if she is likely to do poorly. The patient is being treated with antibiotics for the C. difficile infection. Her respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube and controlled mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/42 mmHg to 138/58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.6-7.8 thousand/mm3, hematocrit of 29.8-30.3%, platelet count of 340-354 thousand/mm3, blood urea nitrogen of 32-34 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.2-1"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   Primary issue still appears to be decreased central respiratory drive.
   Unclear if the process is metabolic or structural (i.e., central
   lesion, CVA, etc.) We started initiated Diamox yesterday in an effort
   to address her significant metabolic alkalosis
 her bicarb is improved
   today, but her respiratory drive remains depressed. She may have some
   improvement over the next day as she equilibrates from an acid/base
   stand-point. However, her prognosis for a successful extubation is
   poor. Will need to discuss with her family about extubation and her
   prognosis. Can consider central respiratory stimulant
   Affirmed with son this AM that goal is DNR/DNI, he understands she can
   not be vented forever, understands that we are awaiting improvement but
   at some point may need to extubate even if we think she will not do
   well off the vent.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continuing to treat w flagyl/PO vanc.
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Opens eyes to voice, but not following commands. Chronic issue but
   concern that toxic-metabolic insults (infection, alkalosis) may be
   contributing to her altered mental status.
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (NSTEMI)
   On Lipitor, aspirin, hemodynamically stable. Suspect demand ischemia
   rather than acute coronary artery thrombus.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   Resolved from admission.
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Worsening erythematous and weeping area on face may be poor skin
   integrity secondary to long-term venting/taping/etc; consider treating
   as skin infection if does not improve with ongoing nursing care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is shock due to C. difficile and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's mental status is altered, and they are not following commands.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 110/42 to 138/58 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) set at 18 inspiratory breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100%. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,252 mL and output of 885 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,367 mL. The patient has received a total of 721 mL of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and 550 mL of intravenous fluids.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.6-7.8 thousand cells/mm³, hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 9.4 g/dL, platelet (Plt) count of 340-48 thousand cells/mm³, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 27.8 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of unknown. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently on various medications, including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but they show signs of respiratory failure due to weakness and possible central component with apnea over the weekend. There is also mention of C. difficile infection, which continues to be treated with vancomycin and metronidazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to weakness, with a possible central component and contribution of alkalosis. Regular monitoring of the patient's ventilation status and considering measures such as non-invasive ventilation or tracheostomy may be necessary.
2. C. difficile Infection: The patient is currently being treated for C. difficile infection with vancomycin and metronidazole. It is important to monitor for any worsening symptoms or complications related to the infection.
3. Shock: Although the patient's shock has resolved, it is essential to monitor for any signs of hemodynamic instability or recurrent shock.
4. DVT Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving DVT prophylaxis with boots and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin. Regular assessment for signs of deep vein thrombosis is necessary.
5. Glycemic Control: The patient requires regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. Frequent monitoring"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with baseline dementia and a history of hypovolemic shock, respiratory failure. She continues to experience respiratory failure, likely due to weakness or myopathy. She has failed extubation once and has hypercarbia.

Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 152/68 to 110/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus, and her weight is currently 75 kg, with a change from 60 kg at admission.

The patient has received several medications, including metronidazole, vancomycin, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. There are no known drug allergies.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for respiratory failure. Flow sheet data shows fluctuations in fluid balance, blood products, urine output, and respiratory support.

Physical examination reveals that the patient's eyes close to command, with weak hand squeeze. Respiratory rate and rhythm are normal, and her lungs are clear anteriorly. Extremities are warm with decreased edema.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of leukocytes, hemoglobin, platelets, glucose, and troponin-T. There are also increased levels of creatinine, potassium, magnesium, and lactate. Other lab values are within"

   87F PMH dementia initially admitted with hypovolemic / septic shock and
   respiratory failure. Failed extubation last week (RSBI had been in the
   80s) due to hypoventilation / hypercapnea. Remains dependent on
   ventilatory support.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   The patient has decreased respiratory drive likely due to ICU
   myopathy.  Her prognosis for a successful extubation is poor.
   Extubation was attempted last week with reintubation due to hypercarbia
   after one hour and a half.  Her son is aware of the situation and will
   be here at noon for likely terminal extubation.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Presented in shock but now hemodynamically stable for greater than one
   week.  Continuing to treat with flagyl IV and vancomycin PO for a
   14-day course to end [**2130-1-8**].
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Opens eyes to voice and following simple commands. Chronic issue but
   concern that toxic-metabolic insults (infection, alkalosis) may be
   contributing to her altered mental status.
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (NSTEMI)
   Demand ischemia rather than acute coronary artery thrombus.  Currently
   on aspirin, metoprolol, statin.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   Resolved from admission.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of dementia, who was initially admitted for hypovolemic and septic shock, along with respiratory failure. She failed extubation last week due to hypoventilation/hypercapnea and remains dependent on ventilatory support. The patient has decreased respiratory drive likely due to ICU myopathy. Her prognosis for a successful extubation is poor. She is being treated for C. difficile infection with a 14-day course of flagyl IV and vancomycin PO. The patient also has a history of dementia, acute myocardial infarction, acute renal failure (resolved), impaired skin integrity, and impaired glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains dependent on ventilatory support, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. The decreased respiratory drive due to ICU myopathy and her poor prognosis for successful extubation pose a significant risk.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient is being treated for C. difficile colitis, which can lead to severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and potentially life-threatening complications such as sepsis or toxic megacolon.
3. Myocardial infarction: The patient has a history of acute myocardial infarction, which increases her risk for further cardiac events such as recurrent myocardial infarction or heart failure.
4. Acute renal failure: Although resolved at present, the patient's history of acute renal failure indicates a potential"

   Assessment and Plan
   87F PMH dementia initially admitted with hypovolemic / septic shock and
   respiratory failure. Failed extubation last week (RSBI had been in the
   80s) due to hypoventilation / hypercapnea. Remains dependent on
   ventilatory support.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   The patient has decreased respiratory drive likely due to ICU
   myopathy.  Her prognosis for a successful extubation is poor.
   Extubation was attempted last week with reintubation due to hypercarbia
   after one hour and a half.  Her son is aware of the situation and will
   be today for likely terminal extubation.  Will have morphine gtt
   available for comfort after extubation.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Presented in shock but now hemodynamically stable for greater than one
   week.  Continuing to treat with flagyl IV and vancomycin PO for a
   14-day course to end [**2130-1-8**].
 DEMENTIA (INCLUDING ALZHEIMER'S, MULTI INFARCT)
   Opens eyes to voice and following simple commands. Chronic issue but
   concern that toxic-metabolic insults (infection, alkalosis) may be
   contributing to her altered mental status.
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (NSTEMI)
   Demand ischemia rather than acute coronary artery thrombus.  Currently
   on aspirin, metoprolol, statin.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
   Resolved from admission.
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   Poor skin integrity secondary to long-term venting/taping/etc;
   supportive care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a medical history of dementia, presenting initially with hypovolemic/septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient failed extubation last week due to hypoventilation/hypercapnea and remains dependent on ventilatory support. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still dependent on ventilatory support, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. There is a high risk of further complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

2. C. difficile infection: The patient is being treated for C. difficile colitis with a 14-day course of metronidazole and vancomycin. If the infection is not adequately controlled, there is a risk of worsening colitis and potential spread to other parts of the gastrointestinal tract.

3. Dementia: The patient has chronic dementia, and acute insults such as infections or metabolic imbalances may worsen her mental status. There is a risk of delirium or further decline in cognitive function.

4. Myocardial infarction: The patient has a history of acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is currently on medications to manage ischemia. There is a risk of recurrent cardiac events if not properly managed.

5. Acute renal failure: Although resolved at the time of the progress note, there is still a risk of renal dysfunction due to factors like seps"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with dementia who was admitted with hypovolemic shock and is now experiencing persistent respiratory failure. She has a history of underlying dementia and other comorbidities, which have contributed to her debilitated state. The family has refused tracheostomy and the plan is for potentially terminal extubation today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current condition of respiratory failure puts her at risk for further complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's initial presentation of hypovolemic shock indicates a significant decrease in blood volume, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not properly managed.
3. Metabolic alkalosis: The administration of acetazolamide for metabolic alkalosis may further complicate the patient's condition, especially if there are underlying electrolyte imbalances.
4. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay, she is at an increased risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobility and the use of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT, which can potentially lead to a life-threatening PE.
6. Stress ulcers: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis due to her"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with dementia who was admitted to the ICU with hypovolemic shock. She is currently experiencing persistent respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient's family has refused tracheostomy and plans for terminal extubation have been made. The patient's medical history includes underlying dementia and multiple comorbidities, which have left her in a debilitated state.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of respiratory failure can lead to further complications such as hypoxemia (low oxygen levels), hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide levels), and acidosis (imbalanced pH levels). If not managed appropriately, it may progress to respiratory arrest.

2. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, she is at risk of developing VAP. This can be caused by bacteria infecting the lungs due to the use of the ventilator.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and critical illness increase her risk for developing blood clots in the deep veins of her legs. These clots can potentially dislodge and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism.

4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the ventilator can lead to the development of pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores. These ulcers can become"
