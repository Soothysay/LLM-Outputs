   Shortly after patient was evaluated he underwent a diagnostic
   paracentesis. After this procedure he began vomiting blood. He likely
   aspirated and developed respiratory distress requiring intubation. His
   CXR shows new bilateral infiltrates. His vent was adjusted to improve
   his acidosis. During these events he lost an IV and a right femoral CVL
   was placed. IJ access was avoided because of his active vomiting. The
   GI service was alerted and he will undergo an EGD to evaluate what is
   likely a variceal bleed. He is receiving octreotide and a protonix
   drip. He has received 6 unit of PRBC
s and 2 more will be transfused
   because of ongoing hematemesis and blood loss anemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male who was found unresponsive on the floor of his home by neighbors. He reported no oral intake other than water in the past few days, and his blood pressure was measured in the 80s by the EMTs. In the emergency room, his blood pressure remained in the 80s/40s, and his heart rate was 114. The patient had a positive guaiac test and was given 6.5 liters of intravenous fluids, which stabilized his blood pressure. A head CT scan showed atrophy, and an abdominal CT scan revealed diffuse colonic thickening consistent with colitis, for which he was given ciprofloxacin.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, ascites presumably due to cirrhosis, and has undergone paracentesis. He has no known drug allergies, and his last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin at 09:00 PM on [**2175-4-6**].

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue, anemia, and chest pain. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), heart rate of 110-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 82/49 mmHg to 108/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male who was found unresponsive by neighbors and brought to the emergency room. He reported no oral intake in a few days and had a blood pressure of the 80's/40's with a heart rate of 114. A head CT showed atrophy, and an abdominal CT revealed diffuse colonic thickening consistent with colitis. The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, ascites, and anemia. He has been receiving IV fluids and ciprofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates a possible volume contraction, especially considering his history of cirrhosis. This could be due to fluid loss from vomiting, diarrhea, or diuretic use. Volume resuscitation is necessary to address this issue.
2. Cirrhosis: The presence of ascites, shrunken and nodular liver on the abdominal CT, along with the history of EtOH abuse, suggests possible cirrhosis. Monitoring liver function and considering liver transplantation may be important.
3. Colitis: The diffuse colonic thickening seen on the abdominal CT raises the suspicion of colitis. Ischemic colitis is a consideration, and further investigation is needed. Volume resuscitation should continue as part of the management.
4. Anemia: The patient has a guaiac positive result, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and appropriate transfusion"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension. He was found unresponsive by neighbors and had no oral intake except for water in the past few days. In the emergency room, his blood pressure was in the 80's/40's, and he had a heart rate of 114. A head CT showed atrophy, and an abdominal CT indicated diffuse colonic thickening consistent with colitis. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and ascites due to cirrhosis, for which he had a paracentesis. His vital signs are currently unstable, with a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), heart rate of 110-117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/62 to 82/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is on ventilator support in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating possible volume contraction in the setting of cirrhosis. Sepsis is less likely, so continued volume resuscitation is necessary.
2. Cirrhosis: The patient likely has cirrhosis, as suggested by shrunken, nodular liver on abdominal CT and ascites. Further evaluation with hepatic serologies and ultrasound is needed.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Variceal bleeding: The patient has a history of chronic EtOH abuse and presents with large variceal bleed. This complication can lead to significant blood loss and hypotension.

2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient has ascites and a positive diagnostic paracentesis, indicating SBP. This infection can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status has improved with IVF hydration but is also likely contributing to confusion due to encephalopathy. Elevated ammonia levels and asterixis on exam suggest hepatic encephalopathy.

4. Colitis: The patient has leukocytosis and CT findings suggestive of colitis. This may be related to infectious or inflammatory causes, and further evaluation is needed.

5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely multifactorial, including chronic liver disease, chronic EtOH abuse, splenic sequestration, colitis, and now IVF hydration.

6. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is likely due to hypovolemia and excessive free water intake. Close monitoring and correction are necessary.

7. Cirrhosis: The patient has chronic liver disease with physical exam findings, CT findings, and abnormal laboratory values consistent with cirrhosis.

8. EtOH abuse:"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic EtOH abuse and depression who presented with confusion and hypotension, along with ascites, colitis, anemia, and hyponatremia. The patient's condition has rapidly deteriorated, leading to the need for intubation and invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress caused by aspiration of blood.

The patient's medical history indicates chronic liver disease, as evidenced by physical exam findings and CT scan showing nodular liver and ascites. Laboratory results also suggest cirrhosis, with elevated INR and low albumin levels. The patient's MELD score is 22, and his DF is 77.

The patient's current condition includes gastrointestinal bleeding (variceal bleed), spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hypotension, confusion (likely due to hepatic encephalopathy), electrolyte and fluid disorder, and colitis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of hepatic encephalopathy, further gastrointestinal bleeding, development of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), sepsis secondary to SBP or other infections, respiratory complications due to intubation and mechanical ventilation, and potential complications from the insertion of central venous lines.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction and requires close monitoring and management of his various medical issues. Prompt evaluation and treatment of complications are necessary to improve the patient's prognosis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with chronic alcohol abuse and depression, presenting with confusion, hypotension, ascites, colitis, anemia, and hyponatremia. He has a history of chronic EtOH abuse and depression. The patient is currently intubated and sedated due to respiratory distress. He has undergone paracentesis, nasal swab, urine culture, and endoscopic evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract (EGD). The EGD showed blood in the esophagus and varices, but banding could not be performed. The patient has received 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and octreotide. His condition is complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Variceal bleeding: The patient has large varices, which are at high risk for re-bleeding and further gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is at risk for further deterioration.
3. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient has evidence of SBP, and there is a risk of recurrence and progression.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to his immunocompromised state and invasive procedures.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with chronic EtOH abuse and depression who presented with confusion, hypotension, ascites, colitis, anemia, and hyponatremia. He now has SBP and a large variceal bleed with a Linton tube in place. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Variceal bleeding: The patient is experiencing a large variceal bleed, which is a significant risk factor for further bleeding and potential death. Close monitoring and endoscopy are necessary to control the bleeding and prevent rebleeding.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, indicating impaired blood clotting function. This is likely due to liver dysfunction and ongoing blood loss. It is crucial to monitor the patient's coagulation status and provide appropriate blood products, such as FFP and platelets, to maintain adequate clotting.

3. SBP (Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis): The patient has evidence of SBP, as indicated by the presence of ascitic fluid infection. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and the patient should be monitored for signs of worsening infection or sepsis.

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be attributed to several factors, including chronic liver disease, fluid loss from gastrointestinal bleeding, and sepsis secondary to SBP. Intravascular volume resuscitation with"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic ethanol abuse and depression. He presented with confusion, hypotension, ascites, colitis, anemia, and hyponatremia. The patient has been found in squalor and is now intubated and sedated due to respiratory distress.

The patient's condition is complicated by multiple medical issues, including gastrointestinal bleeding (variceal bleed), coagulopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hypotension, low urine output, bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, confusion (likely related to hepatic encephalopathy), colitis, anemia, hyponatremia, and cirrhosis with portal hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Variceal bleeding: The patient has experienced a large variceal bleed, which is a potentially life-threatening complication of portal hypertension in cirrhosis. He has received Octreotide and a Linton tube has been placed to control the bleeding. The liver team is aware and plans to re-scope the patient this morning.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is still elevated despite receiving FFP and vit K. The patient's calcium level is low, likely due to transfusion. He needs to be transfused with HCT >30, receive FFP and PLT with PRBCs, with a goal PLT >100. Recheck fibrinogen levels and consider cryoprecipitate if <100.
3. SBP: The patient has been diagnosed with SBP and is being treated with Ceftriaxone. Complete albumin dose for primary prophylaxis of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is also being administered.
4. Hypotension: The patient's baseline blood pressure is likely low due to chronic liver disease. He requires continued albumin and IVF hydration PRN, monitoring of blood cultures, and continuation of Ceftriaxone for SBP.
5. Low urine output: The patient has low urine output, possibly due to hypovolemia, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or abdominal compartment syndrome. Bladder pressures are being monitored, and a bladder scan will be performed. The patient will be vol-resuscitated with normal saline if bladder scan is normal.
6. Bilateral infiltrates: The patient has bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, which may be due to aspiration pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, or ARDS. The patient is being placed on ARDSnet ventilation and will be closely monitored.
7. Confusion: The patient's confusion is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. He will receive lactulose after ammonia levels are cleared by Hepatology. Therapeutic paracentesis will also be performed once cleared by Hepatology.
8. Colitis: The patient has colitis, which may be related to ascitic fluid. Blood cultures sent in"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of variceal bleed. The patient has a history of presumed cirrhosis and presented with large-volume hematemesis. 

The patient underwent paracentesis, nasal swab, and urine culture. They were also started on invasive ventilation, multi-lumen, and [Last Name (un)] insertion. The patient received resuscitation with 8 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC), 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 9 liters of crystalloid.

The patient's vital signs indicate hypothermia with a current temperature of 32.9°C (91.2°F) and low blood pressure ranging from 74 to 98 mmHg. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate set at 22 breaths per minute and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.31, indicating acidosis.

The patient's laboratory results show thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 93,000/mm³ and an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 13.9 K/uL. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 18 U/L and aspartate aminot"

 HCT has not bumped appropriately despite
   numerous transfusions. Now s/p banding and [**Last Name (un) 466**] tube in place.
   Liver team aware and following
   - continue Octreotide, Protonix gtts
   - continue Abx as below
   - [**Last Name (un) 466**] in place
   - appreciate Hepatology recs
   # Coagulopathy: INR still elevated, has received FFP and vit K. In
   addition, pt
s Ca is low in the setting of transfusion.
   -  transfuse HCT >30, will give 2 units now
   - transfuse FFP and PLT with pRBC
s, goal PLT>100
   - recheck fibrinogen, consider crycoprecipitate if <100
   - follow ionized calcium
   .
   #. SBP - Pt w/ SBP on diagnostic paracentesis done prior to
   hematemesis.
   - vanc/zosyn
   - complete albumin dose (1.5g/kg day 1, 1g/kg day 3) for ppx of HRS
   - f/u Cx data
   .
   #. Hypotension
 Ddx sepsis vs bleeding. Improved with IVF hydration in
   ED, with improvement in mental status. Intravascularly dry on exam, has
   not been taking POs well recently. Also consider contribution from SBP.
   Baseline BP likely low given obvious chronic liver disease as below.
   - continue levophed, UOP>20 cc/hr, MAP>60

   vol rescus, ascitis,etc) vs ARDS. Pa)2/Fi02= 100
   - initially on ARDSnet  ventilation: 6cc/kg, but with improvement in
   CXR and ratio, likely not ARDS
   .
   #. Confusion - Improved with IVF hydration as above, but also likely
   contribution from encephalopathy given mildly elevated ammonia but more
   importantly asterixis on exam. Now intubated / sedated.
   - continue albumin / IVF hydration and correction of hypotension as
   above
   - restart lactulose after cleared by Hepatology
   - will need therapeutic paracentesis as well once cleared by Hepatology
   .
   #. Colitis - Noted on CT, also with leukocytosis but no fever or other
   abdominal symptoms. Also w/o findings on exam. Distribution more
   concerning for infectious or inflammatory rather than ischemic. No
   recent illness, sick contacts, travel, or antibiotic use. CT does not
   appear particularly worrisome, more likely related to ascitic fluid.
   - f/u blood cx sent in ED
   - GI aware, will follow
   .
   #. Anemia - Likely multifactorial [**1-16**] chronic liver disease, chronic
   EtOH abuse, splenic sequestration, colitis, and now IVF hydration. Also
   Guaiac positive stools, and now variceal bleeding.
   - txf threshold 25-30 for now
   - maintain active T&C, large bore PIVs; right femoral CVL
   - cont Octreotide / PPI gtts
   - serial Hcts

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old man with chronic alcohol abuse and depression. He presented with confusion, hypotension, ascites, colitis, anemia, and hyponatremia. The patient now has a large variceal bleed with an IUD in place, ongoing hypotension, and oliguria/anuria. He has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, coagulopathy, SBP, and liver cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Variceal bleeding: The patient has a large variceal bleed, which is a serious complication of portal hypertension in liver cirrhosis. It requires immediate medical attention to control bleeding and stabilize the patient.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR and low platelet count, indicating impaired blood clotting function. This increases the risk of bleeding, especially in the context of ongoing variceal bleeding.

3. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has evidence of SBP, which is an infection of the ascitic fluid. It is a common and life-threatening complication in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics and albumin administration.

4. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which may be due to blood loss from variceal bleeding, sepsis, or heart failure. It requires aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic liver disease and portal hypertension, presenting with respiratory failure and gastrointestinal bleeding. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Despite receiving blood products, his hemoglobin concentration has not increased. He is experiencing hypotension and requires vasopressor support. There is evidence of hepatomegaly with stigmata of chronic liver disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to the patient's chronic liver disease, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can manifest as confusion, altered mental status, and changes in personality.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's oliguria/anuria may indicate acute kidney injury, which can be caused by hypotension, sepsis, or the use of nephrotoxic medications.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever may suggest an infection, which could lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
4. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's immobilization and underlying hypercoagulable state, there is a risk of developing a pulmonary embolism, which can cause sudden onset of shortness of breath and chest pain.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the presence of melena or hematemesis may indicate ongoing bleeding, which requires close monitoring and potential endoscopic"

   also with ascites, colitis, anemia, and hyponatremia; now with SBP and
   large variceal bleed with [**Last Name (un) 466**] tube in place.
   .
   #. Variceal bleeding
 HD stable, but HCT still falling 34->27.
   [**Last Name (un) 466**] tube in place. Liver team aware, to re-scope this morning.
   - continue Octreotide, Protonix gtts
   - continue Abx as below
   - [**Last Name (un) 466**] in place, EGD today
   - appreciate Hepatology recs
   # Coagulopathy: INR still elevated, has received FFP and vit K. In
   addition, pt
s Ca is low in the setting of transfusion.
   -  transfuse HCT >30, will give 2 units now
   - transfuse FFP and PLT with pRBC
s, goal PLT>100
   - recheck fibrinogen, consider crycoprecipitate if <100
   - follow ionized calcium
   .
   #. SBP - Pt w/ SBP on diagnostic paracentesis done prior to
   hematemesis.
   - continue Ceftriaxone
   - complete albumin dose (1.5g/kg day 1, 1g/kg day 3) for ppx of HRS
   - f/u Cx data
   .
   #. Hypotension - Improved with IVF hydration in ED, with improvement in
   mental status. Intravascularly dry on exam, has not been taking POs
   well recently. Also consider contribution from SBP. Baseline BP likely
   low given obvious chronic liver disease as below.
   - cont albumin / IVF hydration PRN
   - f/u blood cx sent in ED
   - cont Ceftriaxone for SBP as above
   .
   # Low urine outpt: hypovolemia, ATN vs abd compartment syndrome.
   Bladder pressures now 17
   - bladder scan
   - monitor bladder pressure
   - monitor cr for ATN
   - vol rescuscitate if bladder scan nl: normal saline
   .
   # Bilateral infiltrates: Aspiration pneumonitis vs pulmonary edema (
   vol rescus, ascitis,etc) vs ARDS. Pa)2/Fi02= 100
   - ARDSnet  ventilation: 6cc/kg
   .
   #. Confusion - Improved with IVF hydration as above, but also likely
   contribution from encephalopathy given mildly elevated ammonia but more
   importantly asterixis on exam. Now intubated / sedated.
   - continue albumin / IVF hydration and correction of hypotension as
   above
   - restart lactulose after cleared by Hepatology
   - will need therapeutic paracentesis as well once cleared by Hepatology
   .
   #. Colitis - Noted on CT, also with leukocytosis but no fever or other
   abdominal symptoms. Also w/o findings on exam. Distribution more
   concerning for infectious or inflammatory rather than ischemic. No
   recent illness, sick contacts, travel, or antibiotic use. CT does not
   appear particularly worrisome, more likely related to ascitic fluid.
   - f/u blood cx sent in ED
   - cont CTX as above for SBP
   - GI aware, will follow
   .
   #. Anemia - Likely multifactorial [**1-16**] chronic liver disease, chronic
   EtOH abuse, splenic sequestration, colitis, and now IVF hydration. Also
   Guaiac positive stools, and now variceal bleeding.
   - txf threshold 25-30 for now
   - maintain active T&C, large bore PIVs; right femoral CVL
   - cont Octreotide / PPI gtts
   - serial Hcts
   - GI and Hepatology aware
   .
   #. Hyponatremia - Likely [**1-16**] hypovolemia as intravascularly dry on
   exam, but also with contribution of drinking lots of free water.
   Improving.
   - continue to follow
   .
   #. Cirrhosis - Pt with long chronic daily EtOH use, physical exam
   findings of chronic liver disease and portal hypertension, and CT
   showing nodular liver and ascites. Labs also c/w cirrhosis, w/ elevated
   INR and low albumin. MELD 22, DF 77.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 48-year-old male with chronic alcohol abuse and depression, presenting with confusion, hypotension, ascites, colitis, anemia, and hyponatremia. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, pneumonia, aspiration, gastrointestinal bleeding, and cirrhosis. The patient's condition is critical, and he is experiencing multiple medical complications.

1. Variceal bleeding: The patient has a large variceal bleed with a [**Last Name (un) 466**] tube in place. Liver team is aware and plans to re-scope this morning. The patient is receiving octreotide and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR despite receiving fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K. Additionally, the patient's calcium level is low after transfusion. The plan is to transfuse packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to maintain a hematocrit (HCT) above 30, give FFP and platelets with PRBCs to achieve a platelet count above 100,000/mL, recheck fibrinogen levels, and consider cryoprecipitate if below 100.

3. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient has SBP and is receiving ceftriaxone. Complete albumin dose is being given for primary prophylaxis of hepatorenal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with presumed cirrhosis and variceal bleeding. They were admitted to the ICU for stabilization and treatment. The patient received 12 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 3 cryoprecipitate units. Overnight blood pressures started to drop, so the PEEP was decreased, fluids were administered, sedation was reduced, and moderate-dose levophed was initiated. The patient's bladder pressures were relieved through paracentesis, and an arterial line was started.

The patient has no known drug allergies. They were on ciprofloxacin until 04/06/2175, ceftriaxone until 04/08/2175, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) until 04/08/2175. The patient is currently receiving octreotide, norepinephrine, propofol, and pantoprazole (Protonix). They are also receiving chlorhexidine, thiamine, vancomycin, and Zosyn in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 36.8°C, current temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate (HR) of 115 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 98/56 mmHg to 86/"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of variceal bleed. The patient has a history of presumed cirrhosis and was found to have large-volume bleeding with esophageal and gastric varices. The patient received octreotide, albumin, and blood transfusions. The patient's blood pressure started to drop, and the PEEP was decreased. The patient's sedation was reduced, and they were transitioned to moderate dose levophed. Albumin helped with the pressor requirement. An ultrasound, endoscopy, and paracentesis were performed. The patient's allergies are unknown. The patient is currently on several medications including octreotide, norepinephrine, propofol, and pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs are stable, but the respiratory support is required. The patient has an arterial line in place and has received multiple blood transfusions. The patient's labs show elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function. The assessment and plan include management of variceal bleed, sepsis/hypotension, respiratory failure, presumed cirrhosis, metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, and renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: Variceal bleeding can be unpredictable, and there is a risk of re-bleeding even after initial control.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to the"
