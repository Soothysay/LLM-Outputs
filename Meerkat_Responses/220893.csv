   # Hypotension:  Most likely secondary hypovolumia given extensive
   surgical procedure with open abdomen, though with elevated white count
   will cover empirically for intra-abdominal infection
   - IVF boluses to keep CVP 9-11
   - Central line [**Last Name (un) **] place
   - continue antibiotic coverage with vanc/zosyn
   - hold hypertensive meds
   - continue current dilaudid rate as his pressure is tolerating this
   level of pain meds and his pain is currently well controlled

","The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of stable ventricular tachycardia, stomach cancer post gastrectomy, and appendiceal cancer post appendectomy/partial colectomy/appendectomy. He presented for an elective right flank wound debridement but underwent exploratory laparotomy, small bowel resection, fistulogram, and revision of ileocolic anastomosis due to colocolonic fistula and bowel involvement.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and has low blood pressure. This may be secondary to hypovolemia due to the extensive surgical procedure with an open abdomen. There is also concern for intra-abdominal infection, so empirical antibiotic coverage has been initiated.
- IV fluid boluses will be given to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) between 9-11.
- A central line will be placed.
- Antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam will continue.
- Hypertensive medications will be held.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient may have ARF, most likely prerenal/acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension. Aggressive hydration was administered yesterday with an increase in urine output, and the patient has remained stable. Bolus IV fluids will be given for low CVP and low urine output. Ur"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, previous ventricular tachycardia, stomach cancer treated with gastrectomy, and appendiceal cancer treated with appendectomy and partial colectomy. The patient presented for an elective right flank wound debridement but underwent exploratory laparotomy, small bowel resection, fistulogram, and revision of ileocolic anastomosis due to a colo-cutaneous fistula and bowel involvement.

The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, which is likely secondary to hypovolemia caused by the extensive surgical procedure with an open abdomen. The white blood cell count is elevated, so empirical coverage for intra-abdominal infection is being initiated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of stable ventricular tachycardia, systolic heart failure (LVEF 30%), and previous stomach and appendiceal cancer surgeries. He presented for elective right flank wound debridement but underwent exploratory laparotomy, small bowel resection, fistulogram, and revision of ileocolic anastomosis due to colocolonic fistula and bowel involvement. The patient experienced hypotension post-surgery, which is likely secondary to hypovolemia from the extensive surgical procedure with an open abdomen. Other potential complications include acute renal failure (ARF) due to hypotension, which is most likely prerenal or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient is currently being aggressively hydrated, and nephrotoxins are being avoided. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is most likely secondary to hypovolemia due to the extensive surgical procedure with an open abdomen. Close monitoring of vital signs, IV fluid administration to maintain CVP within the target range, and appropriate antibiotic coverage are essential in managing this condition.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is most likely prerenal or ATN due to hypotension. Aggressive hydration to ensure adequate urine output, avoiding nephrotoxins, and regular monitoring of renal function parameters are important in managing this"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, stomach cancer post gastrectomy, and appendiceal cancer post appendectomy and partial colectomy. He presented for an elective right flank wound debridement but underwent exploratory laparotomy, small bowel resection, fistulogram, and revision of ileocolic anastomosis due to colo-cutaneous fistula and bowel involvement.

The patient is currently hypotensive and has a high white blood cell count (WBC) of 28, indicating possible infection. He has been started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) antibiotics. His mean arterial pressure (MAPs) are in the 60's with good urine output (UOP). Hematocrit (HCT) has dropped, likely due to dilutional effects from fluid resuscitation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate (HR) of 99 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 92/57 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97% on nasal cannula. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm (SR).

The patient's physical examination reveals a pleasant and well-appearing individual in no acute distress. His general appearance is within normal limits,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old man with a medical history of systolic heart failure, stable ventricular tachycardia, stomach cancer, and appendiceal cancer. He presented for an elective right flank wound debridement but underwent exploratory laparotomy, small bowel resection, fistulogram, and revision of ileocolic anastomosis due to colocolonic fistula and bowel involvement.

The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, likely secondary to hypovolemia due to the extensive surgical procedure with an open abdomen. He has an elevated white blood cell count, which will be covered empirically for intra-abdominal infection. The plan includes IV fluid boluses to keep central venous pressure (CVP) at 9-11, placement of a central line, continuation of antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), holding hypertensive medications, and continuing the current dilaudid rate as his pressure is tolerating this level of pain medications.

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF), most likely prerenal or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension. The plan is to aggressively hydrate the patient with an increase in urine output (UOP) and monitor urine electrolytes, aiming to avoid nephrotoxins.

After the exploratory laparotomy, the patient's wound care will be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of systolic heart failure, stable ventricular tachycardia, stomach cancer, and appendiceal cancer. He presented for elective right flank wound debridement but underwent exploratory laparotomy, small bowel resection, fistulogram, and revision of ileocolic anastomosis due to colocolonic fistula and bowel involvement. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being managed for several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which is most likely secondary to hypovolemia due to the extensive surgical procedure and open abdomen. Infection coverage has been initiated empirically due to the elevated white count.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is likely experiencing prerenal or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension. Aggressive hydration has been administered, and measures are being taken to prevent further kidney damage.

3. Surgical Procedure Complications: The patient recently underwent exploratory laparotomy, small bowel resection, fistulogram, and revision of ileocolic anastomosis. Wound care and bowel rest are being implemented as per the primary surgical team.

4. Chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure. A transthoracic echocardiogram (T"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, stable ventricular tachycardia, stomach cancer status post gastrectomy, and appendiceal cancer status post appendectomy. He presented for elective right flank wound debridement but underwent exploratory laparotomy, small bowel resection, fistulogram, and revision of ileocolic anastomosis due to colocolonic fistula and bowel involvement. This procedure was complicated by hypotension requiring admission to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is most likely experiencing secondary hypovolemia due to the extensive surgical procedure with an open abdomen. There is also a possibility of bleeding in the setting of recent surgery. The current management includes IVF boluses to keep CVP between 9-11, central line placement, continuation of antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, holding hypertensive medications, and continuing current dilaudid rate as his pressure is tolerating this level of pain medication.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is most likely prerenal or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypotension. The management includes continuing PRN hydration using CVP and urine output to guide therapy, avoiding nephrotoxins, and monitoring renal function closely.
3. Anemia: The recent drop in Hct"

   Assessment and Plan
   Shock
 likely hypovolemic +/- septic, no evidence of bleeding based on
   Hct. Currently being bolused with IVF. Will send cultures, CXR and
   start broad spectrum abx. Looks quite comfortable. If BP does not
   improve after next [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] insert CVC +/- a line. At risk of
   pulmonary edema given CHF. Can aim for MAP>60 given cardiomyopathy.
   Baseline SBP ~110.
   Renal insufficiency
 likely prerenal. Will follow.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5 C (99.5 F), current temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), heart rate of 93 bpm with a range of 91-103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/63 mmHg to 115/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute with a range of 10-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance with no acute distress or signs of being overweight, obese, thin, anxious, or diaphoretic. The patient's eyes are PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), with no conjunctival pallor, sclera edema, or abnormal dentition. The patient's head and neck examination is also unremarkable.

Cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds with no murmurs or abnormal findings. Peripheral vascular examination reveals normal pulses in all extremities. Respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of systolic heart failure, stable ventricular tachycardia, stomach cancer (s/p gastrectomy), and appendiceal cancer (s/p appendectomy/partial colectomy/appendectomy). He presented for elective right flank wound debridement but underwent exploratory laparotomy, small bowel resection, fistulogram, and revision of ileocolic anastomosis due to colo-cutaneous fistula and bowel involvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: Most likely secondary to hypovolemia given extensive surgical procedure with an open abdomen. Covered empirically for intra-abdominal infection.
2. Renal Failure: Hypovolemia. Receiving fluid repletion.
3. HIT+: Fondaparinux for prophylaxis.
4. Anemia: Unclear etiology. Considering abdominal imaging (CT) due to possible phlebotomy, but doubt hemolysis.
5. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): Most likely prerenal/ATN due to hypotension. Aggressively hydrated yesterday with increased UOP, remained stable. Will continue low CVP and low UOP, avoid nephrotoxins.
6. S/P Ex Lap (Postoperative): Wound care as per primary surgical team, NPO with bowel rest, all diet changes as per primary surgical team.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of colonic-cutaneous fistula and bowel involvement, who underwent exploratory laparotomy, small bowel resection, fistulogram, and revision of ileocolic anastomosis. The patient is currently in the ICU for shock (likely hypovolemic +/- septic) and renal failure.

The patient has been clinically improved with surgical treatment, volume resuscitation, and antimicrobials. The renal failure is attributed to hypovolemia, and the patient is receiving repletion. The urine electrolytes show very low sodium, suggesting a prerenal etiology. Nephrotoxins should be avoided.

The patient also has anemia with unclear etiology, and abdominal imaging (CT) is recommended. Hemolysis is doubtful. The patient has a choloy-cutaneous fistula, and wound care as per the primary surgical team is advised. The patient is NPO with bowel rest, and all diet changes are per the primary surgical team.

Optimize pain management is also recommended, along with ICU care. The patient's nutrition and glycemic control should be monitored.
