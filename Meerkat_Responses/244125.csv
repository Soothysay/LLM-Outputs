   Assessment and Plan
   87M h/o Alzheimer's dementia presented with pneumonia now with fever,
   tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxia.
   .
   # SIRS/Sepsis:  Most likely secondary to PNA as evidenced by CXR right
   sided infiltrate.  Likely secondary to chronic aspiration with possible
   superimposed bacterial process.
   - s/p intubation yesterday for airway protection and frequent
   suctioning
   - Continue to trend lactate, fever curve, WBC
   - f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures, currently no growth
   - continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/levoflox for empiric coverage, likely will be able
   to discontinue vancomycin
   - frequent suctioning
   - Nebs prn
   .
   # Tachycardia: MAT vs. afib. Likely being driven by inflammatory state.
   Concern for evolving sepsis and HD stable at present. Tolerate mildly
   elevated rate for now, but if sustained would treat.
   - [**Last Name (LF) 4022**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] get EKG today
   - Treat infection per above
   - Will treat with metoprolol 12.5mg TID
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Increasing this AM to 147, give D5W and check PM Na+.
   -          increase tube feed flushes to 200cc q6h
   -          will place Nutrition consult for tube feed recs
   .
   #. ARF: Resolved to baseline, prerenal etiology. Monitor daily.
   -          PM set of lytes
   #. Guaiac positive stool: No known h/o GI bleeding, does have GERD per
   report. Brown G+ stool prior to transfer. HD stable. Maintain T&S,
   PIVs. [**Hospital1 **] Hct. PPI IV bid.
   - PM CBC
   .
   #. Dementia: continue outpatient sertraline and namenda.
   .
   # FEN: NPO x meds, replete lytes prn
   # Access: PIV x 2 (18, 20)
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], heparin sc tid, bowel regimen

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with Alzheimer's dementia who presented with pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia. The patient was intubated yesterday for airway protection and is currently on invasive ventilation.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient likely has sepsis secondary to pneumonia, as evidenced by a right-sided infiltrate on the chest X-ray. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, and blood cultures and sputum cultures are pending. The patient is currently receiving vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metoprolol for empiric coverage.

Other findings include hypernatremia, acute renal failure (ARF) that has resolved to baseline, and a guaiac positive stool. The patient has a history of dementia and is being treated with sertraline and namenda. The patient's electrolytes need to be monitored, and they require repletion as needed. The patient has two peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines in place.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, pneumonia, ARF, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's condition needs close monitoring, and appropriate interventions should be implemented based on the progress of the illness."

The patient has allergies to penicillins and sulfa, as well as an unknown reaction to Flomax (Tamsulosin Hcl). The last doses of antibiotics given were Levofloxacin on 01/19/2022 at 12:18 PM, Meropenem on 01/20/2022 at 04:00 AM, and Vancomycin on 01/20/2022 at 06:00 AM.

Infusions include Fentanyl at 50 mcg/hour and Midazolam (Versed) at 1 mg/hour. Other ICU medications include Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis) started on 01/19/2022 at 04:32 PM, and Pantoprazole (Protonix) started on 01/19/2022 at 08:00 PM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.8 F (38.8 C), blood pressure ranging from 127/55 mmHg to 160/78 mmHg, heart rate ranging from 90 to 179 bpm, respiratory rate ranging from 17 to 43 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

The patient's weight remains unchanged at 85.4 kg. Total fluid intake is 2835 mL, with 983 mL given as IV fluids and 850 mL given as PO fluids. Total output includes 680 mL of urine and 415 mL of blood products. 

Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with a ventilator set at a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%. 

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular pulses not assessed, skin not assessed, and neurologic status not assessed. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.0 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 1.5 to 3.2 mg/dL, and elevated troponin levels ranging from 0.04 to 0.06 ng/mL. Other lab values include hemoglobin levels ranging from 12.1 to 34.5 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 186 to 246 K/uL, blood glucose levels ranging from 118 to"

   # Tachycardia: MAT vs. afib. Likely being driven by inflammatory state.
   Concern for evolving sepsis and HD stable at present. Tolerate mildly
   elevated rate for now, but if sustained would treat.
   - Tele
   - Treat infection per above
   - If clearly Afib consider anticoagulation but defer for now due to

- The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of Alzheimer's dementia who presented with pneumonia.
- The patient now has a fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia.
- The patient is suspected to have sepsis with the lung being the likely source, possibly due to chronic aspiration and a superimposed bacterial process.
- Other potential causes for the acute decline include pulmonary embolism (PE), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and flash pulmonary edema.
- The patient's blood cultures, sputum, and urine are being sent for culture.
- Antibiotic therapy has been changed to cover a broader range of bacteria.
- Frequent suctioning of the airway is being performed.
- The patient is receiving respiratory support through intubation and mechanical ventilation.
- Tachycardia may be due to an inflammatory state or atrial fibrillation.
- Hypernatremia is present, and the patient is receiving D5W to replete fluids.
- Acute renal failure has resolved to baseline, likely due to pre-renal causes.
- Guaiac positive stool indicates possible gastrointestinal bleeding, but no known history of GI bleeding is present.
- The patient has dementia and is on outpatient sertraline and namenda.
- The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) for now and is receiving IV fluids as needed.
- The patient has two peripheral IV lines"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of allergies to penicillins, sulfa, and unknown reaction to Flomax. The patient was admitted to the ICU with tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, pneumonia (community-acquired), and acute renal failure. Vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 116/62 mmHg to 144/94 mmHg, heart rate between 77 and 119 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and ABG results of pH 7.39, PaCO2 40 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 145. The patient has received various medications, including fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications for this patient may include:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient is at risk of developing nosocomial pneumonia due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and the use of central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of stress ulcers.
4. Ventilator-associated events: The patient's use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of ventilator-associated events such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's pre-existing acute renal failure, along with potential nephrotoxic medications, can worsen kidney function and lead to acute kidney injury.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note, and there may be additional factors or considerations not mentioned here. It is important to consult with the healthcare team for a comprehensive assessment and management plan for the patient."

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of Alzheimer's dementia who presented with pneumonia and required intubation for airway protection. He is currently tolerating CPAP and has persistent fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. The patient's condition remains unchanged following an aspiration event. His white blood cell count is elevated, and there are concerns about superinfection. He also has tachycardia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure (pre-renal azotemia), and a guaiac-positive stool. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is being closely monitored in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Superinfection: The patient's persistent fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible superinfection, which may require adjustment of antibiotic therapy.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and aspiration event, there is a risk of developing VAP, which would require appropriate antibiotic coverage.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central lines increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin should be considered.
4. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness can predispose the patient to stress ulcers, which may require prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to eat orally and the need for prolonged mechanical"

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of Alzheimer's dementia who presented with pneumonia and is now intubated for airway protection. He has been experiencing fevers and required re-intubation due to hypoxia. The patient's right-sided infiltrate on the chest X-ray has improved today, but he remains febrile with no clear response to broad antibiotic coverage. There is concern for aspiration pneumonitis as the etiology of pneumonia. Superinfection is also a concern.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.5°F (39.2°C), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/49 to 152/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The patient is receiving various medications including fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and platelet count, elevated creatinine level indicating acute kidney injury, and abnormal liver function tests. Urine analysis indicates pre-renal azotemia. Chest X-ray shows decreased opacity on the left side, while the right side remains unchanged.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of Alzheimer's dementia who presented with pneumonia and required intubation for airway protection. He is currently in the ICU due to hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonitis. The patient's CXR showed marginal improvement overnight, and he was placed back on assisted ventilation due to lack of responsiveness.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F (38.8°C), blood pressure ranging from 89/44 mmHg to 136/71 mmHg, heart rate between 83-119 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and impaired skin integrity. He has been treated with multiple antibiotics for pneumonia but has not shown a response. Blood cultures and sputum cultures were obtained, and no growth was observed. It is planned to discontinue antibiotics and restart them if positive cultures are identified.

The patient also presented with hypotension, which was initially thought to be related to metoprolol administration for tachycardia. Metoprolol has been discontinued, and fluid resuscitation is ongoing. The possibility of central access and arterial line placement may be required if hypotension persists.

The patient is also dealing with hypernatremia, pre-renal azotemia, and guaiac positive"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of Alzheimer's dementia who presented with pneumonia and is now intubated for airway protection. The patient's condition remains unchanged despite aspiration events. Persistent fevers and no clear response to broad antibiotic coverage suggest a potential superinfection. 

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia with a heart rate between 83-119 bpm, hypotension with a blood pressure ranging from 89/44 mmHg to 136/71 mmHg, respiratory rate between 20-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on the ventilator. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. 

The patient is currently on multiple medications including metoprolol, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, pantoprazole, and midazolam among others. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include: 
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia.
2. Superinfection despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.
3. Tachycardia, possibly driven by the inflammatory state.
4. Hypernatremia, which is improving.
5. Acute renal failure (pre-renal azotemia by FeNa).
6. Guaiac positive stool, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Dementia management with sertr"

   87M h/o Alzheimer's dementia presented with pneumonia intubated for
   airway protection.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:   Secondary to Aspiration, initially
   thought pneumonia, but no response to antibiotics, therefore more
   likely aspiration pneumonitis.  The patient
s CXR is only marginally
   improved overnight.  Patient is back on AC ventilation given lack of
   responsiveness.
   - s/p re-intubation
   - Continue to trend fever curve, WBC, and discontinue antibiotics today
   after prolonged course of vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro discontinued on [**1-23**]
   - f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures, currently no growth, if
   develops positive cultures will restart antibiotics directed towards
   specific pathogen
   - continue frequent suctioning
   - continue nebs prn
   - Continue lasix drip to attempt to diurese patient
   - Attempt PS trial
   #  Tachycardic:  Resolved. The patient became hypotensive after
   starting metoprolol for tachycardia  yesterday.   Will also continue to
   fluid resuscitate as needed, but given length of stay very positive,
   will attempt lasix drip as likely irritable from fluid overload and
   cardiac distension.
   - Will give trial of 5 mg metoprolol and transition to PO if tolerated
   -          PIVs for now placed by IV team.
   -          Given current care, will attempt PICC line, but if unable
   will not escalate to central line
   -          Attempt to capture tachycardia with EKG
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Unable to reliably follow given difficult access
   -          Discontinue maintenance fluids now
   -          Restart tube feeds with free water flushes.
   #. ARF: Pre-renal azotemia by FeNa, unable to reliably follow.
   -          Continue Tube Feeds/Hydration as protocolled in
Hypernatremia
   -          Obtain PICC
   #. Guaiac positive stool: No known h/o GI bleeding, does have GERD per

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of Alzheimer's dementia who presented with pneumonia and was intubated for airway protection. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has secondary hypoxic respiratory failure due to aspiration, initially thought to be pneumonia, but with no response to antibiotics, more likely aspiration pneumonitis. His CXR only shows marginal improvement overnight.

2. Fever: The patient has a fever of 102.4°F (2122-1-23 06:00 PM). His temperature curve is being trended, and he is being closely monitored for any signs of infection or other causes of fever.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has episodes of tachycardia up to the 160s overnight, appearing to be sinus tachycardia. An EKG is being obtained this morning to further evaluate the cause of the tachycardia.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to dehydration and difficulty following medication orders. His maintenance fluids have been discontinued, and tube feeds are being restarted with free water flushes.

5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing pre-renal azotemia by FeNa and is unable to reliably follow medication orders. Tube feeds/hydration are being continued as protocolled in Hypernatremia"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient's family has discussed the plan with the medical team, expressing their desire to see how the patient responds to a Lasix drip over the next two days before reevaluating on Sunday night. If there is no improvement, they wish to remove mechanical ventilations and plan for hospice care. The patient has been confirmed as DNR.

The patient's vital signs show a fever of 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit and episodes of tachycardia up to the 160s overnight. An EKG has been ordered to assess the heart rhythm. The patient's allergies include penicillins, sulfa, and Flomax. The patient received antibiotics (Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Meropenem) on January 22nd and January 23rd.

Infusions include Pantoprazole (Protonix), Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis), and other medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted fever and tachycardia.

Flow sheet data shows the patient's current temperature at 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 111 to 116 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 131/53 to 156/75 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute with spontaneous rate of 7 breaths"

   Assessment and Plan
   87M h/o Alzheimer's dementia presented with pneumonia intubated for
   airway protection.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:   Secondary to Aspiration, initially
   thought pneumonia, but no response to antibiotics, therefore more
   likely aspiration pneumonitis.  The patient
s CXR is only marginally
   improved overnight.  Patient is back on AC ventilation given lack of
   responsiveness.
   - s/p re-intubation
   - Continue to trend fever curve, WBC, and discontinue antibiotics today
   after prolonged course of vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro.
   - f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures, currently no growth, if
   develops positive cultures will restart antibiotics directed towards
   specific pathogen
   - continue frequent suctioning
   - continue nebs prn
   #  Hypotensive:  The patient became hypotensive after starting
   metoprolol for tachycardia.  Will discontinue metoprolol currently.
   Will also continue to fluid resuscitate as needed, but given length of
   stay very positive, will attempt lasix drip.
   - PIVs for now placed by IV team.  If the patient continues to be
   hypotensive, may require central access and arterial line.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Continues to improve, at 140 today.
   -          Discontinue maintenance fluids now and attempt to restart
   tube feeds with free water flushes.
   #. ARF: Pre-renal azotemia by FeNa.
   - Continue Tube Feeds/Hydration as protocolled in
Hypernatremia
   #. Guaiac positive stool: No known h/o GI bleeding, does have GERD per
   report. Brown G+ stool prior to transfer. HD stable. Maintain T&S,
   PIVs. [**Hospital1 **] Hct. PPI IV bid.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of Alzheimer's dementia who presented with pneumonia and was intubated for airway protection.
- The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration, initially thought to be pneumonia, but no response to antibiotics indicates more likely aspiration pneumonitis.
- The patient's CXR is only marginally improved overnight, and he is back on AC ventilation due to lack of responsiveness.
- The patient has a fever, tachycardia, hypotension, hypernatremia, acute renal failure (pre-renal azotemia by FeNa), and guaiac positive stool.
- The patient's family wants to see how he does with the lasix drip over the next two days before reevaluating on Sunday night. If he is not improving, they would like to remove the mechanical ventilations and plan for hospice care. They have confirmed the patient as DNR.
- The patient's allergies include penicillins, rash; sulfa (sulfonamides), rash; and Flomax (Oral) (Tamsulosin Hcl), unknown.
- The patient received various medications including Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, Meropenem, Pantoprazole (Protonix), and Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis).
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated"

   Assessment and Plan
   87M h/o Alzheimer's dementia presented with pneumonia intubated for
   airway protection.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:   Secondary to Aspiration, initially
   thought pneumonia, but no response to antibiotics, therefore more
   likely aspiration pneumonitis.  The patient
s CXR is only marginally
   improved overnight.  Patient is back on PS ventilation to attempt to
   improve hiccup breathing pattern.
   - s/p re-intubation
   - Continue to trend fever curve, WBC, and discontinue antibiotics today
   after prolonged course of vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro discontinued on [**1-23**]
   - f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures, currently no growth, if
   develops positive cultures will restart antibiotics directed towards
   specific pathogen
   - continue frequent suctioning
   - continue nebs prn
   - Continue lasix drip to attempt to diurese patient with goal 100-200
   cc/hour
   - Will discuss CMO status with family today and attempt extubation as
   on [**5-12**]
   #  Tachycardic:  Resolved. The patient became hypotensive after
   starting metoprolol for tachycardia  yesterday.   Will also continue to
   fluid resuscitate as needed, but given length of stay very positive,
   will attempt lasix drip as likely irritable from fluid overload and
   cardiac distension.
   - Given IV metoprolol and transitioned to PO, tolerated well
   -          PIVs for now placed by IV team.
   -          PICC line unsuccessful
   -          Attempt to capture tachycardia with EKG
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Unable to reliably follow given difficult access
   -          Discontinue maintenance fluids now
   -          Hold tube feeds in the setting of possible extubation
   #. ARF: Pre-renal azotemia by FeNa, unable to reliably follow.
   -          Continue Tube Feeds/Hydration as protocolled in
Hypernatremia
   -          Unable to get PICC
   #. Guaiac positive stool: No known h/o GI bleeding, does have GERD per
   report. Brown G+ stool prior to transfer. HD stable. Maintain T&S,
   PIVs. [**Hospital1 **] Hct. PPI IV bid.
   - will hold as moving toward CMO
   #. Dementia: continue outpatient sertraline and namenda.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonitis, as there was no response to antibiotics and the patient's chest X-ray only showed marginal improvement overnight. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) to improve the breathing pattern.

   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:   Secondary to Aspiration, initially
   thought pneumonia, but no response to antibiotics, therefore more
   likely aspiration pneumonitis.  The patient

   improved overnight.  Patient is back on AC ventilation given lack of
   responsiveness.
   - s/p re-intubation
   - Continue to trend fever curve, WBC, and discontinue antibiotics today
   after prolonged course of vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro discontinued on [**1-23**]
   - f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures, currently no growth, if
   develops positive cultures will restart antibiotics directed towards
   specific pathogen

   - continue nebs prn
   - Continue lasix drip to attempt to diurese patient
   - Attempt PS trial
   #  Tachycardic:  Resolved. The patient became hypotensive after
   starting metoprolol for tachycardia  yesterday.   Will also continue to
   fluid resuscitate as needed, but given length of stay very positive,
   will attempt lasix drip as likely irritable from fluid overload and
   cardiac distension.
   - Will give trial of 5 mg metoprolol and transition to PO if tolerated
   -          PIVs for now placed by IV team.
   -          Given current care, will attempt PICC line, but if unable
   will not escalate to central line

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever of unknown origin, tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, pneumonia, and acute renal failure. The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, sulfa, and Flomax (Tamsulosin Hcl), and a review of systems unchanged from admission except for the noted conditions. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 126/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. Fluid balance shows an input of 1,008 mL (571 mL PO, 316 mL IVF, 245 mL TF) and output of 3,485 mL (900 mL urine, 2,477 mL drain). The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient has been receiving various medications including furosemide, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination findings are not assessed. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, which may lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased risk of infection, and potential sepsis.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, indicated by increased creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output). This can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
3. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fever despite antibiotic therapy suggests an underlying infectious or inflammatory process. Further investigation is necessary to identify the cause of the fever.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity puts him at risk for pressure ulcers and potential infection.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may indicate underlying stress, infection, or other cardiac issues.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a significant output of 3,485 mL, which may indicate fluid overload and the need for diuretic therapy adjustment.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but there is a possibility of developing hypotension due to sepsis or renal failure.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Further clinical evaluation and testing would be required to confirm these findings and identify additional potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   \87M h/o Alzheimer's dementia presented with pneumonia intubated for
   airway protection.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:   Secondary to Aspiration, initially
   thought pneumonia, but no response to antibiotics, therefore more
   likely aspiration pneumonitis.  The patient
s CXR is only marginally
   improved overnight.  Patient is back on PS ventilation to attempt to
   improve hiccup breathing pattern.
   - s/p re-intubation
   - Continue to trend fever curve, WBC, and discontinue antibiotics today
   after prolonged course of vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/cipro discontinued on [**1-23**]
   - f/u blood cultures and sputum cultures, currently no growth, if
   develops positive cultures will restart antibiotics directed towards
   specific pathogen
   - continue frequent suctioning
   - continue nebs prn
   - Continue lasix drip to attempt to diurese patient with goal 100-200
   cc/hour
   - Will discuss CMO status with family today and attempt extubation as
   on [**5-12**]
   #  Tachycardic:  Resolved. The patient became hypotensive after
   starting metoprolol for tachycardia  yesterday.   Will also continue to
   fluid resuscitate as needed, but given length of stay very positive,
   will attempt lasix drip as likely irritable from fluid overload and
   cardiac distension.
   - Given IV metoprolol and transitioned to PO, tolerated well
   -          PIVs for now placed by IV team.
   -          PICC line unsuccessful
   -          Attempt to capture tachycardia with EKG
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Unable to reliably follow given difficult access
   -          Discontinue maintenance fluids now
   -          Hold tube feeds in the setting of possible extubation
   #. ARF: Pre-renal azotemia by FeNa, unable to reliably follow.
   -          Continue Tube Feeds/Hydration as protocolled in
Hypernatremia
   -          Unable to get PICC
   #. Guaiac positive stool: No known h/o GI bleeding, does have GERD per
   report. Brown G+ stool prior to transfer. HD stable. Maintain T&S,
   PIVs. [**Hospital1 **] Hct. PPI IV bid.
   - will hold as moving toward CMO
   #. Dementia: continue outpatient sertraline and namenda.

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of Alzheimer's dementia who presented with pneumonia and required intubation for airway protection. He was initially thought to have pneumonia but showed no response to antibiotics, indicating more likely aspiration pneumonitis. The patient's CXR showed marginal improvement overnight. He was placed back on pressure support ventilation to improve his breathing pattern affected by hiccups.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 127 bpm, blood pressure of 85/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 60%. His current weight is 90.4 kg, and he has received a total of 1,105 mL of fluids since midnight.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 20.9 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, sodium of 142 mEq/L, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, and creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL. Other labs indicate elevated levels of PT/INR, CK/CKMB, and Troponin-T, with normal amylase/lipase levels. Differential white blood cell count shows neutrophils at 88.6%, lymphocytes at 7.1%, monocytes at 3.4%, eosinophils at 0.6%, and basoph"

   Assessment and Plan
   \87M h/o Alzheimer's dementia presented with pneumonia intubated for
   airway protection.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory failure:   Secondary to Aspiration, initially
   thought pneumonia, but no response to antibiotics, therefore more
   likely aspiration pneumonitis.  The patient
s CXR is only marginally
   improved overnight.  Patient is back on PS ventilation to attempt to
   improve hiccup breathing pattern.
   -lasix dripped stopped
   -morphine for pain control
   -extubated
   -scopolamine patch
   #  Tachycardic:  Resolved. The patient became hypotensive after
   starting metoprolol for tachycardia  yesterday.   Will also continue to
   fluid resuscitate as needed, but given length of stay very positive,
   will attempt lasix drip as likely irritable from fluid overload and
   cardiac distension.
   -currently bradycardic
   -CMO

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of Alzheimer's dementia who presented with pneumonia and was intubated for airway protection. He has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonitis, rather than pneumonia. The patient's condition has not improved significantly despite receiving antibiotics. He is currently extubated and on noninvasive ventilation support. 

The patient's vital signs show bradycardia and hypotension. His laboratory results indicate hypernatremia, acute renal failure with pre-renal azotemia, and an elevated white blood cell count. He also has guaiac positive stool, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's medical history includes edema, fever of unknown origin, tachycardia, impaired skin integrity, community-acquired pneumonia, acute renal failure, and impaired peripheral circulation. 

Plan:
The patient's plan includes discontinuing maintenance fluids due to hypernatremia, holding tube feeds, and providing comfort measures only (CMO) care. He is being managed with lasix for fluid overload, morphine for pain control, scopolamine patch for hiccups, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for gastrointestinal protection. The patient's family has been informed of his condition and code status."
