   Assessment and Plan
   33 yo man with h/o sct for lymphoma, c/b GVHD in ICU with hypoxemia,
   fever, and hypotension.
   1. Hypotension/Fever/Sepsis: Most likely source is dense infiltrates in
   lungs bilaterally.
      -Agree with empiric cefepime, vanco, cipro, caspo.
      -Thoracentesis this afternoon when overnight lovenox dose wears off
   to r/o empyema.
      -F/u Cultures this afternoon (here and [**Hospital1 82**])
      -D/C PICC line.
      -Will consult ID.
      -Stress dose steroids for now.
      -Hemodynamics improved with IVF overnight.  Bolus as need based on
   BP and CVP.
   2. Hypoxemia/Hypercarbia: Due to large bilateral
   infiltrates/atelectasis.  Chest CT appears that there is an abrupt
   cutoff in LLL bronchus --> there does appear to be air bronchograms and
   no distinct transition point on the R.
   -Would not bronch at the moment given the tenous respiratory status.
   -Will trial off of Bipap and monitor closely.
   -Chest PT.
   -Doubtful that thoracentesis will correct atelectasis as old CT showed
   no atelectasis with similar sized effusion
   4. GVHD: Continue steroids, Prograf, Cellcept.  Will need to discuss
   with BMT team the risk/benfit of a reduction in level of
   immunosuppressive given repeat infections
   5. PE: Cont LMWH after thoracentesis

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old man with a history of stem cell transplantation for lymphoma, currently in the ICU for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presents with fever, hypotension, and hypoxemia. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal treatment. He has bilateral lung infiltrates, and a chest CT scan shows an abrupt cutoff of the left lower lobe bronchus, indicating a possible obstructive process. The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and he is currently on BiPAP. There are plans to perform a thoracentesis to rule out empyema and consult infectious disease. The patient's hypotension and fever may be due to dense lung infiltrates, and the source of sepsis is likely the lungs. The patient's hypoxemia is primarily due to large bilateral infiltrates and atelectasis. There are concerns about the patient's critical condition and the risk-benefit analysis of reducing immunosuppressive therapy given his repeat infections. The patient has GVHD, and management includes continuing steroids, Prograf, and Cellcept. Prophylactic measures include low-molecular-weight heparin for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor. The patient's code status is full code, and he will remain in the ICU."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old man with a history of stem cell transplant for lymphoma and current diagnosis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He is admitted to the ICU with symptoms of fever, hypotension, and hypoxemia.

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia (HR: 112 bpm), low blood pressure (BP: 96/63 mmHg), normal respiratory rate (RR: 22 breaths/min), and oxygen saturation at 100% while on bipap. His temperature is slightly elevated (Tmax: 37.7°C). The patient has bilateral lung infiltrates on chest imaging, which may suggest pneumonia or pulmonary edema. A chest CT scan reveals an abrupt cutoff of the left lower lobe bronchus, indicating a potential blockage or obstruction.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC: 6.7 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin level (Hct: 30.7%), elevated platelet count (Plt: 372 K/uL), and abnormal electrolyte levels including low potassium (K+: 3.7 mEq/L) and low bicarbonate (HCO3 -: 30 mEq/L). Imaging shows a left-sided pleural effusion.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, ciprofungal), antifungal (caspof"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of large cell lymphoma and complications from an allogenic stem cell transplant. He has severe chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD, requiring chronic immunosuppression. The patient was recently admitted for fungemia and S. pneumo bacteremia, presenting with hypoxemia, fevers, and hypotension. He was found to have new right lower lobe consolidation and increased moderate left-sided pleural effusion with compressive left lower lobe atelectasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/pneumonia: The patient's presentation with hypoxemia, fevers, and hypotension suggests sepsis secondary to pneumonia. This is already being treated.
2. Pleuritic chest pain: The patient complains of pleuritic chest pain, which is likely due to the developing pneumonia. A follow-up chest X-ray is recommended to evaluate for worsening pneumonia or new rib fractures.
3. GVHD: The patient has severe oral and skin GVHD. He is on therapeutic doses of immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and prednisone. His immune suppressants need to be adjusted based on the recommendations of the hematology-oncology team.
4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient previously had an EF of 40-45% and baseline tachycardia. This is likely secondary to chemotherapy, radiation, and/or GVHD. Nodal agents should"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of large cell lymphoma and complications of severe chronic extensive skin and oral graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He is an immunocompromised host who presented with hypoxemia, fevers, and hypotension, along with new right lower lobe consolidation and increased moderate left-sided pleural effusion with compressive left lower lobe atelectasis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 124/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He has markedly thickened skin throughout his body. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactic acid levels. The patient's blood cultures from the PICC line and thoracentesis are pending, along with cytology, viral culture, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) tests on the thoracentesis fluid. The patient continues to receive treatment for infection and pain.

","The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of large cell lymphoma and severe chronic extensive skin and oral GVHD, requiring chronic immunosuppression. He has been admitted multiple times for infections, including recent admissions for fungemia and S. pneumo bacteremia. The patient presented with hypoxemia, fevers, hypotension, new right lower lobe consolidation, and increased moderate left-sided pleural effusion with compressive left lower lobe atelectasis.

The patient is currently being treated for infection and pain. He is on various medications including vancomycin, cefepime, caspofungin, and ciprofloxacin. Further follow-up with infectious disease recommendations is advised. The results of thoracentesis show a likely exudative pleural effusion with normal pH, borderline LDH, and T protein levels. However, there is a small amount of blood in the pleural fluid, which may have falsely elevated LDH and T protein levels. The pleural fluid is negative for Gram stain and further cultures will be done for AFB, viral, bacterial, and fungal organisms. Glucan and galactomannan tests are also being followed up, as well as CMV viral load.

The patient's recent development of pleuritic chest pain is new and reproducible on examination. An X-ray will be obtained to evaluate for worsening pneumonia or new rib fractures. Dilaudid will be given as needed for pain"

The patient is currently admitted for fungemia and S. pneumo bacteremia, presenting with hypoxemia, fevers, and hypotension. He was found to have new right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation and increased moderate left-sided pleural effusion with compressive left lower lobe (LLL) atelectasis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 124/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is receiving non-rebreather oxygen delivery.

The patient's peripheral vascular examination reveals that radial pulses are not assessed, and digital pulses are also not assessed. The neurologic examination is not assessed due to patient's lack of response, movement, tone, and other findings.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 9.9 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (HGB) at 8.8 g/dL, elevated creatinine (Cr) at 0.5 mg/dL, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at 337 IU/L. Other lab values include elevated glucose at 112 mg"

   Assessment and Plan
   33 yo man with h/o sct for lymphoma, c/b GVHD in ICU with hypoxemia,
   fever, and hypotension.
   1. Hypotension/Fever/Sepsis: Most likely source is dense infiltrates in
   lungs bilaterally.
      -Agree with empiric cefepime, vanco, cipro, caspo.
      -F/u Cultures
      -D/C PICC line.
      -Will consult ID.
      -Stress dose steroids for now.
      -Hemodynamics improved with IVF overnight.  Bolus as need based on
   BP and CVP.
   2. Hypoxemia/Hypercarbia: Due to large bilateral
   infiltrates/atelectasis.  Chest CT appears that there is an abrupt
   cutoff in LLL bronchus --> there does appear to be air bronchograms and
   no distinct transition point on the R.  Improving.
   -Would not bronch at the moment given the tenous respiratory status.
   -Will trial off of Bipap and monitor closely.
   -Chest PT.
   -Doubtful that thoracentesis will correct atelectasis as old CT showed
   no atelectasis with similar sized effusion
   -Appears fluid overloaded, consider diuresis
   3. GVHD: Continue steroids, Prograf, Cellcept.
       Will need to discuss with BMT team the risk/benfit of a reduction
   in level of immunosuppressive given repeat infections
       Consider Gleevic for GVHD

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of b-cell lymphoma, status post transplant with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presented to the hospital with septic physiology, fever, and hypotension. He has been in the ICU and is currently in remission.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on non-rebreather oxygen delivery and requires respiratory support.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, cervical lymphadenopathy, crackles in the respiratory system, and no peripheral edema. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.9 thousand/mm^3, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 327 thousand/mm^3, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 337 IU/L, and normal glucose level of 112 mg/dL.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension/Fever/Sepsis: The most likely source is dense infiltrates in the lungs bilaterally. Empiric antibiotics have been started, and cultures are pending. PICC line has been discontinued, and consultation with an infectious disease specialist is planned. Stress"

The patient is a 68-year-old male who presented to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure. He became hypoxic yesterday and was unresponsive to treatments such as IV Lasix and BiPAP. The patient was eventually intubated around [**2161**] yesterday. He also initiated TPN therapy yesterday.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure and continued to experience hypoxia despite interventions.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to refractory hypoxia.
3. Bleeding: The patient had bleeding requiring direct pressure following peripheral IV removal.
4. Potential Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) suggests a potential infection.
5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels indicate possible renal dysfunction.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) suggest a coagulopathy.
7. Metabolic Disturbances: The patient has deranged electrolytes, including low calcium and magnesium levels, as well as altered glucose levels.
8. Potential Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage: The patient's low hemoglobin (Hct) level may indicate a gastrointestinal bleed.
9. Possible Liver Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (AST,"

   Assessment and Plan
   #Respiratory failure: Possibly mixed with components of hypoxemic and
   hypercapnic repiratory failure. Patient
s repiratory status continued
   to decline yesterday despite diuresis and trial of BiPAP
   -Continue mechanical ventilation and liberate when tolearted.
   - Bronchoscopy today to assess airway pathology as well as mucous
   plugging.
   -Attempt diuresis as blood pressure tolerates. Patient had positive
   fluid balance in 6 hours this AM.
   #GVHD: Resulting from allogenic BMT. Extensive skin and oral
   involvement.
   - Continue home immunosupressive regimen including tacrolimus and
   hydrocortisone as tolerated by route of medication. Switch PO meds to
   IV as is possible. Will f/u with BMT on tacrolimus IV options.
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim prophylaxis.
   #Sepsis: Likely pulmonary source given respiratory failure in setting
   of worsening CXR appearance as well as rhonchorous breath sounds.
   - F/U blood cultures from outside hospital as well as pending cultures
   here.
   - Obtain sputum cultures via previously mentioned bronchoscopy.
   - Continue caspofungin, cefipime, cipro, and Vancomycin
   #Hx of PE: Given reported pleuritic chest pain yesterday and worsening
   pulmonary status, should remain suspicious despite systemic
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue lovenox at PM dose despite bleeding earlier today.
   #Hx of cardiomyopathy: Previous EF of 40-45%. Baseline tachycardia of
   100s-110s.
   - Hold nodal blocking agents at this time.
   #FEN: TPN is standard home regimen for patient
   - Continue TPN per nutrition recs.
   - Will reattempt OG placement as tolerated, uderstanding that patient
   anatomy is compromised due to oral GVHD involvement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has progressively worsened, leading to intubation yesterday. The patient has a history of GVHD, sepsis, PE, cardiomyopathy, and FEN. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, and bronchoscopy has been planned to assess airway pathology and mucous plugging. Diuresis is being attempted as the patient has a positive fluid balance. The patient is also on immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD, including tacrolimus and hydrocortisone, as well as prophylactic antibiotics and antifungal medication. There is a concern for ongoing infection, and blood and sputum cultures have been obtained. The patient's code status is full code. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status continues to decline, indicating a potential risk of worsening respiratory failure.
2. GVHD: The patient has extensive skin and oral involvement due to GVHD, which can lead to complications such as infection, poor wound healing, and further immune suppression.
3. Sepsis: Given the worsening appearance of the chest X-ray and rhonchorous breath sounds, there is a concern for a pulmonary source of infection leading to sepsis.
4. PE: The patient's history of pleuritic chest pain and worsening pulmonary status raises suspicion for a possible pulmonary emb"

   Assessment and Plan
   33 yo man with h/o sct for lymphoma, c/b GVHD in ICU with hypoxemia,
   fever, and hypotension.
    1. Hypotension/Fever/Sepsis: Most likely source is dense infiltrates
   in lungs bilaterally.
      -Agree with empiric cefepime, vanco, cipro, caspo.
      -F/u Cultures
      -Stress dose steroids for now.
      -Hemodynamics improved with IVF overnight.  Bolus as need based on
   BP and CVP.
   2. Hypoxemia/Hypercarbia: Due to large bilateral
   infiltrates/atelectasis.  Chest CT appears that there is an abrupt
   cutoff in LLL bronchus --> there does appear to be air bronchograms and
   no distinct transition point on the R
   -Now intubated on full vent suport
   -Appears fluid overloaded, continue diuresis
    3. GVHD: Continue steroids, Prograf, Cellcept.
       Will need to discuss with BMT team the risk/benfit of a reduction
   in level of immunosuppressive given repeat infections

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of stem cell transplantation for lymphoma, currently experiencing complications of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He has been admitted to the ICU due to hypoxemia, fever, and hypotension. 

The patient's medical history and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted events. He has been diagnosed with sepsis and GVHD. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 100/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His cardiovascular system shows sinus rhythm with normal pulse and blood pressure. 

The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, caspofungin), immunosuppressants (tacrolimus, cellcept), and pain management medications. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 263 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 372 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab results are within normal range. 

Imaging shows a tube in place and pulmonary infiltrates bilaterally. Microbiology studies are pending. 

Assessment and plan include managing the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   33 year old male with h/o large B-cell lymphoma status post allogenic
   stem cell transplant in [**2166**], complicated by severe graft versus host
   disease of the skin and oral mucosa. Recent hospital admissions with
   fungemia and s. pneumo bacteremia. For this admission he presented with
   fever, dyspnea, and abdominal pain.
   #Respiratory failure: Possibly mixed with components of hypoxemic and
   hypercapnic repiratory failure. Likely primarily caused by pulmonary
   infection.
   -Continue mechanical ventilation. Move towards liberation from vent by
   lightening sedation today and then switching to a pressure support
   mode.
   - Bronchoscopy yesterday revealed some airway blockage with secretions
   and inflammatory debris. Was suctioned. No change in appearance of CXR
   this AM.
   -Attempt diuresis as blood pressure tolerates.
   #GVHD: Resulting from allogenic BMT. Extensive skin and oral
   involvement.
   - Continue home immunosupressive regimen including tacrolimus and
   hydrocortisone as tolerated by route of medication. Still no PO access
   available.
   - Continue acyclovir (160 MG IV daily) and bactrim prophylaxis.
   #Sepsis: Likely pulmonary source given respiratory failure in setting
   of worsening CXR appearance as well as fact that sputum gram stain from
   bronchoscopy shows multiple PMNs and gram positive cocci in pairs.
   - F/U blood cultures from outside hospital as well as pending cultures
   here.
   - F/U on sputum culture from bronchoscopy yesterday.
   - Continue caspofungin, cefipime, cipro, and vancomycin
   - Be aware of attenuated fever curve due to hydrocortisone.
   #Hx of PE: Given reported pleuritic chest pain yesterday and worsening
   pulmonary status, should remain suspicious despite systemic
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue lovenox systemic anticoagulation home regimen.
   #Hx of cardiomyopathy: Previous EF of 40-45%. Baseline tachycardia of
   100s-110s.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of large B-cell lymphoma, status post allogenic stem cell transplant. He has been admitted to the ICU for fever, dyspnea, and abdominal pain. The patient has severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) affecting his skin and oral mucosa. He has a recent history of fungemia and Staphylococcus pneumonia bacteremia. His current condition includes respiratory failure, likely due to a pulmonary infection, and he requires mechanical ventilation. There is also evidence of airway blockage with secretions and inflammatory debris, which was suctioned during bronchoscopy. The patient has extensive GVHD, requiring immunosuppressive therapy. He is also at risk for sepsis, given his worsening CXR appearance and positive gram stain showing gram-positive cocci in pairs. The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and cardiomyopathy. He is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to his feeding tube not being accessible. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as he is mechanically ventilated and has evidence of hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary. The underlying pulmonary infection needs to be treated effectively to improve respiratory function.

2. Sepsis: The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest the"

   Assessment and Plan
   33 yo man with h/o sct for lymphoma, c/b GVHD in ICU with hypoxemia,
   fever, and hypotension.
    1. Hypotension/Fever/Sepsis: Most likely source is dense infiltrates
   in lungs bilaterally.
      -Agree with empiric cefepime, vanco, cipro, caspo.
      -F/u Cultures
      -Stress dose steroids for now.
      -Hemodynamics improved with IVF overnight.  Bolus as need based on
   BP and CVP.
   2. Hypoxemia/Hypercarbia: Due to large bilateral
   infiltrates/atelectasis.  Chest CT appears that there is an abrupt
   cutoff in LLL bronchus --> there does appear to be air bronchograms and
   no distinct transition point on the R
    Now intubated on full vent support.
    Lighten sedation; consider pressure support trial
   3. GVHD: Continue steroids, Prograf, Cellcept.
       Gleevic for GVHD

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of stem cell transplant for lymphoma, currently in the ICU due to GVHD with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. The patient is on full ventilatory support and has hypotension, fever, and hypoxemia. The patient's condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, fever, and dense lung infiltrates suggest sepsis. Empiric antibiotics have been started, and cultures will be followed up. Stress dose steroids have been given.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to large bilateral lung infiltrates and atelectasis. The patient is now intubated on full ventilatory support.
3. GVHD: The patient has ongoing GVHD, which is being treated with steroids, Prograf, and Cellcept. Gleevic and montelukast are also being considered for GVHD.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a recent PE, and prophylactic LMWH is being given after thoracentesis.
5. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis with a PPI.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient is at risk for DVT, and systemic anticoagulation with LMWH has been initiated.
7. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   33 year old male with h/o large B-cell lymphoma status post allogenic
   stem cell transplant in [**2166**], complicated by severe graft versus host
   disease of the skin and oral mucosa. Recent hospital admissions with
   fungemia and s. pneumo bacteremia. For this admission he presented with
   fever, dyspnea, and abdominal pain.
   #Respiratory failure: Possibly mixed with components of hypoxemic and
   hypercapnic repiratory failure. Likely primarily caused by pulmonary
   infection.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation. Move towards liberation from vent by
   lightening sedation today and then switching to a pressure support mode
   again today. Possible trial with higher pressure support settings today
   than yesterday.
   - f/u CXR today.
   -Was > 1.5 L negative fluid balance since 0000 hours this morning.
   Still up ~7 L for admission. Should continue to diuresis with 20mg IV
   furosemide as BP and renal function tolerates as pulmonary edema may be
   contributing to failure to liberate patient from ventilator.
   #Sepsis: Likely pulmonary source given respiratory failure in setting
   of worsening CXR appearance as well as fact that sputum gram stain from
   bronchoscopy shows multiple PMNs and gram positive cocci in pairs.
   - F/U blood cultures from outside hospital as well as pending cultures
   here. No growth to date thus far.
   - F/U on sputum culture from bronchoscopy. No growth to date thus far.
   - Continue caspofungin, cefipime, and vancomycin. Cipro was D/C
   yesterday.
   - Be aware of attenuated fever curve due to hydrocortisone.
   #Hypergammaglobulinemia:
   - Per BMT recs, patient may benefit from IV Ig therapy. Will follow-up
   with them on dosing for IV Ig.
   #Hyperglycemia: More difficult to control yesterday.
   - On insulin infusion now.
   #GVHD: Resulting from allogenic BMT. Extensive skin and oral
   involvement.
   - Continue home immunosupressive regimen including tacrolimus and
   hydrocortisone as tolerated by route of medication. Still no PO access
   available.
   - Get tacrolimus level today.
   - Continue acyclovir (160 MG IV daily) and bactrim prophylaxis.
   #Hx of PE:
   - Continue lovenox systemic anticoagulation home regimen.
   #Hx of cardiomyopathy: Previous EF of 40-45%. Baseline tachycardia of
   100s-110s.
   - Hold nodal blocking agents at this time.
   #FEN: TPN is standard home regimen for patient
   - Continue TPN per nutrition recs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of large B-cell lymphoma and allogenic stem cell transplant. He has been admitted to the ICU with sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes severe graft versus host disease of the skin and oral mucosa, previous hospital admissions with fungemia and s. pneumo bacteremia, and a current infection that may have pulmonary involvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a pulmonary infection. Continued mechanical ventilation and lightening sedation are planned to move towards liberation from the ventilator. Possible trial with higher pressure support settings will also be considered.

2. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis with a likely pulmonary source. Blood cultures from the outside hospital and pending cultures here will be followed up. Antibiotic therapy will be continued with caspofungin, cefipime, and vancomycin, while cipro was discontinued yesterday.

3. Hypergammaglobulinemia/Hypogammaglobulinemia: The patient has low levels of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM), indicating hypogammaglobulinemia. Immunoglobulin therapy may be beneficial, and the BMT team will provide further guidance on dosing.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently high, necessitating an insulin infusion"

   Assessment and Plan
   33 year old male with h/o large B-cell lymphoma status post allogenic
   stem cell transplant in [**2166**], complicated by severe graft versus host
   disease of the skin and oral mucosa. Recent hospital admissions with
   fungemia and s. pneumo bacteremia. For this admission he presented with
   fever, dyspnea, and abdominal pain.
   #Respiratory failure: Possibly mixed with components of hypoxemic and
   hypercapnic repiratory failure. Likely primarily caused by pulmonary
   infection.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation. Move towards liberation from vent by
   lightening sedation today and then switching to a pressure support mode
   again today. Possible trial with higher pressure support settings today
   than yesterday.
   - f/u CXR today.
   -Was > 1.5 L negative fluid balance since 0000 hours this morning.
   Still up ~7 L for admission. Should continue to diuresis with 20mg IV
   furosemide as BP and renal function tolerates as pulmonary edema may be
   contributing to failure to liberate patient from ventilator.
   #Sepsis: Likely pulmonary source given respiratory failure in setting
   of worsening CXR appearance as well as fact that sputum gram stain from
   bronchoscopy shows multiple PMNs and gram positive cocci in pairs.
   - F/U blood cultures from outside hospital as well as pending cultures
   here. No growth to date thus far.
   - F/U on sputum culture from bronchoscopy. No growth to date thus far.
   - Continue caspofungin, cefipime, and vancomycin. Cipro was D/C
   yesterday.
   - Be aware of attenuated fever curve due to hydrocortisone.
   #Hypergammaglobulinemia:
   - Per BMT recs, patient may benefit from IV Ig therapy. Will follow-up
   with them on dosing for IV Ig.
   #Hyperglycemia: More difficult to control yesterday.
   - On insulin infusion now.
   #GVHD: Resulting from allogenic BMT. Extensive skin and oral
   involvement.
   - Continue home immunosupressive regimen including tacrolimus and
   hydrocortisone as tolerated by route of medication. Still no PO access
   available.
   - Get tacrolimus level today.
   - Continue acyclovir (160 MG IV daily) and bactrim prophylaxis.
   #Hx of PE:
   - Continue lovenox systemic anticoagulation home regimen.
   #Hx of cardiomyopathy: Previous EF of 40-45%. Baseline tachycardia of
   100s-110s.
   - Hold nodal blocking agents at this time.
   #FEN: TPN is standard home regimen for patient
   - Continue TPN per nutrition recs.
   #Code: Full Code
   #Communication: Will arrange joint family meeting with [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] team and
   BMT team. Need to address goals of care.

   #Respiratory failure: Possibly mixed with components of hypoxemic and
   hypercapnic repiratory failure. Likely primarily caused by pulmonary
   infection.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation. Move towards liberation from vent by
   lightening sedation today and then switching to a pressure support mode
   again today. Possible trial with higher pressure support today.
   - No change in appearance of CXR this AM.
   -Was > 1.5 L negative fluid balance yesterday. Still up ~7 L for
   admission. Should continue to diuresis as BP and renal function
   tolerates as it may be contributing to failure to liberate from
   ventilator.
   #GVHD: Resulting from allogenic BMT. Extensive skin and oral
   involvement.
   - Continue home immunosupressive regimen including tacrolimus and
   hydrocortisone as tolerated by route of medication. Still no PO access
   available.
   - Continue acyclovir (160 MG IV daily) and bactrim prophylaxis.
   #Sepsis: Likely pulmonary source given respiratory failure in setting
   of worsening CXR appearance as well as fact that sputum gram stain from
   bronchoscopy shows multiple PMNs and gram positive cocci in pairs.
   - F/U blood cultures from outside hospital as well as pending cultures
   here.
   - F/U on sputum culture from bronchoscopy yesterday.
   - Continue caspofungin, cefipime, cipro, and vancomycin
   - Be aware of attenuated fever curve due to hydrocortisone.
   #Hyperglycemia: More difficult to control yesterday.
   - On insulin infusion now. If well controlled today, should calculate
   NPH insulin dose as baseline under new sliding scale in order to D/C
   insulin infusion.
   #Hx of PE: Given reported pleuritic chest pain yesterday and worsening
   pulmonary status, should remain suspicious despite systemic
   anticoagulation.
   - Continue lovenox systemic anticoagulation home regimen.
   #Hx of cardiomyopathy: Previous EF of 40-45%. Baseline tachycardia of
   100s-110s.
   - Hold nodal blocking agents at this time.
   #FEN: TPN is standard home regimen for patient
   - Continue TPN per nutrition recs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant in [**2166**]. He has been admitted multiple times with complications such as severe graft versus host disease affecting his skin and oral mucosa, as well as fungemia and bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus pneumoniae. On this admission, he presented with fever, dyspnea, and abdominal pain.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, likely due to a pulmonary infection. He is on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned off sedation to potentially switch to pressure support mode. His fluid balance is negative, and diuresis is being continued to manage this. 

The patient also has graft versus host disease (GVHD) resulting from the allogenic bone marrow transplant. He is on immunosuppressive therapy including tacrolimus and hydrocortisone. Prophylaxis for infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is being administered.

Additionally, the patient is suspected of having sepsis, possibly from a pulmonary source, given the worsening appearance of his chest X-ray and the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs on sputum gram stain. Blood and sputum cultures are pending. The patient is being treated with multiple antibiotics, including caspofungin, cefipime, ciprof"

   33 yo man with h/o sct for lymphoma, c/b GVHD in ICU with hypoxemia,
   fever, and hypotension.
    1. Hypotension/Fever/Sepsis: Most likely source is dense infiltrates
   in lungs bilaterally.
      -Continuing with empiric cefepime, vanco, caspo, acyclovir.
      -F/u Cultures
      -Stress dose steroids for now.
      -Appears fluid overloaded - will diurese as BP tolerates with 1
   liter goal
      -Hypogam - will speak with BMT about IV Ig infusions
   2. Hypoxemia/Hypercarbia: Due to large bilateral
   infiltrates/atelectasis.
    Now intubated on full vent support.
    Lighten sedation; consider pressure support trial today with higher
   PSV
   3. GVHD: Continue steroids, Prograf, Cellcept.
       Montelukast at 10mg  for GVHD

   Assessment and Plan
   33 year old male with h/o large B-cell lymphoma status post allogenic
   stem cell transplant in [**2166**], complicated by severe graft versus host
   disease of the skin and oral mucosa. Recent hospital admissions with
   fungemia and s. pneumo bacteremia. For this admission he presented with
   fever, dyspnea, and abdominal pain.
   #Respiratory failure: Possibly mixed with components of hypoxemic and
   hypercapnic repiratory failure. Likely primarily caused by pulmonary
   infection.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation. Doing well on PS of 20/5 overnight.
   Move towards lower PS levels today. FiO2 may be decreased from 50% to
   40%.
   - Diuresis continued yesterday to keep patient essentially even on I/O.
   Blood pressure dropped a bit overnight, so we will hold off on diuresis
   for now. Rhonchi still present, but sounds somewhat improved over last
   two days. CXR from today shows greatly improved aeration (predominately
   at apicies) compared to [**2170-5-23**].
   #Sepsis: Likely pulmonary source given respiratory failure in setting
   of worsening CXR appearance as well as fact that sputum gram stain from
   bronchoscopy shows multiple PMNs and gram positive cocci in pairs.
   - F/U blood cultures from outside hospital as well as pending cultures
   here. No growth to date thus far.
   - F/U on sputum culture from bronchoscopy. No growth to date thus far.
   - Continue caspofungin, cefipime, and vancomycin.
   - Be aware of attenuated fever curve due to hydrocortisone.
   #Hypogammaglobulinemia:
   - Per BMT recs, patient received IV Ig 25 g. Pharmacy reported that
   dosing is a one time dose for hypogammaglobulinemia.
   #Hyperglycemia:
   - On insulin infusion now.
   #GVHD: Resulting from allogenic BMT. Extensive skin and oral
   involvement.
   - Continue home immunosupressive regimen including tacrolimus and
   hydrocortisone as tolerated by route of medication. Still no PO access
   available; therefore, Gleevec will continue to be held.
   - Tacrolimus level drawn with AM labs; will follow up this afternoon.
   - Continue acyclovir (160 mg IV daily) and bactrim prophylaxis.
   #Hx of PE:
   - Continue lovenox systemic anticoagulation home regimen.
   #Hx of cardiomyopathy: Previous EF of 40-45%. Baseline tachycardia of
   100s-110s.
   - Hold nodal blocking agents at this time.
   #FEN: TPN is standard home regimen for patient
   - Continue TPN per nutrition recs.
   #Code: Full Code
   #Communication: Will hold joint family meeting with [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] team and BMT
   team this afternoon. Need to address goals of care.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of large B-cell lymphoma who underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant in [**2166**]. He is currently admitted to the ICU with fevers, dyspnea, and abdominal pain. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to a pulmonary infection, and sepsis with a possible pulmonary source. He is receiving mechanical ventilation and various antibiotics including caspofungin, cefipime, and vancomycin.

The patient also has hypogammaglobulinemia, hyperglycemia, graft versus host disease (GVHD) affecting the skin and oral mucosa, a history of pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy with a previous ejection fraction of 40-45%, and a fever of unknown origin (FUO). He is on immunosuppressive therapy including tacrolimus and hydrocortisone, as well as prophylactic medications such as acyclovir and bactrim.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 117/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on mechanical ventilation. His laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and elevated glucose levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of respiratory function, worsening"

   Assessment and Plan
   33 yo man with h/o sct for lymphoma, c/b GVHD in ICU with hypoxemia,
   fever, and hypotension.
     1. Hypotension/Fever/Sepsis: Most likely source is dense infiltrates
   in lungs bilaterally.
       -Continuing with empiric cefepime, vanco, caspo, acyclovir.
      -F/u Cultures
       -Stress dose steroids for now.
       -Continues to appear fluid overloaded - will diurese as BP
   tolerates with 1/2 liter goal today
       -Hypogam - received IV Ig infusions
   2. Hypoxemia/Hypercarbia: Due to large bilateral
   infiltrates/atelectasis.
       Infiltrates improved. Some success with PSV trial...will continue
   to wean
       Lighten sedation - RSBI 60 might be able to extubate tomorrow AM if
   he continues to do well
   3. GVHD: Continue steroids, Prograf (level pending), Cellcept.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old man with a history of stem cell transplantation for lymphoma, currently admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of GVHD (Graft versus Host Disease). He presents with hypoxemia, fever, and hypotension, and has been receiving treatment for sepsis. The patient's medical history includes lymphoma, GVHD, and an ongoing trial of PSV (Pressure Support Ventilation). He is on multiple medications, including cefepime, vancomycin, caspofungin, acyclovir, steroids, Prograf, and Cellcept.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Fever/Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, fever, and fluid overload suggest sepsis. The source of infection is suspected to be dense infiltrates in the lungs, for which he is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and other supportive measures.
2. Hypoxemia/Hypercarbia: The patient's hypoxemia and hypercarbia are attributed to large bilateral infiltrates and atelectasis. His response to PSV trial has been positive, and weaning of ventilatory support may be possible in the future.
3. GVHD: The patient continues to receive immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD, including steroids, Prograf, and Cellcept. Monitoring of drug levels and regular assessment of the liver function is necessary.
4. PE (Pulmonary Embolism): Prophylactic"

   Assessment and Plan
   33 year old male with h/o large B-cell lymphoma status post allogenic
   stem cell transplant in [**2166**], complicated by severe graft versus host
   disease of the skin and oral mucosa. Recent hospital admissions with
   fungemia and s. pneumo bacteremia. For this admission he presented with
   fever, dyspnea, and abdominal pain.
   #Respiratory failure: Possibly mixed with components of hypoxemic and
   hypercapnic repiratory failure. Likely primarily caused by pulmonary
   infection. Patient has improved greatly over last 3 days.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial this AM with good tidal volumes. Patient
   will remain on PS with low settings while liberated from sedation with
   goal of extubation later today or early tomorrow.
   - Diuresis should continue today as tolerated by patient's BP and renal
   function. CXR still with evidence of pulmonary vasculature volume
   overload.
   #Sepsis: Likely pulmonary source given respiratory failure in setting
   of worsening CXR appearance as well as fact that sputum gram stain from
   bronchoscopy shows multiple PMNs and gram positive cocci in pairs.
   - F/U blood cultures from outside hospital as well as pending cultures
   here. No growth to date thus far.
   - F/U on sputum culture from bronchoscopy. No growth to date thus far.
   - Continue fluconazole, cefipime, and vancomycin.
   - Be aware of attenuated fever curve due to hydrocortisone.
   - Patient is c. diff toxin negative.
   #Hypogammaglobulinemia:
   - Patient received IVIG 25 g last night.
   #Hyperglycemia:
   - On insulin infusion now.
   #GVHD: Resulting from allogenic BMT. Extensive skin and oral
   involvement.
   - Continue home immunosupressive regimen including tacrolimus and
   hydrocortisone as tolerated by route of medication. Still no PO access
   available; therefore, Gleevec will continue to be held.
   - Tacrolimus level is sub-therapeutic; however, this is less important
   in the setting of GVHD. No more Tacrolimus levels are needed at this
   time. Continue with current dose.
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim prophylaxis.
   #Hx of PE:
   - Continue lovenox systemic anticoagulation home regimen.
   #Hx of cardiomyopathy: Previous EF of 40-45%. Baseline tachycardia of
   100s-110s.
   - Hold nodal blocking agents at this time.
   #FEN: TPN is standard home regimen for patient
   - Continue TPN per nutrition recs. Fat was added to TPN mixture
   yesterday.
   #Code: Full Code
   #Communication: Patient's primary oncologist stopped by to visit with
   family yesterday. No specific goals of care were discussed, but family
   wishes to continue with current treatment at this time.

He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure, sepsis, hypogammaglobulinemia, hyperglycemia, GVHD, PE, cardiomyopathy, and malnutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a pulmonary infection. He has shown improvement over the last three days and is expected to continue weaning off mechanical ventilation with the goal of extubation later today or early tomorrow.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely of pulmonary origin given the worsening chest X-ray appearance and the presence of multiple PMNs and gram-positive cocci in pairs on the sputum gram stain from bronchoscopy. Blood cultures from the outside hospital and pending cultures here have shown no growth so far.
3. Hypogammaglobulinemia: The patient received IVIG 25 g last night to address his hypogammaglobulinemia.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient is currently on an insulin infusion to manage his hyperglycemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   33 year old male with h/o large B-cell lymphoma status post allogenic
   stem cell transplant in [**2166**], complicated by severe graft versus host
   disease of the skin and oral mucosa. Recent hospital admissions with
   fungemia and s. pneumo bacteremia. For this admission he presented with
   fever, dyspnea, and abdominal pain.
   #Respiratory failure: Possibly mixed with components of hypoxemic and
   hypercapnic repiratory failure. Likely primarily caused by pulmonary
   infection. Patient has improved greatly over last 3 days.
   - Spontaneous breathing trial this AM with good tidal volumes. Patient
   will remain on PS with low settings while liberated from sedation with
   goal of extubation later today or early tomorrow.
   - Diuresis should continue today as tolerated by patient's BP and renal
   function. CXR still with evidence of pulmonary vasculature volume
   overload.
   #Sepsis: Likely pulmonary source given respiratory failure in setting
   of worsening CXR appearance as well as fact that sputum gram stain from
   bronchoscopy shows multiple PMNs and gram positive cocci in pairs.
   - F/U blood cultures from outside hospital as well as pending cultures
   here. No growth to date thus far.
   - F/U on sputum culture from bronchoscopy. No growth to date thus far.
   - Continue fluconazole, cefipime, and vancomycin.
   - Be aware of attenuated fever curve due to hydrocortisone.
   - Patient is c. diff toxin negative.
   #Hypogammaglobulinemia:
   - Patient received IVIG 25 g last night.
   #Hyperglycemia:
   - On insulin infusion now.
   #GVHD: Resulting from allogenic BMT. Extensive skin and oral
   involvement.
   - Continue home immunosupressive regimen including tacrolimus and
   hydrocortisone as tolerated by route of medication. Still no PO access
   available; therefore, Gleevec will continue to be held.
   - Tacrolimus level is sub-therapeutic; however, this is less important
   in the setting of GVHD. No more Tacrolimus levels are needed at this
   time. Continue with current dose.
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim prophylaxis.
   #Hx of PE:
   - Continue lovenox systemic anticoagulation home regimen.
   #Hx of cardiomyopathy: Previous EF of 40-45%. Baseline tachycardia of
   100s-110s.
   - Hold nodal blocking agents at this time.
   #FEN: TPN is standard home regimen for patient
   - Continue TPN per nutrition recs. Fat was added to TPN mixture
   yesterday.
   #Code: Full Code
   #Communication: Patient's primary oncologist stopped by to visit with
   family yesterday. No specific goals of care were discussed, but family
   wishes to continue with current treatment at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of large B-cell lymphoma, status post allogenic stem cell transplant, complicated by severe graft versus host disease of the skin and oral mucosa. He has been admitted multiple times with fungemia and s. pneumo bacteremia. For this admission, he presented with fever, dyspnea, and abdominal pain.

The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, possibly mixed with components of hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. This is likely caused by a pulmonary infection. The patient has improved over the last three days and is now tolerating spontaneous breathing trials. The plan is to continue with pressure support while weaning off sedation, with the goal of extubation later today or early tomorrow.

The patient also has sepsis, likely of pulmonary origin, given the worsening chest X-ray appearance and the presence of multiple PMNs and gram-positive cocci in pairs on the sputum gram stain from bronchoscopy. Blood cultures from the outside hospital as well as pending cultures here show no growth to date.

Other ongoing issues include hypogammaglobulinemia, for which the patient received IVIG 25 g last night. He is also being treated for hyperglycemia with an insulin infusion. The patient has extensive skin and oral involvement due to graft versus host disease resulting from allogenic BMT. He will continue his home immunosuppressive regimen including tacrolimus"

   Assessment and Plan
   33 year old male with h/o large B-cell lymphoma status post allogenic
   stem cell transplant in [**2166**], complicated by severe graft versus host
   disease of the skin and oral mucosa. Recent hospital admissions with
   fungemia and s. pneumo bacteremia. For this admission he presented with
   fever, dyspnea, and abdominal pain.
   #Respiratory failure: Possibly mixed with components of hypoxemic and
   hypercapnic repiratory failure. Likely primarily caused by pulmonary
   infection, cannot rule out pulmonary GVHD involvement. Patient has
   improved greatly since [**2170-5-22**].
   - Patient was extubated and is now on face tent at 40%. Has been doing
   well aside from having thick secretions.
   - Diuresis should continue today as tolerated by patient's BP and renal
   function. CXR still with evidence of pulmonary vasculature volume
   overload.
   - F/U blood cultures from outside hospital as well as pending cultures
   here. No growth to date thus far.
   - F/U on sputum culture from bronchoscopy. No growth to date thus far.
   - Continue fluconazole and cefipime.
   - Patient is c. diff toxin negative.
   #Tachycardia:
   -Several episodes overnight associated with patient coughin while
   trying to bring up thick respiratory secretions.
   #Hypogammaglobulinemia:
   - Patient received IVIG 25 g on [**2170-5-25**]
   #Hyperglycemia:
   - Insulin infusion has been switched to NPH and sliding scale.
   #GVHD: Resulting from allogenic BMT. Extensive skin and oral
   involvement. Presumed
   - Continue home immunosupressive regimen of tacrolimus. Still no PO
   access available; therefore, Gleevec will continue to be held.
   - Tacrolimus level is sub-therapeutic; however, this is less important
   in the setting of GVHD. No more Tacrolimus levels are needed at this
   time. Continue with current dose.
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim prophylaxis.
   #Hx of PE:
   - Continue lovenox systemic anticoagulation home regimen.
   #Hx of cardiomyopathy: Previous EF of 40-45%. Baseline tachycardia of
   100s-110s.
   - Hold nodal blocking agents at this time.
   #FEN: TPN is standard home regimen for patient
   - Continue TPN per nutrition recs.
   - Now that patient is extubated, has been restarted on clear liquid
   diet; however, he had difficulty swallowing yesterday.
   - Need to explore possibility of tube feeding for this patient, as TPN
   increases his risk for developing bacteremia.
   #Code: Full Code
    #Communication: Patient's primary oncologist stopped by to visit with
   family yesterday. No specific goals of care were discussed, but family
   wishes to continue with current treatment at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of large B-cell lymphoma, status post allogenic stem cell transplant, complicated by severe graft versus host disease (GVHD) of the skin and oral mucosa. He has had recent hospital admissions with fungemia and s. pneumo bacteremia. For this admission, he presented with fever, dyspnea, and abdominal pain. The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by pulmonary infection, possibly mixed with components of hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. Other medical conditions include hypogammaglobulinemia, hyperglycemia, GVHD, previous pulmonary embolism, cardiomyopathy, and feeding difficulties.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary infection: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a pulmonary infection. It is important to continue monitoring his vital signs, oxygen saturation levels, and any signs of worsening respiratory distress.
2. GVHD: The patient has severe GVHD affecting his skin and oral mucosa. Close monitoring for any signs of worsening GVHD is necessary, including skin changes, oral ulcers, and liver function abnormalities.
3. Hypogammaglobulinemia: The patient has low levels of immunoglobulins, which increases his risk for infections. Regular monitoring of immunoglobulin levels and appropriate management to prevent infections are essential.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels. Tight glycemic control through insulin therapy"

   Assessment and Plan
   33 year old male with h/o large B-cell lymphoma status post allogenic
   stem cell transplant in [**2166**], complicated by severe graft versus host
   disease of the skin and oral mucosa. Recent hospital admissions with
   fungemia and s. pneumo bacteremia. For this admission he presented with
   fever, dyspnea, and abdominal pain.
   #Respiratory failure: Possibly mixed with components of hypoxemic and
   hypercapnic repiratory failure. Likely primarily caused by pulmonary
   infection, cannot rule out pulmonary GVHD involvement. Patient has
   improved greatly since [**2170-5-22**].
   - Patient was extubated and is now on face tent at 40%. Has been doing
   well aside from having thick secretions.
   - Diuresis should continue today as tolerated by patient's BP and renal
   function. CXR still with evidence of pulmonary vasculature volume
   overload.
   - F/U blood cultures from outside hospital as well as pending cultures
   here. No growth to date thus far.
   - F/U on sputum culture from bronchoscopy. No growth to date thus far.
   - Continue fluconazole and cefipime. Now day 7 of 10 for each
   antibiotic.
   - Patient is c. diff toxin negative.
   #Tachycardia:
   -Several episodes overnight associated with patient coughin while
   trying to bring up thick respiratory secretions.
   -Although though to be sinus tach related to patient discomfort, we
   will restart metoprolol at level of 12.5 mg PO BID as it may aid in
   controlling tachycardia to provide more ventricular filling in setting
   of documented cardiomyopathy.
   #Hypogammaglobulinemia:
   - Patient received IVIG 25 g on [**2170-5-25**]
   #Hyperglycemia:
   - Insulin infusion has been switched to NPH and sliding scale.
   #GVHD: Resulting from allogenic BMT. Extensive skin and oral
   involvement. Presumed pulmonary involvement considering recent course.
   - Continue home immunosupressive regimen of tacrolimus and cellcept.
   Still no PO access available; therefore, Gleevec will continue to be
   held.
   - Tacrolimus level is sub-therapeutic; however, this is less important
   in the setting of GVHD. No more Tacrolimus levels are needed at this
   time. Continue with current dose.
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim prophylaxis.
   # Depression: Patient with flat affect and depressed mood.
   - Start patient on duloxetine and discuss this medication addition with
   BMT given the many complex interactions of antidepressants.
   #Hx of PE:
   - Continue lovenox systemic anticoagulation home regimen.
   #Hx of cardiomyopathy: Previous EF of 40-45%. Baseline tachycardia of
   100s-110s.
   #FEN: TPN is standard home regimen for patient
   - Continue TPN per nutrition recs.
   - Now that patient is extubated, has been restarted on clear liquid
   diet; however, he had difficulty swallowing yesterday.
   -  Will review records and question BMT team regarding possibility of
   tube feeding for this patient, as TPN increases his risk for developing
   bacteremia. I.E. is there documented evidence of stomach or small
   intestine involvment? If not is there another contraindication to
   patient having more oral feedings that will allow him to be liberated
   from TPN dependence.

   Assessment and Plan
   33 year old male with h/o large B-cell lymphoma status post allogenic
   stem cell transplant in [**2166**], complicated by severe graft versus host
   disease of the skin and oral mucosa. Recent hospital admissions with
   fungemia and s. pneumo bacteremia. For this admission he presented with
   fever, dyspnea, and abdominal pain.
   #Respiratory failure: Possibly mixed with components of hypoxemic and
   hypercapnic repiratory failure. Likely primarily caused by pulmonary
   infection, cannot rule out pulmonary GVHD involvement. Patient has
   improved greatly since [**2170-5-22**].
   - Patient was extubated and is now on face tent at 40%. Has been doing
   well aside from having thick secretions.
   - Diuresis should continue today as tolerated by patient's BP and renal
   function. CXR still with evidence of pulmonary vasculature volume
   overload.
   - F/U blood cultures from outside hospital as well as pending cultures
   here. No growth to date thus far.
   - F/U on sputum culture from bronchoscopy. No growth to date thus far.
   - Continue fluconazole and cefipime. Now day 7 of 10 for each
   antibiotic.
   - Patient is c. diff toxin negative.
   #Tachycardia:
   -Several episodes overnight associated with patient coughin while
   trying to bring up thick respiratory secretions.
   -Although though to be sinus tach related to patient discomfort, we
   will restart metoprolol at level of 12.5 mg PO BID as it may aid in
   controlling tachycardia to provide more ventricular filling in setting
   of documented cardiomyopathy.
   #Hypogammaglobulinemia:
   - Patient received IVIG 25 g on [**2170-5-25**]
   #Hyperglycemia:
   - Insulin infusion has been switched to NPH and sliding scale.
   #GVHD: Resulting from allogenic BMT. Extensive skin and oral
   involvement. Presumed pulmonary involvement considering recent course.
   - Continue home immunosupressive regimen of tacrolimus and cellcept.
   Still no PO access available; therefore, Gleevec will continue to be
   held.
   - Tacrolimus level is sub-therapeutic; however, this is less important
   in the setting of GVHD. No more Tacrolimus levels are needed at this
   time. Continue with current dose.
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim prophylaxis.
   # Depression: Patient with flat affect and depressed mood.
   - Start patient on duloxetine and discuss this medication addition with
   BMT given the many complex interactions of antidepressants.
   #Hx of PE:
   - Continue lovenox systemic anticoagulation home regimen.
   #Hx of cardiomyopathy: Previous EF of 40-45%. Baseline tachycardia of
   100s-110s.
   #FEN: TPN is standard home regimen for patient
   - Continue TPN per nutrition recs.
   - Now that patient is extubated, has been restarted on clear liquid
   diet; however, he had difficulty swallowing yesterday.
   -  Will review records and question BMT team regarding possibility of
   tube feeding for this patient, as TPN increases his risk for developing
   bacteremia. I.E. is there documented evidence of stomach or small
   intestine involvment? If not is there another contraindication to
   patient having more oral feedings that will allow him to be liberated
   from TPN dependence.
   #Code: Full Code
    #Communication: Patient's primary oncologist stopped by to visit with
   family yesterday. No specific goals of care were discussed, but family
   wishes to continue with current treatment at this time.

   Assessment and Plan
   33 year old male with h/o large B-cell lymphoma status post allogenic
   stem cell transplant in [**2166**], complicated by severe graft versus host
   disease of the skin and oral mucosa. Recent hospital admissions with
   fungemia and s. pneumo bacteremia. For this admission he presented with
   fever, dyspnea, and abdominal pain.
   #Respiratory failure: Possibly mixed with components of hypoxemic and
   hypercapnic repiratory failure. Likely primarily caused by pulmonary
   infection, cannot rule out pulmonary GVHD involvement. Patient has
   improved greatly since [**2170-5-22**].
   - Patient was extubated and is now on 2 L NC.
   - F/U blood cultures from outside hospital as well as pending cultures
   here. No growth to date thus far.
   - F/U sputum culture from bronchoscopy. No growth to date thus far.
   - Continue fluconazole and cefipime. Now day 8 of 10 for each
   antibiotic.
   - Patient is c. diff toxin negative.
   - Stable for transfer to the floor.
   #Tachycardia:
    -improved with addition of metoprolol at level of 12.5 mg PO BID
   - patient has documented cardiomyopathy.
   #Hypogammaglobulinemia:
   - Patient received IVIG 25 g on [**2170-5-25**]
   #Hyperglycemia:
   -on NPH and sliding scale.
   #GVHD: Resulting from allogenic BMT. Extensive skin and oral
   involvement. Presumed pulmonary involvement considering recent course.
   - Continue home immunosupressive regimen of tacrolimus and cellcept.
   Still no PO access available; therefore, Gleevec will continue to be
   held.
   - Tacrolimus level is sub-therapeutic; however, this is less important
   in the setting of GVHD. No more Tacrolimus levels are needed at this
   time. Continue with current dose.
   - Continue acyclovir and bactrim prophylaxis.
   - Check CMV viral load today.
   # Depression: Patient with flat affect and depressed mood.
   - Started patient on duloxetine and discuss this medication addition
   with BMT given the many complex interactions of antidepressants.
   #Hx of PE:
   - Continue lovenox systemic anticoagulation home regimen.
   #Hx of cardiomyopathy: Previous EF of 40-45%. Baseline tachycardia of
   100s-110s.
   #FEN: TPN is standard home regimen for patient
   - Continue TPN per nutrition recs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with a history of large B-cell lymphoma and severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following an allogenic stem cell transplant. He presented with fever, dyspnea, and abdominal pain. The patient was intubated but has since been extubated and is currently on 2 L nasal cannula (NC) oxygen. His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 131/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 5 L oxygen. The patient complains of nausea this morning, which has been managed with zofran. He denies vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, abdominal pain, or diarrhea.

The patient has received multiple medications including vancomycin, Bactrim (SMX/TMP), cefepime, acyclovir, fluconazole, lorazepam, hydromorphone, metoprolol, pantoprazole, enoxaparin, and TPN. The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and blood glucose levels. However, his creatinine and total bilirubin levels are elevated. The patient's platelet count is within normal range. Other lab results indicate possible mixed respiratory failure, hypogammaglob"

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a male with respiratory failure who has undergone stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is experiencing symptoms of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient also has a history of lymphoma, depression, esophageal dysmotility, and is unable to take oral medications (POs). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory infection: Due to the patient's respiratory failure and dependence on low flow nasal oxygen, there is a risk of developing respiratory infections such as pneumonia.
2. GVHD complications: The patient's symptoms of GVHD, such as abdominal pain and cool skin, suggest ongoing inflammation and immune response. This may lead to further complications like organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Thrombosis: With a prolonged PTT and low platelet count, the patient is at risk of developing thrombotic events like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. Esophageal issues: The patient's esophageal dysmotility and recent esophageal dilation may increase the risk of aspiration and subsequent pneumonia.
5. Lymphoma recurrence or progression: The patient's history of lymphoma should be closely monitored for any signs of recurrence or disease progression.
6. Depression: The patient's depression should be managed appropriately to improve overall well-being and quality of life.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to take POs may lead to malnutrition"
