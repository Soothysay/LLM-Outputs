   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Has LLL infiltrate on CXR though degree of hypoxia seems to
   greater than might be expected to be accounted for by this.  Earlier in
   stay at OSH had pO2 of 51.  Given the degree of hypoxia shunt
   physiology is possible; echo with bubbles at OSH did not reveal any
   intracardiac shunt.  Given his cirrhosis, hepatopulmonary has been
   entertained though OSH bubble study was negative.  Appears to have been
   on steroids for long periods so PCP is [**Name Initial (PRE) **] consideration as well.
   - Treat as HAP for now with vanco/zosyn
   - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider adding
   caspo or vori
   - BiPAP overnight
   - Repeat ABG in AM
   - Consider CT chest
   - Consider repeat echo with bubbles here
   2. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegay and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.
   - Start lactulose/rifaximin
   - Guaiac stools
   - Consider para to evaluate for SBP
   3. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   4. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppresions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.
   - Check retic ct, iron studies, B12, folate
   5. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. If does not improve
   further, can eval for SIADH.
   6. Renal failure: Unclear baseline.  Does have elevated BUN/Cr ratio
   which may represent prerenal state or GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   7. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative. [**Month (only) 8**]
   have also been due to lactulose.
   - Will resend c.diff here
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates or toxin returns
   positive
   8. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission to
   OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have recieved 50mg on day
   of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent
   FEN: NPO while mental status is poor
   PPX: SC heparin; PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with known alcoholic cirrhosis and COPD. He was admitted to an outside hospital (OSH) with shortness of breath and is now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia. On arrival, the patient is intubated and sedated. The initial assessment reveals that the patient has a lower left lung lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, but the degree of hypoxia seems greater than expected. There is suspicion of shunt physiology, and an echocardiogram with bubbles did not reveal any intracardiac shunt. Given the patient's cirrhosis, hepatopulmonary syndrome is being considered, although the bubble study was negative. The patient may also have been on steroids for long periods, so Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a consideration as well.

The patient's laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and elevated INR. He also has splenomegaly and signs of portal hypertension. The patient is mildly encephalopathic, possibly due to hepatic origin. The plan includes starting lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, guaiac stools to check for gastrointestinal bleeding, and considering a paracentesis to evaluate for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

Other assessments and plans include treating possible causes of altered mental status, such as hypon"

   right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function
   are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no
   valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely
   related to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is
   seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Patent foramen ovale.

   venous system appears patent with reversed flow. Hepatic arterial and
   hepatic venous systems are grossly patent.   2. Small amount of

   with the patient's history of cirrhosis.    4. Cholelithiasis.
   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Multiple processes could be contributing: Cardiac shunt,
   PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and HPS.  Patient
s O2 sats now
   >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and blood products.  Levophed
   has been weaned somewhat overnight with platelets and FFP.  Suggests
   that shunting may be playing a significant role.  To address these
   different possible etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**], plan for
   RH cath on [**3-29**].  Will discuss with cardiology and try to obtain some
   dynamic measurements of function with NO, decreasing levophed, and
   other maneuvers.
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  As hypoxia improved today
   will plan to get CTA chest.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Will get further info with chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori
    - HPS
 possible given underlying cirrhosis.  Will f/u hepatology recs
   as below.
   .
   2. Hypotension: Patient requiring levophed for blood pressure support
   and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying etiology unclear but may
   include sedation, shunt physiology, infection, and underlying liver
   disease.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - consider PRBCs for additional intravascular volume
   3. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegay and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Could potentially have SBP.

   4. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   5. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppresions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient.
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac stools
   6. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. If does not improve
   further, can eval for SIADH.
   7. Renal failure: Unclear baseline.  Does have elevated BUN/Cr ratio
   which may represent prerenal state or GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   8. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - Will resend c.diff here once more
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates or toxin returns

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of hypoxia. The patient has a patent foramen ovale (PFO) on transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE), and there is evidence of a right-to-left shunt across the interatrial septum. The patient's hypoxia is multifactorial, with possible etiologies including cardiac shunt, pulmonary embolism (PE), intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS).

The patient requires levophed for blood pressure support and to maintain oxygen saturation (O2 sat) above 90%. The underlying etiology of hypotension is unclear but may include sedation, shunt physiology, infection, and underlying liver disease. The patient has a history of cirrhosis, and the liver is heterogeneous with a coarse texture consistent with cirrhosis. Additionally, the patient has thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly.

The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, with hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, hypoxia, infection, etc., contributing factors. The patient's anemia is likely multifactorial as well, including marrow suppression due to alcohol use, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB),"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and COPD who was admitted to an outside hospital (OSH) with shortness of breath. He is now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia. The patient's current condition includes invasive ventilation, arterial line, trans thoracic echo, bubble scan, ultrasound, nasal swab, and multi-lumen catheter placement. His vital signs are stable, but he has persistent hypoxia, requiring levophed support for blood pressure and oxygen saturation. He also has thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, altered mental status, anemia, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a possible respiratory problem. Possible causes include cardiac shunt, pulmonary embolism (PE), intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, or hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). Further diagnostic tests such as a right heart catheterization (RH cath) and CT angiography (CTA) will be planned to investigate these possibilities.

2. Hypotension: The patient requires levophed for blood pressure support. The underlying cause of hypotension is unclear but may include sedation, shunt physiology, infection, and underlying liver disease. Weaning off the pressors will be attempted, and other problems will be evaluated as well.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with history of cirrhosis and now with persistent and
   significant hypoxemia with concern for shunt physiology--both
   intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary with ECHO showing clear evidence of
   R->L flow during echo with increases in Right sided pressures.  He has
   had continued dynamic changes with left sided heart pressure which do
   argue strongly for significant intracardiac shunt as the dominant
   physiology here and hepato-pulmonary syndrome simply would not be as
   dynamic with small changes.  He may have porto-pulmonary hypertension
   driving some of the R->L shunt and progression here may explain the
   mainfestions now being more severe in the setting of chronic and
   previously insignificant PFO.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Hypoxemia
Diffuse causes have been postulated
   with shunt physiology clearly defined.
   -Right heart cath for
Shunt Run
 to evaluate intra-cardiac shunt as
   ongoing insults for correction
   -Will need CTA today for evaluate of possible PE and evaluation of the
   lower lobe infiltrate and possible infarct
   -Will add PEEP today to maintain patent airspaces
   -Continue ABX
   -Will need measurement of PA pressures
   -For COPD is on prednisone taper and weaning today with nebs continuing
   2)Hypotension-Likely consistent with sepsis and has possible pulmonary
   source given LLL infiltrate and hypothermia.  He has worsening of R->L
   shunt with decrease in systemic pressure so will wean today with
   careful attention to any changes in SaO2
   -Wean levophed today
   -Will follow up culture results
   -Will be interested to see CO as defined by swan ganz
   3)Cirrhosis-
   -Paracentesis today
   -Continue with lactulose/Rifaxamin
   -Appreciate hepatology input
   4)Thrombocytopenia-
   -Platelets replaced
   -[**Month (only) 8**] be splenic sequestration in the setting of cirrhosis
   -As time course of decline not clearly defined will have to follow up
   in HIT testing
   5)Renal Failure
   -Remains at cr-1.4

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis, currently experiencing significant hypoxemia and respiratory failure. There are concerns about shunt physiology, both intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary. The patient has evidence of R->L flow during echo, suggesting an intracardiac shunt. The patient is also hypotensive, likely due to sepsis with a possible pulmonary source. Other issues include thrombocytopenia, renal failure, and cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure-Hypoxemia: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to shunt physiology. Immediate intervention is required to correct the ongoing insults and maintain patent airspaces. A right heart catheterization for shunt run should be performed to evaluate intra-cardiac shunt. A CT angiography is needed to evaluate for possible pulmonary embolism and assess the lower lobe infiltrate. PEEP should be added to maintain patent airspaces. Continuous ABX should be administered. Measurement of PA pressures is necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be consistent with sepsis and has a possible pulmonary source given the LLL infiltrate and hypothermia. Close attention should be paid to changes in SaO2 while weaning levophed today. Follow-up culture results should be monitored, and CO should be assessed using a swan ganz catheter.

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Multiple processes could be contributing: Cardiac shunt,
   PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and HPS.  Patient
s O2 sats now
   >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and blood products.  MAP
   improves with platelets and FFP infusion.  Suggests that shunting may
   be playing a significant role.  To address these different possible
   etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization showed R to L shunt, probable PFO and
   hepatopulmonary syndrome contributing
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and COPD admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of hypoxia. The patient's condition has been complex and involves multiple potential medical complications. 

1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2) indicates hypoxia, which could be due to cardiac shunt, pulmonary embolism (PE), intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, or hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). The presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) on transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) suggests a cardiac shunt. Heparin has been deferred due to the possibility of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause of the hypoxia.

2. Hypotension: The patient requires norepinephrine (levophed) for blood pressure support. The underlying etiology of the hypotension is unclear but may include sedation, shunt physiology, infection, and underlying liver disease. Pressors should be weaned as tolerated.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, as evidenced by low albumin levels, elevated international normalized ratio (INR), splenomegaly, and thrombocytopenia. Lactulose and rifaximin have been started for the management of hepatic encephalopathy. Further hepatology recommendations will be followed.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has dropped precipitously recently. Possible causes include bone marrow suppression (due to ethanol), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and nutritional deficiencies. Iron supplementation has been given, and guaiac-positive stools are being monitored due to the possibility of GIB.

5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, with contributing factors including hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, hypoxia, infection, etc. Treatment of possible causes individually is recommended.

6. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level has improved from a nadir of 129. It will be monitored further.

7. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is around 1.0, now improved to 1.1. The elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine ratio suggests a pre-renal state and gastrointestinal bleeding. Renal status will be followed closely.

8. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea was initially treated as Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) but was toxin negative at the outside hospital and again here. Hold on PO vancomycin or flagyl unless decompensates or toxin returns positive.

9. COPD: The patient is being treated for COPD exacerbation, which appears"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status and hypotension. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis of the liver. He presented with gastrointestinal bleeding, resulting in acute blood loss and anemia. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his critical condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates inadequate perfusion to vital organs. This can lead to organ damage and failure if not promptly addressed.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation level of 94% is below the normal range, indicating inadequate oxygenation. This may be due to respiratory issues or impaired lung function.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The elevated levels of creatinine and lactate suggest impaired kidney function. This can be a result of decreased perfusion, hypotension, or direct injury to the kidneys.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis puts him at risk for liver failure. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.
5. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and presence of fever may indicate an underlying infection. Infections in critically ill patients can rapidly progress and lead to sepsis and septic shock.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. 

The patient has undergone several diagnostic procedures including a CT chest, which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) but revealed left lower lobe (LLL) consolidation, possibly due to pneumonia or aspiration. The CT head did not reveal any acute intracranial process, but there were chronic microvascular changes. The right heart catheterization indicated a patent foramen ovale (PFO) that was not significant according to cardiology. There were no interventions made during this procedure. 

The patient also tested positive for guaiac, indicating the presence of blood in the stool. An acute drop in hematocrit (Hct) and platelet count was observed, resulting in the administration of 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 2 units of platelets. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to evaluate for possible retroperitoneal bleeding, but no bleeding was found. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics, vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), were administered on 03/29/2198 at 07:29 PM and 03/30/2198 at 04:04 AM, respectively.

The patient is currently on several infusions including fentanyl for pain management, midazolam for sedation, and norepinephrine for blood pressure support. Additional medications include pantoprazole for acid reflux. 

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. 

In terms of vital signs, the patient's maximum temperature recorded was 37.6°C (99.6°F), with the current temperature being 35.4°C (95.8°F). The heart rate ranges between 52 and 79 beats per minute, with a current rate of 58 bpm. Blood pressure readings vary between 120/48 mmHg and 164/68 mmHg, with the current reading being 153/61 mmHg. The respiratory rate is within the range of 8-20 breaths per minute, with a current rate of 8 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation remains at 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 5,172 mL and output of 2,055 mL, resulting in a balance of 3,117 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation support with a mode of CPAP/PSV, with a tidal volume (Vt) ranging from 121-890 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi"

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Multiple processes could be contributing: Cardiac shunt,
   PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and HPS.  Patient
s O2 sats now
   >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and blood products.  MAP
   improves with platelets and FFP infusion.  Suggests that shunting may
   be playing a significant role.  To address these different possible
   etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori
    - HPS
 possible given underlying cirrhosis.  Will f/u hepatology recs
   as below.
   2. Hypotension: Patient requiring levophed for blood pressure support
   and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying etiology unclear but may
   include sedation, shunt physiology, infection, and underlying liver
   disease.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - [**Name (NI) **] improving intravascular volume
   3. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   4. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient.
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   5. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   6. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   7. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 1.1.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   8. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - C. diff neg x1, with one sample pending
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates or toxin returns
   positive
   9. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission to
   OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on day
   of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with known alcoholic cirrhosis and COPD. He presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and is now being transferred to the ICU for further evaluation of hypoxia. The patient requires mechanical ventilation and has evidence of portal hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and possible hepatic encephalopathy. He also has anemia, altered mental status, hyponatremia, renal failure, diarrhea, and COPD. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential complications including cardiac shunt, pulmonary embolism (PE), intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), and septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac shunt: The patient's hypoxia may be due to a cardiac shunt, as indicated by the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Further evaluation is needed, including right heart catheterization.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Given the prolonged hospital stay and immobilization, there is a possibility of PE. Heparin therapy should be considered, but only after ruling out heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) with a HIT antibody panel.
3. Intrinsic lung disease: Although IPF is mentioned in the OSH notes, it does not appear to be significant on the chest CT."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with cirrhosis now admit with hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of what appears to be left sided pneumonia, no evidence
   of PE, PFO but no active R->L shunt at catheterization yesterday and
   concern for persistent hepatopulmonary syndrome but with limited
   capacity to evaluate further.  What we are left with is a significant
   persistent oxygen requirement and this is driven by intrapulmonary
   shunt in large part with
pneumonia, atelectasis and some component of
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome.  The pneumonia and atelectasis may well be
   dynamic and will work to optimize status as we move to try extubation.
   1)Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure-  Secondary to above
   -Will perform bronch today to clear area of collapse and infection as
   best as possible to allow minimization of shunt fraction
   -Zosyn/Vanco to continue
   -Will maintain PSV support now and keep PEEP=[**5-11**]
   -Will pursue intra-pulmonary shunt study with nuclear scan to attempt
   to quantify extent of intrapulmonary shunt
   -Would hope to move to extubation today if at all possible as primary
   requirement is oxygen support and FIO2 can be adjusted with high flow
   once testing has been safely concluded.
   2) ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)-
   -Will look to hemolysis
   -no source of bleed clearly seen
   -Did have paracentesis yesterday and there is concern for IP bleeding
   but not suggested on CT scan this am which did not show RP bleeding
   3)Cirrhosis-
   -Lactulose/Rifax for MS
   [**Name13 (STitle) 5378**] up OB pos stools
   -Ascites without evidence of infection

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient appears to have left-sided pneumonia, but no evidence of pulmonary embolism or right-to-left shunt was found during cardiac catheterization. There is concern for persistent hepatopulmonary syndrome, but further evaluation is limited. The patient requires significant oxygen support due to intrapulmonary shunt caused by pneumonia, atelectasis, and hepato-pulmonary syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to pneumonia, atelectasis, and hepato-pulmonary syndrome. The primary requirement is oxygen support, and the plan includes performing bronchoscopy to clear the area of collapse and infection, maintaining pressure support ventilation (PSV) with adjusted PEEP levels, and pursuing an intra-pulmonary shunt study with nuclear scan to quantify the extent of intrapulmonary shunt.
2. Acute Anemia Secondary to Blood Loss (Hemorrhage, Bleeding): The patient has acute anemia overnight, possibly due to blood loss. No source of bleed is clearly seen on CT scan. The plan includes looking for hemolysis and considering potential causes of bleeding.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of cirrhosis, and measures are being taken to manage complications such as mental status changes and ascites"

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Multiple processes could be contributing: Cardiac shunt,
   PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and HPS.  Patient
s O2 sats now
   >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and blood products.  MAP
   improves with platelets and FFP infusion.  Suggests that shunting may
   be playing a significant role.  To address these different possible
   etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization showed R to L shunt, probable PFO and
   hepatopulmonary syndrome contributing
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori if decompensates
    - HPS
 possible given underlying cirrhosis.  Will f/u hepatology recs
   as below.
   - Will plan on Nuc Med study to further quantify HPS
   - Plan to extubate after Nuc Med study
   2. Hypotension: Patient requiring levophed for blood pressure support
   and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying etiology unclear but may
   include sedation, shunt physiology, infection, and underlying liver
   disease.
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - [**Name (NI) **] improving intravascular volume
   3. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   - Add direct/indirect bilirubin to labs
   4. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient. DDx includes DIC, TTP but not likely HIT as neg x2
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   - F/u bilirubin breakdown and add peripheral smear
   5. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   6. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   7. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 1.1.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   8. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - C. diff neg x1, with one sample pending
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates or toxin returns
   positive
   9. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission to
   OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on day
   of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and COPD admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath. He is intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's hypoxia is likely due to multiple factors including cardiac shunt, pulmonary embolism (PE), intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). His vital signs are stable, but he requires vasopressor support. Laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, hyponatremia, anemia, and renal failure. The patient has a history of IPF, but it does not appear significant on chest CT. He also has a questionable ascites and splenomegaly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation may be due to cardiac shunt, PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, or HPS. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Hypotension: The patient requires vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure, suggesting possible sepsis, shunt physiology, infection, or underlying liver disease.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, which is associated with portal hypertension and potential complications like spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level, likely due to marrow suppression from alcohol"

   Shunt study: There is somewhat heterogenous pulmonary perfusion but
   without segmental or large subsegmental defects. There is tracer
   activity in the liver, spleen, kidneys, brain and thyroid gland, which
   is abnormal and indicates the presence of a right-to-left shunt.
   IMPRESSION: Study is consistent with the presence of a right-to-left
   shunt.
   CT abd/pelvis: 1. No evidence for retroperitoneal or other hematoma. 2.
   Moderate simple abdominal and pelvic ascites. 3. Nodular liver
   consistent with cirrhosis. 4. Diffuse pancreatic calcifications with
   atrophy suggestive of chronic pancreatitis. 5. Bilateral avascular
   necrosis of the femoral heads without collapse. 6. Bibasilar
   consolidations concerning for aspiration pneumonia. 7. Nonobstructive
   renal calculi with bilateral renal cysts. 8. Cholelithiasis without
   cholecystitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   1. Hypoxia: Initially felt that multiple processes could be
   contributing: Cardiac shunt, PE, intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia, and
   HPS.  Initially got O2 sats >90% by keeping MAPs > 70 with levophed and
   blood products.  MAP improves with platelets and FFP infusion.
   Suggests that shunting may be playing a significant role.  Hypoxia Most
   likely HPS with some cardiac shunting and L-sided PNA.  To address
   these different possible etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization showed R to L shunt, probable PFO and
   hepatopulmonary syndrome contributing
   - HPS
 likely given underlying cirrhosis and suggested by shunt
   study.  Will f/u hepatology recs as below.  Consider starting
   pentyoxyphylline.
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori if decompensates
   - Patient still on FIO2 80% and not waking up this morning.  O2 sats
   still upper 80s to low 90s, not yet ready for extubation.
   2. Hypotension: Resolving.  Patient initially required levophed for
   blood pressure support and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying
   etiology unclear but may include sedation, shunt physiology, infection,
   and underlying liver disease.  Levophed now weaned off.
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - [**Name (NI) **] improving intravascular volume
   3. Thrombocytopenia: Unable to increase platelets despite 8 units in 24
   hours (5 since 8 pm last night).  HIT Ab neg here and at OSH.  Smear
   unremarkable.  DIC labs negative.  Patient is already on steroids if
   ITP is contributing.  Hematology is following, their assistance is
   appreciated.
   - Vancomycin was stopped [**3-30**].  Will stop zosyn [**3-31**] as possible
   medication effect could be contributing.
   - change PPI to Ranitidine
   - f/u heme recs
   4. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   - Add direct/indirect bilirubin to labs
   5. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient. DIC labs negative.  HIT as neg x2.   Peripheral
   smear not suggestive.
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   - F/u bilirubin breakdown
   6. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   7. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   8. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 1.1.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   9. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here x2. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates then resend for C.
   diff.
   10. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission
   to OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on
   day of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and COPD admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath. He is currently intubated and sedated, and has been receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of chronic pancreatitis and is at risk for developing hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). He also has a possible patent foramen ovale (PFO) based on a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed on [**3-28**]. The right heart catheterization showed a right-to-left shunt, likely due to PFO and contributing to hypoxia. 

The patient's thrombocytopenia has not improved despite receiving 8 units of platelets in 24 hours. There are concerns about drug-induced thrombocytopenia, and vancomycin has been stopped. 

His liver function tests indicate cirrhosis with mildly elevated INR and low albumin. He is also showing signs of portal hypertension with splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. 

The patient has anemia, which is likely multifactorial including alcohol-related bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and possible deficiencies. 

His altered mental status is likely due to a combination of factors such as hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, hypoxia, infection, etc. 

The patient has hyponatremia, which has improved"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with cirrhosis now admit with hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of what appears to be left sided pneumonia, no evidence
   of PE, PFO but no active R->L shunt at catheterization yesterday and
   concern for persistent hepatopulmonary syndrome but with limited
   capacity to evaluate further.  What we are left with is a significant
   persistent oxygen requirement and this is driven by intrapulmonary
   shunt in large part with pneumonia, atelectasis and some component of
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome.  The pneumonia and atelectasis may well be
   dynamic and will work to optimize status as we move to try extubation.
   1)Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure-  Secondary to above
   - sats decreased to 86% on PS 0/5 on 80% FiO2.
   - Zosyn to continue, off vanc due to thrombocytopenia
   - Will maintain PSV support now and keep sats>89%
   - new pulm infiltrates may be CHF with platelet transfusion, new
   infection, hemorrhage
    2) Acute blood loss anemia
   - No evidence of hemolysis, checking repeat smear
   - no source of bleed clearly seen
   - Did have paracentesis yesterday and there is concern for IP bleeding
   but not suggested on CT scan this am which did not show RP bleeding
   3) Acute thrombocytopenia
   - refractory to transfusions, ? ITP vs HIT unlikely vs leukemia
   - will ask hematology to reassess
   - on steroids for COPD but may require higher doses
   - will d/c Zosyn as possible culprit
   - switch PPI to H2 blocker
   4) Cirrhosis-
   -Lactulose/Rifax for MS

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, COPD, who presented to the ICU after 20 days of progressive respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and unable to provide history. The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute blood loss anemia, acute thrombocytopenia, and cirrhosis.

The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to intrapulmonary shunt, pneumonia, atelectasis, and hepato-pulmonary syndrome. The plan is to maintain pressure support ventilation (PSV) support and keep oxygen saturation (sats) >89%. There is concern for new pulmonary infiltrates, which may be due to congestive heart failure (CHF), infection, or hemorrhage.

The patient also has acute blood loss anemia with no evidence of hemolysis. The source of the bleed is unclear, but there is concern for intra-abdominal bleeding. Repeat smear is being checked, and hematology input is appreciated.

Acute thrombocytopenia is present and refractory to transfusions. The cause is uncertain, but ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura), HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), or leukemia are being considered. Hematology reassessment is planned, and the patient may require higher doses of steroids for COPD.

The patient has a history of cirrhosis and is being"

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   #. Acute hypoxic decompensation: CXRs have continued to worsen over the
   last 24-30 hours.  Picture is concerning for pulmonary edema vs.
   pulmonary hemorrhage or both.  O2 sats now in the 70s on maximum
   ventillatory support.  SBPs 75-80 on 2 pressors (levophed and
   vasopressin).
   - start neosynephrine for additional BP support
   - lasix 40 mg IV and lasix gtt to diurese
   - blood product support: PRBCs, FFP, platelets
   - will actively follow through-out the day.
   #. Hypoxia on presentation: Initially felt that multiple processes
   could be contributing: Cardiac shunt, PE, intrinsic lung disease,
   pneumonia, and HPS.  Initially got O2 sats >90% by keeping MAPs > 70
   with levophed and blood products.  MAP improves with platelets and FFP
   infusion.  Suggests that shunting may be playing a significant role.
   Hypoxia Most likely HPS with some cardiac shunting and L-sided PNA.  To
   address these different possible etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization showed R to L shunt, probable PFO and
   hepatopulmonary syndrome contributing
   - HPS
 likely given underlying cirrhosis and suggested by shunt
   study.  Will f/u hepatology recs as below.  Consider starting
   pentyoxyphylline.
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori if decompensates
   - Patient still on FIO2 80% and not waking up this morning.  O2 sats
   still upper 80s to low 90s, not yet ready for extubation.
   #. Hypotension: Cause unclear this morning.  Most likely due to volume
   loss in the setting of bleeding, though could be a component of sepsis
   as well.
   - support with pressors as above.
   - support with blood products as above
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Unable to increase platelets despite multiple
   transfusions over the past 48+ hours.  HIT Ab neg here and at OSH.
   Smear unremarkable.  DIC labs negative.  Patient is already on steroids
   if ITP is contributing.  Trial yesterday suggests that antibodies may
   not necessarily be playing a role.  Hematology is following, their
   assistance is appreciated.
   - ABO matched (type B) platelets for now. Consider HLA matched
   platelets
   - Vancomycin was stopped [**3-30**].  Will stop zosyn [**3-31**] as possible
   medication effect could be contributing.
   - PPI changed to Ranitidine [**3-31**]
   - f/u heme recs
   #. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   - Add direct/indirect bilirubin to labs
   #. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient. DIC labs negative.  HIT as neg x2.   Peripheral
   smear not suggestive.
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   - F/u bilirubin breakdown
   #. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   #. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   #. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 0.9.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   #. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here x2. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates then resend for C.
   diff.
   #. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission to
   OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on day
   of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent
   FEN: Cont TF, PRBCs and Plts as needed

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and COPD admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath. He is currently in the ICU due to acute hypoxic decompensation and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been deteriorating over the past 24-30 hours, with worsening chest X-rays indicating pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, or both. Oxygen saturation levels have dropped to the 70s on maximum ventilatory support, and blood pressures are in the range of 75-80 mmHg despite the use of two pressors (levophed and vasopressin).

The assessment and plan section of the note indicates multiple potential causes for the patient's hypoxia, including cardiac shunt, pulmonary embolism (PE), intrinsic lung disease, pneumonia (L-sided PNA), and hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). The note also mentions thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis, anemia, altered mental status, hyponatremia, renal failure, diarrhea, and COPD as separate issues that need to be addressed.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include worsening pulmonary edema or hemorrhage, septic shock due to infection, further deterioration of renal function, progression of liver failure, development of bleeding tendencies, and potential complications related to mechanical ventilation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's oxygen saturation levels, blood pressures, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis, COPD admitted to an OSH
   with SOB now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia
   #. Acute hypoxic decompensation: CXRs have continued to worsen over the
   last 24-30 hours.  Picture is concerning for pulmonary edema vs.
   pulmonary hemorrhage or both.  O2 sats now in the 70s on maximum
   ventillatory support.  SBPs ~80 on 2 pressors (levophed and
   vasopressin).
   - start neosynephrine for additional BP support
   -
   #. Hypoxia on presentation: Initially felt that multiple processes
   could be contributing: Cardiac shunt, PE, intrinsic lung disease,
   pneumonia, and HPS.  Initially got O2 sats >90% by keeping MAPs > 70
   with levophed and blood products.  MAP improves with platelets and FFP
   infusion.  Suggests that shunting may be playing a significant role.
   Hypoxia Most likely HPS with some cardiac shunting and L-sided PNA.  To
   address these different possible etiologies:
    - Cardiac shunt
 evidence for this with PFO on TTE on [**3-28**]. Right
   heart catheterization showed R to L shunt, probable PFO and
   hepatopulmonary syndrome contributing
   - HPS
 likely given underlying cirrhosis and suggested by shunt
   study.  Will f/u hepatology recs as below.  Consider starting
   pentyoxyphylline.
    - PE
 possible given patient
s prolonged OSH course.  Have deferred
   starting heparin given pending HIT Ab panel.  Prelim read on chest CT
   is no PE in central vessels, although limited study.
    - Intrinsic lung disease
 history of IPF from OSH notes, but does not
   appear so based on CXR.  Path from OSH biopsy now in [**State 5354**] and
   unobtainable for several days.  Does not appear to be significant IPF
   on chest CT.
    - Infection / PNA - has LLL infiltrate on CXR though cannot account
   for all of the patient
s hypoxia.
             - Cont. vanco/zosyn for HAP,
             - check induced sputum for PCP given [**Name9 (PRE) 4849**] steroid use.
             - Given torulopsis glabrata on bronchial washings, consider
   adding caspo or vori if decompensates
   - Patient still on FIO2 80% and not waking up this morning.  O2 sats
   still upper 80s to low 90s, not yet ready for extubation.
   2. Hypotension: Resolving.  Patient initially required levophed for
   blood pressure support and to help maintain O2 sats.  Underlying
   etiology unclear but may include sedation, shunt physiology, infection,
   and underlying liver disease.  Levophed now weaned off.
   - w/u of other problems as above and below
   - [**Name (NI) **] improving intravascular volume
   3. Thrombocytopenia: Unable to increase platelets despite 8 units in 24
   hours (5 since 8 pm last night).  HIT Ab neg here and at OSH.  Smear
   unremarkable.  DIC labs negative.  Patient is already on steroids if
   ITP is contributing.  Hematology is following, their assistance is
   appreciated.
   - Vancomycin was stopped [**3-30**].  Will stop zosyn [**3-31**] as possible
   medication effect could be contributing.
   - change PPI to Ranitidine
   - f/u heme recs
   4. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.
   Diagnostic para: c/w portal HTN, no SBP
   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   - Add direct/indirect bilirubin to labs
   5. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient. DIC labs negative.  HIT as neg x2.   Peripheral
   smear not suggestive.
   - iron supplementation
   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   - F/u bilirubin breakdown
   6. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   7. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   8. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 1.1.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.
   - Follow and try to determine baseline status
   9. Diarrhea: Was being treated as c.diff though toxin negative at OSH
   and again here x2. [**Month (only) 8**] have also been due to lactulose.
   - Hold on PO vanco or flagyl unless decompensates then resend for C.
   diff.
   10. COPD: Initially treated as primary diagnosis at time of admission
   to OSH. On steroid taper at OSH and appears to have received 50mg on
   day of transfer.
   - Continue taper
   - Albuterol/atrovent
   FEN: Cont TF, [**Month (only) **] and Plts as needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and COPD admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute hypoxic decompensation. The patient's oxygen saturation levels are in the 70s on maximum ventilatory support, and blood pressure support is being provided using neosynephrine. The patient has multiple comorbidities including thrombocytopenia, anemia, altered mental status, hyponatremia, renal failure, diarrhea, and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxic decompensation and worsening chest X-rays suggest the possibility of ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by widespread inflammation in the lungs.
2. Hepatopulmonary Syndrome (HPS): Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and the presence of a right-to-left shunt on echocardiography, HPS should be considered as a potential cause of the hypoxia.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the preliminary chest CT scan showed no PE, it cannot be completely ruled out, especially considering the patient's prolonged bed rest during his hospital stay.
4. Infection/Pneumonia: The presence of LLL infiltrate on the chest X-ray indicates a possible lung infection. Continued antibiotic therapy is warranted.
5. Thrombocytopenia: Despite receiving 8"

   - [**Name (NI) **] improving intravascular volume
   3. Thrombocytopenia: Unable to increase platelets despite 8 units in 24
   hours (5 since 8 pm last night).  HIT Ab neg here and at OSH.  Smear
   unremarkable.  DIC labs negative.  Patient is already on steroids if
   ITP is contributing.  Hematology is following, their assistance is
   appreciated.
   - Vancomycin was stopped [**3-30**].  Will stop zosyn [**3-31**] as possible
   medication effect could be contributing.
   - change PPI to Ranitidine
   - f/u heme recs
   4. Cirrhosis: Per OSH notes, patient with alcoholic cirrhosis.  Has low
   albumin and somewhat elevated INR.  Also with splenomegaly and
   thrombocytopenia.  At this time, appears mildy encephalopathic though
   not clear if this if hepatic in origin.  Patient with tender abdomen.

   - lactulose/rifaximin
   - f/u hepatology recs: no new recs
   - Add direct/indirect bilirubin to labs
   5. Anemia: Likely multifactorial including marrow suppressions (EtOH),
   GIB (guaiac + at OSH) and possible deficiencies.  Hct 42 on initial
   presentation to OSH and between 38 and 40 until [**3-18**].  Unclear why the
   precipitous drop recently.  Retic count elevated (6.6), iron low, B12 &
   folate sufficient. DIC labs negative.  HIT as neg x2.   Peripheral
   smear not suggestive.

   - guaiac pos stools, only on prophylactic anticoagulation
   - F/u bilirubin breakdown
   6. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial with hyponatremia,
   hepatic enceph, hypoxia, infection, etc contributing.
   - Treat possible causes individually
   - CT head
   7. Hyponatremia: Improved from nadir of 129. Will trend.
   8. Renal failure: Baseline from OSH is ~1.0, now improved to 1.1.
   Likely elevated BUN/Cr ratio which may represent prerenal state and
   GIB.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old man with known alcoholic cirrhosis and COPD, admitted to the OSH with shortness of breath, now being transferred for further evaluation of hypoxia. The patient's medical history includes PFO on TTE, right heart catheterization showing R to L shunt, probable PFO, and hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, likely due to HPS with some cardiac shunting and left-sided pneumonia (L-sided PNA). Other possible etiologies for the hypoxia include pulmonary embolism (PE), intrinsic lung disease, and infection/PNA. 

The patient also has thrombocytopenia, possibly due to immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) or other causes such as DIC or liver disease. The patient is already on steroids for presumed ITP. 

The patient has cirrhosis with low albumin and somewhat elevated INR, as well as splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. He is mildly encephalopathic, though it is unclear if this is of hepatic origin. 

The patient also has anemia, likely multifactorial including marrow suppression (EtOH), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and possible deficiencies. His Hct has dropped precipitously recently.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with cirrhosis now admit with hypoxemic respiratory failure
   in the setting of what appears to be left sided pneumonia, no evidence
   of PE, PFO but no active R->L shunt at catheterization yesterday and
   concern for persistent hepatopulmonary syndrome but with limited
   capacity to evaluate further.  What we are left with is a significant
   persistent oxygen requirement and this is driven by intrapulmonary
   shunt in large part with pneumonia, atelectasis and some component of
   hepato-pulmonary syndrome.  The pneumonia and atelectasis may well be
   dynamic and will work to optimize status as we move to try extubation.
   1)Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure-  Secondary to above
   - sats decreased furthur this morning in the setting of suctioned
   pink-frothy secretions and xray showing diffuse infiltrates/white out.
   - Zosyn to continue, off vanc due to thrombocytopenia
   - Will maintain on CMV with slightly higher PEEPs given CHF vs alveolar
   hemorrhage vs less likely new infection
    2) Acute blood loss anemia
   - No evidence of hemolysis, checking repeat smear
   - appears to have bloody ETT secretions
   - Did have paracentesis [**3-30**] and there was concern for IP bleeding but
   not suggested on CT scan 3/28which did not show RP bleeding
   3) Acute thrombocytopenia
   - refractory to transfusions, ? ITP vs HIT unlikely
   - appreciate heme recs. platelets are ABO matched, will need HLA
   matched
   - on steroids for COPD but may require higher doses
   - Zosyn and Vanc were d/c'd
   - switch PPI to H2 blocker
    4) Cirrhosis-
   -Lactulose/Rifax for MS
   [**Name13 (STitle) 5378**] up OB pos stools
   - Ascites without evidence of infection
   5) Shock
   - question of sedation vs less likely hemorrhagic/hypovolemic
   - being transfused plat, FFP and PRBC x 1

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis who was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure in the setting of left-sided pneumonia. The patient has persistent oxygen requirements driven by intrapulmonary shunt, pneumonia, atelectasis, and a component of hepato-pulmonary syndrome. The pneumonia and atelectasis may be dynamic and will be optimized as the patient moves towards extubation. The patient's current conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute blood loss anemia, acute thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis, and shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing significant oxygen requirements due to intrapulmonary shunt, pneumonia, atelectasis, and hepato-pulmonary syndrome. This condition can lead to further respiratory distress and complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient has evidence of bloody ETT secretions and a history of paracentesis, which raises concerns for intra-abdominal bleeding. This condition can lead to hemodynamic instability and may require blood transfusions.
3. Acute Thrombocytopenia: The patient has refractory thrombocytopenia, likely due to immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). This condition"
