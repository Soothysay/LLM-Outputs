","The patient is a 48-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy and a history of multiple myocardial infarctions, who presented with abdominal pain and jaundice secondary to a common bile duct stone. He was admitted to Hospital 1188, where he received antibiotics (Unasyn) and flagyl, resulting in a bump in creatinine (Cr) to 1.7 and a drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP). The patient was then transferred to this hospital for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

Upon arrival, the patient experienced a transient drop in blood pressure to around 70/40 mmHg without obvious intervention, which he recovered from. On arrival, the patient's platelet count dropped to 9 and the international normalized ratio (INR) was elevated, whereas platelets were normal at the previous hospital. His hepatobiliary function is normal, with the primary issue being in the biliary system. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease (CAD) with multiple myocardial infarctions and stents, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15% and severe mitral regurgitation (MR), who underwent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He also has a history of cholecystectomy, hyperlipidemia, anemia, and peptic ulcer disease. The patient is currently on disability and has a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, multiple myocardial infarctions, and stents. He was admitted to another hospital with abdominal pain and jaundice due to a common bile duct (CBD) stone, and later developed fevers. He was started on antibiotics (Unasyn/Flagyl) but experienced a significant drop in blood pressure and an increase in creatinine level. He was transferred to our ICU for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Upon arrival, his platelet count dropped further, and his blood pressure continued to fluctuate. He also has worsening renal function, elevated liver enzymes, and a positive Hepatitis B IgM antibody indicating recent infection. The patient's condition is critical, and the possible diagnoses include CBD stone/biliary sepsis, acute cholangitis, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been sporadically dropping, which could indicate impending septic physiology. It is important to continue antibiotics and avoid beta-blockers and diuretics. Fluid resuscitation should be cautious due to the patient's cardiomyopathy.
2. Cholangitis: ERCP is planned potentially tomorrow, and the patient should remain on Unasyn.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased significantly, indicating potential pre-"

   beta-blocker/diuretics; cautious fluid resuscitation
   *Cholangitis: ERCP planned potentially tomorrow.
   *Acute renal failure: Cr 1.1 at OSH and peaked as high as 2.7, though
   slightly down now. Could represent pre-renal picture given low BP
s and
   chronic low forward-flow
   *Thrombocytopenia: Sudden drop over past couple days. Possibilites
   include TTS/HUS given concomittant renal failure and diarrhea (unusual
   timing as this would have evolved over several days while being
   hospitalized for obsturctive jaundice), medication reaction either
   heparin vs beta-lactams (course atypical for heparin with profound
   drop). Hemolysis labs so far
     Will obtain  smear, request Hematologist consult, avoid use of

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%) admitted from Hospital 1188 with abdominal pain and jaundice due to a common bile duct (CBD) stone. He was initially treated with Unasyn/Flagyl, which resulted in an increase in creatinine (Cr) to 1.7 and a drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP). The patient was then transferred to our hospital for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

During his stay, the patient experienced a transient drop in blood pressure to around 70/40 mmHg but recovered without any intervention. Upon arrival, his platelet count dropped to 9,000/µL, and his international normalized ratio (INR) was elevated. His hepatobiliary function is normal, with primary dark bilirubin (TB).

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous myocardial infarctions (MIs), and stent placement. He is Hepatitis B surface antigen negative but positive for antibodies. The patient's medical, social, and family history, as well as review of systems, remains unchanged except for the noted above and below.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 87/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute"

   48 year-old male with a history of CAD and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
   15%) who presents with abdominal pain and jaundice with CBD dilatation
   on imaging.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Baseline SBPs per patient run 80s-90s.  SBPs currently
   low 90s but suspect this is related to his severe cardiomyopathy.  Has
   been afebrile overnight, but previous concern for infectious cause with
   fever earlier in hospital course.
   - Consider adding back diuretics, BB as tolerated.
   - Keep net even to -500cc today.
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Cholangitis:  Evidence of CBD dilatation on OSH imaging.
   Interestingly however, he is only mildly tender over RUQ rather the
   majority of his discomfort is mid abdomen.  No rebound/guarding.
   T.bili with isolated elevation now to 11.5 (normal alk phos).
   - Consider d/c unasyn if remains afebrile
   - holding ASA pending ERCP
   - ERCP if platelets increase
   - serial abdominal exams
   .
   # ARF:  Unclear baseline, but 2.1 on initial presentation.  Creatinine
   had risen to 2.7 but now down to 1.5 with IVF.  Concerning in the
   setting of his thrombocytopenia and fever would be TTP-HUS, but appears
   to be pre-renal.  Urine lytes c/w this.
   - f/u repeat creatinine
   - gentle IVFs PRN
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Differential includes platelet clumping, DIC,
   TTP-HUS, medication induced.    Concerning, however, is also his
   concomitant bump in renal function in conjunction with fever which
   might suggest TTP/HUS.  Unclear whether he received SC heparin at OSH,
   but likely used there for prophylaxis.  Platelets yesterday at OSH were
   in the 250s and seems less c/w HIT.  Heme/Onc feel this is most c/w ITP
   given lack of schistocytes on peripheral smear.
   - Continue steriods
   - monitor plts [**Hospital1 7**].
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Appears mildly volume overloaded on exam.  Thus, may
   represent hypervolemic hyponatremia.
   - consider diuretics overnight if pressure tolerates.
   - repeat check in PM
   .
   # Ischemic cardiomyopathy:  Currently appears well compensated.
   - holding antihypertensive meds and diuretics overnight d/t relative
   hypotension and hyponatremia.
   - will get echocardiogram to reassess cardiac function.
   .
   # CAD: Holding BB given above, holding ASA for ERCP, holding statin d/t
   LFT abnormalities.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Holding statin as above.
   .
   # Anemia:  Unclear baseline.  Hct currently stable at 31 with low MCV
   and elevated RDW.
   - continue to trend hct
   .
   # PUD:  Given pt was on PPI as outpatient at which time platelets were
   normal, seems very unlikely cause.
   - continue PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 15%). He presents with abdominal pain and jaundice, along with CBD dilatation on imaging. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure in the low 90s, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient has several medical complications, including acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, abdominal pain, and a history of cardiomyopathy and hypotension. The abdominal pain is primarily located in the mid-abdomen, without rebound or guarding. His liver enzymes are elevated, with an isolated elevation in total bilirubin to 11.5 mg/dL. The patient's platelet count remains low, and there is a concern for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS) or immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). 

Other lab findings include hyponatremia, anemia, and elevated lipase levels. The patient's electrolytes are slightly imbalanced, with low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient is currently on several medications, including pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, and diuretics, and is holding certain"

   48 year-old male with a history of CAD and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
   15%) who presents with abdominal pain and jaundice with CBD dilatation
   on imaging.
   .
   # Hypotension:  Baseline SBPs per patient run 80s-90s.  SBPs currently
   low 90s.  Given his severe cardiomyopathy, suspect mainly in this
   setting.  Has been afebrile overnight, but previous concern for
   infectious cause.
   - Consider adding back diuretics, BB as tolerated
   - Keep net even to -500cc today.
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # Cholangitis:  Evidence of retained stone and CBD dilatation on OSH
   imaging.  Interestingly however, he is only mildly tender over RUQ
   rather the majority of his discomfort is mid abdomen.  No
   rebound/guarding.  T.bili with isolated elevation now to 11.5 (normal
   alk phos).
   - continue unasyn
   - will review OSH imaging with out radiologists
   - holding ASA pending ERCP
   - ERCP likely Monday if he remains clinically stable
   - serial abdominal exams
   .
   # ARF:  Unclear baseline, but creatinine 1.15 on initial presentation
   so suspect generally normal.  Creatinine had risen to 2.7 prior to
   transfer to [**Hospital1 19**] (repeat here pending).  Does appear mildly volume
   down, but bump in renal function seems out of proportion.  As above,
   does have low BPs at baseline with dip to the 70s at OSH, but seems
   less likely ATN.  More concerning in the setting of his
   thrombocytopenia and fever would be TTP-HUS.
   - f/u repeat creatinine here
   - adding on hemolysis labs
   - gentle IVFs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Differential includes platelet clumping, DIC,
   TTP-HUS, medication induced.  INR also climbing and given concern for
   sepsis, may be c/w DIC.  Concerning, however, is also his concomitant
   bump in renal function in conjunction with fever which might suggest
   TTP/HUS.  Unclear whether he received SC heparin at OSH, but likely
   used there for prophylaxis.  Platelets yesterday at OSH were in the
   250s and seems less c/w HIT.  He was transferred on a PPI which can
   cause thrombocytopenia however he was taking a PPI as an outpatient
   without difficulty prior to admission.
   - send yellow top to eval for clumping
   - checking hemolysis labs, peripheral smear
   - sending DIC panel
   - reviewing peripheral smear
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Does not appear volume overloaded on exam, rather
   appears mildly down.  Thus, may represent hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - checking urine lytes
   - holding diuretics overnight
   - gentle IVFs with repeat check
   .
   # Ischemic cardiomyopathy:  Currently appears well compensated.
   - holding antihypertensive meds and diuretics overnight d/t relative

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy. He presents with abdominal pain and jaundice, along with CBD dilatation on imaging. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 90s, heart rate in the 80s, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has been feeling well overnight and there is no evidence of bleeding despite low platelet counts.

Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels from 1.15 on initial presentation to 2.7 prior to transfer. This suggests that his renal function is worsening.
2. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, including elevated alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin. This may be due to cholangitis or other liver issues.
3. Abdominal Pain: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain, primarily in the mid-abdomen. There is mild tenderness over the right upper quadrant, but no rebound or guarding.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which can have several causes including platelet clumping, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (T"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of CAD and ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 15%). He presents with abdominal pain, jaundice, and CBD dilatation on imaging. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have risen from 1.15 on initial presentation to 2.7 prior to transfer to another hospital. This indicates a worsening renal function, which is concerning in the context of his low blood pressure and fever. The differential diagnosis includes acute tubular necrosis (ATN), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP-HUS), and sepsis-induced kidney injury.

2. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has an elevated total bilirubin level of 11.5, with isolated elevation of alkaline phosphatase. This suggests a possible cholangitis due to a retained stone and CBD dilatation on OSH imaging.

3. Abdominal pain: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain, which is more pronounced in the mid-abdomen rather than the right upper quadrant (RUQ). There is no rebound/guarding, and the pain does not seem to be related to peritoneal irritation.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, ranging from the 80s to 90s."

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Likely due to
   relative dehydration and hypotension.  Cr improving to 1.5 (baseline
   reportedly 1.1). Monitoring urine output.  Have been holding diuretics
   but plan to restart.
 LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES:  Picture most consitent with late phase
   Hep A given positive IgM.  Total bili 11.1.  Trend liver enzymes on
   prednisone. Liver service following along.
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS): Pain and jaundice
   persist.  Anticipate MRCP later today.
 .H/O CARDIOMYOPATHY, OTHER:  Had been on digoxin, beta blocker,
   spironolactone and lasix as an outpatient.  Unclear why no afterload
   reduction therapy.  Gently diruesis with lasix.  Watch hyponatremia in
   the setting of volume overload.
 .H/O HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK):  Resovled following volume
   resusitation.  Continues antibiotics for possible cholangitis/sepsis.
   Cultures pending.  Will follow-up with [**Hospital 1188**] Hospital fro culture
   results.
