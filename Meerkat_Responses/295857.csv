","Summary:
- The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of recurrent bronchitis.
- She was admitted from the emergency department with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- Her chest X-ray is highly concerning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet protocol settings.
- She is currently sedated and paralyzed.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and slightly abnormal electrolyte levels.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 100s and heart rate in the 80s.
- She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics empirically for suspected influenza and sepsis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Monitoring and weaning off the ventilator as tolerated will be important in preventing this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or subcutaneous heparin may be necessary.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness can lead to stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. Prophylactic treatment with H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors may be required.
4. Sepsis:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of recurrent bronchitis. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's condition is highly suspicious for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), possibly due to influenza, given her symptoms of myalgias, fever, and fatigue prior to presentation. She is being ventilated using the ARDSnet protocol, with a tidal volume of 370 mL and PEEP. The patient's oxygenation has been improving, allowing for a reduction in FiO2 to 60%. The plan is to continue weaning the ventilator as tolerated and monitor gas trends. An esophageal balloon will be considered in the morning to evaluate PEEP requirements. The patient is also being treated with oseltamivir for suspected flu and broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) due to her acutely ill state. Blood cultures, urine culture, and an echocardiogram have been ordered. The patient is hypotensive with SBP's in the 90s, and fluid responsiveness is likely. She is likely experiencing sepsis, possibly secondary to flu as well. Her urine output is 50-80 cc/hr, and she is receiving IV fluids as needed to maintain a target urine output of >30 cc/hr and mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >65.

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of bronchospasm. He was previously diagnosed with influenza A/B negative and is now being investigated for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The patient has been experiencing low blood pressures and has received multiple fluid boluses with decreasing urine output, requiring increased pressors.

The patient's fever has been persistent, and he has been pan-cultured. The patient's arterial line was stopped and restarted multiple times. His vital signs show a temperature of 102.8, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 103/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently sedated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted bronchospasm. The patient has no known drug allergies. He has received antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient's flow sheet data shows an increase in temperature and blood pressure over the past 24 hours. His fluid balance shows a total intake of 6,882 mL and output of 1,115 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 5,767 mL. The patient is receiving fluids through intravenous (IV) infusion.

The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at 18 cmH2"

   and hypercarbic respiratory failure and CXR highly concerning for ARDS.
   # Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure:  CXR, low P/F ratio and
   lack of evidence of CHF make this picture highly suspicious for ARDS -
   highest on the ddx is influenza given history of myalgias, fever and
   fatigue for 3 days prior to presentation.
   - will ventilate with ARDSnet protocol 6mg/kg IBW - 370 Vt, she's
   requiring high PEEP, though has had improving oxygenation so able to
   wean down FiO2 to 60% currently
   - will continue to wean vent as tolerated, trend gases, consider
   esophageal balloon in am to evaluated PEEP requirement
   - r/o for flu, treat with oseltamivir
   - given how acutely ill, will treat with broad spec abx - vanc/zosyn;
   if sputum cx negative, can d/c
   - f/u blood cultures, urine culture (UA dirty)
   - echo in am to better asses cardiac function
   # Hypotension:  SBP's in 90's, fluid responsive.  Likely sepsis [**12-23**] flu
   as above with fevers at home, leukocytosis, left shift.  UOP 50-80
   ccs/hr
   - maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP>65
   - IVF boluses as needed
   - no pressors for now, but low threshold for levophed if above goals

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of recurrent bronchitis who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's condition is highly concerning for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), with the highest differential diagnosis being influenza given the symptoms of myalgias, fever, and fatigue prior to presentation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation using the ARDSnet protocol, with a tidal volume of 6mg/kg IBW and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygenation is improving, allowing for weaning down of the FiO2 to 60%. 

The patient's blood pressure is low, requiring fluid boluses and increasing pressors. There are concerns for sepsis, possibly due to influenza as evidenced by fevers at home, leukocytosis, and a left shift. The patient's urine output is also low at 50-80 cc/hr, indicating possible renal involvement. The goal is to maintain a urine output of more than 30 cc/hr and a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of more than 65. 

The patient has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and a peripheral IV line. Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis are being implemented. Cultures have been obtained, and the patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics while"

   Assessment and Plan
   37 yo F with PMH of recurrent bronchitis admitted from OSH with hypoxic
   and hypercarbic respiratory failure and CXR highly concerning for ARDS.
   # Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure:  CXR, low P/F ratio and
   lack of evidence of CHF make this picture highly suspicious for ARDS -
   highest on the ddx is a viral processes given of myalgias, fever and
   fatigue for 3 days prior to presentation.  Influenza DFA was negative.
   - Will ventilate with ARDSnet protocol 6mg/kg IBW - 370 Vt, she's
   requiring high PEEP, though has had improving oxygenation so able to
   wean down FiO2 to 60% currently. Will hold constant today on PEEP
   trying to get down to FIO2 down to 40% before reducing PEEP
   - Follow-up on Rapid Viral Screen, blood and urine cultures
   - Follow-up Bronch Rapid Viral Screen, sputum samples
   - Given presentation, and relatively low suspicion for bacterial
   etiology, will pull back on antibiotic coverage. Discontinue Vanc/Zosyn
   and start Levofloxacin
   - Given low suspicion for Cardiac etiology, holding on ECHO to assess
   cardiac function
   # Hypotension:  SBP's in 90's, fluid responsive.  Likely sepsis [**12-23**]
   viral infection as above with high fevers at home and in-house,
   leukocytosis (improved), left shift.  UOP 50-80 ccs/hr.
   - maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP>65
   - IVF boluses as needed
   - Levophed for MAP>65 as needed
   - F/u cultures as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of recurrent bronchitis. She was admitted to the ICU from the emergency department with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The chest X-ray showed findings highly concerning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been intubated and placed on ARDSnet protocol ventilation, with a target tidal volume of 6 mg/kg ideal body weight and a plateau pressure limit of 30 cmH2O. She has been receiving high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) but has shown improving oxygenation, allowing for a reduction in FiO2 to 60%. The plan is to maintain constant PEEP today and attempt to wean down FiO2 to 40% before reducing PEEP further.

The patient has also been febrile, with temperatures ranging from 102.8°F to 101.2°F. She has had low blood pressures, requiring multiple fluid boluses and increased pressors. Her urine output has been decreasing, necessitating the use of increased pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. Blood and urine cultures, as well as a rapid viral screen, have been obtained. Levofloxacin has been started due to the low suspicion for bacterial etiology. An echocardiogram has been held due to the low suspicion for cardiac etiology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with several ongoing medical complications. The patient initially presented with hypotension, hypoxia, and acidosis following embolization and required pressors. The patient's elevated lactate and white blood cell count indicate possible sepsis or infection. The patient's temperature has been spiking overnight, and blood and urine cultures have been sent.

The patient's vital signs show persistent tachycardia and fever. The arterial line was stopped and restarted multiple times, indicating possible issues with the line or fluctuations in the patient's condition. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management.

The patient's respiratory support indicates that they are on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 380 mL, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is maintained at 95%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 47, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 155.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose levels, and lactic acid levels. The patient also has abnormal liver function tests and electrolyte imbalances."

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of recurrent bronchitis admitted to the ICU for hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. She was initially suspected to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is highly concerning given her chest X-ray findings and low P/F ratio. The initial workup included negative influenza DFA and ongoing investigations for viral processes and bacterial etiologies. The patient's condition has been improving with ventilatory support according to the ARDSnet protocol, reducing FiO2 to 40% while maintaining PEEP. Antibiotic coverage has been adjusted based on the suspicion of bacterial infection. The patient also presented with hypotension, likely due to sepsis secondary to a viral infection. She is being managed with IV fluids, Levophed for maintaining MAP>65, and careful monitoring of urine output. Nutritional support is being provided through enteral feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms of hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, along with the chest X-ray findings, suggest a high suspicion for ARDS. If not appropriately managed, this condition can lead to progressive respiratory failure and potentially death.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and leukocytosis with left shift suggest a possible septic state. If not promptly addressed, sepsis can progress to septic shock and organ failure.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a medical history of recurrent bronchitis. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. Her chest X-ray showed signs consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Initial treatment included ventilation using the ARDSnet protocol, administration of antibiotics, and follow-up on rapid viral screens and cultures. The patient's condition has been improving, with decreasing FiO2 requirements and stable blood pressure. However, she still requires norepinephrine for hemodynamic support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and culture results will be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can lead to the formation of blood clots in the deep veins. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin may be required.
3. Nosocomial infection: Given the prolonged stay in the ICU, the patient may be at risk for acquiring new infections. Frequent monitoring of vital signs and regular assessment of wound sites or catheters are essential.
4. ARDS progression: Despite improvements, there is still a risk of worsening ARDS. Close monitoring of oxygenation parameters and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary.
5. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 37-year-old female with a medical history of recurrent bronchitis. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, and her chest X-ray showed signs consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation according to the ARDSnet protocol.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 73/47 mmHg to 116/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a FiO2 of 40%. Her fluid balance shows an intake of 3,163 mL, output of 1,180 mL, and a net positive balance of 1,983 mL.

The patient has been receiving various medications including norepinephrine, midazolam, and fentanyl. Blood cultures, rapid viral screens, and bronchoscopy have been performed, with negative results for viral infection. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 10.0 K/uL, low platelet count of 202 K/uL, and elevated lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's primary concerns are hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, suspected"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-inch tall, 152.9 kg male with a chief complaint of fevers unrelieved by Tylenol. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely viral ARDS, and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation per ARDSnet guidelines. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.8°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 73/47 mmHg to 116/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated and on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
2. Nosocomial infection: Given the prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures, the patient is at risk for developing nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) or central line-associated meningitis (CLABSI).
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and hypercoagulable state due to illness increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and prolonged mechanical"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure after experiencing a 3-day prodrome of fevers and myalgias. The patient's initial assessment suggests viral ARDS, but there are concerns regarding ongoing fever, rising white count, and potential sepsis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 10 at FiO2 40%. There is a facial rash present above the mouth where the ET tube tape was applied. The patient requires some pressor support and continues to have spikes in fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's rising white count, continued fever, and hypotension suggest the possibility of an underlying infection leading to sepsis.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
3. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and prolonged pressure from the ET tube tape could lead to the development of pressure ulcers.
4. Delirium: The patient's neurological status is not well-documented, and they may be at risk for delirium due to their ICU stay and sedation medications.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating potential fluid overload.
6. Medication interactions: The patient is on multiple medications, which may interact with each other and increase the risk of adverse effects"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure after a 3-day prodrome of fevers and myalgias. The patient has been steadily improving, appearing to have viral ARDS. He is currently ventilated per ARDSnet 6mg/kg IBW with a Vt of 370 and requiring PEEP of 10 at FiO2 40%. The patient's facial rash, caused by the ET tube tape, has been addressed and monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed (HOB) and proper oral hygiene should be implemented to reduce this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic heparin has been initiated to reduce this risk.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at an increased risk of developing stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are being used for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, requiring the use of norepinephrine for hemodynamic support. Close monitoring of the patient's blood pressure and appropriate adjustments in medication dosages may be necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   37F PMH p/w hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure after 3-day
   prodrome of fevers and myalgias, CXR c/w ARDS.
   # Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: Steadily improving,
   continues to look like viral ARDS. Concerning however that she
   continues to mount a fever and a white count, although improving. Does
   not look like superinfection. Clear CXR.
   - At PEEP of 10 at FiO2 50%
 will attempt to wean to PEEP of 8 (if
   tolerated) and FiO2 40%
   - Levofloxacin only now
 if continued fever and concerns of
   evolving/undertreated healthcare acquired PNA, will broaden to
   Vanc/3^rd gen cephalosporin
   - Follow up blood, sputum, urine cultures
   - Alb/Atrovent nebs prn
    # Hypotension:  Likely sepsis [**12-23**] viral vs bacterial infection.
   Currently off levophed.
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP>65
   - Given grossly positive this hospitalization, will attempt diuresis
   this afternoon with Lasix and give Levophed boluses as needed
   - Minimize IVF boluses for now
   # Facial rash: Rash across skin just above mouth, where tape securing
   ET tube has been. Tape removed, standard ET tube secure device applied.
   - Hydrocortisone 1% cream ordered

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. Given the presence of hypotension and respiratory failure, there is a concern for sepsis.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The decision to broaden antibiotics may indicate a concern for this complication.

3. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP): The patient's history of recent hospitalization and antibiotic use may increase the risk of HCAP. This is another potential source of infection.

4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates inadequate tissue perfusion. This could be due to sepsis, fluid losses, or medication effects.

5. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation suggest the possibility of ARDS. This condition is characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.

6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control. This can be a result of stress from the underlying illness or inadequate insulin administration.

7. Eosinophilia: The presence of increased eosinophils in the blood suggests an allergic reaction or parasitic infection. The facial rash could also be related to an allergic reaction"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fever of unknown origin, hypotension, and hyperglycemia. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has been on multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1°F, blood pressure ranging from 90/48 mmHg to 126/116 mmHg, heart rate between 61-86 bpm, respiratory rate at 17-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's arterial line was stopped and restarted on December 26th, and a rash across the upper lip was observed, which may indicate an allergic reaction. Eosinophilia was noted on the CBC, which is new since admission.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab results show normal electrolyte levels and liver function tests.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a tidal volume set at 380 mL, respiratory rate set at 24 breaths per minute, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and SpO2 of 94%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 52"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure after experiencing a 3-day prodrome of fevers and myalgias. The patient's initial chest X-ray showed findings consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition has been steadily improving, but there are concerns about ongoing fever and an elevated white blood cell count. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 10 and FiO2 of 50%. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.1°F, blood pressure of 90/48 mmHg, heart rate of 74 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing fever, elevated white blood cell count, and hypotension suggest the possibility of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values is necessary to detect any worsening of this condition.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been intubated for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed and performing regular cultures can help prevent or detect this complication.

3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 569 mL since 96 hours ago. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent fluid overload and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He has a history of hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure following a viral prodrome. His current condition shows improvement in terms of oxygenation but persistent fever and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80/41 to 112/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He is receiving various medications including norepinephrine, fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever and worsening respiratory symptoms, is necessary. Cultures should be obtained to identify any potential pathogens.

2. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of fever and elevated white blood cell count, there is a concern for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and ongoing assessment of the patient's condition are essential. Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be considered if the fever persists or worsens.

3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's initial presentation included hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure with a clear chest X-ray,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 37-year-old woman who presented with hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- She had a 3-day prodrome of fevers and myalgias, and her chest X-rays showed findings consistent with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient's condition improved initially but worsened when she was unable to tolerate PEEP of 8, so she was put back on PEEP 12.
- She continues to have a fever and an elevated white blood cell count, despite being on antibiotics (Levofloxacin). This could be concerning for a possible superinfection or lymphoma.
- The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with clear/whitish nasal secretions.
- She is receiving various medications, including norepinephrine, fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), pantoprazole (Protonix), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).
- Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 92/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.
- Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.5 K/uL, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 195 mg/dL, and other abnormalities in electroly"

   prodrome of fevers and myalgias, CXR c/w ARDS.
   # Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: Steadily improving,
   continues to look like viral ARDS. Concerning however that she
   continues to mount a fever and a white count, although improving. Does
   not look like superinfection. Clear CXR.
   - At PEEP of 10 at FiO2 50%
 will attempt to wean to PEEP of 8 (if
   tolerated) and FiO2 40%
   - Levofloxacin only now
 if continued fever and concerns of
   evolving/undertreated healthcare acquired PNA, will broaden to Vanc/3rd
   gen cephalosporin
   - Follow up blood, sputum, urine cultures
   - Alb/Atrovent nebs prn
    # Hypotension:  Likely sepsis [**12-23**] viral vs bacterial infection.
   Currently off levophed.
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP>65
   - Given grossly positive this hospitalization, will attempt diuresis
   this afternoon with Lasix and give Levophed boluses as needed
   - Minimize IVF boluses for now

","Summary:
The patient is an obese individual who was admitted with respiratory distress and has been in the ICU since December 22nd. The patient has been intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation. There have been changes in the patient's condition, including increased PEEP and FiO2, low-grade fevers, and the need for pressors. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain relief. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and decreased urine output. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and there are signs of infection with elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. The patient's lab results show abnormalities in electrolytes, liver enzymes, and kidney function. The patient's chest X-ray indicates low lung volumes, stable infiltrates, and a left pleural effusion. The patient's respiratory status has not improved despite previous interventions, and eosinophilic pneumonia is being considered as a possible cause. The patient requires ongoing ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and inadequate oxygenation despite mechanical ventilation indicate the possibility of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and signs of infection suggest the possibility of sepsis.

","The patient is an obese male who is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia. The patient's condition has not improved as expected, with persistent low-grade fevers and the need for increased PEEP and FiO2. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, requiring the use of norepinephrine as a vasopressor.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 81/47 mmHg to 112/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, elevated blood glucose level, and slightly decreased levels of potassium and bicarbonate. Other lab values appear to be within normal ranges.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (levofloxacin), sedatives (midazolam and fentanyl), and heparin sodium as prophylaxis. The patient's fluid balance shows an overall positive balance, indicating fluid overload.

Potential medical complications that could arise include worsening respiratory distress, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and hypoglycemia due to insulin treatment for"

","Summary:
The patient is an obese individual with anasarca, who is currently in the ICU. They have been intubated and sedated. The patient has a history of low-grade fevers, increased PEEP and FiO2, and the need for pressors. Their vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), blood pressure ranging from 81/47 mmHg to 112/72 mmHg, heart rate between 66-82 bpm, respiratory rate of 17-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 91%. The patient's weight is 153 kg, and their height is 67 inches. Their central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 10 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,225 mL and output of 1,115 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,110 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 380 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 24 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. Blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 51 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 204, and oxygen consumption (Ve) of 10.1 L/min. Physical examination reveals the patient to be intubated, sedated, obese, and showing signs of anasarca. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.6 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) of 195 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 195 mg/dL, and slightly elevated lactate level of 1.0 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, hyperglycemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and suspected pneumonia. The plan includes monitoring the patient's blood pressure, managing hyperglycemia with insulin, and treating ARDS with bronchoscopy and diuresis. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition and glycemic control. Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention are also being implemented. The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently in the ICU."

The patient's chest X-rays are consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently requiring high PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) with oxygen saturation levels in the low 90s. A CT scan reveals bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation. Bronchial lavage analysis shows 1+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) but no microorganisms.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, mildly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. Imaging studies show bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidations, which could be due to atelectasis or superimposed infection.

Microbiology tests reveal gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting a possible Staphylococcus species infection. Blood cultures confirm the presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters as well. The patient is being treated with levofloxacin and Zosyn for suspected pneumonia. Blood, sputum, and urine cultures have been ordered for further evaluation.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, bacteremia, and hypotension. The respiratory failure is being managed with high PEEP and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old woman with hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure following a three-day prodrome of fevers and myalgias. She has been improving but is now experiencing a fever and elevated white blood cell count despite receiving antibiotics. Her condition is concerning, and there is a possibility of superinfection or lymphoma. The patient requires respiratory support with an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation. She also has bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidations on imaging, which could indicate atelectasis or an infectious process. Her blood cultures show gram-positive cocci in clusters, suggesting a possible bacterial infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation included hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, indicating severe impairment in gas exchange. The worsening of her condition and inability to tolerate PEEP suggests a potential deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Sepsis: The elevated white blood cell count and fever, along with the presence of gram-positive cocci in blood cultures, raise concerns about a systemic infection leading to sepsis. This is further supported by the patient's hypotension and requirement for vasopressor support.
3. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidations on imaging are consistent with ARDS, which can occur as a complication of severe infections or other insults to the lungs.
4. Superinfection: The patient's fever"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure after a 3-day prodrome of fevers and myalgias.
- The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and gram-positive bacteremia.
- The patient requires high PEEP with oxygen saturation levels in the low 90s.
- Imaging reveals bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidations, which could reflect atelectasis or superimposed infection.
- The patient has been treated with levofloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam for pneumonia, and vancomycin for bacteremia.
- The patient also has hypotension, likely due to sepsis and adrenal insufficiency, and is receiving steroids and antibiotics.
- Other conditions include facial rash, sinusitis, and conjunctival hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fevers, myalgias, and imaging findings suggest pneumonia. The current treatment with levofloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam is appropriate, but it is important to monitor for any worsening respiratory symptoms or signs of sepsis.
2. ARDS: The patient's low oxygen saturation and requirement for high PEEP indicate the presence of ARDS. Close monitoring of respiratory function and oxygenation is necessary. Supportive care, including lung-protective ventilation strategies, may be"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient requires high PEEP and is in low 90s oxygen saturation levels. The CT scan reveals pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation. There is also a mention of attempting to wean the patient from the ventilator, starting with FiO2 and then PEEP.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has gram-positive bacteremia with GPC in clusters. The likely explanation for ongoing fevers is bacteremia. The patient's central venous line was changed yesterday, and follow-up tip culture results are pending.

3. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which is likely due to sepsis and adrenal insufficiency. The patient is on steroids and antibiotics but has had to restart on Levophed this morning. The plan includes obtaining a central venous pressure (CVP) today, considering an esophageal balloon to match PEEP, maintaining urine output greater than 30 cc/hr, and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated. Insulin gtt and Lantus with breakfast will be increased, and the fixed dose will be increased today.

5. Sinusitis: The patient has sinusitis seen on CT, for which they are being treated with Afrin and nasal steroids.

6. Conjunctival"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 37-year-old female who was admitted with hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure after experiencing fevers and myalgias. She has been diagnosed with ARDS and gram-positive bacteremia.
- The patient continues to require high PEEP and has O2 sats in the low 90s. A CT scan revealed pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation. Bronchial lavage showed 1+ PMNs but no bacteria.
- The patient's fever persists, likely due to ongoing bacteremia.
- The patient has been treated with levaquin, zosyn, vancomycin, and piperacillin.
- Her blood pressure is low, which could be attributed to sepsis and adrenal insufficiency. She is also on steroids and antibiotics.
- The patient has been weaned off pressors twice but had to restart on levophed this morning.
- The plan is to obtain a CVP today and consider an esophageal balloon to match PEEP.
- The patient's urine output needs to be maintained above 30 cc/hr, and her mean arterial pressure should be above 65.
- Efforts should be made to minimize intravenous fluid boluses.
- There is no requirement for diuresis yet.
- The patient has a facial rash that is resolving and has been treated with hydrocortisone cream."

   Assessment and Plan
   37F w/ hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure after 3-day prodrome of
   fevers and myalgias, CXRs c/w ARDS. Now with gram positive bacteremia
   and inability to significantly wean mechanical ventilation
   # Respiratory failure: Continues to desat when PEEP turned down. Has
   known pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation, but has been on
   broad spectrum antibiotics for several days. Bronch revealing 1+ PMNs
   but no bacteria. Given high PEEP and large/short neck, patient not an
   excellent candidate for tracheostomy
   - Continue attempting to wean from vent, starting with FiO2 and then
   PEEP
   - Consider pulling back antibiotics for PNA, given lack of resolution
   with levaquin/zosyn/Vanc
   - Follow up blood, sputum, urine cultures
   - Alb/Atrovent nebs prn
   - Consider thoracentesis to analyze pleural fluid
   - Consider esophageal balloon
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Temperature and WBC both up today. Has been on
   levaquin x 9 days, vanco/zosyn x 3 days. Leukocytosis worsening even
   several days after starting steroids for adrenal insufficiency
   - D/c levaquin as has not provided any clinical benefit
   - ID consult for ?source of fevers
   - LENI

   - consider thoracentesis, as above
   # Bacteremia: Known coag negative staph in blood. Other cultures
   (including CVL tip) negative or pending to date
   - F/u outstanding culture results
   - Coag neg staph by itself should not require vanco
   - ID consult as above
    # Hypotension: Bacteremia and adrenal insufficiency documented as
   etiologies. BP more stable over past 24 hours. On small dose of
   levophed at this time
   - Can taper doses of levo, steroids
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP>65
   - Minimize IVF boluses if possible
   - No requirement for diuresis yet
   # Facial rash: Rash across skin just above mouth, resolving
   - Hydrocortisone 1% cream ordered

She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for several days but continues to have gram-positive bacteremia and an inability to significantly wean mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, as indicated by desaturation when PEEP is turned down. She has known pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation, but has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for several days. Bronch revealing 1+ PMNs but no bacteria.

   fevers and myalgias, CXRs c/w ARDS. Now with gram positive bacteremia
   and inability to significantly wean mechanical ventilation
   # Respiratory failure: Continues to desat when PEEP turned down. Has
   known pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation, but has been on
   broad spectrum antibiotics for several days. Bronch revealing 1+ PMNs
   but no bacteria. Given high PEEP and large/short neck, patient not an
   excellent candidate for tracheostomy
   - Continue attempting to wean from vent, starting with FiO2 and then
   PEEP
   - Consider pulling back antibiotics for PNA, given lack of resolution
   with levaquin/zosyn/Vanc
   - Follow up blood, sputum, urine cultures
   - Alb/Atrovent nebs prn
   - Consider thoracentesis to analyze pleural fluid
   - Consider esophageal balloon
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Temperature and WBC both up today. Has been on
   levaquin x 9 days, vanco/zosyn x 3 days. Leukocytosis worsening even
   several days after starting steroids for adrenal insufficiency
   - D/c levaquin as has not provided any clinical benefit
   - ID consult for ?source of fevers
   - LENI

   - consider thoracentesis, as above
   # Bacteremia: Known coag negative staph in blood. Other cultures
   (including CVL tip) negative or pending to date

   - Coag neg staph by itself should not require vanco
   - ID consult as above
    # Hypotension: Bacteremia and adrenal insufficiency documented as
   etiologies. BP more stable over past 24 hours. On small dose of
   levophed at this time
   - Can taper doses of levo, steroids

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure after a 3-day prodrome of fevers and myalgias, CXRs consistent with ARDS. She now presents with gram-positive bacteremia and an inability to significantly wean mechanical ventilation. 

24-hour events include an arterial line stop, fever, and ongoing attempts to wean FiO2 and PEEP. The patient's arterial line could not be replaced due to multiple flashes but unable to thread. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for several days, but there is no resolution with levaquin/zosyn/Vanc. Bronchoscopic examination revealed 1+ PMNs but no bacteria. 

The patient has known pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation. She has been on levaquin for 9 days, vanco/zosyn for 3 days, and steroids for adrenal insufficiency. 

Assessment and plan include continuing to attempt to wean from the ventilator, considering pulling back antibiotics for pneumonia given the lack of resolution, following up with blood, sputum, and urine cultures, administering Alb/Atrovent nebs as needed, considering thoracentesis to analyze pleural fluid, and considering an esophageal balloon. 

Other issues include fevers and leukocytosis, bacteremia with known coag-negative staph in the blood, and hypotension. The patient's blood pressure is more stable"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure. She has been experiencing fevers and myalgias for three days prior to admission. Chest X-rays indicate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has known pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation, but has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for several days. A bronchoscopy revealed 1+ polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) but no bacteria. The patient's temperature and white blood cell count are elevated, suggesting ongoing infection or inflammation. She has bacteremia with coag-negative staphylococcus, and other cultures are pending. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but she has been diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency. She is currently on small doses of norepinephrine and steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to desaturate when PEEP is turned down. She has known pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation, but has not shown significant improvement despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a possibility of ongoing respiratory failure if she does not respond to weaning attempts from mechanical ventilation.
2. Fevers/leukocytosis: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient's temperature and WBC count remain elevated. This indicates that the current treatment may not be effectively addressing the underlying infection or inflammation. Further evaluation and consideration of alternative treatments may be necessary"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II and presents with fever, hypotension, and respiratory distress. On examination, the patient has bilateral lower extremity edema, rash on the neck and arms, conjunctival/scleral hemorrhage and edema, and sinusitis. The patient's vital signs show elevated temperature, low blood pressure, decreased heart rate, and decreased respiratory rate. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with FiO2 set at 40%. The ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia and hypoxemia. The patient's blood glucose level is significantly elevated, and there are abnormalities in other lab results including elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, elevated total bilirubin, and elevated lactate levels. The patient has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type II, rash, sinusitis, pneumonia (viral), fever of unknown origin, hypotension, bacteremia with coag-negative staphylococcus, adrenal insufficiency, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, sepsis secondary to bacteremia, further deterioration of renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to prolonged immobilization, and worsening of diabetes control."

   Assessment and Plan
   37F w/ hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure after 3-day prodrome of
   fevers and myalgias, CXRs c/w ARDS. Now with gram positive bacteremia
   and inability to significantly wean mechanical ventilation
   # Respiratory failure: Continues to desat when PEEP turned down. Has
   known pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation, but has been on
   broad spectrum antibiotics for several days. Bronch revealing 1+ PMNs
   but no bacteria. Given high PEEP and large/short neck, patient not an
   excellent candidate for tracheostomy
   - Continue attempting to wean from vent, starting with FiO2 and then
   PEEP
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn although there is suspicion for drug fever and no
   compelling PNA/bacteremia found
   - Follow up blood, sputum, urine cultures
   - Alb/Atrovent nebs prn
   - Consider esophageal balloon
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Temperature and WBC both up today. Had been on
   levaquin x 9 days (discontinued), vanco/zosyn x 4 days. Leukocytosis
   worsening even several days after starting steroids for adrenal
   insufficiency. LENI negative bilaterally for DVT
   - Appreciate ID consult: ordered Cdiff, repeat nasopharyngeal swabs
   (DFA/rapid viral screen)
   - CT torso with contrast to be done today  ID consult for ?source of
   fevers
 will prep with bicarb and mucomyst
    # Hypotension: Bacteremia and adrenal insufficiency documented as
   etiologies. BP more stable over past 24 hours. On small dose of
   levophed at this time
   - Will wean off levophed as patient continues to have good urine output
   with low blood pressures
   - Will switch to decadron (physiologic repletion dose) to allow for
   cortisol stimulation test
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP>65
   - Minimize IVF boluses if possible
   # Facial rash: Rash across skin just above mouth, resolving
   - Hydrocortisone 1% cream ordered
   # Sinusitis: On CT
   - Afrin, nasal steroids
   - On Zosyn
 will discuss with ID appropriateness for sinusitis
   coverage, and course
   # Conjunctival hemorrhage: ophtho consulted; they believe may be [**12-23**]
   high vent pressure
   - Appreciate Ophthal recommendations
 will continue with lubrication,
   erythromycin. Will call them when patient extubated for re-examination

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female with hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure after a three-day prodrome of fevers and myalgias. The patient has known pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation but has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for several days. The patient is also experiencing gram-positive bacteremia and an inability to significantly wean mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to desaturate when PEEP is turned down, indicating difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation. This could lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.

2. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient has persistent fevers and leukocytosis despite being on antibiotics. This could suggest an ongoing infection or drug fever. It is important to follow up with blood, sputum, and urine cultures to identify the source of infection.

3. Hypotension: The patient has documented bacteremia and adrenal insufficiency as etiologies for hypotension. The blood pressure is more stable over the past 24 hours, but close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further hypotension and associated complications like organ dysfunction or septic shock.

4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has documented adrenal insufficiency, which requires careful management with corticosteroids"

   Assessment and Plan
   37F w/ hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure after 3-day prodrome of
   fevers and myalgias, CXRs c/w ARDS. Now with gram positive bacteremia
   and inability to significantly wean mechanical ventilation
   # Respiratory failure: Extubated this morning without issues. Has known
   pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation, but has been on broad
   spectrum antibiotics for several days (Vanc/Zosyn). Bronch revealing 1+
   PMNs but no bacteria. Given high PEEP and large/short neck, patient not
   an excellent candidate for tracheostomy
   - Discontinue Vanc but continue Zosyn although there is suspicion for
   drug fever and no compelling PNA/bacteremia found
   - Follow up blood, sputum, urine cultures
   - Alb/Atrovent nebs prn; incentive spirometer at bedside
   - Lasix diuresis (mild given blood pressures) today at 20mg IV
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Temperature continues to be low grade, WBC
   significantly improved. Had been on levaquin x 9 days (discontinued),
   vanco/zosyn x 5 days. LENI negative bilaterally for DVT
   - Appreciate ID consult: ordered Cdiff, hold on repeat nasapharyngeal
   swab sampling
   - CT torso final read not suggestive of infectious processes (except
   for bibasilar pneumonia, but no localizing symptoms)
    # Hypotension: Bacteremia and adrenal insufficiency documented as
   etiologies. BP more stable over past 24 hours. Levophed weaned off
   yesterday with MAPs acceptable ~55
   - Will continue decadron (physiologic repletion dose) 2mg twice daily
   for now
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP>55
   - Minimize IVF boluses if possible, given +12-13L length of stay
   # Elevated Lipase: Holding tube feeds today in setting of lipase
   - Will recheck AM lipase and consider resuming tube feeds tomorrow (or
   Speech and Swallow evaluation for reinitiation of diet)
   # Facial/upper torso rash: Rash across skin just above mouth,
   resolving; [**Doctor Last Name **]/ hive-like rash on neck and bilateral arms
   - Hydrocortisone 1% cream ordered
   - Benadryl PRN
   # Sinusitis: On CT
   - Afrin, nasal steroids
   - On Zosyn
 will discuss with ID appropriateness for sinusitis
   coverage, and course
   # Conjunctival hemorrhage: ophtho consulted; they believe may be [**12-23**]
   high vent pressure
   - Appreciate Ophthal recommendations
 will continue with lubrication,

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 37-year-old female with hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure following a three-day prodrome of fevers and myalgias. She has known pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation.
- The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) for suspected gram-positive bacteremia and ARDS. However, bronchial lavage reveals no bacteria.
- The patient was extubated this morning without issues but now has low-grade fevers and leukocytosis.
- She has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and a rash.
- The patient's blood pressure is stable, but she has evidence of adrenal insufficiency and bacteremia caused by coag-negative Staph.
- She has been on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS, but her condition has not significantly improved.
- Other issues include elevated lipase levels, facial/upper torso rash, sinusitis, and conjunctival hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent or worsening respiratory failure: The patient's condition indicates severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to further respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Infection: Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient still has persistent low-grade fevers and leukocytosis, suggesting a possible ongoing infection or antibiotic resistance.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has documented adrenal insufficiency, which can lead to hypotension and other"

   Assessment and Plan
   37F w/ hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure after 3-day prodrome of
   fevers and myalgias, CXRs c/w ARDS. Now with gram positive bacteremia
   and inability to significantly wean mechanical ventilation
   # Respiratory failure: Continues to desat when PEEP turned down. Has
   known pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation, but has been on
   broad spectrum antibiotics for several days. Bronch revealing 1+ PMNs
   but no bacteria. Given high PEEP and large/short neck, patient not an
   excellent candidate for tracheostomy
   - Continue attempting to wean from vent, starting with FiO2 and then
   PEEP
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn although there is suspicion for drug fever and no
   compelling PNA/bacteremia found
   - Follow up blood, sputum, urine cultures
   - Alb/Atrovent nebs prn
   - Consider esophageal balloon
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Temperature and WBC both up today. Had been on
   levaquin x 9 days (discontinued), vanco/zosyn x 4 days. Leukocytosis
   worsening even several days after starting steroids for adrenal
   insufficiency. LENI negative bilaterally for DVT
   - Appreciate ID consult: ordered Cdiff, repeat nasopharyngeal swabs
   (DFA/rapid viral screen)
   - CT torso with contrast to be done today  ID consult for ?source of
   fevers
 will prep with bicarb and mucomyst
    # Hypotension: Bacteremia and adrenal insufficiency documented as
   etiologies. BP more stable over past 24 hours. On small dose of
   levophed at this time
   - Will wean off levophed as patient continues to have good urine output
   with low blood pressures
   - Will switch to decadron (physiologic repletion dose) to allow for
   cortisol stimulation test
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP>65
   - Minimize IVF boluses if possible
   # Facial rash: Rash across skin just above mouth, resolving
   - Hydrocortisone 1% cream ordered
   # Sinusitis: On CT
   - Afrin, nasal steroids
   - On Zosyn
 will discuss with ID appropriateness for sinusitis
   coverage, and course
   # Conjunctival hemorrhage: ophtho consulted; they believe may be [**12-23**]
   high vent pressure
   - Appreciate Ophthal recommendations
 will continue with lubrication,
   erythromycin. Will call them when patient extubated for re-examination

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure after a three-day prodrome of fevers and myalgias. She has gram-positive bacteremia and an inability to significantly wean mechanical ventilation. The patient has known pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation but has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for several days. Bronch revealing 1+ PMNs but no bacteria. She is also experiencing facial rash, sinusitis, and conjunctival hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to desaturate when PEEP is turned down, indicating ongoing respiratory distress.
2. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient's temperature and white blood cell count are elevated, suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
3. Hypotension: The patient has bacteremia and adrenal insufficiency documented as etiologies for her low blood pressure. She is currently on a small dose of levophed to maintain blood pressure.
4. Drug fever: There is suspicion for drug fever due to the patient's worsening leukocytosis even after starting steroids for adrenal insufficiency.
5. Inability to wean from mechanical ventilation: The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for several days but still cannot be successfully weaned off mechanical ventilation.
6. Pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation: The patient has known pleural effusions and bibasilar"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 99/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving regular insulin infusions and various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and fentanyl.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type II, rash, sinusitis, pneumonia, fever of unknown origin, hypotension, bacteremia caused by coag-negative Staphylococcus, adrenal insufficiency, and ARDS.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), nosocomial infections, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further deterioration of organ function.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, glycemic control, and nutritional intake while in the ICU. Frequent assessment of vital signs, daily chest x-rays, and regular laboratory tests"

   37F w/ hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure after 3-day prodrome of
   fevers and myalgias, CXRs c/w ARDS. Now with gram positive bacteremia
   and inability to significantly wean mechanical ventilation
   # Respiratory failure: Extubated this morning without issues. Has known
   pleural effusions and bibasilar consolidation, but has been on broad
   spectrum antibiotics for several days (Vanc/Zosyn). Bronch revealing 1+
   PMNs but no bacteria. Given high PEEP and large/short neck, patient not
   an excellent candidate for tracheostomy
   - Discontinue Vanc but continue Zosyn although there is suspicion for
   drug fever and no compelling PNA/bacteremia found
   - Follow up blood, sputum, urine cultures
   - Alb/Atrovent nebs prn; incentive spirometer at bedside
   - Lasix diuresis (mild given blood pressures) today at 20mg IV
   # Fevers/leukocytosis: Temperature continues to be low grade, WBC
   significantly improved. Had been on levaquin x 9 days (discontinued),
   vanco/zosyn x 5 days. LENI negative bilaterally for DVT
   - Appreciate ID consult: ordered Cdiff, hold on repeat nasapharyngeal
   swab sampling
   - CT torso final read not suggestive of infectious processes (except
   for bibasilar pneumonia, but no localizing symptoms)
    # Hypotension: Bacteremia and adrenal insufficiency documented as
   etiologies. BP more stable over past 24 hours. Levophed weaned off
   yesterday with MAPs acceptable ~55
   - Will continue decadron (physiologic repletion dose) 2mg twice daily
   for now
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP>55
   - Minimize IVF boluses if possible, given +12-13L length of stay
   # Elevated Lipase: Holding tube feeds today in setting of lipase
   - Will recheck AM lipase and consider resuming tube feeds tomorrow (or
   Speech and Swallow evaluation for reinitiation of diet)

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female who was admitted with hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to viral ARDS. She also had a G+ bacteremia associated with a line infection. The patient has been extubated without issues and is currently on nasal cannula with oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's current medical issues include hyperkalemia (potassium level of 5.2), which is now normal, no EKG changes. She also has adrenal insufficiency, as she has been on steroids for a cortisol level of 3 last week in the setting of respiratory failure. 

The patient's physical examination shows a facial/upper torso rash that is resolving, along with hive-like rash on her neck and bilateral arms. She has conjunctival hemorrhage, which may be due to high vent pressure, and sinusitis, which is being managed with nasal steroids. 

In terms of nutrition, the patient is cleared for oral intake, and her glycemic control is being managed with insulin gtt and Lantus. She has multiple lines in place, including a multi-lumen line and a 20-gauge line. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is being provided with heparin, and stress ulcer prophylaxis is being given with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Elevating the head of bed (HOB) is being done to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch tall, 165 kg individual admitted to the ICU with ARDS. They have been experiencing an increase in baseline diplopia, and their vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/35 mmHg to 130/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. The patient has received various medications, including heparin sodium, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. They have undergone invasive ventilation and have been extubated. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted increase in diplopia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously intubated and is now on a nasal cannula. They are still requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if they do not continue to improve.
2. Fevers/leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, indicating a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting treatment accordingly is crucial.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has fluctuated between 90/35 mmHg and 130/72 mmHg. It is essential to closely monitor their blood pressure and provide appropriate hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of viral ARDS and a previous line infection. She is currently extubated and doing well on a nasal cannula. The patient has been weaned off antibiotics and is being treated for hyperkalemia, adrenal insufficiency, facial/rash, conjunctival hemorrhage, bacteremia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and sinusitis. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 117/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for diplopia, which is resolving. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but within normal range for creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes. Imaging shows mild interstitial pulmonary edema and no pneumothorax. Microbiology results indicate heavy growth of commensal respiratory flora and yeast in urine and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures. The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, heparin, insulin, and dexamethasone. The patient is cleared for nutrition and is being weaned off sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
