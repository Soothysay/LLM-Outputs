   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old lady with Severe COPD (home oxygen 4L), CAD, obstructive
   cardiomyopathy presents with closed loop small bowel obstruction s/p
   exploratory laproscopy (nearly 1 foot of bowel removed), lysis of
   adhesions and small bowel resection.
   .
   # Closed loop small bowel obstruction: s/p exploratory laproscopy,
   lysis of adhesions and small bowel resection.
   - appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue Cefazolin per surgery recs
   - Pain control with morphine for now, may need a PCA later if pain not
   controlled
   .
   # S/P Intubation/COPD: On home oxygen.
   - D/C propofol and start morphine prn
   - Plan to extubate today
   - Patient with fluid overload on CXR; patient may need bipap after
   extubation
   - continue albuterol/atrovent
   .
   # Low UOP: likely secondary to need for ivfs and component of pre-renal
   secondary to mild hypotension and s/p surgery with fluid shifts
   - Gentle IVFs
   - Monitor uop
   - Consider lasix trial later in day if uop is low
   # Obstructive Cardiomyopathy/CAD:
   - TTE given ? WMA on intraop TEE
   - strictly monitor I and O, daily weight
   .
   # h/o DVT:  Currently not on coumadin.
   - sc heparin for prophylaxis
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue home levothyroxine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old lady with severe COPD, CAD, and obstructive cardiomyopathy. She presented with a closed-loop small bowel obstruction after exploratory laparoscopy, lysis of adhesions, and small bowel resection. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/67 to 117/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her temperature is within the normal range at 37.7°C (99.9°F). 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,746 mL and output of 470 mL, with a positive balance of 1,276 mL. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 59 kg. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 38.6%, platelet count (Plt) of 331 K/uL, blood glucose level of 164 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 1.8 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes continuing cefazolin per surgery recommendations, pain control with morphine, and potential transition to a patient-controlled anal"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old lady with severe COPD, CAD, and obstructive cardiomyopathy. She is currently in the ICU following exploratory laparoscopy, lysis of adhesions, and small bowel resection due to closed loop small bowel obstruction. 

The patient has multiple medical conditions and complications, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), obstructive cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). 

During her stay in the ICU, she has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/67 mmHg to 117/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on FiO2 40%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,746 mL and output of 470 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,276 mL. Her urine output is 120 mL, and she has received IV fluids, blood products, and has drains in place. 

Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, PaO2 of 155 mmHg, and HCO3- of 28 mEq/L. Her other lab values include white blood cell count of 12.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.2 g/dL, sodium of 152 mg/dL, potassium of 0.8 mg/dL, and glucose of 164 mg/dL. 

The patient's physical examination reveals an endotracheal tube in place, normocephalic head, regular heart rhythm, and coarse breath sounds diffusely. 

Given the patient's medical history and current condition, potential medical complications that can arise include exacerbation of COPD, hypotension, small bowel obstruction, stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old lady with Severe COPD (home oxygen 4L), CAD, obstructive
   cardiomyopathy presents with closed loop small bowel obstruction s/p
   exploratory laproscopy (nearly 1 foot of bowel removed), lysis of
   adhesions and small bowel resection.
   .
   # Closed loop small bowel obstruction: s/p exploratory laproscopy,
   lysis of adhesions and small bowel resection.
   - appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Completed 24h of post-op cefazolin
   - NPO with NGT in place
   - Pain control with morphine PCA, which has been working well for her
   pain and SOB
   - Surgery requesting periop beta [**Last Name (LF) 770**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] f/u about po vs. IV
   dosing, will likely need IV given bowel rest
   .
   # S/P Intubation/COPD: On home oxygen.
   - Successfully extubated and weaned down to her home level of O2 (2-4L
   NC)
   - Keeping patient net negative helps her overall respiratory status
   - Patient on morphine PCA for pain/SOB, has been on morphine as an
   outpatient to help with SOB
   - continue albuterol/atrovent
   .
   # Low UOP: likely secondary to need for ivfs and component of pre-renal
   secondary to mild hypotension and s/p surgery with fluid shifts.  UOP
   remained low in the setting of IVF, was given a lasix trial yesterday
   afternoon and responded with brisk UOP. Since that time UOP has
   remained elevated, will continue to monitor and if she needs more lasix
   would give only 20mg given extremely brisk response to 40mg IV
   # Obstructive Cardiomyopathy/CAD:
   - TTE given ? WMA on intraop TEE
   - try to run negative for the day as it results in improved respiratory
   status and likely improved cardiac function as well, goal is even to
   -500cc
   .
   # h/o DVT:  Currently not on coumadin.
   - sc heparin for prophylaxis
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue home levothyroxine

","The patient is an 85-year-old lady with severe COPD, CAD, and obstructive cardiomyopathy. She presented with closed loop small bowel obstruction after exploratory laparoscopy, lysis of adhesions, and small bowel resection. 

She has completed 24 hours post-op cefazolin, is NPO with an NGT in place, and is receiving pain control with morphine PCA. Surgery is requesting periop beta for follow-up regarding PO vs. IV dosing, as she will likely need IV given bowel rest.

The patient was successfully extubated and weaned down to her home level of O2 (2-4L NC). She is being kept net negative to help her overall respiratory status. The patient is on morphine PCA for pain/SOB, has been on morphine as an outpatient to help with SOB, and will continue albuterol/atrovent.

Her low urine output is likely secondary to IVF and component of pre-renal due to mild hypotension and s/p surgery with fluid shifts. She received a furosemide (Lasix) trial yesterday afternoon and responded with brisk urine output. Since then, her urine output has remained elevated, and she will continue to be monitored. If needed, she will receive only 20mg of Lasix given her extremely brisk response to 40mg IV.

Obstructive cardiomyopathy/CAD: A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, but the results are not mentioned. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was also done. The goal is to run negative for the day as it results in improved respiratory status and likely improved cardiac function as well.

The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently not on Coumadin. She is receiving subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis.

The patient has hypothyroidism and will continue her home levothyroxine.

ICU care includes NPO for now, bowel rest as per surgery. Glycemic control is not mentioned. The patient has arterial, central venous, and peripheral IV lines in place. Prophylaxis is being given for DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Code status has been reversed from DNR/DNI to full code for her surgery. The patient's disposition will likely be called out to surgery later this afternoon as long as she remains stable."

   # Closed loop small bowel obstruction: s/p exploratory laproscopy,
   lysis of adhesions and small bowel resection.
   - appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Completed 24h of post-op cefazolin
   - NPO with NGT in place
   - Pain control with morphine PCA, which has been working well for her
   pain and SOB
   .
   # S/P Intubation/COPD: On home oxygen.
   - Successfully extubated and weaned down to her home level of O2 (2-4L
   NC)

   remained low in the setting of IVF, was given a lasix trial yesterday
   afternoon and responded with brisk UOP. Since that time UOP has
   remained elevated, will continue to monitor and if she needs more lasix
   would give only 20mg given extremely brisk response to 40mg IV
   # Obstructive Cardiomyopathy/CAD:
   - TTE given ? WMA on intraop TEE
   - try to run negative for the day as it results in improved respiratory
   status and likely improved cardiac function as well

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 85-year-old lady with severe COPD, CAD, and obstructive cardiomyopathy.
- She presented with closed-loop small bowel obstruction after exploratory laparoscopy, lysis of adhesions, and small bowel resection.
- The patient was intubated due to post-operative complications and had COPD exacerbation. She has been successfully extubated and weaned down to her home level of O2 (2-4L NC).
- The patient is experiencing pain and shortness of breath, for which she is receiving morphine PCA.
- Her urine output is low, likely due to IV fluids and pre-renal factors secondary to mild hypotension and post-surgery fluid shifts. A trial of lasix was given yesterday afternoon, which resulted in a brisk urine output. Further monitoring and potential use of lasix will be considered.
- The patient has a history of DVT and is currently not on coumadin, so prophylactic sc heparin is being administered.
- She also has hypothyroidism, for which she will continue taking home levothyroxine.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old lady with severe COPD, CAD, and obstructive cardiomyopathy. She presented with closed loop small bowel obstruction following exploratory laparoscopy, lysis of adhesions, and small bowel resection. The patient was intubated due to postoperative COPD exacerbation and is currently on home oxygen. She has a history of DVT and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of severe COPD and recent postoperative complications, there is a risk of respiratory failure or exacerbation of COPD symptoms. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.

2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of CAD and obstructive cardiomyopathy, which increases the risk of cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or heart failure. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, especially blood pressure and heart rate, is crucial.

3. Infection: The patient is still receiving antibiotics (Cefazolin) as per surgical recommendations. There is a risk of infection, especially considering the recent surgery and prolonged hospital stay. Regular assessment of vital signs and laboratory parameters, including white blood cell count, should be done to detect any signs of infection.

4. Thromboembolic Events: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently receiving subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis. Monitoring for signs of deep vein thromb"
