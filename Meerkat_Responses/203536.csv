   # Hypoxia: Diff DX includes infectious (most likely viral or atypical
   given onset and interstitial pattern though would have expected
   atypical to respond to Azithro), malignant (lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis), Pulmonary Embolism and volume overload.  Patient's
   course and URTI symptoms, plus her husband's illness is most consistent
   with a viral process that was complicated by either PE or volume
   overload.  Repeat CXR hints at volume overload though not clear.
   Patient mildly tachycardic but EKG does not show stigmata of PE.
   Patient at some increased risk for PCP given recent dexamethasone but
   this is much less likely given her course.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer to the lung and brain. She was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress and is currently on high-dose oxygen. She has been experiencing worsening symptoms despite antibiotic therapy, diuretics, and heparin infusion. The patient also presents with left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain, but further investigation is needed to determine the cause. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/55 mmHg to 125/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, and electrolytes. Imaging studies reveal bilateral patchy infiltrates on the chest X-ray, and a negative bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI) for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's condition remains critical, and she is currently receiving ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress has not improved with antibiotics and other interventions. Continued monitoring and adjustment of respiratory support may be necessary.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient is on heparin infusion for possible PE, indicating a concern for this condition. Further diagnostic tests, such as a computed tomography angiography"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and upper respiratory infection symptoms. The patient's condition has worsened, leading to transfer to the ICU.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing difficulty in breathing and has low oxygen saturation levels. This could be due to various causes including infectious processes, malignant spread (lymphangitic carcinomatosis), pulmonary embolism, or volume overload. The patient's course and URI symptoms suggest a viral process that may have been complicated by either PE or volume overload.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a concern for possible respiratory failure. The patient's ability to maintain oxygen saturation above 90% is uncertain, and intubation may be necessary if the patient is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest a possible infectious process. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but further evaluation is needed to identify the specific causative organism.

4. Pulmonary Edema: The worsening interstitial and bilateral ground-glass opacity seen on imaging is more consistent with pulmonary edema rather than lymphangitic carcinomatosis. Treatment for volume overload should be considered, and diuretics may be useful in managing this condition.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer, admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms. She was transferred to the ICU due to worsening hypoxia and is currently stable on nonrebreather oxygen (NRB). The patient's condition is complicated by several potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's primary concern is hypoxia, which could be caused by infectious, malignant (lymphangitic carcinomatosis), pulmonary embolism (PE), or volume overload. The recent CXR hints at volume overload, but further evaluation is needed.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The marked worsening of interstitial and bilateral ground-glass opacity in a perihilar and upper lobe distribution suggests pulmonary edema rather than lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
3. Pulmonary Metastatic Disease Progression: The unchanged diffuse osseous, hepatic, and pulmonary metastases indicate the possibility of concomitant pulmonary metastatic disease progression.
4. Proctitis: Mild rectal wall enhancement may reflect mild proctitis.
5. Pulmonary Embolism: Although the CTA was negative, the patient remains at an increased risk for PE due to her medical history and symptoms.
6. Atypical Coverage: The patient recently completed a full course of azithromycin, so no current atypical coverage is"

   more consistent with pulmonary edema than lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
   No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Mild rectal wall enhancement may
   reflect mild proctitis. 3. Unchanged diffuse osseous, hepatic and

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and upper respiratory infection symptoms. She has been stable on non-rebreather oxygen and is currently on high flow mask with an SpO2 of 97%. The patient's course suggests a viral process with possible complications of pulmonary embolism or volume overload. There are no signs of pulmonary embolism on CT, and the patient has shown improvement with one dose of IV lasix, indicating possible volume overload. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/59 mmHg to 129/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high flow mask.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's primary issue is hypoxia, which could worsen if she is unable to maintain an SpO2 above 90% on high flow mask. If this occurs, intubation may be necessary.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient has shown improvement with IV lasix, indicating a possible volume overload. Close monitoring and further evaluation of cardiac function are recommended.
3. Pulmonary embolism: Although the CT scan showed no signs of PE, it cannot be completely ruled out. Continued monitoring and consideration of a lower extremity venous ultrasound may be"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 65-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer admitted for hypoxia and upper respiratory tract infection symptoms.
- She was transferred to the ICU for worsening hypoxia and is currently stable on non-rebreather oxygen therapy.
- The differential diagnosis for her hypoxia includes infectious causes (such as viral or atypical bacterial), malignant causes (lymphangitic carcinomatosis), and volume overload.
- The patient's course and URI symptoms, along with her husband's illness, suggest a viral process with possible complications of pulmonary embolism or volume overload.
- A repeat chest X-ray showed some improvement after one dose of IV lasix, indicating that she may be volume overloaded.
- She has an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) but no signs of pulmonary embolism on CT.
- The patient is at increased risk for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) due to recent dexamethasone use, but this is less likely given her clinical course.
- The plan is to continue oxygen therapy, titrating to keep oxygen saturation (SpO2) >90%. Intubation will be considered if unable to maintain adequate oxygenation.
- A repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) will be done with any clinical change.
- If the clinical course does not improve, a bronchoscopy for tissue biopsy may be"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - LLQ pain persists intermittently, got percocet and ativan yesterday;
   had pain again this morning [**2-29**], but not as severe as yesterday
   - has not had a BM since Saturday; no diarrhea, no subjective blood in
   stool
   - KUB final read: Supine and upright views of the abdomen demonstrate a
   non-obstructive bowel gas pattern, and no evidence of free
   intraperitoneal air. Left basilar airspace opacification is identified
   within the imaged portion of the chest as well as bilateral nonspecific
   interstitial opacities and small pleural effusions
   - serial abdominal exam -> pain resolved.
   - f/u CTA/abdomen today: dictated read (check final read): 1. A marked
   worsening of interstitial and bilateral ground-glass opacity in a
   perihilar and upper lobe distribution, given rapid interval progression
   more consistent with pulmonary edema than lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
   No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 2. Mild rectal wall enhancement may
   reflect mild proctitis. 3. Unchanged diffuse osseous, hepatic and
   pulmonary metastases. Given underlying pulmonary metastases and
   significant superimposed interstitial and ground glass abnormality, a
   concomitant pulmonary metastatic disease progression cannot be excluded
   and short-term interval followup to exclude lmphangitic carcinomatosis
   is recommended.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer admitted for hypoxia and upper respiratory infection symptoms.
- She was transferred to the ICU for worsening hypoxia and is currently stable on high-flow nasal cannula.
- The patient's course and symptoms suggest a viral process that may have been complicated by either pulmonary embolism or volume overload.
- Her oxygen saturation levels are in the mid-90s, and she is being closely monitored with ABG analysis.
- The patient has completed a course of Azithromycin for atypical coverage and is showing some improvement clinically with Lasix diuretics.
- Further diagnostic tests, such as repeat sputum culture, viral DFA and culture, CT abdomen/pelvis, and follow-up oncology recommendations, are planned.
- The patient's pain, breast cancer, and constipation are also being managed accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is at risk for further respiratory compromise due to the possibility of an infectious or malignant cause.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's symptoms may indicate the presence of a pulmonary embolism, which can lead to respiratory distress and potentially fatal complications.
3. Volume overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating ongoing efforts to manage volume overload, which can have cardiovascular implications.
4. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): Although less likely, the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, hypoxia, and upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms. She was transferred to the ICU due to worsening hypoxia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 107/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination shows bilateral basilar inspiratory crackles, regular heart sounds without murmurs, mild lower left quadrant tenderness in the abdomen, and no peripheral edema or cyanosis. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The ECHO shows moderate pulmonary artery hypertension, and the chest X-ray reveals increased bibasilar opacities. The patient's condition is improving with diuretics and negative fluid balance. The assessment and plan include continued oxygen therapy, consideration of intubation if unable to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%, gentle diuresis with a goal of negative 500 mL fluid balance, repeat ABG with any clinical change, albuterol and ipratropium nebs, continued vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia coverage, discussion of gallium scan to differentiate between lymphangitic carcinomatosis and infectious etiology"

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer admitted for hypoxia and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms. She was transferred to the ICU for worsening hypoxia and is currently stable on nasal high flow oxygen (NRB).

The patient's medical history includes positive estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positive breast cancer that has metastasized to the lung. The cancer progressed despite treatment with faslodex, aromasin, and xomeda. She also underwent recent whole brain irradiation.

The patient is experiencing several medical complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's primary concern is hypoxia, which could be due to various causes such as infectious, malignant (lymphangitic carcinomatosis), pulmonary embolism (PE), or volume overload. The patient's symptoms, along with her husband's illness, suggest a viral process that may have been complicated by PE or volume overload. The repeat chest X-ray indicates possible volume overload, and the patient is at an increased risk for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) due to recent dexamethasone use. However, PCP is less likely given her clinical course.

The plan includes continuing oxygen therapy, titrating to keep oxygen saturation (sats) above 90%. If unable to maintain sats above 90%, intubation may be necessary for a short-term period. ABG repeat"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer who was admitted for hypoxia and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms. She was transferred to the ICU due to worsening hypoxia and is currently stable on nasal high-flow oxygen.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/55 mmHg to 119/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is alert and oriented, with no murmurs or thrills on cardiac examination. There is mild lower left quadrant (LLQ) tenderness on abdominal examination, but no peripheral edema or cyanosis. Neurologically, the patient is awake and conversant, with grossly intact functions.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood chemistry values are within normal ranges, except for an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. Imaging studies show no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but there are bilateral basilar inspiratory crackles on lung auscultation.

   atypical to respond to Azithro), malignant (lymphangitic

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and upper respiratory infection symptoms. She was transferred from the general medical floor due to worsening hypoxia. Her current condition shows improvement with subjective feelings of betterment, decreased FiO2 requirement, and tolerance for out-of-bed activities. The patient has a history of metastatic breast cancer that is positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors. She has received various treatments but showed progression of the disease. She recently underwent whole brain irradiation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient initially presented with hypoxia, which can be caused by several factors including infectious processes, malignant spread (lymphangitic carcinomatosis), or volume overload. Although a viral process seems most consistent with her symptoms and her husband's illness, other causes should be considered and monitored.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is receiving antibiotics for empiric coverage of pneumonia. It is important to monitor her response to the treatment and repeat ABG with any clinical change.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient has been experiencing left lower quadrant abdominal pain. Differential diagnoses include constipation, metastatic disease, diverticulitis, and gastroenteritis. Further evaluation and management should focus on these possibilities.
4. Breast cancer progression: The patient has metastatic breast cancer that has progressed despite treatment. Regular follow-up with the primary oncologist is essential to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to worsening hypoxia and is currently stable on non-rebreather mask (NRB).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/77 mmHg to 92/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and fluid balance shows a total input of 1,280 mL and output of 1,110 mL, resulting in a balance of 170 mL.

Physical examination reveals the patient sleeping comfortably with the head of the bed at 45 degrees and easily aroused. There is chronic supraclavicular fullness noted on the left side. The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count ranging from 5.1 to 6.7 thousand cells/microliter, hemoglobin level ranging from 27.3 to 28.2 g/dL, platelet count of 67 thousand cells/microliter, creatinine level ranging from 0.6 to 0.7 mg/dL, and glucose level ranging from 139 to 110 mg/dL.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia with potential differential diagnoses including infectious causes (such as viral or atypical pneumonia), malignant causes (lymphangitic carcinomatosis), and volume overload. The patient's course and URI symptoms suggest a viral process that may have been complicated by either pulmonary embolism (PE) or volume overload. Repeat chest X-ray hints at volume overload. The patient is at an increased risk for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) given recent dexamethasone use, but this is less likely given her clinical course.

2. Respiratory support: The patient is currently on 6 liters of nasal cannula (NC) plus high-flow face mask with FiO2 set at 95% to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%. If the patient is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation, intubation may be considered for a short-term period.

3. Fluid management: The patient has shown some improvement with lasix and has had a negative fluid balance of 877 mL yesterday. The goal is to maintain a negative fluid balance of 500 mL today.

4. Diagnostics: Repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis should be performed with any clinical changes. The patient is already receiving albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers, and empiric antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia is being continued. Previous use of azith"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms. She was transferred to the ICU due to worsening hypoxia and is currently stable on nonrebreather oxygen therapy (NRB). Her condition has improved clinically, with subjective improvement and no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory values.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient initially presented with hypoxia, which could be caused by various factors including infectious processes, malignant involvement of the lungs (lymphangitic carcinomatosis), or volume overload. However, the patient's clinical improvement suggests a viral process as the most likely cause.
2. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP): Although the patient received dexamethasone, which can increase the risk of PCP, her clinical course does not strongly support this diagnosis.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and requirement for high-flow oxygen therapy may raise concerns for ARDS. However, there is no mention of bilateral infiltrates on imaging, and the patient's clinical improvement makes this less likely.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient had a negative compression ultrasound of the lower extremities, and bilateral lower extremity Doppler studies were negative for DVT. Therefore, the risk of DVT appears to be low at this"
