","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and previous hospitalization. He was transferred to the ICU with septic shock. The patient has several medical complications including severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (likely due to flash pulmonary edema), acute renal failure, liver mass (unclear etiology), anemia, troponin leak, chronic systolic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus type II, gout, and hypertension. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 102/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock has led to severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, indicated by worsening acidosis with rising lactate levels and an obstructive pattern on liver function tests. The most likely source of infection is the liver.

2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to flash pulmonary edema secondary to his underlying cardiomyopathy, tachycardia, and sepsis. Ventilatory support is being provided, and plans are in place to wean the patient off the ventilator as tolerated"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and previous hospitalization (Hospital 2092). He was transferred to the ICU with septic shock. The patient has multiple medical complications including severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, anemia, NSTEMI, chronic systolic congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, hyperglycemia, and gout.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is complicated by severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and drainage of a liver abscess was performed.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure likely due to flash pulmonary edema caused by underlying cardiomyopathy, tachycardia, and sepsis. Ventilator support has been provided, and measures are being taken to wean the patient off ventilatory support as tolerated.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are failing, likely related to overwhelming infection and hypovolemia. IV fluid resuscitation is ongoing, and renal function will be monitored closely.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely due to anemia of chronic disease, which has worsened with massive fluid resuscitation.
5. NSTEMI:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and a previous hospitalization (Hospital 2092). The patient was transferred to the unit with septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The likely source of infection is a liver abscess, which was drained by interventional radiology (IR) today. Cultures are pending to identify the causative organism.

The patient also has acute respiratory failure, likely due to flash pulmonary edema secondary to underlying cardiomyopathy, tachycardia, and sepsis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and will be weaned as tolerated.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure, likely related to overwhelming infection and hypovolemia. The patient is receiving intravenous fluids to maintain adequate volume status.

Other medical conditions noted include anemia of chronic disease, chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%, and a history of coronary artery disease with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's home medications, including aspirin, statin, and antihypertensives, have been held due to the current illness.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related complications: The patient is at risk for further complications related to sepsis, such as organ dysfunction, septic shock, and"

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and previous hospitalization (Hospital 2092). He was transferred to the ICU with septic shock and severe organ dysfunction. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, liver mass (unclear etiology), anemia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (EF 40%), and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema, likely caused by underlying cardiomyopathy, tachycardia, and sepsis. The plan is to wean off ventilator support as tolerated and prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute renal failure due to overwhelming infection and hypovolemia. It is essential to continue treatment of infection and volume resuscitation. IV fluids will be administered to maintain adequate circulation and follow urine output trends.

3. Liver Mass: The patient has a liver mass with unclear etiology. It may be an abscess or malignancy. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued, and cultures will be followed up. Hepatitis serologies were negative, and hepatology consult is appreciated. Further evaluation of the liver mass is needed"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yoM with a history of CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, PVD and [**Hospital 2092**]
   transferred to unit with septic shock.
   .
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   : worsening acidosis with rising lactate. GNR now growing in blood.
   Most likely source is liver. Urine also possible. Obstructive pattern
   on LFTs but no intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation suggesting
   etiology from hepatocyte injury rather than obstruction.  On broad
   spectrum antibiotics. Went for IR drainage of liver abcess today,
   drainage of 60cc of purulent material.
   - cont broad spectrum abx: Switched from  vanco, zosyn, flagyl (for
   possible C diff) to Zosyn, cipro, gent per ID recs.
   - IVF gor CVP minimum [**7-2**]. Can use D5W w/ 150 meq of bicarb until
   acidosis improved
   -Currently on Levophend and Neo to maintain MAP > 65, plan to add
   vasopressin next if necessary.
   - follow central venous O2 sats
   - s/p IR CT guided drainage with 60 cc purulent fluid. F/u cult,
   cytology.
   - ERCP fellow aware but unlikely to require intervention as no biliry
   dilation
   -Blood growing GNR, awaiting speciation, F/u , urine, sputum
   -C diff negative x1
   - hold off on steroids as septic and APC since s/p IR procedure, risk
   for bleeding.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   : likely due to flash pulmonary edema given underlying cardiomyopathy,
   tachycardia, and sepsis.
   - wean vent support as tolerated
   - VAP ppx
   .
   # liver mass. Unclear etiology. ? abscess vs malignancy. Had cyst in
   similar location. ? now super infected.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   - f/u cultures as above
   - Hepatitis serologies negative, AFP WNL
   - hepatology consult appreciated, sent Aoemba and Echinococcus serology
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF:. Likely related to
   overwhelming infection and hypovolemia. Continue to trend with
   treatment of infection and volume rescucitation.
   - IVF as above
   - follow UOP
   .
   # Anemia. Likely anemia of chronic disease. Worsened with dilution from
   massive fluid resesitation.
   - Active type and screen
   - serial Hcts
   .
   # NSTEMI: . Doubt acute plaque rupture physiology. Likely demand in the
   setting of acute illness with hypovolemia and poor clearance in the
   setting of acute renal failure. Troponins continue to rise
   -          trend CEs
   -          unable to anticoagulate with IR procedure.
   -          Unable to give BB, ACE in setting of hypotension
   -          Holding ASA with IR procedure consider restarting tomorrow.
   .
   # chronic systolic CHF, EF 40%. Echo today with EF 30-35%. Mod LV
   dysfxn with hypokinesis of distal septum. Possible acute change in

   shock. Hold home aspirin in the setting of IR procedure
   - Hold home BP meds in the setting of sepsis
   - Hold statin in the setting of liver disease.

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of heart failure, chronic anemia, and hypotension. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis and organ dysfunction, hyperglycemia, acute respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics including metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). He also received IR drainage of a liver abscess with 60 cc pus. His current medications include Levophenac, Neo overnight, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 127/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 13 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 10,553 mL and output of 2,185 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 8,368 mL. The patient has received a total of 7,463 mL of intravenous fluids.

Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through an endotracheal tube, set tidal volume (Vt) of 450 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 26 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 18 mmHg. Arterial blood gas (ABG) values show a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 262 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 31 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 100%.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 26.5 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.7 g/dL, elevated blood glucose level of 467 mg/dL, and elevated lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L. Liver function tests show elevated levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), as well as elevated total bilirubin (T Bili) level. Renal function tests indicate acute renal failure with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels.

The patient's medical history includes chronic heart failure, chronic anemia, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous hospitalization. He was transferred to the ICU with septic shock.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient has worsening acidosis with rising lactate levels and growth of Gram-negative rods (GNRs) in the blood culture. The most likely source of infection is the liver, as indicated by the presence of an abscess that was drained via interventional radiology (IR) procedure. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and the patient is being closely monitored.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is likely experiencing flash pulmonary edema due to his underlying cardiomyopathy, tachycardia, and sepsis. There may also be an element of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but this is not confirmed.
3. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, likely due to overwhelming infection and hypovolemia. Close monitoring of urine output (UOP) and IV fluids (IVF) is ongoing.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and previous hospitalization. He was transferred to the ICU with severe septic shock. The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis caused by a Gram-negative organism (GNR) growing in his blood, likely originating from a liver abscess. He became hypotensive again and unresponsive to fluid resuscitation, requiring the reintroduction of norepinephrine (Neo) and subsequent switch to levophed.

2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure, likely resulting from flash pulmonary edema associated with his underlying cardiomyopathy, tachycardia, and sepsis. There may also be an element of ARDS.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely related to overwhelming infection and hypovolemia. His renal function is being monitored, and he is receiving IV fluids as per the treatment plan.

4. Liver mass/abscess: An imaging study suggests the presence of a liver mass, which appears to be an abscess based on drainage performed by interventional radiology (IR). Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further speciation and sensitivity testing are pending.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and a previous hospitalization. He was transferred to the ICU with septic shock.

The patient's current conditions include severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, liver mass (appearing to be an abscess), anemia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (EF 40%), and hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening sepsis leading to multiple organ failure, progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), further deterioration of renal function, development of liver failure, exacerbation of heart failure, worsening of anemia, potential complications related to the NSTEMI such as arrhythmias or ischemic stroke, and uncontrolled hypertension.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, organ function, and laboratory values to promptly identify any potential complications and take appropriate measures to manage them."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and previous hospitalization. The patient was transferred to the ICU with septic shock. The patient's current medical conditions include severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, liver mass (abscess), NSTEMI, chronic systolic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, hyperglycemia, gout, and liver abscess.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening sepsis and septic shock, worsening respiratory failure leading to ARDS, progression of acute renal failure to chronic kidney disease, further liver dysfunction or abscess formation, worsening of ischemic heart disease and potential heart attack, uncontrolled hypertension, worsening peripheral vascular disease, uncontrolled hyperglycemia, gout flare-up, and potential complications from the liver abscess.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, oxygenation, and organ functions to prevent and manage these potential complications. The patient should be kept on broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat the liver abscess and sepsis. Frequent assessment of blood cultures, liver function tests, renal function tests, and other relevant lab parameters should be done to guide treatment. Close collaboration between the ICU team, infectious disease specialist, cardiologist, and hepatologist will be"

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   : GNR growing in blood, most likely source being his liver abscess.
   Overnight the patient became hypotensive again and not responsive to
   fluids, and was placed back on neosynephrine. Will switch to levo today
   and continue to monitor hemodynamics. Outside hospital records
   yesterday reported Klebsiella bacteremia; ID was notified but felt it
   would not change management at this point, as we are waiting for
   cultures here.
   - Switched to cipro and zosyn
   - For CVP of [**7-2**], use D5W w/ 150 meq of bicarb until acidosis improved
   - and Levophed (preferably)
   - follow central venous O2 sats
   - f/u IR evaluation for possible drainage of caudal lobe
   abscess/loculation
   - f/u surgery recs
   -f/u cultures
   -C diff negative, Ova and parasite negative
   -follow LFTs
   -TEE for possible endocarditis as nidus of infection
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   : likely secondary to  flash pulmonary edema initially, given
   underlying cardiomyopathy, tachycardia, and sepsis; however cannot
   exclude ARDS
   - will hold off on weaning off vent at this time given hemodynamic
   instability
   - VAP ppx

   # Liver abscess. Post-drain placement by IR. Per surgery may have other
   areas of loculation in caudate. Will go down to IR to evaluate for any
   other areas that may be amenable to drainage. If not, surgery may want
   to go in and evacuate in OR. The family will need to be contact[**Name (NI) **] to
   make sure this is within their goals of care for Mr.[**Known lastname 823**].

   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE: Likely related to overwhelming infection and
   hypovolemia. Improvement with fluid resuscitation.
   - IVF as above
   - follow UOP
   -monitor creatinine

   # Anemia. Likely anemia of chronic disease. Worsened with dilution from
   massive fluid resuscitation.  Does not appear to be actively bleeding
   at this time.  Hct has been stable over 24 hourse.
   - Active type and screen
   - serial Hcts
 stable [**11-5**]
   .
   # NSTEMI: Thought to be likely to demand ischemia in setting of sepsis,
   with rising troponins on admission but questionable changes on EKG.
   This could also have been falsely elevated by his acute renal failure
   and poor clearance of troponins/CK. Restarted his aspirin (low dose)
   but holding his BP meds given his hypotension. Recently had 2 episodes
   of atrial tachycardia, likely MAT. Responsive to lopressor but also
   resolved on its own the second time.
   -81mg ASA daily
   -Unable to give BB, ACE in setting of hypotension
   -continue to monitor for arrhythmia

   # Chronic systolic CHF, EF 40%: [**11-4**] Echo showed normal LA/RA, LV wall
   thicknesses and cavity size; moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction
   with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior
   walls. The distal inferior wall and apex are akinetic. LVEF = 30-35 %
   Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension.
   -restarted ASA
   - Hold home BP meds and statin
   - TEE today

 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 FSBG are improved, however he is receiving D5W
   w/bicarb which requires an insulin drip. ISS has been adjusted as well
   to cover for glucose under 150.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and peripheral vascular disease. He was transferred to the ICU with septic shock and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient underwent CT-guided drainage of a liver abscess, which yielded purulent fluid growing gram-negative rods (GNRs), but no bacteria yet. The source of infection is likely the liver, and urine is also a possible source. The patient has obstructive pattern on liver function tests (LFTs) without intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation, suggesting hepatocyte injury rather than obstruction.

The patient has multiple medical complications including severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure (likely due to flash pulmonary edema), acute renal failure (possibly related to overwhelming infection and hypovolemia), anemia (likely anemia of chronic disease), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (EF 40%), acute change in EF to 30-35%, and hypertension. The patient also has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, gout, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic liver mass (appearing to be an abscess based on IR drainage).

The patient is currently on various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, phenylephrine, metoprolol, dextrose, heparin sodium, and other ICU"

   abscess.  Outside hospital records yesterday reported Klebsiella
   bacteremia. No growth in abcess fluid. Last night period of htn to 190,
   tachy to 130, pressors stoped, however BP droped again after small dose
   lopressor. Required Norepi throughout night.
   - continue cipro and zosyn. S/p one dose of gentamicin for extended GNR
   coverage
   - on Levophed this am. Had been titrating to MAP of 65 but pt has a
   wide pulse pressure meaning was frequently with SBP of 120. Switched
   titrating parameters to SBP > 100 for pressor in hopes of weaning off
   today.
   - [**11-7**] rescaned abd for additional possible sites to drain. No
   abcesses to intervene on through IR. Scan shows multiple small
   abcesses,
   - f/u surgery recs, they suggest consider surgery for eval of liver and
   possible further intraop drainage.  However medical team feel pt is
   improving. Pressor requirements decreasing, afebrile, WBC downtrending,
   decreasing FiO2 on vent. Feel mortality risk with surgery at this time
   is greater.

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and previous hospitalization for septic shock. He was transferred to the unit with septic shock and has since been diagnosed with multiple medical complications.

1. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient has Klebsiella bacteremia, which is likely the same path as his liver abscess. He also had a period of hypertension and atrial tachycardia, indicating ongoing infection and potential sepsis. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has received extended GNR coverage with gentamicin.

2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[Doctor Last Name 11]): The patient likely developed flash pulmonary edema initially, given his underlying cardiomyopathy, tachycardia, and sepsis. However, it cannot be excluded that ARDS may develop. The patient's hemodynamic instability is a concern for weaning off the ventilator at this time.

3. Liver abscess: The patient has a liver abscess that was drained via interventional radiology (IR). Additional drainage sites are being evaluated through IR, as surgery may not be feasible for smaller abscesses in the caudate lobe. Hepatitis serologies are negative, and tumor markers are within normal limits.

4. Renal failure, acute: The patient's renal failure is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of heart failure, anemia, hypotension, liver abscess, and diabetes mellitus. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with severe sepsis, which can lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. If not managed properly, this can result in ventilator-associated pneumonia or worsening respiratory distress.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. If left untreated, AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Liver Failure: The presence of liver abscesses suggests ongoing liver dysfunction. If not appropriately managed, this can lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and other complications.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of heart failure increases the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, or heart failure exacerbation.
6. Infection Control: Given the patient's immunocompromised state, there is a risk of healthcare-associated infections, including central"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a previous hospitalization (Hospital 2092). The patient was transferred to the ICU with septic shock. He has several medical complications including severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, liver abscess, anemia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with ejection fraction of 40%, hypertension, PVD, gout, hyperglycemia, and bacteremia.

The patient's recent events include an episode of hypertension and atrial tachycardia, which resolved with the removal of levophed and administration of lopressor. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was attempted but unsuccessful due to loose teeth. A CT abdomen/pelvis showed near complete resolution of the left hepatic abscess, but there are multiple small collections elsewhere in the liver that are not amenable to percutaneous drainage. There is also evidence of bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, and left basilar consolidation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 88 bpm with a range of 70-116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The likely source of infection is a liver abscess. The patient's condition has worsened with episodes of hypotension and not responding to fluids, indicating ongoing sepsis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema initially, given the underlying cardiomyopathy, tachycardia, and sepsis. However, ARDS cannot be excluded.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely related to overwhelming infection and hypovolemia. Improvement has been observed with fluid resuscitation.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely due to chronic disease, which has worsened with dilution from massive fluid resuscitation. There is no active bleeding at this time.

5. NSTEMI: The patient is suspected to have had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) due to rising troponins on admission but questionable changes on EKG. This could also be falsely elevated by acute renal failure and poor clearance of troponins/CK.

6. Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient has chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30-"

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   : Klebsiella growing in blood, most likely same path as his liver
   abscess.  Outside hospital records yesterday reported Klebsiella
   bacteremia. No growth in abcess fluid. Last night period of htn to 190,
   tachy to 130, pressors stoped, however BP droped again after small dose
   lopressor. Required Norepi throughout night.
   - continue cipro and zosyn. S/p one dose of gentamicin for extended GNR
   coverage
   - on Levophed this am. Had been titrating to MAP of 65 but pt has a
   wide pulse pressure meaning was frequently with SBP of 120. Switched
   titrating parameters to SBP > 100 for pressor in hopes of weaning off
   today.
   - [**11-7**] rescaned abd for additional possible sites to drain. No
   abcesses to intervene on through IR. Scan shows multiple small
   abcesses,
   - f/u surgery recs, they suggest consider surgery for eval of liver and
   possible further intraop drainage.  However medical team feel pt is
   improving. Pressor requirements decreasing, afebrile, WBC downtrending,
   decreasing FiO2 on vent. Feel mortality risk with surgery at this time
   is greater.
   -f/u cultures
   -C diff negative, Ova and parasite negative
   -TEE for possible endocarditis as nidus of infection requested by ID.
   Feel likelihood of klebs endocarditis low, pt does not have
   presistantly positive blood cultures, clinically improving. Do not feel
   worth sending pt to OR for teeth pulling to do TEE.
   -bolus fluids as necessary for hypotension.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, PVD, and previous hospitalization for septic shock.
- He was transferred to the ICU with septic shock, likely due to Klebsiella bacteremia, which is also suspected to be the cause of his liver abscess.
- The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with periods of hypertension and tachycardia requiring pressor support.
- He has shown improvement with fluid resuscitation and decreased FiO2 on the ventilator.
- Surgical recommendations for further evaluation and possible drainage of additional abscesses were made, but the medical team believes the patient's current condition is improving and the risk of mortality with surgery outweighs the benefits.
- Cultures have been sent, and there are ongoing discussions regarding the need for a transesophageal echo (TEE) to evaluate for possible endocarditis.
- The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly secondary to flash pulmonary edema initially, but ARDS cannot be excluded.
- He has acute renal failure likely related to overwhelming infection and hypovolemia, which is improving with fluid resuscitation.
- The patient has anemia likely due to chronic disease, worsened by massive fluid resuscitation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, chronic anemia, hypotension, liver abscess, and bacteremia. He is currently in the ICU for severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and hyperglycemia. The patient's WBC count has been decreasing, and he has been weaned off all pressors. There is a discussion about stopping ciprofloxacin and re-imaging in a few days. The family is not excited about pursuing surgery at this time but may change their decision if the clinical situation changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia and liver abscess, and is currently being treated for severe sepsis. There is a risk of further infections or complications related to the ongoing infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can lead to difficulty in breathing and inadequate oxygenation.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can result in decreased kidney function and the accumulation of waste products in the body.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which can increase the risk of complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or further deterioration in organ function.
5. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has a liver abscess, which can affect liver function and lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or coag"

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   : Klebsiella growing in blood, most likely same path as his liver
   abscess.  Outside hospital records yesterday reported Klebsiella
   bacteremia. No growth in abcess fluid. Last night period of htn to 190,
   tachy to 130, pressors stoped, however BP droped again after small dose
   lopressor. Required Norepi throughout night.
   - continue cipro and zosyn. S/p one dose of gentamicin for extended GNR
   coverage
   - on Levophed this am. Had been titrating to MAP of 65 but pt has a
   wide pulse pressure meaning was frequently with SBP of 120. Switched
   titrating parameters to SBP > 100 for pressor in hopes of weaning off
   today.
   - [**11-7**] rescaned abd for additional possible sites to drain. No
   abcesses to intervene on through IR. Scan shows multiple small
   abcesses,
   - f/u surgery recs, they suggest consider surgery for eval of liver and
   possible further intraop drainage.  However medical team feel pt is
   improving. Pressor requirements decreasing, afebrile, WBC downtrending,
   decreasing FiO2 on vent. Feel mortality risk with surgery at this time
   is greater.
   -f/u cultures
   -C diff negative, Ova and parasite negative
   -TEE for possible endocarditis as nidus of infection requested by ID.
   Feel likelihood of klebs endocarditis low, pt does not have
   presistantly positive blood cultures, clinically improving. Do not feel
   worth sending pt to OR for teeth pulling to do TEE.
   -bolus fluids as necessary for hypotension.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   : likely secondary to  flash pulmonary edema initially, given
   underlying cardiomyopathy, tachycardia, and sepsis; however cannot
   exclude ARDS
   -          VAP ppx
   -          Decrease FIO2 from 50 to 40% this am

   # Liver abscess. Post-drain placement by IR. Per surgery may have other
   areas of loculation in caudate. wentdown to IR to evaluate for any
   other areas that may be amenable to drainage, however none were found.
   As above surgery may want to go in and evacuate in OR. Goals of care
   discussed with family, not clear that he would want the surgery.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   - Hepatitis serologies negative, AFP WNL, Aoemba and Echinococcus
   serology -pend
   .
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE: Likely related to overwhelming infection and
   hypovolemia. Improvement with fluid resuscitation.
   - IVF as above
   - follow UOP
   -monitor creatinine, slowing downtrending
   .
   # Anemia. Likely anemia of chronic disease. Worsened with dilution from
   massive fluid resuscitation.  Does not appear to be actively bleeding
   at this time.  Hct has been stable
   - Active type and screen
   - serial Hcts
 stable
   .
   # NSTEMI: Thought to be likely to demand ischemia in setting of sepsis,
   with rising troponins on admission but questionable changes on EKG.
   This could also have been falsely elevated by his acute renal failure
   and poor clearance of troponins/CK. Restarted his aspirin (low dose)
   but holding his BP meds given his hypotension. Recently had 2 episodes
   of atrial tachycardia, likely MAT. Responsive to lopressor but also
   resolved on its own the second time.
   -81mg ASA daily
   -Unable to give BB, ACE in setting of hypotension
   -continue to monitor for arrhythmia
   .
   # Chronic systolic CHF, EF 40%: [**11-4**] Echo showed normal LA/RA, LV wall
   thicknesses and cavity size; moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction
   with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior
   walls. The distal inferior wall and apex are akinetic. LVEF = 30-35 %
   Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, PVD, and septic shock. He was transferred to the ICU with severe sepsis and respiratory failure, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema initially, given underlying cardiomyopathy, tachycardia, and sepsis. The patient also has a liver abscess, acute renal failure, anemia, NSTEMI, chronic systolic CHF, hypertension, PVD, gout, hyperglycemia, and a history of hypotension (not shock).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently recovering from severe sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and close observation of vital signs are essential.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly due to flash pulmonary edema or ARDS. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and ventilation parameters is necessary. Weaning off ventilatory support may be considered based on the patient's clinical improvement.

3. Liver Abscess: The patient has a liver abscess that was previously drained but may require further intervention. Monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or abscess formation is important.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely related to overwhelming infection and hypovolemia. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is required. Adjustments in fluid"

The patient is currently in the ICU receiving mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, and multiple medications. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing organ dysfunction and requires close monitoring and aggressive management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and cultures will be necessary to identify any early signs of infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or anticoagulation may be needed to prevent this complication.
3. Stress ulcer: Critically ill patients, especially those receiving mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support, are at an increased risk of developing stress ulcers. Gastric prophylaxis may be required to prevent this complication.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's current acute renal failure increases the risk of developing AKI. Close monitoring of renal function and careful fluid management will be necessary to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic shock and current bacteremia with pansensitive Klebsiella infection. This indicates a severe infection that can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema initially, given the underlying cardiomyopathy, tachycardia, and sepsis. There is also a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given the increasing vent requirements.

3. Liver abscess: The patient has a liver abscess, which may require drainage. Surgery may want to evacuate other areas in the OR if amenable to drainage.

4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely related to overwhelming infection and hypovolemia. Improvement with fluid resuscitation is noted.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, likely due to chronic disease and worsened by massive fluid resuscitation. Active type and screen is recommended.

6. NSTEMI: The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) thought to be likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis, with rising troponins on admission but questionable changes on EKG.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, PVD, and previous hospitalization for septic shock. He was transferred to the ICU with severe sepsis due to Gram-negative rod bacteremia, likely Klebsiella. The patient also has acute respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, liver abscess, NSTEMI, chronic systolic CHF with EF 40%, hypertension, PVD, gout, hyperglycemia, and anemia of chronic disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing severe sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially progress to septic shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema initially, but cannot be excluded as ARDS. This could worsen if the patient develops further lung complications or if the underlying cause of the respiratory failure is not addressed.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely related to overwhelming infection and hypovolemia. If not managed appropriately, this could lead to chronic renal failure or end-stage renal disease.
4. Liver Abscess: The patient has a liver abscess, which may require drainage, especially if it becomes symptomatic or causes further systemic complications.
5. NSTEMI: Although the patient's troponin levels are rising, the EKG changes are"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a critically ill 84-year-old man with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaints include septic shock, respiratory failure, and liver abscess. 

From the review of systems, the patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/44mmHg to 184/66mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 mmHg.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 26 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 213.

In terms of laboratory results, the patient has an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 18.8 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 24.7%, platelet count (Plt) of 429 K/uL, blood glucose level of 230 mg/dL, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 26 mg/dL. The patient's microbiology results indicate the presence of Klebsiella in the blood and growth of Gram-positive rods in fluid.

The patient's imaging findings include increased edema on chest X-ray, as well as a probable right upper lobe opacity that is new.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Likely Klebsiella bacteremia from liver abscess.
2. Probable ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), with plans to check endotracheal aspirate and perform mini-brain natriuretic peptide analysis (miniBAL).
3. Addition of vancomycin and ciprofloxacin to the antibiotic regimen.
4. Congestive heart failure (CHF), both acute and chronic, with plans to hold diuretics for now but consider resuming this afternoon.
5. Renal failure, which appears stable.
6. Respiratory failure, likely secondary to sepsis, PNA, and CHF. Treatment will focus on addressing VAP and diuresis as tolerated. Weaning PEEP and lightening sedation will also be considered.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications, including septic shock, respiratory failure, liver abscess, CHF, renal failure, and possible VAP. Immediate medical attention and aggressive treatment are necessary to address these conditions and improve the patient's condition."

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and peripheral vascular disease. He was transferred to the ICU with septic shock and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, liver abscess, anemia, NSTEMI, chronic systolic congestive heart failure, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, hyperglycemia, gout, and hypotension.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 153/44 mmHg to 180/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes. Blood cultures have grown pansensitive Klebsiella, most likely the same pathogen causing his liver abscess. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient has had multiple episodes of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, indicating ongoing infection and sepsis. He also has worsening respiratory status, as evidenced by increasing ventilator requirements and new infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's renal function is impaired, likely due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and previous hospitalization for septic shock. The patient was transferred to the ICU with severe sepsis and septic shock. The patient has several medical complications that can arise due to his current condition.

1. Sepsis with organ dysfunction: The patient has severe sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient's respiratory function is compromised, likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema initially, given his underlying cardiomyopathy, tachycardia, and sepsis. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to increasing ventilator requirements and findings on the chest X-ray.

3. Liver abscess: The patient has a liver abscess, which may require drainage. It is important to monitor the patient's liver function tests and follow the recommendations of the infectious disease specialist.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely related to overwhelming infection and hypovolemia. Fluid resuscitation has improved his renal function, but it is crucial to continue monitoring his renal parameters and adjust fluid and medication administration accordingly.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is likely"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of bacteremia, liver abscess, and sepsis. The patient has a history of heart failure, chronic systolic, anemia, hypotension, and hyperglycemia. He also has respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient is currently on various medications including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, fentanyl, midazolam, insulin, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Infection: The patient is already diagnosed with bacteremia and liver abscess, indicating an ongoing infection. There is a risk of further infections due to the immunocompromised state caused by sepsis and organ dysfunction.

2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which means that his vital organs may be affected. This could potentially lead to acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, cardiovascular instability, and respiratory compromise.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which may require continued mechanical ventilation support. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory complications.

4. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which may require"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, PVD, and previous hospitalization for septic shock. He was transferred to the ICU with severe sepsis and organ dysfunction, including bacteremia with pansensitive Klebsiella, liver abscess, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anemia, NSTEMI, chronic systolic CHF, hypertension, gout, hyperglycemia, and PVD. The patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple episodes of hypotension, tachycardia, and fever. He required massive fluid resuscitation, pressors, and mechanical ventilation. There are concerns about ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and flash pulmonary edema. The patient's labs show elevated WBC count, creatinine, and liver enzymes, along with abnormal electrolytes and coagulation profile. Imaging studies reveal new right lung opacification and worsening effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's increasing ventilator requirements and right lung opacification on chest X-ray, there is a concern for VAP.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis and organ dysfunction may lead to further complications such as acute kidney injury or liver dysfunction.
3. Flash pulmonary edema: The patient's underlying cardiomyopathy and hypotension may contribute to flash pulmonary edema, which can wors"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a previous hospitalization for septic shock. The patient was transferred to the ICU with severe sepsis and organ dysfunction due to a Gram-negative rod bacteremia caused by pansensitive Klebsiella. The patient also has a liver abscess, which may or may not be related to the bacteremia.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications. These include acute respiratory failure, possibly secondary to flash pulmonary edema initially, and now with possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given the increasing ventilator requirements and new infiltrates on the chest X-ray. The patient's cardiac status is also a concern, with a history of chronic systolic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (EF 40%). The patient had an episode of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) during admission, but the EKG changes were questionable.

The patient's renal function has improved with fluid resuscitation, and there is ongoing concern for acute kidney injury. The patient has anemia, likely due to chronic disease, worsened by massive fluid resuscitation. There is also a concern for impaired skin integrity and hyperglycemia, for which insulin therapy is being continued.

The patient's vital signs have been unstable, with episodes of hypertension and tachycardia. The patient's oxygenation status is stable, with a SpO2 of 97% on 40% FiO2. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormalities in liver function tests. Blood cultures have grown Gram-negative rods, identified as pansensitive Klebsiella.

The patient's medication regimen includes broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam), antifungal therapy (Midazolam), pain management (Fentanyl), and insulin for glycemic control. The patient's code status is full code, and his family has been contacted and informed about his condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, development of multi-drug resistant organisms, progression of renal failure, further deterioration of cardiac function, and potential complications related to the liver abscess."

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 Klebsiella Bacteremia,
   Liver abscess
   : Pansensitive Klebsiella growing in blood (both from [**Hospital1 19**] and OSH
   samples). Remainder of workup has been negative.  No growth in abcess
   fluid initially now one sample with GNR, which ID strongly feels is
   contaminant and has not speciated further. Off pressors at this point
   with good UOP with lasix drip. WBC has been holding steady at 13 with
   intermittent low-grade fevers, but overall he seems to be improving.
   CXR with RUL infiltrates appear stable.

   -hemodynamically stable
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   : Initially flash pulmonary now with new VAP given CXR and increasing
   vent requirements. Added vancomycin to antibiotic regimen. Cultures
   have been negative so far. CXR appears slightly improved from
   yesterday. He appears to be tolerating lower vent settings today, with
   intermittent episodes of tachycardia and tachypnea, but would continue
   to wean as he is potentially stable enough to extubate today/tomorrow.

   -cipro, vanco, zosyn for PNA
   -ID recs

   .
   # Tachycardia: appears to be sinus tachycardia, as responds slightly to
   carotid massage.  Has had multiple episodes of HTN accompanying the
   tachycardia which improves with lopressor as well as increase in
   sedation. Given his overall improvement at this point it would be
   reasonable to restart a standing beta blocker and titrate as needed.
   -coreg [**Hospital1 **]
   -lasix IV prn if BP is stable
   -EKG if concern for arrhythmia
   -prn hydralazine for SBP over 170

   # Liver abscess. Post-drain placement by IR. Currently continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics for Klebsiella, anaerobes and usual GI infectious
   sources, although no other species have grown on culture.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   - Echinococcus negative, amoeba pending
   -maintain clean dressing
   .
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE: Likely related to overwhelming infection and
   hypovolemia. Slow and steady improvement with fluid resuscitation. Will
   continue to monitor Cr and treat fluid overload w/lasix as tolerated.
   At this point he may start to auto-diurese as we come down on his vent
   settings.
   - IVF as above

   massive fluid resuscitation.  Does not appear to be actively bleeding
   at this time.  Hct has been stable
   - Active type and screen
   - cont to follow hct
   .
   # NSTEMI: Thought to be likely to demand ischemia in setting of sepsis,
   with rising troponins on admission but questionable changes on EKG.
   This could also have been falsely elevated by his acute renal failure
   and poor clearance of troponins/CK. Overnight his EKG changes were in
   the setting of tachycardia, which would be appropriate to start beta
   blocker and maintain blood pressure and NSR. Baby aspirin restart, low

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, PVD, and septic shock. He was transferred to the ICU with severe sepsis, liver abscess, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, NSTEMI, chronic systolic CHF, hypertension, gout, hyperglycemia, impaired skin integrity, bacteremia, and anemia. The patient's current condition shows improvement with good urine output and stable vital signs. He is being treated for multiple infections, including Klebsiella bacteremia and pneumonia, and has had a liver abscess. The patient is also being managed for chronic conditions such as CHF, hypertension, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of severe sepsis and ongoing infection, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may progress to ARDS if not managed appropriately.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are failing, leading to elevated creatinine levels and potential fluid overload.
4. NSTEMI: The patient has had rising troponins, suggesting myocardial injury or ischemia, which may lead to further cardiac complications.
5. Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, which can worsen with ongoing stress and inadequate management.

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 Klebsiella Bacteremia,
   Liver abscess
   : Pansensitive Klebsiella growing in blood (both from [**Hospital1 19**] and OSH
   samples). Remainder of workup has been negative. Off pressors at this
   point with good UOP, autodiuresis overnight. WBC has been holding
   steady at 13 with intermittent low-grade fevers, but overall has been
   improving.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   : Initially flash pulmonary now with VAP given CXR and increasing vent
   requirements. Added vancomycin/cipro  to antibiotic regimen. Cultures
   have been negative so far. CXR appears slightly improved from
   yesterday, but appears to have underlying pulmonary edema. Was unable
   to extubate yesterday as did not tolerate PS 5/0 for very long. Was
   rested on AC overnight. We will continue to wean off the vent and
   extubate today if he does better.
   -on PS 10/5, continue to wean
   -BAL, sputum cx NG so far
   -cipro, vanco for PNA

   # Tachycardia: appears to be sinus tachycardia, as responds slightly to
   carotid massage.  Has had multiple episodes of HTN accompanying the
   tachycardia which improves with lopressor as well as increase in
   sedation. Has done well with coreg thus far, and may have room to
   increase today. Given his anemia, we will hold off on increasing
   bblocker until he has settled out after transfusion.
   -coreg [**Hospital1 **], consider increase in dose
   -lasix IV prn if BP is stable
   -EKG if concern for arrhythmia
   -start ACEi if BP>160s persistently

   # Liver abscess. Post-drain placement by IR. Currently continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics for Klebsiella, anaerobes and usual GI infectious
   sources, although no other species have grown on culture.  Drain has
   not had any significant output in the last 24hrs.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   - Echinococcus negative, amoeba pending
   .
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE: Likely related to overwhelming infection and
   hypovolemia. Slow and steady improvement with fluid resuscitation. Will
   continue to monitor Cr and treat fluid overload w/lasix as tolerated.
   At this point he may start to auto-diurese as we come down on his vent
   settings.
   - IVF as above
   - follow UOP, lasix boluses for UOP<100cc
   -monitor creatinine
   -renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia. Likely anemia of chronic disease. However given his steady
   decline (today 20) will transfuse 2U, with bolus lasix IV to avoid
   fluid overload and worsening pulmonary edema. Of note he continues to
   be very fluid overloaded so some of his anemia may be secondary to
   dilution from massive fluid resuscitation.  Does not appear to be
   actively bleeding at this time, hemolysis labs are negative and retic
   count is pending.

   # NSTEMI: Thought to be likely to demand ischemia in setting of sepsis,
   with rising troponins on admission but questionable changes on EKG.
   This could also have been falsely elevated by his acute renal failure
   and poor clearance of troponins/CK. Recent  EKG changes in the setting
   of tachycardia, which have resolved and may be due to demand ischemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and previous hospital admission. He was transferred to the ICU with septic shock due to Klebsiella bacteremia and liver abscess. The patient initially had flash pulmonary edema, which has now progressed to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He required intubation and mechanical ventilation but failed extubation attempts twice.

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, anemia, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), chronic systolic heart failure with ejection fraction (EF) of 40%, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), hyperglycemia, gout, and impaired skin integrity.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction): Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for Klebsiella, anaerobes, and usual GI infectious sources. Monitor white blood cell count and fever response.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): Wean off the ventilator and consider extubation if the patient tolerates pressure support levels of 5-10. BAL and sputum cultures should be performed.
3. Tachycardia: Adjust beta-blocker dose cautiously considering the patient's anemia and recent blood transfusion.
4. Liver abscess: Continue"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and is experiencing several medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. However, there are several important events mentioned:

1. The patient was weaned to assist-control ventilation mode but attempted extubation failed, so they were put back on assist-control ventilation.
2. The patient has been auto-diuresing, with a decrease in fluid intake of 2 liters overnight.

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 Klebsiella Bacteremia,
   Liver abscess
   : Pansensitive Klebsiella growing in blood (both from [**Hospital1 19**] and OSH
   samples). Remainder of workup has been negative.  No growth in abcess
   fluid initially now one sample with GNR, which ID strongly feels is
   contaminant and has not speciated further. Off pressors at this point
   with good UOP with lasix drip. WBC has been holding steady at 13 with
   intermittent low-grade fevers, but overall he seems to be improving.
   CXR with RUL infiltrates appear stable.

   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   : Initially flash pulmonary now with new VAP given CXR and increasing
   vent requirements. Added vancomycin to antibiotic regimen. Cultures
   have been negative so far. CXR appears slightly improved from
   yesterday. He appears to be tolerating lower vent settings today, with
   intermittent episodes of tachycardia and tachypnea, but would continue
   to wean as he is potentially stable enough to extubate today/tomorrow.

   # Tachycardia: appears to be sinus tachycardia, as responds slightly to
   carotid massage.  Has had multiple episodes of HTN accompanying the
   tachycardia which improves with lopressor as well as increase in
   sedation. Given his overall improvement at this point it would be
   reasonable to restart a standing beta blocker and titrate as needed.

   # Liver abscess. Post-drain placement by IR. Currently continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics for Klebsiella, anaerobes and usual GI infectious
   sources, although no other species have grown on culture.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   - Echinococcus negative, amoeba pending
   -maintain clean dressing
   .
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE: Likely related to overwhelming infection and
   hypovolemia. Slow and steady improvement with fluid resuscitation. Will
   continue to monitor Cr and treat fluid overload w/lasix as tolerated.
   At this point he may start to auto-diurese as we come down on his vent
   settings.

   # NSTEMI: Thought to be likely to demand ischemia in setting of sepsis,
   with rising troponins on admission but questionable changes on EKG.
   This could also have been falsely elevated by his acute renal failure
   and poor clearance of troponins/CK. Overnight his EKG changes were in
   the setting of tachycardia, which would be appropriate to start beta
   blocker and maintain blood pressure and NSR. Baby aspirin restart, low

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and previous hospitalization for septic shock. He was transferred to the ICU with severe sepsis and organ dysfunction due to Klebsiella bacteremia and a liver abscess. The patient has shown improvement with fluid resuscitation, and his white blood cell count has been stable at around 13, with intermittent low-grade fevers.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), for which he is being treated with vancomycin in addition to other antibiotics. He also has acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and flash pulmonary edema, which has been managed with diuretics.

The patient's renal function is improving slowly, and he is being monitored for fluid overload and given lasix as needed. His liver function tests show elevated levels of AST and ALT, but other liver enzymes are within normal range. The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease and has worsened due to massive fluid resuscitation. He does not appear to be actively bleeding.

The patient has a history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%, and peripheral vascular disease. His blood pressure has been uncontrolled, and he has been restarted on a beta-blocker. The patient also"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   : Initially flash pulmonary now with VAP given CXR and increasing vent
   requirements. Added vancomycin/cipro  to antibiotic regimen. Cultures
   have been negative so far. CXR appears worse from yesterday. Was unable
   to extubate yesterday as did not tolerate PS 5/0 for very long. Was
   rested on AC overnight. We will continue to wean off the vent and
   extubate today if he does better. ABG this am on .40 FiO2 shows O2 of
   63, FiO2 now at 50%.  Sputum and Mini BAL cx NG-final. Neg GM stain.

   # Tachycardia: appears to be sinus tachycardia, as responds slightly to
   carotid massage.  Has had multiple episodes of HTN accompanying the
   tachycardia which improves with lopressor as well as increase in
   sedation. Has done well with coreg thus far, and may have room to
   increase today. Given his anemia, we will hold off on increasing
   bblocker until he has settled out after transfusion.

   sources, although no other species have grown on culture.  Drain has
   not had any significant output in the last 48hrs.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics

   # Anemia. Likely anemia of chronic disease. However given his steady
   decline (today 20) will transfuse 2U, with bolus lasix IV to avoid
   fluid overload and worsening pulmonary edema. Of note he continues to
   be very fluid overloaded so some of his anemia may be secondary to
   dilution from massive fluid resuscitation.  Does not appear to be
   actively bleeding at this time, hemolysis labs are negative and retic
   count is 5.5%.  Transfused 2 units PRBCs yesterday with HCT increase

   with rising troponins on admission but questionable changes on EKG.
   This could also have been falsely elevated by his acute renal failure
   and poor clearance of troponins/CK. Recent  EKG changes in the setting
   of tachycardia, which have resolved and may be due to demand ischemia.

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 Klebsiella Bacteremia,
   Liver abscess
   : Pansensitive Klebsiella growing in blood (both from [**Hospital1 19**] and OSH
   samples). Remainder of workup has been negative. Off pressors at this
   point with good UOP, autodiuresis overnight. WBC has been holding
   steady at 13 with intermittent low-grade fevers, but overall has been
   improving.
   - zosyn, touch base w/ID to establish timeline for abx
   -no drainage per catheter
   - monitor abd distention
   -monitor UOP, if drops below 100 give lasix IV bolus
   -hemodynamically stable
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   : Initially flash pulmonary now with VAP given CXR and increasing vent
   requirements. Added vancomycin/cipro  to antibiotic regimen. Cultures
   have been negative so far. CXR appears slightly improved from
   yesterday, but appears to have underlying pulmonary edema. Was unable
   to extubate yesterday as did not tolerate PS 5/0 for very long. Was
   rested on AC overnight. We will continue to wean off the vent and
   extubate today if he does better.
   -on PS 10/5, continue to wean
   -BAL, sputum cx NG so far
   -cipro, vanco for PNA
   -ID recs
   -lasix bolus for pulmonary edema
   .
   # Tachycardia: appears to be sinus tachycardia, as responds slightly to
   carotid massage.  Has had multiple episodes of HTN accompanying the
   tachycardia which improves with lopressor as well as increase in
   sedation. Has done well with coreg thus far, and may have room to
   increase today. Given his anemia, we will hold off on increasing
   bblocker until he has settled out after transfusion.
   -coreg [**Hospital1 **], consider increase in dose
   -lasix IV prn if BP is stable
   -EKG if concern for arrhythmia
   -start ACEi if BP>160s persistently
   .
   # Liver abscess. Post-drain placement by IR. Currently continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics for Klebsiella, anaerobes and usual GI infectious
   sources, although no other species have grown on culture.  Drain has
   not had any significant output in the last 24hrs.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   - Echinococcus negative, amoeba pending
   .
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE: Likely related to overwhelming infection and
   hypovolemia. Slow and steady improvement with fluid resuscitation. Will
   continue to monitor Cr and treat fluid overload w/lasix as tolerated.
   At this point he may start to auto-diurese as we come down on his vent
   settings.
   - IVF as above
   - follow UOP, lasix boluses for UOP<100cc
   -monitor creatinine
   -renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia. Likely anemia of chronic disease. However given his steady
   decline (today 20) will transfuse 2U, with bolus lasix IV to avoid
   fluid overload and worsening pulmonary edema. Of note he continues to
   be very fluid overloaded so some of his anemia may be secondary to
   dilution from massive fluid resuscitation.  Does not appear to be
   actively bleeding at this time, hemolysis labs are negative and retic
   count is pending.
   - Active type and screen
   - 2U PRBC
   -20mg IV lasix prn
   .
   # NSTEMI: Thought to be likely to demand ischemia in setting of sepsis,
   with rising troponins on admission but questionable changes on EKG.
   This could also have been falsely elevated by his acute renal failure
   and poor clearance of troponins/CK. Recent  EKG changes in the setting
   of tachycardia, which have resolved and may be due to demand ischemia.
   On aspirin, low dose coreg.
   -81mg ASA daily
   -coreg [**Hospital1 **]
   -monitor on tele, EKG if concern
   .
   # Chronic systolic CHF, EF 40%: [**11-4**] Echo showed normal LA/RA, LV wall
   thicknesses and cavity size; moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction
   with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior
   walls. The distal inferior wall and apex are akinetic. LVEF = 30-35 %
   Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy, PVD, and previous hospitalization for septic shock. He was transferred to the ICU with septic shock, Klebsiella bacteremia, and a liver abscess. The patient has shown improvement in his condition, but still faces several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient initially had flash pulmonary edema and now has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He requires continued weaning off the ventilator and possible extubation if he tolerates pressure support.
2. Sepsis, Severe (with organ dysfunction): The patient's sepsis is caused by Klebsiella bacteremia and a liver abscess. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered, and the drain from the liver abscess has not shown significant output in the last 24 hours.
3. Renal Failure, Acute: The patient's renal function is improving with fluid resuscitation, but ongoing monitoring of creatinine levels is necessary. Fluid overload should be managed with lasix as tolerated.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to chronic disease or fluid overload. A transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) has been ordered.
5. NSTEMI: Although troponin levels are elevated, EKG changes are inconclusive."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and previous hospitalization. He was transferred to the ICU with septic shock due to Klebsiella bacteremia and liver abscess. The patient's current conditions include severe respiratory failure, acute renal failure, anemia, NSTEMI, chronic systolic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, hyperglycemia, gout, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and the need for continued weaning off the ventilator.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring of creatinine levels and fluid balance is essential.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease, and there may be ongoing blood loss or inadequate production of red blood cells. Transfusion and monitoring of hemoglobin levels are necessary.
4. NSTEMI: The patient has a history of NSTEMI, and there is a risk of recurrent ischemia or myocardial infarction. Continuous cardiac monitoring and optimization of heart failure medications are important.
5. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Management of fluid balance"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and previous hospitalization. He was transferred to the ICU with septic shock and has multiple comorbidities including severe liver abscess, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, NSTEMI, chronic systolic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, hyperglycemia, gout, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, likely secondary to Klebsiella bacteremia and liver abscess. He also has acute respiratory failure, possibly due to flash pulmonary edema and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Acute renal failure is suspected, which may be related to overwhelming infection and hypovolemia. The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease, but there is a concern for dilutional anemia secondary to massive fluid resuscitation. The patient had a recent NSTEMI, and his chronic systolic heart failure requires ongoing management.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, hydralazine, heparin sodium, and lantus. The patient's family has been informed of the situation.

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 Klebsiella Bacteremia,
   Liver abscess
   : Pansensitive Klebsiella growing in blood (both from [**Hospital1 19**] and OSH
   samples). Remainder of workup has been negative. Off pressors at this
   point with good UOP, autodiuresis overnight. WBC has been trending down
   last 3 days 13-12-11, with intermittent low-grade fevers, but afebrile
   now.
   - continue Zosyn for now
   - d/c Vanc/Cipro as should be well covered w/ Zosyn and no culture data
   or clear source.
   - ID following, appreciate recs.
   - no drainage per hepatic catheter
   - monitor abd distention
   -monitor UOP, if drops below 100 give lasix IV bolus
   -hemodynamically stable with UOP approx 12-15cc /hr
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   : Initially flash pulmonary now with VAP given CXR and increasing vent
   requirements. Added vancomycin/cipro  to antibiotic regimen. Cultures
   have been negative so far. CXR appears worse from yesterday. Was unable
   to extubate yesterday as did not tolerate PS 5/0 for very long. Was
   rested on AC overnight. We will continue to wean off the vent and
   extubate today if he does better. ABG this am on .40 FiO2 shows O2 of
   63, FiO2 now at 50%.  Sputum and Mini BAL cx NG-final. Neg GM stain.
   Xray this am shows some worsening compared to yesterday.
   -Repeat ABG this am
   - on CMV, continue to wean as tolerated
   - consider repeat BAL if spikes
   - Stopped Vanc/Cipro (as above), will continue Zosyn, which should
   cover both the Klebsiella as well as many lung pathogen
   - Consider checking NIFF
   - Lasix 40mg IV x1 and Lasix drip to continue diuresis to improve
   respiratory status given worsening xray
   .
   # Tachycardia: HR has been well controlled for past day. Previous
   appeared to be sinus tachycardia, as responded slightly to carotid
   massage.  Has had multiple episodes of HTN accompanying the tachycardia
   which improves with lopressor as well as increase in sedation. Has done
   well with coreg thus far, and may have room to increase today. Given
   his anemia, we will hold off on increasing B-blocker until he has
   settled out after transfusion and BPs stabilize.
   -coreg [**Hospital1 **], consider increase in dose
   -lasix IV bolus and drip today if BP is stable
   .
   # Liver abscess. Post-drain placement by IR. Currently continuing broad
   spectrum antibiotics for Klebsiella, anaerobes and usual GI infectious
   sources, although no other species have grown on culture.  Drain has
   not had any significant output in the last 48hrs.
   - Continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   - Echinococcus negative, amoeba pending
   .
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE: Likely related to overwhelming infection and
   hypovolemia. Had some  improvement with fluid resuscitation. Will
   continue to monitor Cr and treat fluid overload w/ lasix as tolerated.
   Cr stable at 2.1 for past 3 days
   - IVF as above
   - follow UOP, lasix boluse and drip today
   -monitor creatinine
   -renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia. Likely anemia of chronic disease. However given his steady
   decline (today 20) will transfuse 2U, with bolus lasix IV to avoid
   fluid overload and worsening pulmonary edema. Of note he continues to
   be very fluid overloaded so some of his anemia may be secondary to
   dilution from massive fluid resuscitation.  Does not appear to be
   actively bleeding at this time, hemolysis labs are negative and retic
   count is 5.5%.  Transfused 2 units PRBCs yesterday with HCT increase
   from 20.5 to 28.0, 25.8 this am.

   .
   # NSTEMI: Thought to be likely to demand ischemia in setting of sepsis,
   with rising troponins on admission but questionable changes on EKG.
   This could also have been falsely elevated by his acute renal failure
   and poor clearance of troponins/CK. Recent  EKG changes in the setting
   of tachycardia, which have resolved and may be due to demand ischemia.
   On aspirin, low dose coreg.  Tropins appeared to have stabilized or
   started to decrease at 0.81 from 0.84, have not been trended further.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient has been in the ICU for several days, with multiple medical complications. The chief complaint is not specified in the note. 

The patient had an EKG at 09:57 AM and a PICC line placed at 04:00 PM. The multi-lumen line was stopped at 04:33 PM, and the left internal jugular (IJ) line was discontinued with tip coaxial. There was some blood with suctioning from the endotracheal tube (ETT). The patient was initially doing well on pressure support ventilation (PSV) but became hypertensive, tachypneic, tachycardic, and agitated. Therefore, sedation was increased, and the patient was switched back to assist-control (AC) ventilation.

The patient was earlier hypotensive and did not receive a lasix drip due to incompatibility with other medications. Instead, the patient received 20 IV (200-300 per hour) of lasix. The patient also received antibiotics, including vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient has various infusions, including fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), pantoprazole (Protonix), hydralazine, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). The patient's medical"

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 Klebsiella Bacteremia,
   Liver abscess
   : Pansensitive Klebsiella growing in blood (both from [**Hospital1 19**] and OSH
   samples). Remainder of workup has been negative. Off pressors at this
   point with good UOP, autodiuresis overnight. WBC has been trending down
   last 3 days 13-12-11, with intermittent low-grade fevers, but afebrile
   now.  Vanc and Cipro dc
d yesterday as no clear culture data.
   - continue Zosyn for 2-3 weeks
   - ID following, appreciate recs.
   - no drainage per hepatic catheter, will reimage today with RUQ US and
   talk to IR about removal.
   - monitor UOP, if drops below 100 give lasix IV bolus
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   : Initially flash pulmonary  with possible VAP given CXR and increasing
   vent requirements, vancomycin/cipro were added to antibiotic regimen.
   Cultures have been negative so far. Vanc/Cipro stopped yesterday. CXR
   appears to have worse edema from yesterday.  Sputum and Mini BAL cx
   NG-final. Neg GM stain. Will diurese more today with goal of -2L.
   - on CMV, continue to wean as tolerated,
   - consider repeat BAL if spikes
   - continue Zosyn, which should cover both the Klebsiella as well as
   many lung pathogen
   - Consider checking NIFF
   - Lasix 20mg IV  continue diuresis to improve respiratory status given
   worsening xray
   .
   # Tachycardia: HR has been well controlled for past day. Previous
   appeared to be sinus tachycardia, as responded slightly to carotid
   massage.  Has had multiple episodes of HTN accompanying the tachycardia
   which improves with lopressor as well as increase in sedation. Has done
   well with coreg thus far, and may have room to increase today. Given
   his anemia, we will hold off on increasing B-blocker until he has
   settled out after transfusion and BPs stabilize.
   -coreg [**Hospital1 **], consider increase in dose
   .
   # Liver abscess. Post-drain placement by IR. Currently continuing zosyn
   for Klebsiella, anaerobes and usual GI infectious sources, although no
   other species have grown on culture.  Drain has not had any significant
   output in the last 72hrs.
   - Continue zosyn
   .
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE: Likely related to overwhelming infection and
   hypovolemia. Had some  improvement with fluid resuscitation. Will
   continue to monitor Cr and treat fluid overload w/ lasix as tolerated.
   Cr stable at 2.1 for past 3 days, improved to 1.9 today
   - IVF as above
   - follow UOP, lasix today
   -monitor creatinine, lytes
   -renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia. Likely anemia of chronic disease. However given his steady
   decline (today 20) will transfuse 2U, with bolus lasix IV to avoid
   fluid overload and worsening pulmonary edema. Of note he continues to
   be very fluid overloaded so some of his anemia may be secondary to
   dilution from massive fluid resuscitation.  Does not appear to be
   actively bleeding at this time, hemolysis labs are negative and retic
   count is 5.5%.  Transfused 2 units PRBCs yesterday with HCT increase
   from 20.5 to 28.0, not 29.6 this am.
   - PM HCT to trend
   - Active type and screen good until : [**2109-11-15**]
   .
   # NSTEMI: Thought to be likely to demand ischemia in setting of sepsis,
   with rising troponins on admission but questionable changes on EKG.
   This could also have been falsely elevated by his acute renal failure
   and poor clearance of troponins/CK. Recent  EKG changes in the setting
   of tachycardia, which have resolved and may be due to demand ischemia.
   On aspirin, low dose coreg.  Tropins appeared to have stabilized or
   started to decrease at 0.81 from 0.84, have not been trended further.
   -81mg ASA daily
   -coreg [**Hospital1 **]
   -monitor on tele, EKG if concern
   .
   # Chronic systolic CHF, EF 40%: [**11-4**] Echo showed normal LA/RA, LV wall
   thicknesses and cavity size; moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction
   with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior
   walls. The distal inferior wall and apex are akinetic. LVEF = 30-35 %
   Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension.
   -restarted ASA
   - coreg as above
   .
   # PVD. On aspirin only.
   .
   # HYPERGLYCEMIA
 Received Lantus 10 last night, with sugars this am
   150-160 this am.
   -Start ISS and adjust for tight control.
   - Increase Lantus to 20 qhs.
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis and organ dysfunction. He has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, gout, hyperglycemia, and anemia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 141/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 60% FiO2. The patient's blood cultures revealed pansensitive Klebsiella bacteria, and he has been treated with appropriate antibiotics. He also has a liver abscess and acute respiratory failure, possibly due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's renal function is impaired, and he has anemia of chronic disease. He is also on prophylactic anticoagulation and stress ulcer medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. Continued monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Organ Failure: The patient's kidneys, liver, and lungs are already showing signs of dysfunction. Close monitoring of laboratory values and clinical symptoms is essential to detect any additional organ failures.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress to ARDS if not properly managed. Continued weaning of sedation and consideration"

d [**2109-11-13**] as no clear
   culture data, and lung pathogens most likely well covered by zosyn.
   - continue Zosyn for 3 weeks for liver abscess
   - ID following, appreciate recs.
   - no drainage per hepatic catheter, will reimage today with RUQ US and
   talk to IR about removal.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   : Initially flash pulmonary  with possible VAP given CXR and increasing
   vent requirements, vancomycin/cipro were added to antibiotic regimen.
   Cultures have been negative so far. Vanc/Cipro stopped [**2109-11-13**]. CXR
   initially worsened with more edema then improved today with good
   diuresis yesterday.  Sputum and Mini BAL cx NG-final. Neg GM stain.
   Will diurese more today with goal of -1-2L.  Respiratory status
   improved. Tolerated PSV 5/5 for most of yesterday. On [**10-25**] at night.
   - Decrease sedation and attempt extubation today.
   - Nitro drip and beta blocker at bedside for per-extubation
   hypertension/tachycardia.
   - continue Zosyn, which should cover both the Klebsiella as well as
   many lung pathogen
   - Diurese again today with Lasix 40IV x1
   .
   # Tachycardia: HR has been well controlled for > than 2 days. Previous
   appeared to be sinus tachycardia, as responded slightly to carotid
   massage.  Had multiple episodes of HTN accompanying the tachycardia
   which improves with lopressor as well as increase in sedation. Has done
   well with coreg thus far, and may have room to increase today.
   -coreg [**Hospital1 **], consider increase in dose as tolerated by BPs
   .
   # Liver abscess. Post-drain placement by IR. Currently continuing zosyn
   for Klebsiella, anaerobes and usual GI infectious sources, although no
   other species have grown on culture.  Drain has not had any significant
   output in the last 72hrs.
   - Continue zosyn
   - reimage today with RUQ US,
   - discuss drain removal with IR and ID
   .
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE: Likely related to overwhelming infection and
   hypovolemia. Had some  improvement with fluid resuscitation. Will
   continue to monitor Cr and treat fluid overload w/ lasix as tolerated.
   Cr stable at 1.9-2.1 for past 4 days, improved to 2.0 today
   - IVF as above
   - follow UOP, lasix today
   -monitor creatinine, lytes
   -renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia. Likely anemia of chronic disease. Pt had steady decline to
   nadir of 20 and was transfused 2 units PRBC, with bolus lasix IV. Some
   of anemia may have been dilutional 2ndary to fluid resuscitation. Does
   not appear to be actively bleeding at this time, hemolysis labs are
   negative and retic count is 5.5%.  HCTs have been stable x 3 days since
   transfusion.
   - Maintain active type and screen.
   .
   # ? NSTEMI: Thought to be likely to demand ischemia in setting of
   sepsis, with rising troponins on admission but questionable changes on
   EKG. This could also have been falsely elevated by his acute renal
   failure and poor clearance of troponins/CK. Recent  EKG changes in the
   setting of tachycardia, which have resolved and may be due to demand
   ischemia. On aspirin, low dose coreg.  Tropins appeared to have
   stabilized or started to decrease at 0.81 from 0.84, have not been
   trended further.
   -81mg ASA daily
   -coreg [**Hospital1 **]
   -monitor on tele, EKG if concern
   .
   # Chronic systolic CHF, EF 40%: [**11-4**] Echo showed normal LA/RA, LV wall
   thicknesses and cavity size; moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction
   with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior
   walls. The distal inferior wall and apex are akinetic. LVEF = 30-35 %
   Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension.
   -restarted ASA
   - coreg as above
   .
   # PVD. On aspirin only.
   .
   # HYPERGLYCEMIA
 On Lantus 20 qhs, with good control. Dose halved last
   night with NPO at midnight for likely extubation. Pt had FS of 50
   overnight and received 1amp of D5.

   # Liver abscess. Post-drain placement by IR. Currently continuing zosyn
   for Klebsiella, anaerobes and usual GI infectious sources, although no
   other species have grown on culture.  Drain has not had any significant
   output in the last 72hrs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and he has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, acute renal failure, sepsis with organ dysfunction, liver abscess, diabetes, gout, and anemia. The patient was on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated and transitioned to non-invasive ventilation. He is currently receiving various medications including nitroglycerin, furosemide, metoprolol, heparin, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced acute respiratory failure and was placed on invasive ventilation. Although he was successfully extubated, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if his underlying lung condition worsens.
2. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient had severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, which required intensive care management. There is a risk of recurrent sepsis if the patient develops new infections or if his immune system remains compromised.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient also has acute renal failure, likely related to overwhelming infection and hypovolemia. Close monitoring of renal function and continued management of fluid balance are crucial to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
4. Liver Abscess: The patient has a liver abscess that has been treated with antibiotics. There is a risk of recurrence or spread of infection if the antibiotic therapy is not effective or if"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is altered mental status, but he is now alert and responsive to questions. The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%, liver abscess, anemia, possible NSTEMI, chronic renal failure, gout, hyperglycemia, and PVD.

The patient's recent events include being intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, which was later changed to non-invasive ventilation. The patient received hydralazine and imdur overnight while titrating back on a nitro drip to help with pulmonary edema post-extubation. The patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled, but he experienced episodes of hypertension that improved with lopressor and increased sedation. The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he is now on CPAP/PSV mode with a FiO2 of 80%. The patient's ABG results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 162.

The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and elevated troponin T levels. The patient's liver enzymes and bilirubin levels are within normal range. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild cyanosis but no clubbing or"

   # Anemia. Likely anemia of chronic disease. Pt had steady decline to
   nadir of 20 and was transfused 2 units PRBC, with bolus lasix IV. Some
   of anemia may have been dilutional 2ndary to fluid resuscitation. Does
   not appear to be actively bleeding at this time, hemolysis labs are
   negative and retic count is 5.5%.  HCTs have been stable x 3 days since
   transfusion.
   - Maintain active type and screen.
   .
   # ? NSTEMI: Thought to be likely to demand ischemia in setting of
   sepsis, with rising troponins on admission but questionable changes on
   EKG. This could also have been falsely elevated by his acute renal
   failure and poor clearance of troponins/CK. Recent  EKG changes in the
   setting of tachycardia, which have resolved and may be due to demand
   ischemia. On aspirin, low dose coreg.  Tropins appeared to have
   stabilized or started to decrease at 0.81 from 0.84, have not been
   trended further.
   -81mg ASA daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 84-year-old male with a history of Klebsiella liver abscess/bacteremia, acute on chronic CHF, resolving respiratory failure, and prior NSTEMI. He is currently in the ICU for suspected sepsis with organ dysfunction. The patient's arterial line stopped at 12:25 PM, but his O2 sats and paO2 improved afterward. He was diuresed with Lasix 40 IV in the morning. The abdominal drain has not been removed. His blood pressure is controlled, and speech and swallow evaluation has been ordered. The patient's allergies include hydrochlorothiazide, which caused a rash. He was on antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam) until yesterday and received a single dose of Piperacillin today. He is currently on several infusions including Furosemide (Lasix), Pantoprazole (Protonix), and Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis). The patient's review of systems indicates improving breathing and pain under control. The patient's weight is 76.6 kg, down from 66 kg at admission. The patient's height is 62 inches.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Klebsiella Bacteremia/Liver Abscess: The patient has been on Zosyn for 15 days without fever or leukocytosis. There is no drainage, so continued treatment with Zosyn for 3 weeks is recommended."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of resolving Klebsiella liver abscess/bacteremia, acute on chronic CHF, resolving respiratory failure, and prior NSTEMI. The patient remains afebrile without leukocytosis and has no drainage for the liver abscess. He is currently extubated and on aerosol mask at 50% oxygen saturation. The patient's blood pressure is controlled, and he is receiving Lasix for diuresis. His creatinine level has risen to 2.0 due to diuresis, and he is showing signs of fluid overload with decreased urine output. The patient's hemoglobin level has increased to 24.9 due to diuresis, and he is currently on blood type and screen. He has chronic systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 40% and is restarting ASA with an increased dose of Carvedilol. The patient also has a history of PVD, hyperglycemia, gout, and is awaiting speech and swallow evaluation. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Klebsiella Bacteremia/Liver Abscess: The patient remains on Zosyn for the liver abscess, but there is no drainage planned. Monitoring for any signs of infection or worsening symptoms is important.

2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on aerosol mask at 50% oxygen saturation. Close monitoring of oxygen"

   SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 RESOLVED.  Klebsiella
   Bacteremia, Liver abscess
   : Pansensitive Klebsiella grew in blood (both from [**Hospital1 19**] and OSH
   samples). Remainder of workup has been negative. Off pressors at this
   point with good UOP in response to Lasix 40 IV x 2 yesterday. WBC has
   been trending down last 4 days 13-12-11, 10, and now afebrile > 72
   hours. Initially on Vanc and Cipro, both dc
d [**2109-11-13**] as no clear
   culture data, and lung pathogens most likely well covered by zosyn.
   - continue Zosyn (Day 14) for 3 weeks for liver abscess
   - ID following, appreciate recs
   - no drainage per hepatic catheter, reimaged and fluid collection
   resolved
   - pull drain TODAY
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   : Initially flash pulmonary  with possible VAP given CXR and increasing
   vent requirements, vancomycin/cipro were added to antibiotic regimen.
   Cultures have been negative so far. Vanc/Cipro stopped [**2109-11-13**]. CXR
   initially worsened with more edema then improved today with good
   diuresis yesterday.  Sputum and Mini BAL cx NG-final. Neg GM stain.
   Will diurese more today with goal of -1-2L.  Respiratory status
   improved. Tolerated PSV 5/5 for most of yesterday. On [**10-25**] at night.
   - Decrease sedation and attempt extubation today.
   - Nitro drip and beta blocker at bedside for per-extubation
   hypertension/tachycardia.
   - continue Zosyn, which should cover both the Klebsiella as well as
   many lung pathogen
   - Diurese again today with Lasix 40IV x1, follow O2 sats
   - Check abg then pull A line
   .
   # Tachycardia: HR has been well controlled for > than 2 days. Previous
   appeared to be sinus tachycardia, as responded slightly to carotid
   massage.  Had multiple episodes of HTN accompanying the tachycardia
   which improves with lopressor as well as increase in sedation. Has done
   well with coreg thus far, and may have room to increase today.
   -coreg [**Hospital1 **], consider increase in dose as tolerated by BPs
   .
   # Liver abscess. Post-drain placement by IR. Currently continuing zosyn
   for Klebsiella, anaerobes and usual GI infectious sources, although no
   other species have grown on culture.  Drain has not had any significant
   output in the last 72hrs.
   - Continue zosyn
   - discuss drain removal with IR
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   # HTN: Currently normotensive on hydral, carvedilol. Off Nitro gtt.
   .
   # RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE: Likely related to overwhelming infection and
   hypovolemia. Had some  improvement with fluid resuscitation. Will
   continue to monitor Cr and treat fluid overload w/ lasix as tolerated.
   Cr stable at 1.9-2.1 for past 4 days, improved to 2.0 today
   - IVF as above
   - follow UOP, lasix today
   -monitor creatinine, lytes
   -renally dose meds
   .
   # Anemia. Likely anemia of chronic disease. Pt had steady decline to
   nadir of 20 and was transfused 2 units PRBC, with bolus lasix IV. Some
   of anemia may have been dilutional 2ndary to fluid resuscitation. Does
   not appear to be actively bleeding at this time, hemolysis labs are
   negative and retic count is 5.5%.  HCTs have been stable x 3 days since
   transfusion.
   - Maintain active type and screen.
   .
   # ? NSTEMI: Thought to be likely to demand ischemia in setting of
   sepsis, with rising troponins on admission but questionable changes on
   EKG. This could also have been falsely elevated by his acute renal
   failure and poor clearance of troponins/CK. Recent  EKG changes in the
   setting of tachycardia, which have resolved and may be due to demand
   ischemia. On aspirin, low dose coreg.  Tropins appeared to have
   stabilized or started to decrease at 0.81 from 0.84, have not been
   trended further.
   -81mg ASA daily
   -coreg [**Hospital1 **]
   -monitor on tele, EKG if concern
   .
   # Chronic systolic CHF, EF 40%: [**11-4**] Echo showed normal LA/RA, LV wall
   thicknesses and cavity size; moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction
   with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior
   walls. The distal inferior wall and apex are akinetic. LVEF = 30-35 %
   Mild to moderate ([**11-21**]+) mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension.
   -restarted ASA
   - coreg as above
   .
   # PVD. On aspirin only.

   # HYPERGLYCEMIA
 On Lantus 20 qhs, with good control. Dose halved last
   night with NPO at midnight for likely extubation. Pt had FS of 50

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of chronic heart failure, hypertension, and anemia. He is currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and suspected sepsis. The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, bacteremia, liver abscess, and other comorbidities.

Recent events include the removal of an arterial line due to stoppage, administration of diuretics (Lasix), and reinsertion of an abdominal drain. The patient has allergies to hydrochlorothiazide and has received antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Piperacillin) for suspected infection.

Vital signs show stable temperature, heart rate within normal range, slightly elevated blood pressure, and respiratory rate within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is at 96% on high-flow nasal cannula with FiO2 at 50%. ABG results indicate a slightly alkalotic pH, elevated PaCO2, and normal oxygen levels. Blood glucose levels are elevated.

Physical examination reveals peripheral vascular issues with non-assessed pulses and skin assessment not done. Neurologic examination is also not assessed. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's diagnoses include acute leukemia, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, bacteremia, liver abscess, chronic heart failure, anemia, hypotension, severe seps"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of resolving Klebsiella liver abscess/bacteremia, acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), resolving respiratory failure, and prior non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation, but stopped recently. He is also receiving various medications including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, heparin, and others. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/49 mmHg to 169/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight is 67.3 kg, and height is 62 inches.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient was previously intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation but has now been extubated and is on an aerosol mask at 50%. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's oxygen saturation levels and respiratory effort to prevent further respiratory failure.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's serum creatinine levels have been increasing, indicating a decline in renal function. This may be due to diuresis or other factors. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte imbalances is necessary to manage this condition.
3. Anemia: The"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of resolving Klebsiella liver abscess/bacteremia, acute on chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), resolving respiratory failure, and prior non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient remains afebrile without leukocytosis, and there is no drainage from the pigtail tube. The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure has resolved, and he is now extubated and on an aerosol mask at 50%. He is in no acute distress and has been diuresed with 40 IV Lasix, which resulted in an associated rise in creatinine. The patient's blood pressure is controlled with hydralazine and carvedilol. His acute renal failure (ARF) has improved, with a decrease in creatinine from 2.0 to 1.8. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has also improved at 27.8. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Klebsiella liver abscess/bacteremia: The patient still has a liver abscess, and there is a risk of recurrence or worsening of the infection if proper treatment and follow-up are not continued.
2. Chronic systolic CHF: The patient has chronic systolic CHF with an ejection fraction (EF) of 40%. There is a risk of exacerbation of heart failure symptoms if the patient's fluid balance is not properly"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, leukemia (specific type not mentioned), heart failure, chronic anemia, hyperglycemia, and renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU for non-invasive ventilation support and has been weaned off high-flow oxygen. Allergies include hydrochlorothiazide causing a rash. The patient has received antibiotics, specifically piperacillin-tazobactam, for an unknown duration. The patient is receiving various medications including pantoprazole, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 75 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 128/47 mmHg to 135/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,868 mL with 807 mL given through PO, 1,088 mL through TF, and 430 mL through IVF. Output includes 1,275 mL through urine, 375 mL through NG, and 593 mL through drains. 

Blood work reveals a white blood cell count of 9.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 28.9%, platelet count of 644 K/uL, creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL, blood glucose of 118 mg/dL, and various electrolyte imbalances. Other lab results indicate elevated levels of lactic acid, LDH, and liver enzymes, as well as low albumin and calcium levels. 

The patient's physical examination reveals an unassessed peripheral vascular status, skin not assessed, and neurologic examination also not assessed. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include worsening of hypertension, potential infection due to the presence of leukopenia and bacteremia, liver abscess, worsening of heart failure, chronic anemia, hyperglycemia, and renal failure."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of Klebsiella liver abscess and chronic heart failure. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory distress, which has been resolved after being extubated and placed on nasal cannula. The patient also has bacteremia due to Klebsiella infection and a liver abscess, which is currently being treated with Zosyn.

Other medical conditions and complications include acute renal failure (ARF) likely caused by overdiuresis, hypertension, other anemia, hyperglycemia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's liver function tests show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, indicating potential liver damage or dysfunction.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure reading of 151/56 mmHg, heart rate of 92 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. His temperature is within normal range at 37.1°C.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, elevated blood glucose level, and abnormal liver function tests including elevated ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels.

The patient's current plan includes ongoing treatment for Klebsiella bacteremia and liver abscess, management of ARF, control of hypertension, and monitoring of other conditions. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of Klebsiella liver abscess and chronic heart failure. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and is now extubated and on a nasal cannula. The patient has been on day 16/21 of Zosyn for Klebsiella bacteremia and liver abscess, but there is no drainage plan for IR removal of pigtail. The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) likely due to overdiuresis yesterday, hypertension, anemia, hyperglycemia, and liver abscess. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/56 mmHg to 134/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient was previously intubated due to respiratory distress but is now extubated and on a nasal cannula. There is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.

2. Klebsiella Bacteremia and Liver Abscess: The patient has been on Zosyn for 16/21 days, but there is no drainage plan for the liver abscess. This increases the risk of persistent bacteremia and further complications related to the liver abs"
