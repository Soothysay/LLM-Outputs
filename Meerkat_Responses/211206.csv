   This is a 55 year-old female with a history of COPD and respiratory
   failure, MAT/a-flutter, who was intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **]
   with MAT/a-fib, respiratory distress, intubated and treated for UTI and
   transferred per family request.
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever
   (101-103), and RR and 45%bands. Pt lactate 3.7.  Likely source is
   urinary vs respiratory vs line infection. The patient has been at [**Hospital **] and resident of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial infections are high on the
   differential. The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial.
   Contributing factors include her MAT/a-flutter with rapid rate, likely
   infection from UTI, pseudomonas pna or line infection.  She was placed
   on levophed gtt and neo gtt.  CXR showed pna vs effusion vs pulm edema
   vs ARDS.
   - likely secondary to infx per above: continue vanc/[**Last Name (un) 430**]/amikacin.
   - ID c/s today
   - call OSH for sensitivities
   - TTE today to assess for cardiac fxn
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12, trend lactate, trend WBC/diff
   - IV fluid boluses
   - Levophed and Neo to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr, but may use
   dopa depending on Echo
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30 if remains in spetic shock
   - cont treatment with Amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum
   - check amikacin peak and trough
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - f/u BCx, Ucx, sputum, pull line and culture tip
   - stress dose steriods, increase to solumedrol 60 [**Hospital1 **] (pt was on 2d ago
   at OSH)

   .
   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter Her rates on admission were as
   high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr)
   due to hypotension nodal agents were deferred.  Her fast rate is likely
   contributing to her hypotension.  She was previously controlled on po
   lopressor, dilt and dig. Also on the differential is possible
   underlying PE driving her tachycardia, although given Hct drop would
   not start anti-coagulation.  Additionally, sepsis and pain also likely
   driving her tachycardia. Cardioverted yesterday night into sinus tach
   (130-140s)
   - cont Amio gtt for now, hold nodal agents given hemodynamic instab [**2-25**]
   septic shock per above, wait for TTE
   - repeat ECG in AM
   - hold on anti-coagulation given bleeding and Hct drop
   - LENI to r/o DVT
   - first set CE neg, will ROMI
   - check dig level
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure.  She was initially admitted to and placed on
   BiPAP, but required intubtion after desat. ABG here showed
   7.35/74/162/43. AC 540/15/5/100%. Possible PNA given pseudomonas in
   sputum and as well as chronic aspirations. CXR showed b/l diffuse
   infiltrates/effusions R>L. DDx: Multi-focal Pneumonia, pulmonart edema
   Aspiration pneumonitis, effusision, ARDS
   - CXR in AM
   - cont methylpred
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs
   - Pt likely lives at an elevated PCO2 given elevated Bicarb. Pt also
   autopeeping and thus will increase PEEP to 10 and attempt to decrease
   RR.  Will follow closely with ABG.
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt Hct on admission was 21.9. This is down from 25 at the
   OSH. Pt with multiple ecchymosis on exam.  No evidence of active
   bleeding. Other possiblities could be RP or intraperitonea bleed.
   - active T&C 4U

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respiratory failure, and atrial flutter who was admitted to the hospital with respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI). She was then transferred to another hospital due to family request.

Upon arrival at the current hospital, the patient was diagnosed with septic shock, likely secondary to a urinary or respiratory infection. The source of infection could be either a urinary tract infection (UTI) or a respiratory infection. The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, including her atrial flutter with rapid rate, infection from UTI, or line infection. She was placed on norepinephrine and amiodarone infusions.

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to her underlying COPD and frequent admissions for respiratory failure. She was initially placed on BiPAP but required intubation after desaturation. An arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH 7.30, PaCO2 162, PaO2 74, and bicarbonate level 43. A chest X-ray (CXR) revealed bilateral diffuse infiltrates/effusions, raising the differential diagnosis of multi-focal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonitis, effusion, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient also presents with anemia, with a hemoglobin (Hct) level on admission of 21.9%. This is down from 25 at the previous hospital. The patient has multiple ecchymosis on examination, but no evidence of active bleeding. Other possibilities include radiation pneumonitis or intraperitoneal bleed. Transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) is planned to increase the Hct to above 30.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is characterized by a platelet count of 125,000/mm3. HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) is negative, and the platelet count is stable. Monitoring and trending of platelet levels are ongoing.

A urinary tract infection (UTI) is present, with growing Proteus in the urine. Coverage with amikacin is continued, and repeat urinalysis/culture is planned.

Pseudomonas sputum is growing from sputum cultures, although the clinical significance is uncertain. Amikacin and meropenem coverage are initiated, and a repeat sputum culture is planned.

The patient is a diabetic and on steroids, so insulin and lantus are initiated. Monitoring of blood glucose levels and coverage with insulin syrup are planned.

The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line, multi-lumen central venous catheter (CVC), and arterial line.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU for now."

   transferred per family request.
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever
   (101-103), and RR and 45%bands. Pt lactate 3.7.  Likely source is
   urinary vs respiratory vs line infection. The patient has been at [**Hospital **] and resident of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial infections are high on the
   differential. The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial.
   Contributing factors include her MAT/a-flutter with rapid rate, likely
   infection from UTI, pseudomonas pna or line infection. She has h/o
   proteus UTI and pseudomonas in sputum. She was placed on levophed gtt
   and neo gtt.  CXR showed pna vs effusion vs pulm edema vs ARDS.

   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter Her rates on admission were as
   high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr)
   due to hypotension nodal agents were deferred.  Her fast rate is likely
   contributing to her hypotension.  She was previously controlled on po
   lopressor, dilt and dig. Also on the differential is possible
   underlying PE driving her tachycardia, although given Hct drop would
   not start anti-coagulation, and d-dimer low so PE unlikely.
   Additionally, sepsis and pain also likely driving her tachycardia.

   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure.  She was initially admitted to and placed on
   BiPAP, but required intubtion after desat. ABG here showed
   7.35/74/162/43. AC 540/15/5/100%. Possible PNA given pseudomonas in
   sputum and as well as chronic aspirations. CXR showed b/l diffuse

   - Pt likely lives at an elevated PCO2 given elevated Bicarb. Pt also
   autopeeping and thus will increase PEEP and attempt to decrease RR.
   Will follow closely with ABG.
   .
   # Oliguria: BUN and Cr are normal right now. However given septic shock
   there is concern for poor renal blood flow, and the possibility for
   development of ATN and future need for CVVH given IVF need.
   - check [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   - monitor UOP closely, gentle IVF

   #. Anemia: Pt Hct on admission was 21.9. This is down from 25 at the
   OSH. Pt with multiple ecchymosis on exam.  No evidence of active
   bleeding. Other possiblities could be RP or intraperitoneal bleed.  HCT

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of COPD, respiratory failure, and atrial flutter. She was initially admitted to another hospital with atrial fibrillation, respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for a urinary tract infection before being transferred to our facility.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature 101.4°F, Blood pressure 67/49 mmHg, Heart rate 153 bpm, Oxygen saturation 100% on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient is minimally responsive, with dilated pupils that are reactive to light. She has multiple ecchymoses on her upper and lower extremities.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate level, D-dimer, and lactic acid. Other lab values are within normal limits.
- Chest X-ray shows bilateral diffuse infiltrates/effusions, raising suspicion of pneumonia, effusion, or pulmonary edema.
- The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, pulmonary hypertension, and a history of proteus urinary tract infection and pseudomonas in sputum.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and frequent admissions for respiratory failure. She required intubation after desaturation, indicating severe respiratory distress.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for severe sepsis with t"

   - Sputum (4+ GNR, 4+GPC in [**Hospital1 54**] culture, OSH culture showing
   pseudomonas) and blood (GPC, GNR in [**Hospital1 54**] culture). Reported VRE
   surveillance positive in OSH culture.
   - Started linezolid ([**8-16**]), amikacin (started at OSH), flagyl.
   - cont treatment with Amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum, treat with linezolid for VRE coverage (positive screen at
   OSH), meropenem for pseudomonas double coverage, voriconazole (at risk
   of fungal infection given chronic steroid use)
   - Need to renally dose medications
   - f/u urine, sputum, blood cxs.
   - consider activated protein C in patient, however, bleeding risks
   outweigh benefit.
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - ID approval of abx.
   Metabolic: Has AG metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactate. With low
   pH on ABG, worry about cardiac asystole.
   - Continue to trend lactate
   - dialysis will help with lactate clearance
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure.  Likely ARDS given sudden onset, P/F ratio<200,
   pulmonary edema which is unlikely cardiogenic. Also has underlying
   pseudomonas pneumonia. She was initially admitted to and placed on
   BiPAP, but required intubtion after desat. ABG with worsening
   hypercarbia and hypoxia. Possible PNA given pseudomonas in sputum. CXR
   showed b/l diffuse infiltrates/effusions R>L.
   - Consider placement of an esophageal balloon to clarify PEEP therapy.
   - If the patient is dialyzed, her respiratory status might improve.
   - CXR in AM
   - cont methylpred
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs
   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter Her rates on admission were as
   high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr)
   due to hypotension nodal agents were deferred.  Her fast rate is likely
   contributing to her hypotension.  She was previously controlled on po
   lopressor, dilt and dig. Also on the differential is possible
   underlying PE driving her tachycardia, although given Hct drop would
   not start anti-coagulation.  Additionally, sepsis and pain also likely
   driving her tachycardia. The patient has troponin leaks, likely due to
   demand ischemia.
   - Received an amiodarone load on [**8-16**]. Decided to D/C because did not
   want to give oral med. Also, hypotensive and BP will not tolerate
   amiodarone.
   - Pending studies: echo, LENIs (to r/o DVTs and possible PE)
   - hold on anti-coagulation given bleeding and Hct drop
   ARF: Renal failure was initially likely pre-renal given sepsis. It has
   likely progressed to ischemic ATN. Has poor UOP.
   - consulted renal to dialyze patient.
   - need to renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u renal note.
   #. DIC:.Increased PT/PTT, LDH. Thrombocytopenia (HIT negative at OSH).
   Fibrinogen elevated
   --Stable, will cont to monitor and trend.
   --Will treat underlying sepsis and see if DIC improves.
   --spoke about starting activated protein C, but risks of bleeding
   outweigh benefits.
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt
s crit continues to fall. Unsure if dilution. Doubt
   active bleeding.
   - active T&C
   - transfuse 1 unit of blood
   - check Hct q 4 hr
   - Consider CT of torso if continues to bleed.
   .
   Abdominal striae with oozing fluid: KUB done last night and cannot see
   anything.
   - consider abdominal CT if status worsens.
   #. UTI: See above. Growing proteus in urine from OSH.

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   55 yo F with septic shock and MODS (ARF, ARDS, worsening lactic
   acidosis).  She remains on 100% fio2 via vent.  She remains on 2
   pressors with progressive acidosis and rising lactate despite
   aggressive resuscitation.  She is anuric and in ARF.  Her antibx were
   broadened and vori added.  She is growing gpc pairs/clusters and gnr
   from blood and sputum.

     * altered level of consciousness
   MODS in setting of progressive septic shock.  Continues to decline
   despite aggressive management. Her prognosis for recovery is grim.  We
   continue to  update family and address goals of care.  Will continue
   aggressive supportive care for septic shock, maintaining maps > 60 with
   pressors. Is now 11L pos.  Her oxygenation remains poor on 100%
   fio2/peep 18.  Rising lactate raises concern for ischemic bowel in
   setting of persistent shock and pressors. Continue broad empiric
   antibacterial and fungal coverage-linezolid, amikacin (follow levels),
   [**Last Name (un) 430**], flagyl, and vori. D/c bactrim as low suspicion for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] data.
   Continue stress hydrocort.  Continuous cardiac output monitoring w/
   vigileo. Trend lactate, lytes, SVO2.  Continue vent support, ards net
   TVs.  We are unable to wean O2.  She is maxed on what we can do from
   vent standpoint in term of her acid base status.  Renal is following,
   but given grim prognosis, CVVH would only be temporizing. We again
   discussed xigris, but her progressive coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia
   (and ? bleeding at admit) make her a poor candidate. ICU:  SSI, NPO, L

   Addendum
   I met with pt
s family several times today to discuss her condition.
   They understand that she is in MODS, on full vent support requiring 2
   pressors to maintain her BP.  She continues to worsen despite
   aggressive support.  Renal was consulted and also spoke with the
   family.  CVVH would be a temporizing intervention.  I explained to
   family that pt would be unlikely to survive a cardiac arrest.  Family
   understands but pts husband and daughter remain understandably
   extrmeely distraught.  They are not ready to make any change to code
   status at this time.  We continue the current level of aggressive
   care.  Pt remains full code.
   Repeat gas and labs [**Last Name (un) **] pending.

   Addendum
   Most recent labs reviewed.  Spoke with pt
s husband. Family has been
   informed that pt is in MODS and her chance of recovery remains grim.
   She remains unresponsive despite no sedation. Family continues to wish
   for aggressive care and full code, understadning the poor chance of
   recovery .  We will continue aggressive support and trial CVVH.   She
   remains a full code.  We will continue to update family and address
   goals of care.

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of COPD and respiratory failure, who was initially admitted with MAT/a-fib, respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for UTI. She has since developed septic shock with MODS (acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, worsening lactic acidosis). She remains on 100% FiO2 via vent, two pressors, and has persistent bandemia, leukopenic WBC, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, altered level of consciousness, and anemia.

The primary issues include septic shock, hypotension, progressive lactic acidosis, MODS, respiratory failure/ARDS/pulmonary edema, persistent tachycardia, acute renal failure, persistent bandemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia/coagulopathy, and altered level of consciousness.

The patient's prognosis for recovery is grim, and she continues to decline despite aggressive management. The family has been updated, and the patient remains full code. The plan includes maintaining MAP > 60 with pressors, broad empiric antibacterial and fungal coverage, continuous cardiac output monitoring, trend lactate, lytes, SVO2, continue vent support, ARDS net TVs, and trial CVVH."

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 .H/O PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PULM HTN, PHTN)
 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   Assesment: This is a 55 year-old female with a history of COPD and
   respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was
   intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with MAT/a-fib, respiratory
   distress, intubated and treated for UTI and transferred per family
   request.
   .
   Plan:
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever,
   and RR and 45%bands. Pt lactate elevated.  Likely source is
   respiratory, although urinary and line infection are possible. The
   patient has been at [**Hospital3 **] and resident of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial
   infections are high on the differential. The patient's hypotension is
   likely multifactorial.  Contributing factors include her MAT/a-flutter
   with rapid rate, likely infection from UTI, pseudomonas pna or line
   infection.  She was placed on levophed gtt and neo gtt.  CXR showed pna
   vs effusion vs pulm edema vs ARDS.
   Hemodynamics
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed and Dopamine to maintain MAP > 65 and
   UOP > 30cc/hr. Avoid Neo due to vasoconstrictive effects on
   limbs/organs.
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - consulted renal for possible CVVH to remove fluid. +~11 liters over
   24 hours
   Infection: broad coverage for C.diff, gram +/- including VRE. Bactrim
   because long term steroid use.
   - Sputum (4+ GNR, 4+GPC in [**Hospital1 54**] culture, OSH culture showing
   pseudomonas) and blood (GPC, GNR in [**Hospital1 54**] culture). Reported VRE
   surveillance positive in OSH culture.
   - Started linezolid ([**8-16**]), amikacin (started at OSH), flagyl.
   - cont treatment with Amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum, treat with linezolid for VRE coverage (positive screen at
   OSH), meropenem for pseudomonas double coverage, voriconazole (at risk
   of fungal infection given chronic steroid use)
   - Need to renally dose medications
   - f/u urine, sputum, blood cxs.
   - consider activated protein C in patient, however, bleeding risks
   outweigh benefit.
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - ID approval of abx.
   Metabolic: Has AG metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactate. With low
   pH on ABG, worry about cardiac asystole.
   - Continue to trend lactate
   - dialysis will help with lactate clearance
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure.  Likely ARDS given sudden onset, P/F ratio<200,
   pulmonary edema which is unlikely cardiogenic. Also has underlying
   pseudomonas pneumonia. She was initially admitted to and placed on
   BiPAP, but required intubtion after desat. ABG with worsening
   hypercarbia and hypoxia. Possible PNA given pseudomonas in sputum. CXR
   showed b/l diffuse infiltrates/effusions R>L.
   - Consider placement of an esophageal balloon to clarify PEEP therapy.
   - If the patient is dialyzed, her respiratory status might improve.
   - CXR in AM
   - cont methylpred
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs
   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter Her rates on admission were as
   high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr)
   due to hypotension nodal agents were deferred.  Her fast rate is likely
   contributing to her hypotension.  She was previously controlled on po
   lopressor, dilt and dig. Also on the differential is possible
   underlying PE driving her tachycardia, although given Hct drop would
   not start anti-coagulation.  Additionally, sepsis and pain also likely
   driving her tachycardia. The patient has troponin leaks, likely due to
   demand ischemia.
   - Received an amiodarone load on [**8-16**]. Decided to D/C because did not
   want to give oral med. Also, hypotensive and BP will not tolerate
   amiodarone.
   - Pending studies: echo, LENIs (to r/o DVTs and possible PE)
   - hold on anti-coagulation given bleeding and Hct drop
   ARF: Renal failure was initially likely pre-renal given sepsis. It has
   likely progressed to ischemic ATN. Has poor UOP.
   - consulted renal to dialyze patient.
   - need to renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u renal note.

   #. Anemia: Pt
s crit continues to fall. Unsure if dilution. Doubt
   active bleeding.
   - active T&C
   - transfuse 1 unit of blood
   - check Hct q 4 hr
   - Consider CT of torso if continues to bleed.

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   55 yo F with septic shock and MODS (ARF, ARDS, worsening lactic
   acidosis).  She remains on 100% fio2 via vent.  She remains on 2
   pressors with progressive acidosis and rising lactate despite
   aggressive resuscitation.  She is anuric and in ARF.  Her antibx were
   broadened and vori added.  She is growing gpc pairs/clusters and gnr
   from blood and sputum.

   continue to  update family and address goals of care.  Will continue
   aggressive supportive care for septic shock, maintaining maps > 60 with
   pressors. Is now 11L pos.  Her oxygenation remains poor on 100%
   fio2/peep 18.  Rising lactate raises concern for ischemic bowel in
   setting of persistent shock and pressors. Continue broad empiric
   antibacterial and fungal coverage-linezolid, amikacin (follow levels),
   [**Last Name (un) 430**], flagyl, and vori. D/c bactrim as low suspicion for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] data.
   Continue stress hydrocort.  Continuous cardiac output monitoring w/
   vigileo. Trend lactate, lytes, SVO2.  Continue vent support, ards net
   TVs.  We are unable to wean O2.  She is maxed on what we can do from
   vent standpoint in term of her acid base status.  Renal is following,
   but given grim prognosis, CVVH would only be temporizing. We again
   discussed xigris, but her progressive coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia
   (and ? bleeding at admit) make her a poor candidate. ICU:  SSI, NPO, L

   Addendum
   I met with pt
s family several times today to discuss her condition.
   They understand that she is in MODS, on full vent support requiring 2
   pressors to maintain her BP.  She continues to worsen despite
   aggressive support.  Renal was consulted and also spoke with the
   family.  CVVH would be a temporizing intervention.  I explained to
   family that pt would be unlikely to survive a cardiac arrest.  Family
   understands but pts husband and daughter remain understandably
   extrmeely distraught.  They are not ready to make any change to code
   status at this time.  We continue the current level of aggressive
   care.  Pt remains full code.
   Repeat gas and labs [**Last Name (un) **] pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respiratory failure, atrial flutter, and chronic steroid use. She was initially admitted for atrial fibrillation and respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for urinary tract infection (UTI). She was transferred to the ICU due to septic shock with organ dysfunction, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure (ARF), and lactic acidosis. The patient's condition has been declining despite aggressive management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is in septic shock with persistent hypotension, despite resuscitation efforts. This is indicated by a low mean arterial pressure (MAP) and high lactate levels.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, requiring the use of two vasopressors to maintain MAP.
3. Progressive Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactic acid levels are rising, indicating worsening tissue hypoperfusion and potentially impending organ failure.
4. Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): The patient is experiencing MODS, with involvement of multiple organ systems including respiratory, renal, and coagulation dysfunction.
5. Respiratory Failure/ARDS/Pulmonary Edema: The patient has severe ARDS with diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and persistent hypoxia despite high levels of inspired oxygen (FiO2).
6. Persistent Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia, which may be due to sepsis, pain, or underlying pulmonary hypertension.
7. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has ARF with poor urine output and rising creatinine levels.
8. Persistent Bandemia: The patient has persistent leukopenia and bandemia, indicating ongoing infection or inflammation.
9. Anemia: The patient has a decreasing hematocrit, suggesting ongoing bleeding or hemolysis.
10. Thrombocytopenia/Coagulopathy: The patient has thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy, indicated by elevated PT/PTT and decreased fibrinogen levels.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided information, and additional clinical evaluation would be necessary for a definitive diagnosis and management plan."

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 .H/O PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PULM HTN, PHTN)
 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   Assesment: This is a 55 year-old female with a history of COPD and
   respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was
   intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with MAT/a-fib, respiratory
   distress, intubated and treated for UTI and transferred per family
   request.
   .
   Plan:
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever,
   and RR and 45%bands. Pt lactate elevated.  Likely source is
   respiratory, although urinary and line infection are possible. The
   patient has been at [**Hospital3 **] and resident of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial
   infections are high on the differential. The patient's hypotension is
   likely multifactorial.  Contributing factors include her MAT/a-flutter
   with rapid rate, likely infection from UTI, pseudomonas pna or line
   infection.  She was placed on levophed gtt and neo gtt.  CXR showed pna
   vs effusion vs pulm edema vs ARDS.
   Hemodynamics
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed and Dopamine to maintain MAP > 65 and
   UOP > 30cc/hr. Avoid Neo due to vasoconstrictive effects on
   limbs/organs.
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - consulted renal for possible CVVH to remove fluid. +~11 liters over
   24 hours
   Infection: broad coverage for C.diff, gram +/- including VRE. Bactrim
   because long term steroid use.
   - Sputum (4+ GNR, 4+GPC in [**Hospital1 54**] culture, OSH culture showing
   pseudomonas) and blood (GPC, GNR in [**Hospital1 54**] culture). Reported VRE
   surveillance positive in OSH culture.
   - Started linezolid ([**8-16**]), amikacin (started at OSH), flagyl.
   - cont treatment with Amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum, treat with linezolid for VRE coverage (positive screen at
   OSH), meropenem for pseudomonas double coverage, voriconazole (at risk
   of fungal infection given chronic steroid use)
   - Need to renally dose medications
   - f/u urine, sputum, blood cxs.
   - consider activated protein C in patient, however, bleeding risks
   outweigh benefit.
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - ID approval of abx.
   Metabolic: Has AG metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactate. With low
   pH on ABG, worry about cardiac asystole.
   - Continue to trend lactate
   - dialysis will help with lactate clearance
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure.  Likely ARDS given sudden onset, P/F ratio<200,
   pulmonary edema which is unlikely cardiogenic. Also has underlying
   pseudomonas pneumonia. She was initially admitted to and placed on
   BiPAP, but required intubtion after desat. ABG with worsening
   hypercarbia and hypoxia. Possible PNA given pseudomonas in sputum. CXR
   showed b/l diffuse infiltrates/effusions R>L.
   - Consider placement of an esophageal balloon to clarify PEEP therapy.
   - If the patient is dialyzed, her respiratory status might improve.
   - CXR in AM
   - cont methylpred
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs
   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter Her rates on admission were as
   high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory failure. She was initially admitted to another hospital with atrial flutter, respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was transferred to this hospital due to family request.

The patient has several medical complications, including:
1. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and poor urine output.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. She also has underlying pseudomonas pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for severe sepsis, with signs of infection including fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. Potential sources of infection include respiratory, urinary, and line infections.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's rapid heart rate is likely due to a combination of factors such as underlying pulmonary embolism (PE), sepsis, pain, and demand ischemia.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which may be related to ongoing blood loss or dilutional effects.
6. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient has elevated PT/PTT, LDH, and thrombocytopenia"

 .H/O PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PULM HTN, PHTN)
 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   Assesment: This is a 55 year-old female with a history of COPD and
   respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was
   intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with MAT/a-fib, respiratory
   distress, intubated and treated for UTI and transferred per family
   request.
   .
   Plan:
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever,
   and RR and 45%bands. Pt lactate elevated.  Likely source is
   respiratory, although urinary and line infection are possible. The
   patient has been at [**Hospital3 **] and resident of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial
   infections are high on the differential. The patient's hypotension is
   likely multifactorial.  Contributing factors include her MAT/a-flutter
   with rapid rate, likely infection from UTI, pseudomonas pna or line
   infection.  She was placed on levophed gtt and neo gtt.  CXR showed pna
   vs effusion vs pulm edema vs ARDS.
   Hemodynamics
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed and Dopamine to maintain MAP > 65 and
   UOP > 30cc/hr. Avoid Neo due to vasoconstrictive effects on
   limbs/organs.
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - consulted renal for possible CVVH to remove fluid. +~11 liters over
   24 hours
   Infection: broad coverage for C.diff, gram +/- including VRE. Bactrim
   because long term steroid use.
   - Sputum (4+ GNR, 4+GPC in [**Hospital1 54**] culture, OSH culture showing
   pseudomonas) and blood (GPC, GNR in [**Hospital1 54**] culture). Reported VRE
   surveillance positive in OSH culture.
   - Started linezolid ([**8-16**]), amikacin (started at OSH), flagyl.
   - cont treatment with Amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum, treat with linezolid for VRE coverage (positive screen at
   OSH), meropenem for pseudomonas double coverage, voriconazole (at risk
   of fungal infection given chronic steroid use)
   - Need to renally dose medications
   - f/u urine, sputum, blood cxs.
   - consider activated protein C in patient, however, bleeding risks
   outweigh benefit.
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - ID approval of abx.
   Metabolic: Has AG metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactate. With low
   pH on ABG, worry about cardiac asystole.
   - Continue to trend lactate
   - dialysis will help with lactate clearance
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure.  Likely ARDS given sudden onset, P/F ratio<200,
   pulmonary edema which is unlikely cardiogenic. Also has underlying
   pseudomonas pneumonia. She was initially admitted to and placed on
   BiPAP, but required intubtion after desat. ABG with worsening
   hypercarbia and hypoxia. Possible PNA given pseudomonas in sputum. CXR
   showed b/l diffuse infiltrates/effusions R>L.
   - Consider placement of an esophageal balloon to clarify PEEP therapy.
   - If the patient is dialyzed, her respiratory status might improve.
   - CXR in AM
   - cont methylpred
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs
   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter Her rates on admission were as
   high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr)
   due to hypotension nodal agents were deferred.  Her fast rate is likely
   contributing to her hypotension.  She was previously controlled on po
   lopressor, dilt and dig. Also on the differential is possible
   underlying PE driving her tachycardia, although given Hct drop would
   not start anti-coagulation.  Additionally, sepsis and pain also likely
   driving her tachycardia. The patient has troponin leaks, likely due to
   demand ischemia.
   - Received an amiodarone load on [**8-16**]. Decided to D/C because did not
   want to give oral med. Also, hypotensive and BP will not tolerate
   amiodarone.
   - Pending studies: echo, LENIs (to r/o DVTs and possible PE)
   - hold on anti-coagulation given bleeding and Hct drop
   ARF: Renal failure was initially likely pre-renal given sepsis. It has
   likely progressed to ischemic ATN. Has poor UOP.
   - consulted renal to dialyze patient.
   - need to renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u renal note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of COPD and respiratory failure, who was initially admitted for MAT/a-fib, respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for UTI. She was transferred from Hospital3 to Hospital1 due to a family request. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with the development of septic shock, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, DIC, anemia, UTI, and suspected pseudomonas sputum infection. She is currently on multiple antibiotics and renal dosing of medications is required. The patient's vitals show tachycardia, fever, and hypotension. Her ABG results indicate metabolic acidosis. Imaging shows worsening pulmonary congestion, pleural effusions, and bilateral infiltrates. The patient's labs reveal elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and D-dimer, as well as thrombocytopenia and elevated fibrinogen. She has anemia and is critically ill, with a falling Hct. The patient's condition requires ongoing monitoring and treatment for sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and other complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 .H/O PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PULM HTN, PHTN)
 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   Assesment: This is a 55 year-old female with a history of COPD and
   respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was
   intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with MAT/a-fib, respiratory
   distress, intubated and treated for UTI and transferred per family
   request.
   .
   Plan:
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever,
   and RR and 45%bands. Pt lactate elevated.  Likely source is
   respiratory, although urinary and line infection are possible. The
   patient has been at [**Hospital3 **] and resident of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial
   infections are high on the differential. The patient's hypotension is
   likely multifactorial.  Contributing factors include her MAT/a-flutter
   with rapid rate, likely infection from UTI, pseudomonas pna or line
   infection.  She was placed on levophed gtt and neo gtt.  CXR showed pna
   vs effusion vs pulm edema vs ARDS.
   Hemodynamics
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed and Dopamine to maintain MAP > 65 and
   UOP > 30cc/hr. Avoid Neo due to vasoconstrictive effects on
   limbs/organs.
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - consulted renal for possible CVVH to remove fluid. +~11 liters over
   24 hours
   Infection: broad coverage for C.diff, gram +/- including VRE. Bactrim
   because long term steroid use.
   - Sputum (4+ GNR, 4+GPC in [**Hospital1 54**] culture, OSH culture showing
   pseudomonas) and blood (GPC, GNR in [**Hospital1 54**] culture). Reported VRE
   surveillance positive in OSH culture.
   - Started linezolid ([**8-16**]), amikacin (started at OSH), flagyl.
   - cont treatment with Amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum, treat with linezolid for VRE coverage (positive screen at
   OSH), meropenem for pseudomonas double coverage, voriconazole (at risk
   of fungal infection given chronic steroid use)
   - Need to renally dose medications
   - f/u urine, sputum, blood cxs.
   - consider activated protein C in patient, however, bleeding risks
   outweigh benefit.
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - ID approval of abx.
   Metabolic: Has AG metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactate. With low
   pH on ABG, worry about cardiac asystole.
   - Continue to trend lactate
   - dialysis will help with lactate clearance
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure.  Likely ARDS given sudden onset, P/F ratio<200,
   pulmonary edema which is unlikely cardiogenic. Also has underlying
   pseudomonas pneumonia. She was initially admitted to and placed on
   BiPAP, but required intubtion after desat. ABG with worsening
   hypercarbia and hypoxia. Possible PNA given pseudomonas in sputum. CXR
   showed b/l diffuse infiltrates/effusions R>L.
   - Consider placement of an esophageal balloon to clarify PEEP therapy.
   - If the patient is dialyzed, her respiratory status might improve.
   - CXR in AM
   - cont methylpred
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs
   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter Her rates on admission were as
   high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr)
   due to hypotension nodal agents were deferred.  Her fast rate is likely
   contributing to her hypotension.  She was previously controlled on po
   lopressor, dilt and dig. Also on the differential is possible
   underlying PE driving her tachycardia, although given Hct drop would
   not start anti-coagulation.  Additionally, sepsis and pain also likely
   driving her tachycardia. The patient has troponin leaks, likely due to
   demand ischemia.
   - Received an amiodarone load on [**8-16**]. Decided to D/C because did not
   want to give oral med. Also, hypotensive and BP will not tolerate
   amiodarone.
   - Pending studies: echo, LENIs (to r/o DVTs and possible PE)
   - hold on anti-coagulation given bleeding and Hct drop
   ARF: Renal failure was initially likely pre-renal given sepsis. It has
   likely progressed to ischemic ATN. Has poor UOP.
   - consulted renal to dialyze patient.
   - need to renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u renal note.
   #. DIC:.Increased PT/PTT, LDH. Thrombocytopenia (HIT negative at OSH).
   Fibrinogen elevated
   --Stable, will cont to monitor and trend.
   --Will treat underlying sepsis and see if DIC improves.
   --spoke about starting activated protein C, but risks of bleeding
   outweigh benefits.
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt
s crit continues to fall. Unsure if dilution. Doubt
   active bleeding.
   - active T&C
   - transfuse 1 unit of blood
   - check Hct q 4 hr
   - Consider CT of torso if continues to bleed.
   .
   Abdominal striae with oozing fluid: KUB done last night and cannot see
   anything.
   - consider abdominal CT if status worsens.
   #. UTI: See above. Growing proteus in urine from OSH.
   - cont amikacin for now
   - f/u UCx
   - obtain OSH records from [**Hospital3 **]
   .
   #. Pseudomonas Sputum from OSH. GPC, GNR in sputum at [**Hospital1 54**]: growing
   from sputum. Question as to whether colonization vs active infection.
   CXR was reportly normal at OSH. Is being covered with amikacin.
   - CXR
   - f/u sputum cx
   - OSH sensitivies need to be obtained
   - cont amikacin,  meropenem
   .
   #. IDDM: Pt on steriods. Will initiated ISS and lantus 24U q12.
   Monitor QACHS FS and cover with ISS.

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   55 yo F with septic shock and MODS (ARF, ARDS, worsening lactic
   acidosis).  She remains on 100% fio2 via vent.  She remains on 2
   pressors with progressive acidosis and rising lactate despite
   aggressive resuscitation.  She is anuric and in ARF.  Her antibx were
   broadened and vori added.  She is growing gpc pairs/clusters and gnr
   from blood and sputum.

   MODS in setting of progressive septic shock.  Continues to decline
   despite aggressive management. Her prognosis for recovery is grim.  We
   continue to  update family and address goals of care.  Will continue
   aggressive supportive care for septic shock, maintaining maps > 60 with
   pressors. Is now 11L pos.  Her oxygenation remains poor on 100%
   fio2/peep 18.  Rising lactate raises concern for ischemic bowel in
   setting of persistent shock and pressors. Continue broad empiric
   antibacterial and fungal coverage-linezolid, amikacin (follow levels),
   [**Last Name (un) 430**], flagyl, and vori. D/c bactrim as low suspicion for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] data.
   Continue stress hydrocort.  Continuous cardiac output monitoring w/
   vigileo. Trend lactate, lytes, SVO2.  Continue vent support, ards net
   TVs.  We are unable to wean O2.  She is maxed on what we can do from
   vent standpoint in term of her acid base status.  Renal is following,
   but given grim prognosis, CVVH would only be temporizing. We again
   discussed xigris, but her progressive coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia
   (and ? bleeding at admit) make her a poor candidate. ICU:  SSI, NPO, L

   Assesment: This is a 55 year-old female with a history of COPD and
   respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was
   intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with MAT/a-fib, respiratory
   distress, intubated and treated for UTI and transferred per family
   request.
   .
   Plan:
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever,
   and RR and 45%bands. Pt lactate elevated.  Likely source is
   respiratory, although urinary and line infection are possible. The
   patient has been at [**Hospital3 **] and resident of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial
   infections are high on the differential. The patient's hypotension is
   likely multifactorial.  Contributing factors include her MAT/a-flutter
   with rapid rate, likely infection from UTI, pseudomonas pna or line
   infection.  She was placed on levophed gtt and neo gtt.  CXR showed pna
   vs effusion vs pulm edema vs ARDS.
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed and Dopamine to maintain MAP > 65 and
   UOP > 30cc/hr. Avoid Neo due to vasoconstrictive effects on
   limbs/organs.
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30 if remains in septic shock
   - cont treatment with Amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum, treat with linezolid for VRE coverage (positive screen at
   OSH), meropenem for pseudomonas double coverage, bactrim for PCP (use
   of chronic steroids)
   - check amikacin peak and trough
   - empiric coverage with meropenem
   - CXR in AM
   - f/u blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - call OSH for sensi
   - stress dose steriods
   - cooling blankets prn
   - ID consult in AM regarding abx regimen
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure.  Likely ARDS given sudden onset, P/F ratio<200,
   pulmonary edema, unlikely cardiogenic. Also has underlying pseudomonas
   pneumonia. She was initially admitted to and placed on BiPAP, but
   required intubtion after desat. ABG with worsening hypercarbia and
   hypoxia. Possible PNA given pseudomonas in sputum and as well as
   chronic aspirations. CXR showed b/l diffuse infiltrates/effusions R>L.
   - CXR in AM
   - cont methylpred
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs
   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter Her rates on admission were as
   high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr)
   due to hypotension nodal agents were deferred.  Her fast rate is likely
   contributing to her hypotension.  She was previously controlled on po
   lopressor, dilt and dig. Also on the differential is possible
   underlying PE driving her tachycardia, although given Hct drop would
   not start anti-coagulation.  Additionally, sepsis and pain also likely
   driving her tachycardia.
   - If continue Amio, need to switch to PO.
   - ECHO ordered
   - hold on anti-coagulation given bleeding and Hct drop
   - LENI to r/o DVT
   #. DIC:. HIT negative at OSH. Stable, will cont to monitor and trend.
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt Hct on admission was 21.9. This is down from 25 at the
   OSH. Pt with multiple ecchymosis on exam.  No evidence of active
   bleeding. Other possiblities could be RP or intraperitonea bleed.
   - active T&C 4U
   - Transfuse 2U pRBC and repeat Hct
   - hemolysis labs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of COPD and respiratory failure, atrial flutter, chronic steroid use, who was admitted to the hospital with MAT/a-fib, respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for UTI before being transferred. The patient's current condition indicates multiple medical complications.

1. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction. Renal dosing of antibiotics is recommended due to the patient's renal insufficiency.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly not associated with ARDS. She has underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and frequent admissions for respiratory failure. The sudden onset of respiratory failure, low PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and pulmonary edema suggest the possibility of ARDS, especially given the presence of pseudomonas pneumonia.

3. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for severe sepsis with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and organ dysfunction. The likely source of infection is respiratory, although urinary tract infection (UTI) and line infection are also possible. Nosocomial infections are high on the differential due to her recent hospitalization and residence in a nursing home.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has an elevated heart rate, likely contributing to her hypotension. MAT/a-flutter is present, and nodal"

   respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was
   intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with MAT/a-fib, respiratory
   distress, intubated and treated for UTI and transferred per family
   request.
   .
   Plan:
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever,
   and RR and 45%bands. Pt lactate elevated.  Likely source is
   respiratory, although urinary and line infection are possible. The
   patient has been at [**Hospital3 **] and resident of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial
   infections are high on the differential. The patient's hypotension is
   likely multifactorial.  Contributing factors include her MAT/a-flutter
   with rapid rate, likely infection from UTI, pseudomonas pna or line
   infection.  She was placed on levophed gtt and neo gtt.  CXR showed pna
   vs effusion vs pulm edema vs ARDS.
   Hemodynamics
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed and Dopamine to maintain MAP > 65 and
   UOP > 30cc/hr. Avoid Neo due to vasoconstrictive effects on
   limbs/organs.
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - consulted renal for possible CVVH to remove fluid. +~11 liters over
   24 hours
   Infection: broad coverage for C.diff, gram +/- including VRE. Bactrim
   because long term steroid use.
   - Sputum (4+ GNR, 4+GPC in [**Hospital1 54**] culture, OSH culture showing
   pseudomonas) and blood (GPC, GNR in [**Hospital1 54**] culture). Reported VRE
   surveillance positive in OSH culture.
   - Started linezolid ([**8-16**]), amikacin (started at OSH), flagyl.
   - cont treatment with Amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum, treat with linezolid for VRE coverage (positive screen at
   OSH), meropenem for pseudomonas double coverage, voriconazole (at risk
   of fungal infection given chronic steroid use)
   - Need to renally dose medications
   - f/u urine, sputum, blood cxs.
   - consider activated protein C in patient, however, bleeding risks
   outweigh benefit.
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - ID approval of abx.
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure.  Likely ARDS given sudden onset, P/F ratio<200,
   pulmonary edema, unlikely cardiogenic. Also has underlying pseudomonas
   pneumonia. She was initially admitted to and placed on BiPAP, but
   required intubtion after desat. ABG with worsening hypercarbia and
   hypoxia. Possible PNA given pseudomonas in sputum and as well as
   chronic aspirations. CXR showed b/l diffuse infiltrates/effusions R>L.
   - CXR in AM
   - cont methylpred
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs
   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter Her rates on admission were as
   high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr)
   due to hypotension nodal agents were deferred.  Her fast rate is likely
   contributing to her hypotension.  She was previously controlled on po
   lopressor, dilt and dig. Also on the differential is possible
   underlying PE driving her tachycardia, although given Hct drop would
   not start anti-coagulation.  Additionally, sepsis and pain also likely
   driving her tachycardia.
   - If continue Amio, need to switch to PO.
   - ECHO ordered
   - hold on anti-coagulation given bleeding and Hct drop
   - LENI to r/o DVT
   #. DIC:. HIT negative at OSH. Stable, will cont to monitor and trend.
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt Hct on admission was 21.9. This is down from 25 at the
   OSH. Pt with multiple ecchymosis on exam.  No evidence of active
   bleeding. Other possiblities could be RP or intraperitonea bleed.
   - active T&C 4U
   - Transfuse 2U pRBC and repeat Hct
   - hemolysis labs
   - guaiac stools
   - if continues to drop Hct plan for CT-torso
   .
   Abdominal striae with oozing fluid: KUB done last night and cannot see
   anything.
   #. UTI: See above. Growing proteus in urine.
   - cont amikacin for now
   - repeat UA/UCx
   .
   #. Pseudomonas Sputum: growing from sputum. Question as to whether
   colonization vs active infection. CXR was reportly normal at OSH. Is
   being covered with amikacin.
   - CXR
   - f/u sputum cx
   - cont amikacin,  meropenem
   .
   #. IDDM: Pt on steriods. Will initiated ISS and lantus 24U q12.
   Monitor QACHS FS and cover with ISS.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of COPD, respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was admitted to the hospital with MAT/a-fib, respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for UTI before being transferred. The patient's current health condition is as follows:

1. Renal Failure: The patient is diagnosed with acute renal failure, possibly due to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal dosing of antibiotics is recommended.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The underlying cause could be pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an acute exacerbation.

3. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. The likely source of infection is respiratory, although urinary tract infection (UTI) and line infection are also possible. The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, with contributing factors including her MAT/a-flutter with rapid rate, likely infection from UTI, pseudomonas in the sputum or line infection.

   Assesment: This is a 55 year-old female with a history of COPD and
   respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was
   intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with MAT/a-fib, respiratory
   distress, intubated and treated for UTI.  Transferred in septic shock
   currently w/ multi-organ failure.
   Plan:
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient with persistent tachycardia, fever, high RR
   and left shift. Pt lactate elevated.  Likely source is pseudomonas from
   OSH cx respiratory, although urinary (OSH cx grew proteus) and line
   infection are possible. The patient has been at [**Hospital3 **] and resident
   of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial infections are high on the differential. The
   patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial.   She was placed on
   levophed gtt and dopa gtt.  CXR showed pna vs effusion vs pulm edema vs
   ARDS.
   Hemodynamics
   - albumin to maintain CVP 8-12
   -  albumin Levophed and Dopamine to maintain MAP > 65. Avoid Neo due to
   vasoconstrictive effects on limbs/organs.
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30, will transfuse 1 unit PRBCs today
   - discussed w/ family pt started on CVVH
   Infection: broad coverage for C.diff, gram +/- including VRE. Bactrim
   because long term steroid use.
   - Sputum (4+ GNR, 4+GPC in [**Hospital1 54**] culture, OSH culture showing
   pseudomonas) and blood (GPC, GNR in [**Hospital1 54**] culture). Reported VRE
   surveillance positive in OSH culture.
   - Started linezolid ([**8-16**]), amikacin (started at OSH), flagyl D2.
   - cont treatment with Amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum, treat with linezolid for VRE coverage (positive screen at
   OSH), meropenem for pseudomonas double coverage
   - will dc vori, as per pharm, and start micofungin
   - Need to renally dose medications
   - f/u [**Hospital1 **] and OSH urine, sputum, blood cxs.
   - trend WBC, fever curve q6h
   - full abdominal U/S to look for further source of infection (ie bowel
   necrosis) as pt persistently febrile
   Metabolic: Has respiratory acidosis, AG metabolic acidosis and
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. With low pH on ABG, worry about
   cardiac asystole.
   - f/u abg serial abg
   - Continue to trend lactate
   - currently on CVVHD
   - receiving amps of bicarb to try and ameliorate acidosis
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure.  Currently in ARDS given sudden onset, P/F
   ratio<200, pulmonary edema. Also has underlying pseudomonas pneumonia.
   She was initially admitted to and placed on BiPAP, but required
   intubtion after desat. Possible PNA given pseudomonas in sputum. CXR
   showed b/l diffuse infiltrates/effusions R>L.
   - cont amikacin and [**Last Name (un) 430**] for pseudomonas
   - patient is being dialyzed
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - cont methylpred
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs
   - f/u serial abg
   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter on admision to OSH. Her rates on
   admission to [**Hospital1 54**] were as high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio
   (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr) due to hypotension nodal agents were
   deferred.  Her fast rate is likely contributing to her hypotension.
   She was previously controlled on po lopressor, dilt and dig. Sepsis and
   persistent fevers are likely the cause of her tachycardia. The patient
   has troponin leaks, likely due to demand ischemia.
   - received one dose of dig 0.125 w/ no response, current level 4.4 so
   it was dc
   - Received an amiodarone load on [**8-16**]. Decided to D/C because did not
   want to give oral med. Also, hypotensive and BP will not tolerate
   amiodarone.
   - f/u  echo, LENIs
   - hold on anti-coagulation given bleeding and thrombocytopenia
   ARF: Renal failure was initially likely pre-renal given sepsis. It has
   progressed to ischemic ATN. Currently aniuric.
   - being dialyzed.
   - need to renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u renal note.
   #. DIC:  incresed PT/PTT, LDH. Thrombocytopenia (HIT negative at OSH).
   Fibrinogen elevated.  Platelets down to 10 yesterday, she was
   transfused 1 unit, w/ appropriate rise to 40.  Currently 20.
   -- transfuse 1 unit of platelets if 10 or <
   --Stable DIC [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] cont to monitor and trend.
   --Will treat underlying sepsis and see if DIC improves.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory failure, who was admitted to the hospital with myocardial infarction (MAT/a-fib), respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for urinary tract infection (UTI). She was transferred to the ICU due to septic shock and currently has multi-organ failure.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient has a history of COPD and frequent admissions for respiratory failure. She is currently in ARDS given the sudden onset, low PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and pulmonary edema. There is also an underlying pseudomonas pneumonia.

2. Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has deteriorated from pre-renal to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She is anuric and being dialyzed.

3. Septic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to a suspected pseudomonas infection from the OSH care respiratory, although urinary and line infections are possible. She is hypotensive and tachycardic, with elevated lactate levels.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has MAT/a-flutter on admission and high heart rates. She was started on amiodarone but it was discontinued due to hypotension. Her fast"

   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 .H/O PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PULM HTN, PHTN)
 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   Assesment: This is a 55 year-old female with a history of COPD and
   respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was
   intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with MAT/a-fib, respiratory
   distress, intubated and treated for UTI and transferred per family
   request.
   .
   Plan:
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever,
   and RR and 45%bands. Pt lactate elevated.  Likely source is
   respiratory, although urinary and line infection are possible. The
   patient has been at [**Hospital3 **] and resident of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial
   infections are high on the differential. The patient's hypotension is
   likely multifactorial.  Contributing factors include her MAT/a-flutter
   with rapid rate, likely infection from UTI, pseudomonas pna or line
   infection.  She was placed on levophed gtt and neo gtt.  CXR showed pna
   vs effusion vs pulm edema vs ARDS.
   Hemodynamics
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed and Dopamine to maintain MAP > 65.
   Avoid Neo due to vasoconstrictive effects on limbs/organs.
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - discussed w/ family pt started on CVVH
   Infection: broad coverage for C.diff, gram +/- including VRE. Bactrim
   because long term steroid use.
   - Sputum (4+ GNR, 4+GPC in [**Hospital1 54**] culture, OSH culture showing
   pseudomonas) and blood (GPC, GNR in [**Hospital1 54**] culture). Reported VRE
   surveillance positive in OSH culture.
   - Started linezolid ([**8-16**]), amikacin (started at OSH), flagyl.
   - cont treatment with Amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum, treat with linezolid for VRE coverage (positive screen at
   OSH), meropenem for pseudomonas double coverage, voriconazole (at risk
   of fungal infection given chronic steroid use)
   - Need to renally dose medications
   - f/u urine, sputum, blood cxs.
   - consider activated protein C in patient, however, bleeding risks
   outweigh benefit.
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   Metabolic: Has AG metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactate. With low
   pH on ABG, worry about cardiac asystole.
   - Continue to trend lactate
   - dialysis will help with lactate clearance
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure.  Likely ARDS given sudden onset, P/F ratio<200,
   pulmonary edema which is unlikely cardiogenic. Also has underlying
   pseudomonas pneumonia. She was initially admitted to and placed on
   BiPAP, but required intubtion after desat. ABG with worsening
   hypercarbia and hypoxia. Possible PNA given pseudomonas in sputum. CXR
   showed b/l diffuse infiltrates/effusions R>L.
   - patient is being dialyzed
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - cont methylpred
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs
   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter. Her rates on admission were as
   high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr)
   due to hypotension nodal agents were deferred.  Her fast rate is likely
   contributing to her hypotension.  She was previously controlled on po
   lopressor, dilt and dig. Sepsis and persistent fevers are likely the
   cause of her tachycardia. The patient has troponin leaks, likely due to
   demand ischemia.
   - Received an amiodarone load on [**8-16**]. Decided to D/C because did not
   want to give oral med. Also, hypotensive and BP will not tolerate
   amiodarone.
   - Pending studies: echo, LENIs (to r/o DVTs and possible PE)
   - hold on anti-coagulation given bleeding and Hct drop
   ARF: Renal failure was initially likely pre-renal given sepsis. It has
   likely progressed to ischemic ATN. Currently aniuric.
   - being dialyzed.
   - need to renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u renal note.
   #. DIC:.Increased PT/PTT, LDH. Thrombocytopenia (HIT negative at OSH).
   Fibrinogen elevated
   --Stable, will cont to monitor and trend.
   --Will treat underlying sepsis and see if DIC improves.
   --spoke about starting activated protein C, but risks of bleeding
   outweigh benefits.
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt
s Hct currently stable at 26.1.
   - active T&C
   - check Hct q 4 hr
   - Consider CT of torso if continues to bleed.
   .
   Abdominal striae with oozing fluid, total output ~3L. KUB done on [**8-17**]
   did not show anything.
   - consider abdominal CT if status worsens.
   #. UTI: See above. Growing proteus in urine from OSH.
   - cont amikacin for now
   - f/u UCx
   - obtain OSH records from [**Hospital3 **]
   .
   #. Pseudomonas Sputum from OSH. GPC, GNR in sputum at [**Hospital1 54**]: growing
   from sputum. Question as to whether colonization vs active infection.
   CXR was reportly normal at OSH. Is being covered with amikacin.
   - CXR
   - f/u sputum cx
   - OSH sensitivies need to be obtained
   - cont amikacin,  meropenem
   .
   #. IDDM: Pt on steriods. Will initiated ISS and lantus 24U q12.
   Monitor QACHS FS and cover with ISS.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of COPD and respiratory failure, who was initially admitted with MAT/a-fib, respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for UTI.
- She was transferred to another hospital due to family request and subsequently developed septic shock, likely caused by respiratory infection, with possible sources being urinary tract infection or line infection.
- The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, with contributing factors including MAT/a-flutter with rapid rate, infection from UTI, and pseudomonas pneumonia or line infection.
- She has acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure not consistent with ARDS, severe sepsis, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation.
- The patient is being treated with IV fluids, Levophed, Dopamine, CVVH, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and medications for VRE, GNR, and GPC infections.
- She is also being monitored for DIC, anemia, UTI, pseudomonas sputum infection, and IDDM.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with severe sepsis, and there is a risk of further complications such as organ dysfunction, septic shock, or death if not properly managed.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Although the patient does not meet the criteria for ARDS, there is a risk of developing"

   Assesment: This is a 55 year-old female with a history of COPD and
   respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was
   intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with MAT/a-fib, respiratory
   distress, intubated and treated for UTI and transferred per family
   request.
   .
   Plan:
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever,
   and RR and 45%bands. Pt lactate elevated.  Likely source is
   respiratory, although urinary and line infection are possible. The
   patient has been at [**Hospital3 **] and resident of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial
   infections are high on the differential. The patient's hypotension is
   likely multifactorial.  Contributing factors include her MAT/a-flutter
   with rapid rate, likely infection from UTI, pseudomonas pna or line
   infection.  She was placed on levophed gtt and neo gtt.  CXR showed pna
   vs effusion vs pulm edema vs ARDS.
   Hemodynamics
   - IV fluids to goal CVP 8-12
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed and Dopamine to maintain MAP > 65 and
   UOP > 30cc/hr. Avoid Neo due to vasoconstrictive effects on
   limbs/organs.
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - consulted renal for possible CVVH to remove fluid. +~11 liters over
   24 hours
   Infection: broad coverage for C.diff, gram +/- including VRE. Bactrim
   because long term steroid use.
   - Sputum (4+ GNR, 4+GPC in [**Hospital1 54**] culture, OSH culture showing
   pseudomonas) and blood (GPC, GNR in [**Hospital1 54**] culture). Reported VRE
   surveillance positive in OSH culture.
   - Started linezolid ([**8-16**]), amikacin (started at OSH), flagyl.
   - cont treatment with Amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum, treat with linezolid for VRE coverage (positive screen at
   OSH), meropenem for pseudomonas double coverage, voriconazole (at risk
   of fungal infection given chronic steroid use)
   - Need to renally dose medications
   - f/u urine, sputum, blood cxs.
   - consider activated protein C in patient, however, bleeding risks
   outweigh benefit.
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - ID approval of abx.
   Metabolic: Has AG metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactate. With low
   pH on ABG, worry about cardiac asystole.
   - Continue to trend lactate
   - dialysis will help with lactate clearance
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure.  Likely ARDS given sudden onset, P/F ratio<200,
   pulmonary edema which is unlikely cardiogenic. Also has underlying
   pseudomonas pneumonia. She was initially admitted to and placed on
   BiPAP, but required intubtion after desat. ABG with worsening
   hypercarbia and hypoxia. Possible PNA given pseudomonas in sputum. CXR
   showed b/l diffuse infiltrates/effusions R>L.
   - Consider placement of an esophageal balloon to clarify PEEP therapy.
   - If the patient is dialyzed, her respiratory status might improve.
   - CXR in AM
   - cont methylpred
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs
   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter Her rates on admission were as
   high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr)
   due to hypotension nodal agents were deferred.  Her fast rate is likely
   contributing to her hypotension.  She was previously controlled on po
   lopressor, dilt and dig. Also on the differential is possible
   underlying PE driving her tachycardia, although given Hct drop would
   not start anti-coagulation.  Additionally, sepsis and pain also likely
   driving her tachycardia. The patient has troponin leaks, likely due to
   demand ischemia.
   - Received an amiodarone load on [**8-16**]. Decided to D/C because did not
   want to give oral med. Also, hypotensive and BP will not tolerate
   amiodarone.
   - Pending studies: echo, LENIs (to r/o DVTs and possible PE)
   - hold on anti-coagulation given bleeding and Hct drop
   ARF: Renal failure was initially likely pre-renal given sepsis. It has
   likely progressed to ischemic ATN. Has poor UOP.
   - consulted renal to dialyze patient.
   - need to renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u renal note.
   #. DIC:.Increased PT/PTT, LDH. Thrombocytopenia (HIT negative at OSH).
   Fibrinogen elevated
   --Stable, will cont to monitor and trend.
   --Will treat underlying sepsis and see if DIC improves.
   --spoke about starting activated protein C, but risks of bleeding
   outweigh benefits.
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt
s crit continues to fall. Unsure if dilution. Doubt
   active bleeding.
   - active T&C
   - transfuse 1 unit of blood
   - check Hct q 4 hr
   - Consider CT of torso if continues to bleed.
   .
   Abdominal striae with oozing fluid: KUB done last night and cannot see
   anything.
   - consider abdominal CT if status worsens.
   #. UTI: See above. Growing proteus in urine from OSH.
   - cont amikacin for now
   - f/u UCx
   - obtain OSH records from [**Hospital3 **]
   .
   #. Pseudomonas Sputum from OSH. GPC, GNR in sputum at [**Hospital1 54**]: growing
   from sputum. Question as to whether colonization vs active infection.
   CXR was reportly normal at OSH. Is being covered with amikacin.
   - CXR
   - f/u sputum cx
   - OSH sensitivies need to be obtained
   - cont amikacin,  meropenem
   .
   #. IDDM: Pt on steriods. Will initiated ISS and lantus 24U q12.
   Monitor QACHS FS and cover with ISS.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory failure, atrial flutter with rapid rate, chronic steroid use, who was initially admitted to Hospital3 with atrial fibrillation, respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for urinary tract infection (UTI) and transferred per family request. She has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension, and possible pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is experiencing severe sepsis with signs of infection in multiple systems. Immediate management should include aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 ratio and diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest ARDS. Supportive care with mechanical ventilation and consideration for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be necessary.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine and urea levels, as well as low urine output. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration for renal replacement therapy (such as continuous venovenous hemodialysis) may be required.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of pneumonia, likely caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, based on sputum culture results. Appropriate antibiotic therapy, including"

   Assesment: This is a 55 year-old female with a history of COPD and
   respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was
   intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with MAT/a-fib, respiratory
   distress, intubated and treated for UTI.  Transferred in septic shock
   currently w/ multi-organ failure.
   Plan:
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient with persistent tachycardia, fever, high RR
   and left shift. Pt lactate elevated.  Likely source is pseudomonas from
   OSH cx respiratory, although urinary (OSH cx grew proteus) and line
   infection are possible. The patient has been at [**Hospital3 **] and resident
   of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial infections are high on the differential. The
   patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial.   She was placed on
   levophed gtt and dopa gtt.  CXR showed pna vs effusion vs pulm edema vs
   ARDS.
   Hemodynamics
   - albumin to maintain CVP 8-12
   -  albumin Levophed and Dopamine to maintain MAP > 65. Avoid Neo due to
   vasoconstrictive effects on limbs/organs.
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30, will transfuse 1 unit PRBCs today
   - discussed w/ family pt started on CVVH
   Infection: broad coverage for C.diff, gram +/- including VRE. Bactrim
   because long term steroid use.
   - Sputum (4+ GNR, 4+GPC in [**Hospital1 54**] culture, OSH culture showing
   pseudomonas) and blood (GPC, GNR in [**Hospital1 54**] culture). Reported VRE
   surveillance positive in OSH culture.
   - Started linezolid ([**8-16**]), amikacin (started at OSH), flagyl D2.
   - cont treatment with Amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum, treat with linezolid for VRE coverage (positive screen at
   OSH), meropenem for pseudomonas double coverage
   - will dc vori, as per pharm, and start micofungin
   - Need to renally dose medications
   - f/u [**Hospital1 **] and OSH urine, sputum, blood cxs.
   - trend WBC, fever curve q6h
   - full abdominal U/S to look for further source of infection (ie bowel
   necrosis) as pt persistently febrile
   Metabolic: Has respiratory acidosis, AG metabolic acidosis and
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. With low pH on ABG, worry about
   cardiac asystole.
   - f/u abg serial abg
   - Continue to trend lactate
   - currently on CVVHD
   - receiving amps of bicarb to try and ameliorate acidosis
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure.  Currently in ARDS given sudden onset, P/F
   ratio<200, pulmonary edema. Also has underlying pseudomonas pneumonia.
   She was initially admitted to and placed on BiPAP, but required
   intubtion after desat. Possible PNA given pseudomonas in sputum. CXR
   showed b/l diffuse infiltrates/effusions R>L.
   - cont amikacin and [**Last Name (un) 430**] for pseudomonas
   - patient is being dialyzed
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - cont methylpred
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs
   - f/u serial abg
   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter on admision to OSH. Her rates on
   admission to [**Hospital1 54**] were as high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio
   (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr) due to hypotension nodal agents were
   deferred.  Her fast rate is likely contributing to her hypotension.
   She was previously controlled on po lopressor, dilt and dig. Sepsis and
   persistent fevers are likely the cause of her tachycardia. The patient
   has troponin leaks, likely due to demand ischemia.
   - received one dose of dig 0.125 w/ no response, current level 4.4 so
   it was dc
   - Received an amiodarone load on [**8-16**]. Decided to D/C because did not
   want to give oral med. Also, hypotensive and BP will not tolerate
   amiodarone.
   - f/u  echo, LENIs
   - hold on anti-coagulation given bleeding and thrombocytopenia
   ARF: Renal failure was initially likely pre-renal given sepsis. It has
   progressed to ischemic ATN. Currently aniuric.
   - being dialyzed.
   - need to renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u renal note.
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Unknown cause of thrombocytopenia possibly a
   component of DIC as labs are not normal but not in
   --Stable, will cont to monitor and trend.
   --Will treat underlying sepsis and see if DIC improves.
   --spoke about starting activated protein C, but risks of bleeding
   outweigh benefits.
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt
s Hct currently stable at 26.1.
   - active T&C
   - check Hct q 4 hr
   - Consider CT of torso if continues to bleed.
   .
   Abdominal striae with oozing fluid, total output ~3L. KUB done on [**8-17**]
   did not show anything.
   - consider abdominal CT if status worsens.
   #. UTI: See above. Growing proteus in urine from OSH.
   - cont amikacin for now
   - f/u UCx
   - obtain OSH records from [**Hospital3 **]
   .
   #. Pseudomonas Sputum from OSH. GPC, GNR in sputum at [**Hospital1 54**]: growing
   from sputum. Question as to whether colonization vs active infection.
   CXR was reportly normal at OSH. Is being covered with amikacin.
   - CXR
   - f/u sputum cx
   - OSH sensitivies need to be obtained
   - cont amikacin,  meropenem

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of COPD, respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was initially admitted with MAT/a-fib, respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for UTI. She was transferred to the current facility in septic shock and is currently experiencing multi-organ failure.
- The patient has persistent tachycardia, fever, high respiratory rate, and left shift. Lactate levels are elevated, suggesting possible sepsis.
- The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, and she has been placed on levophed and dopamine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, severe sepsis, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation.
- The patient has shown no improvement despite treatment, and her condition remains critical.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 104.9°F (Tmax), blood pressure ranging from 103/53 mmHg to 124/61 mmHg, heart rate between 119-149 bpm, respiratory rate of 7-27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on 100% FiO2, and CVP of 8-19 mmHg.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of COPD, respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was initially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with MAT/a-fib, respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for UTI. She is currently in septic shock with multi-organ failure, including renal failure, respiratory failure, and possible sepsis. The patient has persistent tachycardia, fever, high RR, left shift, elevated lactate, and hypotension. She has a history of pulmonary hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including potential nosocomial infections, pseudomonas pneumonia, and a urinary tract infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to an infection, possibly from pseudomonas or another source. This is indicated by persistent tachycardia, fever, high respiratory rate, left shift, and elevated lactate levels.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly due to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), as evidenced by low PaO2/FiO2 ratio and bilateral diffuse infiltrates on chest X-ray.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely progressing from pre-renal to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). She is currently anur"

   Assesment: This is a 55 year-old female with a history of COPD and
   respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was
   intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with MAT/a-fib, respiratory
   distress, intubated and treated for UTI.  Transferred in septic shock
   currently w/ multi-organ failure.
   Plan:
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient with persistent tachycardia, fever, high RR
   and left shift. Pt lactate elevated.  Likely source is pseudomonas from
   OSH cx respiratory, although urinary (OSH cx grew proteus) and line
   infection are possible. The patient has been at [**Hospital3 **] and resident
   of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial infections are high on the differential. The
   patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial.   She was placed on
   levophed gtt and dopa gtt.  CXR showed pna vs effusion vs pulm edema vs
   ARDS.
   Hemodynamics
   - albumin to maintain CVP 8-12
   -  albumin Levophed and Dopamine to maintain MAP > 65. Avoid Neo due to
   vasoconstrictive effects on limbs/organs.
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30, will transfuse 1 unit PRBCs today
   - discussed w/ family pt started on CVVH
   Infection: broad coverage for C.diff, gram +/- including VRE. Bactrim
   because long term steroid use.
   - Sputum (4+ GNR, 4+GPC in [**Hospital1 54**] culture, OSH culture showing
   pseudomonas) and blood (GPC, GNR in [**Hospital1 54**] culture). Reported VRE
   surveillance positive in OSH culture.
   - Started linezolid ([**8-16**]), amikacin (started at OSH), flagyl D2.
   - cont treatment with Amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum, treat with linezolid for VRE coverage (positive screen at
   OSH), meropenem for pseudomonas double coverage
   - will dc vori, as per pharm, and start micofungin
   - Need to renally dose medications
   - f/u [**Hospital1 **] and OSH urine, sputum, blood cxs.
   - trend WBC, fever curve q6h
   - full abdominal U/S to look for further source of infection (ie bowel
   necrosis) as pt persistently febrile
   Metabolic: Has respiratory acidosis, AG metabolic acidosis and
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. With low pH on ABG, worry about
   cardiac asystole.
   - f/u abg serial abg
   - Continue to trend lactate
   - currently on CVVHD
   - receiving amps of bicarb to try and ameliorate acidosis
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure.  Currently in ARDS given sudden onset, P/F
   ratio<200, pulmonary edema. Also has underlying pseudomonas pneumonia.
   She was initially admitted to and placed on BiPAP, but required
   intubtion after desat. Possible PNA given pseudomonas in sputum. CXR
   showed b/l diffuse infiltrates/effusions R>L.
   - cont amikacin and [**Last Name (un) 430**] for pseudomonas
   - patient is being dialyzed
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - cont methylpred
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory failure, atrial flutter with chronic steroid use. She was initially admitted with atrial fibrillation, respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for urinary tract infection (UTI). She was then transferred to the current hospital due to septic shock and multi-organ failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to ischemic acute tubular necrosis due to sepsis and multi-organ failure. She is currently being dialyzed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pseudomonas pneumonia. She is receiving amikacin and meropenem for pseudomonas coverage. She is also being mechanically ventilated.
3. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, likely caused by a nosocomial infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, including coverage for Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and gram-negative organisms.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has persistent tachycardia, likely secondary to sepsis, atrial flutter, and demand ischemia. Amiodarone was given but had to be discontinued due to hypotension.

 .H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   Assesment: This is a 55 year-old female with a history of COPD and
   respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was
   intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with MAT/a-fib, respiratory
   distress, intubated and treated for UTI.  Transferred in septic shock
   currently w/ multi-organ failure.
   Plan:
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient with persistent tachycardia, fever, high RR
   and left shift. Pt lactate elevated.  Likely source is pseudomonas from
   OSH cx respiratory, although urinary (OSH cx grew proteus) and line
   infection are possible. The patient has been at [**Hospital3 **] and resident
   of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial infections are high on the differential. The
   patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial.   She was placed on
   levophed gtt and dopa gtt.  CXR showed pna vs effusion vs pulm edema vs
   ARDS.
   Hemodynamics
   - albumin to maintain CVP 8-12
   -  albumin Levophed and Dopamine to maintain MAP > 65. Avoid Neo due to
   vasoconstrictive effects on limbs/organs.
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30, will transfuse 1 unit PRBCs today
   - discussed w/ family pt started on CVVH
   Infection: broad coverage for C.diff, gram +/- including VRE. Bactrim
   because long term steroid use.
   - Sputum (4+ GNR, 4+GPC in [**Hospital1 54**] culture, OSH culture showing
   pseudomonas) and blood (GPC, GNR in [**Hospital1 54**] culture). Reported VRE
   surveillance positive in OSH culture.
   - Started linezolid ([**8-16**]), amikacin (started at OSH), flagyl D2.
   - cont treatment with Amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum, treat with linezolid for VRE coverage (positive screen at
   OSH), meropenem for pseudomonas double coverage
   - will dc vori, as per pharm, and start micofungin
   - Need to renally dose medications
   - f/u [**Hospital1 **] and OSH urine, sputum, blood cxs.
   - trend WBC, fever curve q6h
   - full abdominal U/S to look for further source of infection (ie bowel
   necrosis) as pt persistently febrile
   Metabolic: Has respiratory acidosis, AG metabolic acidosis and
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. With low pH on ABG, worry about
   cardiac asystole.
   - f/u abg serial abg
   - Continue to trend lactate
   - currently on CVVHD
   - receiving amps of bicarb to try and ameliorate acidosis
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure.  Currently in ARDS given sudden onset, P/F
   ratio<200, pulmonary edema. Also has underlying pseudomonas pneumonia.
   She was initially admitted to and placed on BiPAP, but required
   intubtion after desat. Possible PNA given pseudomonas in sputum. CXR
   showed b/l diffuse infiltrates/effusions R>L.
   - cont amikacin and [**Last Name (un) 430**] for pseudomonas
   - patient is being dialyzed
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - cont methylpred
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs
   - f/u serial abg
   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter on admision to OSH. Her rates on
   admission to [**Hospital1 54**] were as high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio
   (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr) due to hypotension nodal agents were
   deferred.  Her fast rate is likely contributing to her hypotension.
   She was previously controlled on po lopressor, dilt and dig. Sepsis and
   persistent fevers are likely the cause of her tachycardia. The patient
   has troponin leaks, likely due to demand ischemia.
   - received one dose of dig 0.125 w/ no response, current level 4.4 so
   it was dc
   - Received an amiodarone load on [**8-16**]. Decided to D/C because did not
   want to give oral med. Also, hypotensive and BP will not tolerate
   amiodarone.
   - f/u  echo, LENIs
   - hold on anti-coagulation given bleeding and thrombocytopenia
   ARF: Renal failure was initially likely pre-renal given sepsis. It has
   progressed to ischemic ATN. Currently aniuric.
   - being dialyzed.
   - need to renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u renal note.
   #. DIC:  incresed PT/PTT, LDH. Thrombocytopenia (HIT negative at OSH).
   Fibrinogen elevated.  Platelets down to 10 yesterday, she was
   transfused 1 unit, w/ appropriate rise to 40.  Currently 20.
   -- transfuse 1 unit of platelets if 10 or <
   --Stable DIC [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] cont to monitor and trend.
   --Will treat underlying sepsis and see if DIC improves.
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt
s Hct currently stable at 26.1.
   - active T&C
   - check Hct q 6 hr
   - transfuse to Hct >28
   .
   #Abdominal striae with oozing fluid, total output ~3L. KUB done on [**8-17**]
   did not show anything.
   - will cont to monitor
   - will keep even I/O.
   .
   #. IDDM: Pt on steriods. Will initiated ISS and lantus 24U q12.

   Disposition: ICU level of care
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory failure. She was admitted to the hospital with atrial fibrillation (MAT/a-flutter), respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient then developed septic shock and was transferred to the ICU.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with anuria. She is being dialyzed and receiving albumin to maintain CVP at 8-12. Medications are being renally dosed due to renal failure.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio <200, pulmonary edema, and underlying pseudomonas pneumonia. She is receiving amikacin and meropenem for pseudomonas coverage, as well as albuterol/ipratropium nebs.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has a fast heart rate due to MAT/a-flutter. She was previously controlled on propranolol, diltiazem, and digoxin. Sepsis and persistent fevers are likely contributing to her tachycardia. Amiodarone was given but discontinued due to hypotension.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has respiratory acidosis, anion gap"

   Avoid Neo due to vasoconstrictive effects on limbs/organs.
   - Transfuse for Hct > 30
   - discussed w/ family pt started on CVVH
   Infection: broad coverage for C.diff, gram +/- including VRE. Bactrim
   because long term steroid use.
   - Sputum (4+ GNR, 4+GPC in [**Hospital1 54**] culture, OSH culture showing
   pseudomonas) and blood (GPC, GNR in [**Hospital1 54**] culture). Reported VRE
   surveillance positive in OSH culture.
   - Started linezolid ([**8-16**]), amikacin (started at OSH), flagyl.
   - cont treatment with Amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum, treat with linezolid for VRE coverage (positive screen at
   OSH), meropenem for pseudomonas double coverage, voriconazole (at risk
   of fungal infection given chronic steroid use)
   - Need to renally dose medications

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory failure, who was initially admitted with myocardial infarction (MAT/a-fib), respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for urinary tract infection (UTI). She was transferred to the current hospital in septic shock and is currently experiencing multi-organ failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient has persistent tachycardia, fever, high respiratory rate, and a left shift. Her lactate levels are elevated, indicating poor tissue perfusion. The likely source of infection is pseudomonas from an open skin wound (OSH cx respiratory) or urinary tract infection (OSH cx grew proteus). Nosocomial infections are also a concern given her prolonged hospital stay. The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and frequent admissions for respiratory failure. She likely has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to sudden onset, low PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and pulmonary edema which is unlikely cardiogenic. Pseudomonas pneumonia is also suspected. The patient has diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has MAT/a-flutter and her heart rates have been as high as 150-180 beats per minute. She was started on amiodarone"

   Assesment: This is a 55 year-old female with a history of COPD and
   respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was
   intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with MAT/a-fib, respiratory
   distress, intubated and treated for UTI.  Transferred in septic shock
   currently w/ multi-organ failure.
   Plan:
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient with persistent tachycardia, fever, high RR
   and left shift. Pt lactate elevated. Likely source is MDR pseudomonas
   from OSH cx respiratory, although urinary (OSH cx grew proteus) and
   line infection are possible. The patient has been at [**Hospital3 **] and
   resident of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial infections are high on the
   differential. The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial.   CXR
   showed pna vs effusion vs pulm edema vs ARDS.
   Infection: Sources, MDR pseudomonas PNA, MRSA PNA leading to
   bacteremia; Proteus UTI is also consideration. She also has a h/o
   C.diff, and VRE. Abd U/S only showed subcu fluid collection.
   - Sputum (4+ GNR pseudomonas, 4+GPC MRSA in [**Hospital1 54**] culture, OSH culture
   showing pseudomonas) and blood (GNR in [**Hospital1 54**] sputum culture)
 amakacin
   and colistin (per ID)
   - amakacin peak and trough
   - growing coag pos staph in blood and h/o VRE
 linezolid ID considers
   changing to vanco since unlikely VRE
   - cont treatment with amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum
   - continue broad fungal coverage with micafungin, ID considers D/C
   - continue anerobic coverage with flagyl
   - all meds are CVVH dosed
   - f/u cultures and speciation from blood
   - q6h WBC, trend fever curve
   Hemodynamics: likely due to infection, CVP 15. Initially gave albumin
   Levophed and Dopamine to maintain MAP > 65. Avoid Neo due to
   vasoconstrictive effects on limbs/organs.
   - cont CVVH for even fluid balance
   - on levofed / vasopressin at improved doses, continue to wean as
   infection
   Metabolic: Has chronic respiratory acidosis, AG metabolic acidosis due
   to lactic (from infx vs end organ ischemia, such as ?bowel ischemia,
   shock liver vs uremia) and slight non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
   (renal failure). With low pH on ABG, worry about cardiac asystole.
   Lactate now improved to 2.8
   - treating underlying infection (cause of septic shock) per above
   - q4h ABGs
   - Continue to trend lactate
   - currently on CVVHD
   - receiving amps of bicarb to try and ameliorate acidosis
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure. Failure due to multifocal PNA leading to ARDA
   (given sudden onset, P/F ratio<200, pulmonary edema), and fluid
   overload all in setting of chronic COPD and probably bronchiectatic
   lungs given PNA history in the past. She was initially admitted to and
   placed on BiPAP, but required intubtion after desat. CXR showed b/l
   diffuse infiltrates/effusions R>L.  ABGs show ventilation probable at
   pt
s baseline, but oxygenation is tenuous, requiring high levels of
   PEEP and 100% FIO2.
   - wean AC to PEEP of 14 as pt may be on noncompliant part of the curve
   and over-PEEPed right now, if tolerates wean FIO2 to prevent
   hyperoxygenation injury.
   - cont treating infection as above
   - cont CVVH for fluid overload
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - cont methylpred
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs
   - q4h ABGs
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter on admision to OSH. Her rates on
   admission to [**Hospital1 54**] were as high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio
   (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr) due to hypotension nodal agents were
   deferred.  Her fast rate is likely contributing to her hypotension.
   She was previously controlled on po lopressor, dilt and dig. Sepsis and
   persistent fevers are likely the cause of her tachycardia. The patient
   has troponin leaks, likely due to demand ischemia. Was place on amio
   drip and cardioverted upon admission to sinus tach (130s) for which she
   has multiple likely causes. Received one dose of dig 0.125 w/ no
   response, level was 4.4 so it was dc
d. Echo showed moderate pulm
   hypertension, LENIs showed no DVT (both were poor studies given pt
   body habitus). No longer on dopa or inotropic/chronotropic pressors.
   - currently not on any agents due to pt
s hemodynamic instability
   (hypotension)
   - hold on anti-coagulation given bleeding and thrombocytopenia
   - continue to follow on tele
   .
   # ARF: Renal failure was initially likely pre-renal given sepsis. It
   has progressed to ischemic ATN. Currently aniuric.
   - cont CVVH
   - CVVH dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u renal note.
   .
   #. DIC: Initially thought to have incresed PT/PTT, LDH.
   Thrombocytopenia (HIT negative at OSH). Fibrinogen elevated.  Platelets
   down to 10 yesterday, she was transfused 1 unit, w/ appropriate rise to
   40.  Currently back down to 14.
   -- transfuse 1 unit of platelets if 10 or <
   --Stable DIC [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] cont to monitor and trend.
   --Will treat underlying sepsis and see if DIC improves.
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt
s Hct currently improved at 29.
   - active T&C
   - check Hct q 6 hr
   - transfuse to Hct >28
   .
   #Abdominal striae with oozing fluid, total output ~3L. KUB done on [**8-17**]
   did not show anything.
   - will cont to monitor
   - will keep even I/O.
   .
   #. IDDM: Pt on steriods.
   - cont ISS, have decreased [**Last Name (un) **] lantus from 24U q12 to 6U q12
   - monitor QACHS FS and cover with ISS.

   .
   Assesment: This is a 55 year-old female with a history of COPD and
   respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was
   intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with MAT/a-fib, respiratory
   distress, intubated and treated for UTI.  Transferred in septic shock
   currently w/ multi-organ failure.
   Plan:
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient with persistent tachycardia, fever, high RR
   and left shift. Pt lactate elevated. Likely source is MDR pseudomonas
   from OSH cx respiratory, although urinary (OSH cx grew proteus) and
   line infection are possible. The patient has been at [**Hospital3 **] and
   resident of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial infections are high on the
   differential. The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial.   CXR
   showed pna vs effusion vs pulm edema vs ARDS.
   Infection: Sources, MDR pseudomonas PNA, MRSA PNA leading to
   bacteremia; Proteus UTI is also consideration. She also has a h/o
   C.diff, and VRE. Abd U/S only showed subcu fluid collection.
   - Sputum (4+ GNR pseudomonas, 4+GPC MRSA in [**Hospital1 54**] culture, OSH culture
   showing pseudomonas) and blood (GNR in [**Hospital1 54**] sputum culture)
 amakacin
   and colistin (per ID)
   - amakacin peak and trough
   - growing coag pos staph in blood and h/o VRE
 change linezolid to
   vanco since unlikely VRE
   - cont treatment with amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum
   - D/C micafungin (per ID)
   - D/C flagyl
   - all meds are CVVH dosed
   - f/u cultures and speciation from blood
   - strict contact precautions
   - q6h WBC, trend fever curve
   Hemodynamics: likely due to infection, CVP 15. Initially gave albumin
   Levophed and Dopamine to maintain MAP > 65. Avoid Neo due to
   vasoconstrictive effects on limbs/organs.
   - cont CVVH for even fluid balance
   - on levofed / vasopressin at improved doses, continue to wean as
   infection
   Metabolic: Has chronic respiratory acidosis, AG metabolic acidosis due
   to lactic (from infx vs end organ ischemia, such as ?bowel ischemia,
   shock liver vs uremia) and slight non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
   (renal failure). With low pH on ABG, worry about cardiac asystole.
   Lactate now improved to 2.8
   - treating underlying infection (cause of septic shock) per above
   - q4h ABGs
   - Continue to trend lactate
   - currently on CVVHD with bicarb
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure. Failure due to multifocal PNA leading to ARDA
   (given sudden onset, P/F ratio<200, pulmonary edema), and fluid
   overload all in setting of chronic COPD and probably bronchiectatic
   lungs given PNA history in the past. She was initially admitted to and
   placed on BiPAP, but required intubtion after desat. CXR showed b/l
   diffuse infiltrates/effusions R>L.  ABGs show ventilation probable at
   pt
s baseline, but oxygenation is tenuous, requiring high levels of
   PEEP and 100% FIO2.
   - weaned to AC PEEP 14, tolerating well this AM, with improved pH, CO2,
   O2. pt may have been on noncompliant part of the curve and over-PEEPed
   right now and may have increased Zone I physiology. Goal today to wean
   FIO2 from 100% to prevent hyperoxygenation injury. Goal PaCO2 >60.
   - can consider decreasing RR later today as PaCO2 now in 40s (pt
   baseline probably >60)
   - cont treating infection as above
   - cont CVVH for fluid overload
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - cont hydrocort 100 q6h, consider tapering in upcoming days when
   decrease pressors
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs
   - q4h ABGs
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter on admision to OSH. Her rates on
   admission to [**Hospital1 54**] were as high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio
   (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr) due to hypotension nodal agents were
   deferred.  Her fast rate is likely contributing to her hypotension.
   She was previously controlled on po lopressor, dilt and dig. Sepsis and
   persistent fevers are likely the cause of her tachycardia. The patient
   has troponin leaks, likely due to demand ischemia. Was place on amio
   drip and cardioverted upon admission to sinus tach (130s) for which she
   has multiple likely causes. Received one dose of dig 0.125 w/ no
   response, level was 4.4 so it was dc
d. Echo showed moderate pulm
   hypertension, LENIs showed no DVT (both were poor studies given pt
   body habitus). No longer on dopa or inotropic/chronotropic pressors.
   - currently not on any agents due to pt
s hemodynamic instability
   (hypotension)
   - hold on anti-coagulation given bleeding and thrombocytopenia
   - continue to follow on tele
   .
   # ARF: Renal failure was initially likely pre-renal given sepsis. It
   has progressed to ischemic ATN. Currently aniuric.
   - cont CVVH
   - CVVH dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u renal note.
   .
   # Altered Level of Consciousness: currently not on sedation. may have
   several causes including metabolic/toxic (acidosis, uremia, liver
   failure, sepsis, lactic acidosis) vs hypoxic brain injury vs
   intracranial hemorrhage.
   - can scan head later when more stable to evaluate for acute
   intracranial process / hypoxic injury
   - frequent neuro checks
   .
   #. DIC: Initially thought to have incresed PT/PTT, LDH.
   Thrombocytopenia (HIT negative at OSH). Fibrinogen elevated.  Platelets
   down to 10 yesterday, she was transfused 1 unit, w/ appropriate rise to
   40.  Currently back down to 14.
   -- transfuse 1 unit of platelets if <10
   --Stable DIC [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] cont to monitor and trend daily AM [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   --Will treat underlying sepsis and see if DIC improves.

   #. Anemia: Pt
s Hct currently improved at 29.
   - active T&C
   - check Hct q 6 hr
   - transfuse to Hct >25
   .
   #Abdominal striae with oozing fluid, total output ~3L. KUB done on [**8-17**]
   did not show anything.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory failure, who was admitted to the hospital with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is experiencing several medical complications.

1. Septic Shock: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pseudomonas infection. She has persistent tachycardia, fever, high respiratory rate, and a left shift in her blood counts. The source of infection could be respiratory, urinary, or a line infection. The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This is indicated by diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, and the patient requires high levels of oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to maintain adequate oxygenation.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has developed AKI, which is initially likely pre-renal due to sepsis. It has progressed to ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient is currently anuric and receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).

4. Altered Level of Consciousness: The patient's altered level of consciousness is due to several factors,"

   Assesment: This is a 55 year-old female with a history of COPD and
   respiratory failure, MAT/a-flutter, chronic steroid use, who was
   intially admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with MAT/a-fib, respiratory
   distress, intubated and treated for UTI.  Transferred in septic shock
   currently w/ multi-organ failure.
   Plan:
   .
   #. Septic Shock - Patient with persistent tachycardia, fever, high RR
   and left shift. Pt lactate elevated. Likely source is MDR pseudomonas
   from OSH cx respiratory, although urinary (OSH cx grew proteus) and
   line infection are possible. The patient has been at [**Hospital3 **] and
   resident of [**Hospital1 630**] so nosocomial infections are high on the
   differential. The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial.   CXR
   showed pna vs effusion vs pulm edema vs ARDS.
   Infection: Sources, MDR pseudomonas PNA, MRSA PNA leading to
   bacteremia; Proteus UTI is also consideration. She also has a h/o
   C.diff, and VRE. Abd U/S only showed subcu fluid collection.
   - Sputum (4+ GNR pseudomonas, 4+GPC MRSA in [**Hospital1 54**] culture, OSH culture
   showing pseudomonas) and blood (GNR in [**Hospital1 54**] sputum culture)
 amakacin
   and colistin (per ID)
   - amakacin peak and trough
   - growing coag pos staph in blood and h/o VRE
 change linezolid to
   vanco since unlikely VRE
   - cont treatment with amikacin given Proteus in urine and pseudomonas
   in sputum
   - D/C micafungin (per ID)
   - D/C flagyl
   - all meds are CVVH dosed
   - f/u cultures and speciation from blood
   - strict contact precautions
   - q6h WBC, trend fever curve
   Hemodynamics: likely due to infection, CVP 15. Initially gave albumin
   Levophed and Dopamine to maintain MAP > 65. Avoid Neo due to
   vasoconstrictive effects on limbs/organs.
   - cont CVVH for even fluid balance
   - on levofed / vasopressin at improved doses, continue to wean as
   infection
   Metabolic: Has chronic respiratory acidosis, AG metabolic acidosis due
   to lactic (from infx vs end organ ischemia, such as ?bowel ischemia,
   shock liver vs uremia) and slight non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
   (renal failure). With low pH on ABG, worry about cardiac asystole.
   Lactate now improved to 2.8
   - treating underlying infection (cause of septic shock) per above
   - q4h ABGs
   - Continue to trend lactate
   - currently on CVVHD with bicarb
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Pt with COPD and frequent admissions for
   respiratory failure. Failure due to multifocal PNA leading to ARDA
   (given sudden onset, P/F ratio<200, pulmonary edema), and fluid
   overload all in setting of chronic COPD and probably bronchiectatic
   lungs given PNA history in the past. She was initially admitted to and
   placed on BiPAP, but required intubtion after desat. CXR showed b/l
   diffuse infiltrates/effusions R>L.  ABGs show ventilation probable at
   pt
s baseline, but oxygenation is tenuous, requiring high levels of
   PEEP and 100% FIO2.
   - weaned to AC PEEP 14, tolerating well this AM, with improved pH, CO2,
   O2. pt may have been on noncompliant part of the curve and over-PEEPed
   right now and may have increased Zone I physiology. Goal today to wean
   FIO2 from 100% to prevent hyperoxygenation injury. Goal PaCO2 >60.
   - can consider decreasing RR later today as PaCO2 now in 40s (pt
   baseline probably >60)
   - cont treating infection as above
   - cont CVVH for fluid overload
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - cont hydrocort 100 q6h, consider tapering in upcoming days when
   decrease pressors
   - albuterol/ ipratropium nebs
   - q4h ABGs
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Pt with MAT/a-flutter on admision to OSH. Her rates on
   admission to [**Hospital1 54**] were as high as 150-180's.  She was started on amio
   (bolus 150mg, then 1mg/hr) due to hypotension nodal agents were
   deferred.  Her fast rate is likely contributing to her hypotension.
   She was previously controlled on po lopressor, dilt and dig. Sepsis and
   persistent fevers are likely the cause of her tachycardia. The patient
   has troponin leaks, likely due to demand ischemia. Was place on amio
   drip and cardioverted upon admission to sinus tach (130s) for which she
   has multiple likely causes. Received one dose of dig 0.125 w/ no
   response, level was 4.4 so it was dc
d. Echo showed moderate pulm
   hypertension, LENIs showed no DVT (both were poor studies given pt
   body habitus). No longer on dopa or inotropic/chronotropic pressors.
   - currently not on any agents due to pt
s hemodynamic instability
   (hypotension)
   - hold on anti-coagulation given bleeding and thrombocytopenia
   - continue to follow on tele
   .
   # ARF: Renal failure was initially likely pre-renal given sepsis. It
   has progressed to ischemic ATN. Currently aniuric.
   - cont CVVH
   - CVVH dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u renal note.
   .
   # Altered Level of Consciousness: currently not on sedation. may have
   several causes including metabolic/toxic (acidosis, uremia, liver
   failure, sepsis, lactic acidosis) vs hypoxic brain injury vs
   intracranial hemorrhage.
   - can scan head later when more stable to evaluate for acute
   intracranial process / hypoxic injury
   - frequent neuro checks
   .
   #. DIC: Initially thought to have incresed PT/PTT, LDH.
   Thrombocytopenia (HIT negative at OSH). Fibrinogen elevated.  Platelets
   down to 10 yesterday, she was transfused 1 unit, w/ appropriate rise to
   40.  Currently back down to 14.
   -- transfuse 1 unit of platelets if <10
   --Stable DIC [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] cont to monitor and trend daily AM [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   --Will treat underlying sepsis and see if DIC improves.
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt
s Hct currently improved at 29.
   - active T&C
   - check Hct q 6 hr
   - transfuse to Hct >25
   .
   #Abdominal striae with oozing fluid, total output ~3L. KUB done on [**8-17**]
   did not show anything.
   - will cont to monitor
   - will keep even I/O.

   #. IDDM: Pt on steriods.
   - cont ISS, have decreased [**Last Name (un) **] lantus from 24U q12 to 6U q12
   - monitor QACHS FS and cover with ISS.

   Disposition: ICU level of care
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of COPD, respiratory failure, chronic steroid use, and multiple comorbidities. She was admitted to the ICU with MAT/a-fib, respiratory distress, intubated, and treated for a urinary tract infection. The patient is currently experiencing septic shock with multi-organ failure, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and an altered level of consciousness.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is suffering from severe sepsis with signs of organ dysfunction. Immediate treatment is required to address the infection and prevent further deterioration.
2. Multi-organ Failure: The patient's kidneys, lungs, and possibly other organs are failing. Supportive care and interventions such as CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) may be necessary to manage these failures.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient has developed DIC, which is a serious condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body. Monitoring and managing coagulation parameters, platelet count, and transfusion requirements are crucial.
4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, a life-threatening condition that causes severe lung inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. Prone positioning, lung-protective ventilation strategies, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation"
