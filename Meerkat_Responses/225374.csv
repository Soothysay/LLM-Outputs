   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   Assessment and Plan: This is a 41 y.o. African American Male w/ OSA on
   CPAP, HTN, Asthma p/w fevers, SOB, hemoptysis, transferred to ICU for
   hypoxia, lobar consolidation.
   .
   ##. Hypoxia: Based on initial ABG, large A-a gradient noted. I suspect
   his hypoxia is due to a combination of hypoventilation as well as
   physiological shunt. Given pt's body habitus, h.o. of CPAP use suspect
   pt does have soem obesity hypoventilation syndrome. This coupled with
   his consolidation versus lobar collapse which provides a shunt is
   likely responsible for his A-a gradient and hypoxia. Pt transferred to
   the ICU given his hypoxia, CTA shows no large PE (would suspect large
   PE in case of such hypoxia).
   - will continue to monitor in the ICU
   - Pt cannot remember if was on BiPAP versus CPAP. Will set on autosat
   CPAP for now and monitor O2 sat. If pt continues to have problems with
   saturation will consider BiPAP versus intubation
   - given ?lobar consolidation and hypoxia will expand pt's abx coverage.
   Will d/c Vancoymcin and start on Ceftriaxone with Levofloxacin
   - will continue on Albuterol nebs q2hr PRN
   - will keep NPO overnight
   - check X-ray in the AM
   - will recheck ABG if respiratory status changes
   .
   ##. Hemoptysis: Pt was transferred from floor to ICU given concern of
   hemoptysis and hypoxia. On discussion with the pt hemoptysis has been 1
   tablespoon and occurs with his cough. Given low rate of blood flow
   suspect blood is from pulmonary circulation. On review of CT scan
   appears to be consolidation versus hemorrhage given heterogeneity.
   Hemoptysis likely from PNA, CTA already negative for P. Embolism,
   tumour burden. Although pt has history of Cocaine and Heroin use he
   denies any recent smoking of Cocaine. Pt not recently exposed to anyone
   with TB, has distant history of being in prison.
   - will continue to monitor amount of hemoptysis
   - will consider intubation for airway protection if gross hemoptysis
   - will continue on aforementioned abx Ceftriaxone/Levofloxacin
   - will continue on scheduled Benzonatate
   - will place PPD today
   - will consider possible bronchoscopy when pt's breathing status has
   improved
   .
   ##. Acuite Kidney Injury: Pt's Creatinine on admission elevated at 1.5
   but trending down, likely pre-renal due to increased insensible losses
   from fever.
   - Will monitor UOP
   - trend Creatinine
   .
   ##. HTN: Will continuie on home regimen of Clonidine,
   .
   ##. PSYCH: Pt has h.o. Bipolar d.o., depression, will continue on home
   regimen of Citalopram and Buproprion. Will hold off on Trazadone given
   pt's hypoxia.
   - will restart Trazadone when hypoxia improves
   .
   ##. OSA: Pt not sure if he is on CPAP versus BiPAP at home. Will
   continue on autoset CPAP at this time and advance pending pt's clinical
   respiratory status.
   .
   ##. FEN: Will keep NPO at night and give IVF PRN. Replete lytes PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old African American male with obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypertension, and asthma. He presented with fevers, shortness of breath, and hemoptysis. He was transferred to the ICU due to hypoxia and diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). His vital signs include a temperature of 37.9Â°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/79 to 161/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination revealed no peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, or neurologic assessment. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (287 K/uL), hemoglobin (11.6 g/dL), platelet count (214 mg/dL), creatinine (1.4 mg/dL), and glucose (214 mg/dL). The patient's imaging shows consolidation versus lobar collapse. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's initial ABG showed a large A-a gradient, suggesting hypoventilation as well as physiological shunt. This could be due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome and the presence of lobar consolidation providing a shunt.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient has been experiencing hemoptysis, which may be related to his pneumonia. It is important to monitor the amount of hemopt"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old African American male with a history of OSA on CPAP, hypertension, and asthma. He presented with fevers, shortness of breath, and hemoptysis, which led to his transfer to the ICU for hypoxia and lobar consolidation. Initial ABG showed a large A-a gradient, indicating hypoxia. The patient's body habitus and history of CPAP use suggest the possibility of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. A CT angiogram showed no pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently on CPAP and being treated for pneumonia with vancomycin and levofloxacin. Albuterol nebs are given every 2 hours as needed. The patient's hemoptysis has stopped, and a PPD has been placed to assess for tuberculosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's initial ABG showed a large A-a gradient, indicating severe hypoxia. This could be due to pneumonia, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, or a combination of both. Monitoring oxygen saturation and adjusting CPAP or mechanical ventilation as needed is crucial to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's admission creatinine level was elevated at 1.5, which has since trended down. AKI could be pre-renal due to increased insensible losses from fever. Close monitoring of urine output and trending creatinine levels is necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old man with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who is currently on BiPap and has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia. He did well overnight on CPAP but is now on a high-flow mask. The patient has experienced scant hemoptysis overnight. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.2Â°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/79 to 161/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 37 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in sinus rhythm, and his review of systems is unchanged from admission except for cough and dyspnea. Physical examination findings include diminished breath sounds throughout, right lower extremity edema absent, and left lower extremity edema absent. The patient appears comfortable and conversant. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with decreased hematocrit, creatinine, and potassium levels. The patient's assessment includes pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), hypoxemic respiratory failure, and hemoptysis. The plan involves continuing CTX and levofloxacin, monitoring for worsening symptoms, and considering restarting vancomycin if necessary. The patient's condition is critical, and he is expected to remain in the ICU."

   pt's body habitus, h.o. of CPAP use suspect pt does have some obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome, coupled with his PNA .  Pt transferred to the
   ICU given his hypoxia, CTA shows no PE.
   - felt well yesterday, eating well, but stayed on 80% facemask, unable
   to wean.
   - on CPAP overnight.
   - given lobar consolidation and hypoxia, treating with Levofloxacin
   - will continue on Albuterol nebs q2hr PRN
