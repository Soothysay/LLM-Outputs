   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 59F with mental retardation w/ recent dx of nodular
   sclerosing hodgkins lymphoma s/p modified EACOP, ileus,  now with
   febrile neutropenia and afib with RVR
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: In the setting of fever, went into afib
   with HRs as high as 180s and SBP in 80s. She has had difficult to
   control afib in the past on max dose esmolol and diltiazem drips and
   finally converted with amiodarone during her last ICU visit.  It is
   likley that she has converted back into afib with RVR in the setting of
   fever and possibly hypovolemia given her recent worsened ileus.
   - restart on amiodarone IV bolus and drip
   - Monitor ECG and specifically QTc
   - no anticoagulation given hemopericardium
   # Febrile neutropenia: Now s/p cytoxan, doxorubin, etoposide,
   dexamethasone and procarbazine (last [**7-29**]). CXR unchanged, UA negative
   and blood cultures pending
   - f/u cultures - GNR bacteremia
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - monitor PICC line
   # Ileus/abdominal distention: Has this history, requires intermittent
   rectal tube (now out given neutropenia). Last BM loose stool this AM
   - Appreciate GI recs
   - For now continue full liquids. Will continue to monitor abdomen and
   for flatulence or BM
   - repeat KUB if no improvement in distension
   - Replete lytes aggressively, TSH wnl
   - Will hold bowel regimen for now, stool softeners only
   - IVF
   - Will need colonoscopy when counts are improved
   # Hemopericardium: Moderate pericardial effusion per ECHO on [**7-17**]
   without evidence of tamponade. Hemodynamically stable. If develops
   persistent uncontrolled afib, discuss need to drain pericardial
   effusion with cards.
   - recheck ECHO
   - Monitor pulsus once rate better controlled
   # Hypoxia: Encasement of pulmonary artery and left main bronchus by
   mediastinal mass per CT at NWH. Also with SVC compression on CT here
   during last admission. Significant improvement in these symptoms
   post-chemo as her tumor is likely very chemoresponsive. [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   pericardial thrombus, but given hemopericardium, not able to start
   heparin.  Also, has bilateral pleural effusions.
   - Continue to monitor for decreased tumor burden, reduced PA
   compression
   - Continue steroids x total of 14 days
   - Continue supplemental oxygen as needed, will wean as tolerated
   # Lymphoma: NSHL as per pathology from supraclavicular LN biopsy. Stage
   2b at least per OMR note. Completed one cycle of modified regimen with
   cytoxan, etoposide and doxorubicin (C1D+10, procarbazine day +3 s/p 2
   doses). TL labs stable.
   - Continue decadron 20mg IV x14 days total, will discuss further
   treatment with team (like due for next cycle 21 days after C1)
   - Continue to monitor pericardial effusion as tumor shrinks
   - Cont allopurinol for now, will discuss length of treatment with BMT
   team
   - Restart Neupogen today, was held during procarbazine but will hold
   third dose of procarbazine today given rapid onset of neutropenia and
   GI disease.
   - PCP/HSV/VZV ppx to be started next week
   - Continue to follow ANC daily
   - Consider repeat CT Torso to further evaluate mediastinal mass/SVC
   compression in near future
   # Anemia: Chronic, iron deficiency anemia. Now s/p chemo Will continue
   to monitor.
   - Maintain Hct >25, plt >75 given hemopericardium
   - given hypotension and problems with third spacing fluid, would
   transfuse 1 unit pRBCs now
   # FEN: monitor lytes. neutropenic, liquid diet for now
   # Proph: bowel regimen, PPI, pneumoboots

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation and a recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma, status post modified EACOP. She is currently experiencing febrile neutropenia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB with RVR). The patient has a history of ileus, abdominal distention, and moderate bilateral effusions. She also has a hemopericardium due to a pericardial effusion and a mediastinal mass causing SVC compression. The patient is on various medications including antibiotics, antiarrhythmics, and chemotherapy drugs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFIB with RVR): The patient's history of difficult-to-control AFIB in the past, along with the current symptoms of fever and possible hypovolemia, increases the risk of recurrent AFIB with RVR. Close monitoring of ECG and QTc interval is necessary, and restarting amiodarone IV bolus and drip is recommended.

2. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient's recent chemotherapy treatment and low white blood cell count put her at high risk for infections. Blood cultures are pending, and she should continue on cefepime and vancomycin. Neutropenic precautions should be maintained, and the PICC line should be monitored.

3. Ileus/Abdominal Distention"
107962.0,243236,2144-08-01 07:18:00,Physician ,Physician Resident Progress Note,"Chief Complaint: Afib with RVR
   24 Hour Events: On arrival to the ICU the pt was given a 1L fluid bolus
   and spont converted to sinus rhythm. Pt was started on amiodarone gtt
   for atrial fibrillation, with the gtt she became bradycardic to the low
   40s. Amiodarone was stopped. The pt had contined loose stools
   overnight. She reverted back to a fib with rates in 110s and again
   converted back with IVF. She was found to have blood cultures with GNR
   and was started on flagyl for possible bowel source.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 59F with mental retardation w/ recent dx of nodular
   sclerosing hodgkins lymphoma s/p modified EACOP, ileus,  now with
   febrile neutropenia and afib with RVR
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: In the setting of fever, went into afib
   with HRs as high as 180s and SBP in 80s. She has had difficult to
   control afib in the past on max dose esmolol and diltiazem drips and
   finally converted with amiodarone during her last ICU visit.  It is
   likley that she has converted back into afib with RVR in the setting of
   fever and possibly hypovolemia given her recent worsened ileus.
   - restart on amiodarone IV bolus and drip
   - Monitor ECG and specifically QTc
   - no anticoagulation given hemopericardium
   # Febrile neutropenia: Now s/p cytoxan, doxorubin, etoposide,
   dexamethasone and procarbazine (last [**7-29**]). CXR unchanged, UA negative
   and blood cultures pending
   - f/u cultures - GNR bacteremia
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - monitor PICC line
   # Ileus/abdominal distention: Has this history, requires intermittent
   rectal tube (now out given neutropenia). Last BM loose stool this AM
   - Appreciate GI recs
   - For now continue full liquids. Will continue to monitor abdomen and
   for flatulence or BM
   - repeat KUB if no improvement in distension
   - Replete lytes aggressively, TSH wnl
   - Will hold bowel regimen for now, stool softeners only
   - IVF
   - Will need colonoscopy when counts are improved
   # Hemopericardium: Moderate pericardial effusion per ECHO on [**7-17**]
   without evidence of tamponade. Hemodynamically stable. If develops
   persistent uncontrolled afib, discuss need to drain pericardial
   effusion with cards.
   - recheck ECHO
   - Monitor pulsus once rate better controlled
   # Hypoxia: Encasement of pulmonary artery and left main bronchus by
   mediastinal mass per CT at NWH. Also with SVC compression on CT here
   during last admission. Significant improvement in these symptoms
   post-chemo as her tumor is likely very chemoresponsive. [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   pericardial thrombus, but given hemopericardium, not able to start
   heparin.  Also, has bilateral pleural effusions.
   - Continue to monitor for decreased tumor burden, reduced PA
   compression
   - Continue steroids x total of 14 days
   - Continue supplemental oxygen as needed, will wean as tolerated
   # Lymphoma: NSHL as per pathology from supraclavicular LN biopsy. Stage
   2b at least per OMR note. Completed one cycle of modified regimen with
   cytoxan, etoposide and doxorubicin (C1D+10, procarbazine day +3 s/p 2
   doses). TL labs stable.
   - Continue decadron 20mg IV x14 days total, will discuss further
   treatment with team (like due for next cycle 21 days after C1)
   - Continue to monitor pericardial effusion as tumor shrinks
   - Cont allopurinol for now, will discuss length of treatment with BMT
   team
   - Restart Neupogen today, was held during procarbazine but will hold
   third dose of procarbazine today given rapid onset of neutropenia and
   GI disease.
   - PCP/HSV/VZV ppx to be started next week
   - Continue to follow ANC daily
   - Consider repeat CT Torso to further evaluate mediastinal mass/SVC
   compression in near future
   # Anemia: Chronic, iron deficiency anemia. Now s/p chemo Will continue
   to monitor.
   - Maintain Hct >25, plt >75 given hemopericardium
   - given hypotension and problems with third spacing fluid, would
   transfuse 1 unit pRBCs now

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation, who has been diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma and has undergone modified EACOP treatment. She is currently admitted to the ICU with febrile neutropenia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR). The patient's medical history includes ileus, abdominal distention, hemopericardium, hypoxia, lymphoma, anemia, and chemotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient's history of difficult-to-control afib in the past and conversion back to afib with RVR suggests a potential complication of recurrent arrhythmia.
2. Febrile Neutropenia: Given the patient's recent chemotherapy and neutropenia, there is a risk of infection and sepsis.
3. Hemopericardium: The moderate pericardial effusion may lead to cardiac tamponade if it worsens, which can compromise cardiac output.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's previous SVC compression and pulmonary artery encasement by the mediastinal mass pose ongoing risks for respiratory compromise.
5. Ileus/Abdominal Distention: The patient's history of ileus and abdominal distention indicates the possibility of ongoing gastrointestinal issues, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
6. Anemia: The chronic iron deficiency anemia may wors"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation, recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma, post modified EACOP, ileus, now with febrile neutropenia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and bacteremia with gram-negative rods (GNR). She has a history of difficult-to-control AFib in the past and converted back to sinus rhythm after receiving IV fluids. She was started on amiodarone but experienced bradycardia and the medication was discontinued. She then converted back to AFib with RVR and was treated with IV fluids, which broke the arrhythmia. The patient also has a positive blood culture with GNR, likely due to a line-associated infection. 

Assessment and Plan:

1. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient is at high risk for stroke, and anticoagulation therapy is indicated. She should be transitioned to oral amiodarone for maintenance dosing once her bradycardia resolves. Close monitoring of the ECG and QTc interval is necessary.

2. Febrile neutropenia: The patient recently received chemotherapy with cytoxan, doxorubicin, etoposide, dexamethasone, and procarbazine. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) for suspected bacteremia"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 59F with mental retardation w/ recent dx of nodular
   sclerosing hodgkins lymphoma s/p modified EACOP, ileus,  now with
   febrile neutropenia and afib with RVR  in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR: In the setting of fever, went into afib
   with HRs as high as 180s and SBP in 80s. She has had difficult to
   control afib in the past on max dose esmolol and diltiazem drips and
   finally converted with amiodarone during her last ICU visit.  It is
   likley that she has converted back into afib with RVR in the setting of
   fever and possibly hypovolemia given her recent worsened ileus. Pt was
   converted to NSR after receiving 1L NS upon arrival to the ICU. She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt at 0.5mg/hr. Following the initiation of
   the gtt she became bradycardiac with HR in the low 40s and the gtt was
   discontinued. She converted back to Afib with RVR with HRs in the
   110s-120s which broke again following IVF bolus. In this setting she
   was found to have continued volume loss from diarrhea and a positive BC
   with GNR.
   - Given bradycardia with IV amiodarone infusion, transition to po
   amiodarone load with goal of 7gm prior to transitioning to maintenance
   dose. Will start 400mg [**Hospital1 **]. Pt received approx 90mg IV total yesterday
   with a 0.5mg/min rate X 3 hours.
   - Monitor ECG and specifically QTc
   - no anticoagulation given hemopericardium
   - continue metoprolol and uptitrate as BP allows
   .
   # Febrile neutropenia: Now s/p cytoxan, doxorubin, etoposide,
   dexamethasone and procarbazine (last [**7-29**]). CXR unchanged, UA negative.
   Blood cultures with
 bottles GNR
   - f/u cultures - GNR bacteremia
   - Given pt
s dilated colon and recent rectal tube placement
 bowel
   likely source for GNR bacteremia. Pt was started on flagyl
   - C. diff to be sent this am
   - continue cefepime and vancomycin as long as neutropenic
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - monitor PICC line
   - continue GCSF
    .
   # Ileus/abdominal distention: Has this history, requires intermittent
   rectal tube (now out given neutropenia). Last BM loose stool overnight
   - Appreciate GI recs
   - For now continue full liquids. Will continue to monitor abdomen and
   for flatulence or BM
   - repeat KUB daily to monitor dilated bowel
   - Replete lytes aggressively, TSH wnl
   - IVF to keep up with diarrhea and insensible losses
   - Will need colonoscopy when counts are improved
   .
   # Hemopericardium: Moderate pericardial effusion per ECHO on [**7-17**]
   without evidence of tamponade. Hemodynamically stable. If develops
   persistent uncontrolled afib, discuss need to drain pericardial
   effusion with cards.
   - recheck ECHO
   - Pulses following conversion to NSR - 4
   .
   # Hypoxia: Encasement of pulmonary artery and left main bronchus by
   mediastinal mass per CT at NWH. Also with SVC compression on CT here
   during last admission. Significant improvement in these symptoms
   post-chemo as her tumor is likely very chemoresponsive. [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   pericardial thrombus, but given hemopericardium, not able to start
   heparin.  Also, has bilateral pleural effusions.
   - Continue to monitor for decreased tumor burden, reduced PA
   compression
   - Continue steroids x total of 14 days
   - Continue supplemental oxygen as needed, will wean as tolerated
   .
   # Lymphoma: NSHL as per pathology from supraclavicular LN biopsy. Stage
   2b at least per OMR note. Completed one cycle of modified regimen with
   cytoxan, etoposide and doxorubicin (C1D+10, procarbazine day +3 s/p 2
   doses). TL labs stable.
   - Continue decadron 20mg IV x14 days total, will discuss further
   treatment with team (like due for next cycle 21 days after C1)
   - Continue to monitor pericardial effusion as tumor shrinks
   - Cont allopurinol for now, will discuss length of treatment with BMT
   team
   - Restarted Neupogen [**7-31**], was held during procarbazine but will hold
   third dose of procarbazine today given rapid onset of neutropenia and
   GI disease.
   - PCP/HSV/VZV ppx to be started next week
   - Continue to follow ANC daily
   - Consider repeat CT Torso to further evaluate mediastinal mass/SVC
   compression in future
   .
   # Anemia: Chronic, iron deficiency anemia. Now s/p chemo Will continue
   to monitor.
   - Maintain Hct >25, plt >75 given hemopericardium  - received 2U PRBC
   and 1bag plts since transfer

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation who has recently been diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma and has undergone modified EACOP chemotherapy. She presented with febrile neutropenia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and bacteremia caused by Gram-negative rods (GNR). 

The patient was initially given a fluid bolus and converted to sinus rhythm. She was started on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation but became bradycardic and the medication was discontinued. She converted back to atrial fibrillation with rates in the 110s-120s after receiving intravenous fluids. 

Blood cultures revealed GNR bacteremia, and the patient was started on Flagyl due to a possible bowel source. Her ileus and abdominal distention have been ongoing, and she has a history of these symptoms. 

The patient also has a moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade. She is hypoxia-prone due to encasement of the pulmonary artery and left main bronchus by mediastinal mass, as well as SVC compression. 

The patient has been diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma and has completed one cycle of modified chemotherapy. Her labs are stable, and she will continue with ongoing treatment plans.

   59 yo F with MR, HD, and [**Hospital 3282**] transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with febrile
   neutropenia and AF with RVR.
   1.) AF with RVR: In and out of AF overnight.  Bradycardia with IV amio
   overnight.
   -Will try po Amio load to avoid bradycardia and Qt prolongation.  I f
   poor tolerance or hypotension to PO amio would try digoxin.
   -Check echo to assess pericardial effusion.  Pulsus is 4 at present.
   -Holding on anticoagulation given bloody nature of her pericardial
   effusion
   2.) Febrile Neutropenia:  No clear localizing signs or symptoms.
   Potenial sources include PNA, PICC infection, colitis/translocation of
   bacteria.  Abdominal exam not concerning at present.  BCx with 1/4 GNR.
   -Follow up pan-Cx including C diff
   -Vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl  for now.
   -Serial abdominal exams, though may be unrevealing given steroid
   regimen.  Low threshold for abd ct if change in hemodynamic perameters
   or clinical status given cx data.
   -Will keep PICC line in place for now
   3.) Pericardial effusion:
       -Echo as above
       -Platelet goal >75k per oncology.  Will transfuse today.
   4.) Ileus: Appears at baseline at present.
   -Will monitor with serial abd exams.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) and febrile neutropenia. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/43 mmHg to 112/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's physical examination revealed a well-nourished appearance, diaphoresis, normal heart sounds, crackles at the bases of the lungs, and distended abdomen. The patient's laboratory results showed leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 3.3 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 62 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 6.9 mmol/L, and elevated D-dimer level of 752 ng/mL. Imaging studies showed marked colonic dilation. Microbiology results indicated the presence of a gram-negative rod bacterium. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AF with RVR: The patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response overnight and bradycardia with intravenous amiodarone. The plan is to try oral amiodarone loading to avoid bradycardia and QT prolongation. If"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of malignancy, who was admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) and febrile neutropenia. The patient had been treated with intravenous fluids (IVF) and amiodarone, but experienced bradycardia and the amiodarone was stopped. The patient then went into AF with RVR again and received IVF resuscitation overnight. Blood cultures showed 1/4+ growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR). The patient is well-nourished and diaphoretic, with normal oxygen saturation on nasal cannula. Vital signs are stable, but the patient has a distended abdomen and crackles at the bases of the lungs. Lab results indicate anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and elevated D-dimer. Imaging shows marked colonic dilation. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole for febrile neutropenia, and will have a follow-up pan-culture including Clostridium difficile. The patient's condition requires close monitoring due to potential complications such as pericardial effusion, ileus, and sepsis."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 59F with mental retardation w/ recent dx of nodular
   sclerosing hodgkins lymphoma s/p modified EACOP, ileus,  now with
   febrile neutropenia and afib with RVR  in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
   -now in sinus with rhythm control - on amiodarone- EKG to check QTc
   -400mg po bid of amio - last day [**8-7**] then switch to amio 200mg daily
   (initial IV load then PO load x 1 week)
   -RVR possibly related to GNR bacteremia
   -currently in sinus x 24hrs
   - continue metoprolol and uptitrate as BP allows (currently on 25mg po
   tid)
   # Febrile neutropenia: Now s/p cytoxan, doxorubin, etoposide,
   dexamethasone and procarbazine (last [**7-29**])
   CXR unchanged, UA negative. Blood cultures with
 bottles GNR
   -continue dex until [**8-7**]
   -GNR bacteremia 2/4 bottles, sensitive to cipro, urine with e coli.
   GNR in blood two different morphologies
   -f/u cultures for further speciation and sensitivities
   -repeat blood cultures today
   -urine w/ e coli but u/a negative
   -if diarrhea send c diff
   -d/c vanc, given two morphologies of GNR in blood possibly related to
   gut translocation and given gut translocation likely polymicrobial
   infection so would continue cefepime as well as cover anaerobes with
   flagyl.
   - Neutropenic precautions
   - monitor PICC line
   - continue GCSF
   # Ileus/abdominal distention: Has this history, requires intermittent
   rectal tube (now out given neutropenia).
   - For now continue full liquids advance diet to neutropenic diet as
   tolerated
   - repeat KUB daily to monitor dilated bowel
   - Replete lytes aggressively, TSH wnl
   - Will need colonoscopy when counts are improved
   -surgery consult re: rectal tube and management of colonic distention.
   d/w BMT rectal tube as well given neutropenia (however already on
   coverage for GNR and anaerobes so may not place her at substantially
   increased risk)
   # Hemopericardium: Moderate pericardial effusion per ECHO on [**7-17**]
   without evidence of tamponade. Hemodynamically stable
   - recheck ECHO
   - Pulses following conversion to NSR
   -contraindication to anticoagulation
   # Hypoxia: related to tumor compression of pulmonary arteries and L
   main bronchus.
   -also SVC encasement
   -monitor for improvement given treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma
   -steroids x 14 days
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   # Lymphoma: NSHL as per pathology from supraclavicular LN biopsy. Stage
   2b at least per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1422**].
   -s/p cytoxan, etoposide, doxarubacin and dex note.
   - Cont allopurinol for now, will discuss length of treatment with BMT
   team
   - Restarted Neupogen [**7-31**].
   - PCP/HSV/VZV ppx to be started next week , d/w BMT need for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **]
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Continue to follow ANC daily
   - Consider repeat CT Torso to further evaluate mediastinal mass/SVC
   compression in future
   # Anemia: Chronic, iron deficiency anemia. Now s/p chemo Will continue
   to monitor.
   - Maintain Hct >25, plt >75 given hemopericardium  - received 2U PRBC
   and 1bag plts since transfer
   # FEN: monitor lytes. neutropenic, liquid diet for now
   # Proph: bowel regimen, PPI, pneumoboots

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation who has been diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma following modified EACOP chemotherapy. She presented with febrile neutropenia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the setting of gram-negative bacterial bacteremia.

The patient's medical history includes ileus, recent chemotherapy treatment, and a previous diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma. She has multiple complications such as atrial fibrillation with RVR, febrile neutropenia, hypoxia, hemopericardium, lymphoma, anemia, and ileus.

The patient is currently being treated with amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, cytoxan, doxorubicin, etoposide, dexamethasone, and procarbazine for lymphoma, ciprofloxacin for gram-negative bacterial bacteremia, and Flagyl for anaerobic coverage. She is also receiving G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) to stimulate the production of white blood cells and is on a liquid diet due to neutropenic precautions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 108/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo F with MR, HD, and [**Hospital 3282**] transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with febrile
   neutropenia and AF with RVR.
   1.) AF with RVR: Has remained in SR for 24 hours, currently on po amio
   and lopressor
   -Continue PO amio load and monitor QT.  Goal will be for a 7g load.
   -Check echo to assess pericardial effusion.
   -Holding on anticoagulation given bloody nature of her pericardial
   effusion
    2.) Febrile Neutropenia:  No clear localizing signs or symptoms.
   Likely source is gut translocation vs UTI.  Abdominal exam not
   concerning at present but is very distended.  BCx with 1/4 GNR of 2
   different morphologies suggestive of possible gut translocation.
   -Follow up culture sensitivites.  Awaiting C diff
   -D/C vanc, continue cefepime/flagyl.
   -Serial abdominal exams, though may be unrevealing given steroid
   regimen.  Low threshold for abd ct if change in hemodynamic perameters
   or clinical status given cx data.
   -Will ask surgery to evaluate abdomen given risk of perforation.
   -Will keep PICC line in place for now
    3.) Pericardial effusion:
   -Echo as above
   -Platelet goal >75k per oncology, 112k today.
    4.) Ileus: Appears at baseline at present.
   -Will monitor with serial abd exams.
   -Surgical eval
   -Will discuss with surgery and BMT regarding if rectal tube is
   reasonable, as already on broad abx.
   -Full liquid diet, ADAT
    5.) HD:  Further chemo plans per oncology
   -Currently on Dexamethasone Daily until [**8-4**].
   -Will discuss with oncology service regarding any need for prophylactic
   abx regimen

","The patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of multiple myeloma, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. She was admitted to the ICU with febrile neutropenia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR). The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. Her EKG shows sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including cefepime, metronidazole, and vancomycin. She is also on dexamethasone, amiodarone, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The review of systems is negative for chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

The physical examination reveals a well-nourished, pale appearance with normal breath sounds and symmetric chest expansion. The patient's abdomen is soft, with bowel sounds present, but distended. No tenderness is noted. Distended abdomen is a new finding. Extremities show 1+ edema bilaterally. Neurologic examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory findings include a white blood cell count of 5.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, platelet count of 237 K/uL, creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL, glucose of 162 mg/dL, and sodium of 139 mEq/L. Blood cultures show growth of Gram-negative rods of two different morphologies, and urinalysis is negative.

Imaging reveals increasing colonic distention. The assessment and plan include management of AF with RVR, febrile neutropenia, pericardial effusion, ileus, and hemodynamic stabilization. The patient will continue on amiodarone and lopressor for AF with RVR, with monitoring for QT prolongation. An echocardiogram will be performed to assess pericardial effusion. Anticoagulation will be held due to the bloody nature of the effusion. 

For febrile neutropenia, the likely source is gut translocation or urinary tract infection. The patient will have follow-up cultures and continue with cefepime and flagyl. Serial abdominal exams will be performed, and low threshold for abdominal CT if there is a change in hemodynamic parameters or clinical status. The patient will also be evaluated by surgery for possible abdominal intervention.

Regarding the pericardial effusion, an echo will be performed, and platelet count will be monitored to maintain a goal of >75k. The patient appears to have an ileus, which will be monitored with serial abdominal exams. Surgical evaluation will also be sought.

The patient is currently on dexamethasone daily until August 4th, and further chemotherapy plans will be discussed with the oncology service. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be transferred to the floor upon improvement."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation who has been diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma after undergoing modified EACOP treatment. She is currently experiencing febrile neutropenia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), ileus, and hypoxia. The patient has a history of chronic iron deficiency anemia and is undergoing chemotherapy.

The patient's recent events include being called out to the BMT but given abdominal distention instead, leading to her being kept in the ICU. She underwent a CT abdomen/pelvis and was found to have rapid atrial fibrillation with RVR upon return. Lopressor was administered intravenously with some effect, and her oral lopressor was slowly increased. An attempt to give 10 mg of diltiazem intravenously was unsuccessful as the patient flipped back into atrial fibrillation.

The patient has allergies to no known drugs. She has been receiving various medications including metoprolol, diltiazem, lopressor, and others. Her vital signs show an increased heart rate (132 bpm) and blood pressure (120/82 mmHg). Oxygen saturation is at 94%. The patient's heart rhythm remains in atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 5,042 mL and total output of 1,075 mL since 12 AM. The patient's respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation who has been diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma, post-modified EACOP. She presented with febrile neutropenia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and gastrointestinal ileus. The patient's current medications include amiodarone, lopressor, cefepime, flagyl, dexamethasone, cytoxan, doxorubicin, etoposide, and procarbazine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient is on amiodarone load and will continue to monitor for response. If the RVR persists or worsens, further interventions such as increasing the dose of lopressor or attempting a fluid bolus may be necessary.
2. Febrile neutropenia: The patient has already received chemotherapy and is currently on cefepime and flagyl. It is important to continue monitoring her white blood cell count and repeat cultures to ensure appropriate management.
3. Ileus/abdominal distention: The patient's ileus appears to have improved with the use of a rectal tube. However, it is important to continue monitoring for any worsening of symptoms or signs of perforation. Daily KUB and serial abdominal exams should be conducted, and a final CT read should be obtained. Repletion of"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 59F with mental retardation w/ recent dx of nodular
   sclerosing hodgkins lymphoma s/p modified EACOP, ileus,  now with
   febrile neutropenia and afib with RVR  in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
   -paroxysmal
   -on amio load
   -400mg po bid, continue x 2 weeks then decrease to 200mg daily
   maintenance
   -check QTc in 1 week
   -RVR possibly related to GNR bacteremia,
    -currently on 50mg po qid lopressor - uptitrate
   -attempt fluid bolus this a.m. but 4L + yesterday so unlikely dry but
   monitor for response, attempt 10mg IV dilt x 1 to see if responds
   better to CCBs
   # Febrile neutropenia: Now s/p cytoxan, doxorubin, etoposide,
   dexamethasone and procarbazine (last [**7-29**])
   -ANC greater than 1000
   -check w/ BMT duration of GCSF
   -f/u CXR and repeat cultures
   -2 GNR in blood, f/u sensitivities of both, call micro lab to see if
   sensitivities on culture of GNR are for both GNRs
   -continue cefepime and flagyl
   -continue dex until [**8-7**]
   -repeat blood cultures today
   -if diarrhea send c diff
   - monitor PICC line
   # Ileus/abdominal distention:
   -improved with rectal tube
   -f/u final CT read
   -daily KUB and serial abdominal exams to evaluate for worsening
   distention and for perforation
   -per surgery CT scan shows mostly dilated stomach, may benefit from NG
   tube but would not likely change her colonic perforation risk, so will
   hold off on this as patient will unlikely tolerate this.
   -Replete lytes aggressively
   -f/u surgery recs if any
   # Hemopericardium: Moderate pericardial effusion per ECHO on [**7-17**]
   without evidence of tamponade. Hemodynamically stable
   - recheck ECHO
   -contraindication to anticoagulation
   # Hypoxia: related to tumor compression of pulmonary arteries and L
   main bronchus.
   -also SVC encasement
   -monitor for improvement given treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma
   -steroids x 14 days
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   # Lymphoma: NSHL as per pathology from supraclavicular LN biopsy. Stage
   2b at least per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1422**].
   -s/p cytoxan, etoposide, doxarubacin and dex note.
   - d/c allopurinol
   -will need ppx for PCP / HSV / VZV per BMT team
   -daily ANC
   # Anemia: Chronic, iron deficiency anemia. Now s/p chemo Will continue
   to monitor.
   - Maintain Hct >25, plt >75 given hemopericardium
   # FEN: monitor lytes. neutropenic, liquid diet for now
   # Proph: bowel regimen, PPI, pneumoboots

","The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation, recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma status post modified EACOP, ileus, febrile neutropenia, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the setting of gram-negative bacteremia. 

Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with RVR, which may be related to the GNR bacteremia.
- The patient is currently on amiodarone 400mg po bid, and it will be continued for 2 weeks then decreased to 200mg daily maintenance.
- The patient's RVR is not responding to metoprolol 50mg po qid, so an attempt to uptitrate and try diltiazem 10mg IV x 1 will be made.
- The patient has febrile neutropenia and has received cytoxan, doxorubicin, etoposide, dexamethasone, and procarbazine (last dose on [**7-29**]).
- The patient's ANC is greater than 1000, and GCSF will be checked with BMT. Repeat cultures will be done, and sensitivities of both GNRs will be obtained.
- The patient is currently on cefepime and flagyl, and dex will be continued until [**8-7**].
- Repeat blood cultures will be done today, and if diarrhea occurs, a C. difficile test will be performed.
- The patient's ileus and abdominal distention have improved with a rectal tube.
- A CT scan shows mostly dilated stomach, and an NG tube may benefit the patient, but it would not likely change the colonic perforation risk, so it will be held off.
- The patient's electrolytes should be monitored and repleted aggressively.
- The patient has a moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade, and a recheck echo will be done.
- The patient is contraindicated for anticoagulation.
- The patient has hypoxia due to tumor compression of the pulmonary arteries and left main bronchus.
- The patient's lymphoma is nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma, stage 2b at least, per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1422**].
- The patient has received cytoxan, etoposide, doxorubicin, and dex.
- Allopurinol will be discontinued.
- The patient will need prophylaxis for PCP/HSV/VZV per BMT team.
- The patient's anemia is chronic, iron deficiency anemia, and it will be monitored.
- The patient's platelet count should be maintained above 75K due to hemopericardium.
- The patient is neutrop"

   with febrile neutropenia and AF with RVR.
   1.) AF with RVR: in AF with RVR, currently on po amio and lopressor
   -Continue PO amio load and monitor QT.  Goal will be for a 7g load.
   -Consider adding digoxin
   -Holding on anticoagulation given bloody nature of her pericardial
   effusion
    2.) Febrile Neutropenia:  No clear localizing signs or symptoms.
   Likely source is gut translocation vs UTI.  Abdominal exam not
   concerning at present but is very distended.  BCx with 1/4 GNR of 2

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old woman with mental retardation (MR), Hodgkin's disease, and currently experiencing febrile neutropenia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 113 bpm with AFib, blood pressure ranging from 115/66 mmHg to 136/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. 

The patient has been on amiodarone for AFib and metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control. She has been receiving cefepime, flagyl, vancomycin, and metronidazole for febrile neutropenia. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count of 5.5, hemoglobin (Hct) of 27.4%, platelet count of 237,000, creatinine (Cr) of 0.3, total carbon dioxide (TCO2) of 40, blood glucose of 162, and other lab values within normal ranges. 

Imaging shows a distended bowel, and microbiology reveals bacteria positive for two different gram-negative rods and E. coli in the urine.

   This is a 59F with mental retardation w/ recent dx of nodular
   sclerosing hodgkins lymphoma s/p modified EACOP, ileus,  now with
   febrile neutropenia and afib with RVR  in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR:
   -paroxysmal
   - IV amiodorone load.
   - Check EKG
   -RVR possibly related to GNR bacteremia,
    -currently on 50mg po qid lopressor
 consider uptitrating.
   - Check ABG
   # Febrile neutropenia: Now s/p cytoxan, doxorubin, etoposide,
   dexamethasone and procarbazine (last [**7-29**])
   -ANC greater than 1000
   -check w/ BMT duration of GCSF
   -f/u CXR and repeat cultures
   -2 GNR in blood, f/u sensitivities of both, call micro lab to see if
   sensitivities on culture of GNR are for both GNRs
   -continue cefepime and flagyl
   -continue dex until [**8-7**]
   -repeat blood cultures today
   -if diarrhea send c diff
   - monitor PICC line
   # Ileus/abdominal distention:
   -Worse today. Rectal tube is not draining appropriately due to stool
   thickness.
   -f/u final CT read
   -daily KUB and serial abdominal exams to evaluate for worsening
   distention and for perforation
   -Replete lytes aggressively
   -f/u surgery recs if any
   # Hemopericardium: Moderate pericardial effusion per ECHO on [**7-17**]
   without evidence of tamponade. Hemodynamically stable
   - ECHO today
   -contraindication to anticoagulation
   # Hypoxia: related to tumor compression of pulmonary arteries and L
   main bronchus.
   -also SVC encasement
   -monitor for improvement given treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma
   -steroids x 14 days
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   # Lymphoma: NSHL as per pathology from supraclavicular LN biopsy. Stage
   2b at least per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1422**].
   -s/p cytoxan, etoposide, doxarubacin and dex note.
   - d/c allopurinol
   -will need ppx for PCP / HSV / VZV per BMT team
   -daily ANC
   # Urine culture: [**7-31**] grew out yeast.  Plan to recheck when Foley was
   placed and change out if necessary.
   # Anemia: Chronic, iron deficiency anemia. Now s/p chemo Will continue
   to monitor.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation, recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma, and history of ileus.
- She is currently admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and generalized necrotizing encephalopathy (GNR) bacteremia.
- The patient is receiving chemotherapy and has undergone modified EACOP treatment.
- She is experiencing an ileus with abdominal distention and worsening stool thickness, making rectal tube drainage difficult.
- There is a moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade, contraindicating anticoagulation.
- The patient has chronic iron deficiency anemia and yeast infection in her urine culture.
- She is on a liquid diet and being monitored for electrolyte imbalances, neutropenia, and potential prophylaxis for bowel regimen, PPI, and pneumoboots.
- Code status is full code, and disposition is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Febrile neutropenia: The patient is at risk for complications associated with febrile neutropenia, such as sepsis, multi-organ failure, and increased mortality.
2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's rapid ventricular response increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, and potential heart"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 59F with mental retardation w/ recent dx of nodular
   sclerosing hodgkins lymphoma s/p modified EACOP, ileus,  now with
   febrile neutropenia and afib with RVR  in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR (paroxysmal): IV amiodarone load was
   successful yesterday in keeping HR in the mid 80s as patient was in
   sinus rhythm overnight. During rounds, the patient displayed a HR in
   the 150s to 180s.
   - Restart PO amiodarone load at 400mg [**Hospital1 **].
   - Give Digoxin IV with 0.5 mg intially followed by 0.25 mg dose at 6
   and 12 hours following initial dose.
   - Check EKG with new tachycardia run.
   # Febrile neutropenia (s/p cytoxan, doxorubin, etoposide, dexamethasone
   and procarbazine (last [**7-29**])): Patient has been afebrile in last 24
   hours and no longer has neutropenia.
   - Check w/ BMT duration of GCSF
   - f/u CXR and repeat cultures
   -GNR in blood are susceptible to current antibiotic regimen. Continue
   Cefipime, Metronidazole, and Vancomycin
   - monitor PICC line
   # Ileus/abdominal distention: Worse today. Unlikely due to c. diff
   given negative assay; however, should repeat c. diff toxin assay.
   - Rectal tube is not draining appropriately due to stool thickness and
   has been removed. Per surgery recs, rectal tube should be replaced and
   should be flushed with saline or gastrografin to prevent plugging with
   thick stool.
   -Daily KUB and serial abdominal exams to evaluate for worsening
   distention and for perforation
   -Replete lytes aggressively
   # Hemopericardium: ECHO shows residual, but improved hemopericardium.
   Likely not contributing significantly to current overall status.
   # Hypoxia: related to tumor compression of pulmonary arteries and L
   main bronchus.
   -also SVC encasement
   -monitor for improvement given treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma
   -steroids x 14 days (last dose on [**8-7**])
   -wean O2 as tolerated
   # Lymphoma: NSHL as per pathology from supraclavicular LN biopsy. Stage
   2b at least per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1422**].
   -s/p cytoxan, etoposide, doxarubacin and dex note.
   - d/c allopurinol
   -will need ppx for PCP / HSV / VZV per BMT team
   -daily ANC
   # Urine culture: [**7-31**] grew out yeast.  Plan to recheck when Foley was
   placed and change out if necessary.
   # Anemia: Chronic, iron deficiency anemia. Now s/p chemo Will continue
   to monitor.
   - Maintain Hct >25, plt >75 given hemopericardium

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation, recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma, status post modified EACOP, ileus, febrile neutropenia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and GNR bacteremia. The patient has a history of chemotherapy and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient is on amiodarone and digoxin to manage this condition. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rate and rhythm regularly.
2. Febrile neutropenia: The patient had an episode of febrile neutropenia but is currently afebrile and no longer neutropenic. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's temperature and white blood cell count. Cultures should be repeated, and the antibiotic regimen should be continued as it covers the GNR bacteremia.
3. Ileus/abdominal distention: The patient's abdominal distention has worsened, and there is concern for possible c. difficile infection despite a negative assay. Repeat testing for c. difficile toxin is recommended. A rectal tube should be replaced, and saline or gastrografin should be used to flush it to prevent plugging with thick stool. Daily KUB and serial abdominal exams are needed to evaluate for worsening distention and perforation.
4. Hemopericardium: An"

   not concerning at present but is very distended.  BCx with 1/4 GNR
   ecoli, enterobacter covered by Cefopime
    C diff - neg
    -continue cefepime/flagyl
    -Serial abdominal exams, though may be unrevealing given steroid
   regimen.  Low threshold for abd ct if change in hemodynamic perameters
   or clinical status given cx data.
    -KUB this AM
   -Will keep PICC line in place for now
    3.) Pericardial effusion:
   -Echo as above
   -Platelet goal >75k per oncology, 190k today.
    4.) Ileus: KUB with increaed colonic dilation and abd exam more
   distended
    -Will monitor with serial abd exams, daily KUB.
   -Full liquid diet, ADAT

   This is a 59F with mental retardation w/ recent dx of nodular
   sclerosing hodgkins lymphoma s/p modified EACOP, ileus,  now with
   febrile neutropenia and afib with RVR  in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR (paroxysmal): IV amiodarone load was
   successful yesterday in keeping HR in the mid 80s as patient was in
   sinus rhythm overnight. During rounds, the patient displayed a HR in
   the 150s to 180s.
   - Reinitiation IV Amiodarone loading at 0.5 mg/min for a total infusion
   of 1 g. (Approx 33 hours)
   - Hold Digoxin now per cardiology. F/U on digoxin levels reveals level
   of 1.0, which is within therapeutic range.
   - Check EKG with new tachycardia run.
   # Febrile neutropenia (s/p cytoxan, doxorubin, etoposide, dexamethasone
   and procarbazine (last [**7-29**])): Patient has been afebrile in last 24
   hours and no longer has neutropenia.
   - f/u CXR and repeat cultures
   -GNR in blood are susceptible to current antibiotic regimen. Continue
   Cefipime, Metronidazole, and Vancomycin.
   - monitor PICC line
   # Ileus/abdominal distention: Much better this AM than yesterday AM.
   Should continue bowel decompression by way of rectal tube.
   - Rectal tube has been reinserted. Will need to keep tube in and flush
   as needed with saline if stool becomes too thick to pass through tube..
   -Daily KUB and serial abdominal exams to evaluate for worsening
   distention and for perforation.
   -Replete lytes aggressively per sliding scale orders.
   # Hemopericardium: ECHO shows residual, but improved hemopericardium.
   Likely not contributing significantly to current overall status.
   # Hypoxia: Existed pre-admission and is likely related to tumor
   compression of pulmonary arteries and L main bronchus.
   - Monitor for improvement given treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma
   - Dexamethasone dosing has been completed.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   # Lymphoma: NSHL as per pathology from supraclavicular LN biopsy. Stage
   2b at least per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1422**].
   -s/p cytoxan, etoposide, doxarubacin and dex note.
   -will need ppx for PCP / HSV / VZV per BMT team
   -daily ANC
   # Urine culture: [**7-31**] grew out yeast.
   # Anemia: Chronic, iron deficiency anemia. Now s/p chemo. Will continue

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation who has been diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma after undergoing modified EACOP treatment.
- She presented with febrile neutropenia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) in the setting of gram-negative bacteremia.
- The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with improvements and setbacks. She has undergone various interventions and treatments.
- Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 139/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89% on high-flow nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient's irregular heartbeat increases the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure. It is important to closely monitor her heart rhythm and manage any associated symptoms.
2. Febrile Neutropenia: The patient's low white blood cell count makes her more susceptible to infections. Close monitoring of fever and prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics are crucial to prevent complications.
3. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient's abdominal pain, dist"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation who has been diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma and underwent modified EACOP chemotherapy. She presents with febrile neutropenia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in the setting of gram-negative bacteremia. The patient also has an ileus, chronic iron deficiency anemia, and yeast in her urine culture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's heart rate is currently in the 150s to 180s, indicating uncontrolled atrial fibrillation. This can lead to inadequate cardiac output, hypotension, and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Febrile neutropenia: The patient is at high risk for infections due to her neutropenic state. Infection can progress rapidly and lead to sepsis, multiorgan failure, and death.
3. Ileus: The worsening abdominal distention suggests a possible progression of the ileus, which can lead to bowel ischemia, perforation, and peritonitis.
4. GNR bacteremia: The presence of gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock.
5. Hypoxia: The patient's tumor compression of pulmonary arteries and left main bronchus may worsen her respiratory function and lead to further hypoxia.
6. Lymphoma progression: Despite ongoing treatment, there is a risk"

   59 yo F with MR, Hodgkin's Disease, and [**Hospital 3282**] transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   with febrile neutropenia and AF with RVR.
   1.) AF with RVR: in AF with controlled rate currently on IV amio and
   digoxin
    -Holding on anticoagulation given bloody nature of her pericardial
   effusion
   2.) ID -  Likely source is gut translocation vs UTI.  Abdominal exam
   concerning at present but is very distended.  BCx with 1/4 GNR ecoli,
   enterobacter covered by Cefopime
     -continue cefepime/flagyl
    -Serial abdominal exams, though may be unrevealing given steroid
   regimen.  Low threshold for abd ct if change in hemodynamic perameters
   or clinical status given cx data.
   -Will keep PICC line in place for now
    3.) Pericardial effusion:
   -Platelet goal >75k per oncology, 332k today.
    4.) Ileus - improved today colonic dilation after rectal tube placed.
     -Will monitor with serial abd exams, daily KUB.
   -Full liquid diet as tolerated
      5.) HD:  Further chemo plans per oncology

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of Hodgkin's disease, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF/RVR), and multiple comorbidities. She was admitted to the ICU with febrile neutropenia and AF/RVR.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) status.
- She is critically ill and has ongoing issues with ileus, pericardial effusion, and febrile neutropenia.
- She is currently on IV amiodarone and digoxin for rate control of AF/RVR.
- Her abdominal exam is concerning, with distention and colonic dilation.
- She has a pericardial effusion and her platelet count is elevated.
- She is receiving antibiotics for suspected gut translocation or urinary tract infection.
- The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AF/RVR with uncontrolled rate: The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently being managed with IV amiodarone and digoxin. However, there is a risk of complications associated with AF/RVR, such as hemodynamic instability, thromboembolic events, and increased risk of stroke.
2. Febrile neutropenia: The patient's low white blood cell count and fever increase the risk of infection and sepsis. Prompt identification and treatment of infections are crucial to prevent complications"

   decrease appeared to correlate to dosing with 25 mg Metoprolol.
   - Continuation of Amiodarone IV load 0.5 mg/min for total of ~33 hours
   to reach goal of 1 gram.
   - Increased Metoprolo dose from 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 25 mg TID.
   - EKG Check EKG this AM to evaluate QT interval while on continued
   amiodarone. EKG comparison yesterday showed QTc of 405 both prior to
   and 6 hours after restarting amiodarone IV load.
   # Febrile neutropenia (s/p cytoxan, doxorubin, etoposide, dexamethasone
   and procarbazine (last [**7-29**])): Patient has been afebrile in last 24
   hours and no longer has neutropenia.
   - f/u CXR and repeat cultures
   -GNR in blood are susceptible to current antibiotic regimen. Continue
   Cefipime, Metronidazole, and Vancomycin.
   - Monitor PICC line
   # Ileus/abdominal distention: Exam is not significantly changed since
   yesterday AM.
   - Should continue bowel decompression by way of rectal tube.
   -Daily KUB and serial abdominal exams to evaluate for worsening
   distention and for perforation.
   -Replete lytes aggressively per sliding scale orders.
   # Hypoxia: Existed pre-admission and is likely related to tumor
   compression of pulmonary arteries and L main bronchus.  Has improved
   since admission. Patient now tolerating nasal cannula.
   - Monitor for improvement given treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma
   - Dexamethasone dosing has been completed.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   # Hemopericardium: ECHO shows residual, but improved hemopericardium.
   Likely not contributing significantly to current overall status.
   # Lymphoma: NSHL as per pathology from supraclavicular LN biopsy. Stage
   2b at least per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1422**].
   -s/p cytoxan, etoposide, doxarubacin and dex note.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation, who has recently been diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma. She underwent modified EACOP chemotherapy and developed an ileus. Currently, she is experiencing febrile neutropenia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the setting of gram-negative bacterial bacteremia.

The patient's recent medical history includes a hemopericardium, chronic iron deficiency anemia, and a yeast infection in her urine. She has also been on liquid diet due to her neurologic status.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 111/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. Her physical examination shows well-nourished appearance, poor dentition, and ulcerative lesions at the right upper and central lower border of her mouth. She has distended abdomen with bowel sounds present and tender to palpation. Her extremities show 2+ pitting edema in both lower limbs, but no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination reveals attentive behavior, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.3 K/uL, anemia with"

   currently on IV amio and metoprolol
   -Continuing on IV amio load for now.  Will monitor QT. BB increased to
   QID yesterday.
   -Holding on anticoagulation given bloody nature of her pericardial
   effusion
   2.) ID -  Likely source is gut translocation.  Abdominal exam with
   improved distension over the last 2 days.  BCx with 1/4 GNR ecoli,
   enterobacter covered by Cefopime
    -continue cefepime/flagyl
    -Serial abdominal exams, though may be unrevealing given steroid
   regimen.  Low threshold for abd ct if change in hemodynamic perameters
   or clinical status given cx data.
   3.) Pericardial effusion:
     -Improved on recent TTE

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 59F with mental retardation w/ recent dx of nodular
   sclerosing hodgkins lymphoma s/p modified EACOP, ileus,  now with
   febrile neutropenia and afib with RVR  in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR (paroxysmal): NSR with pulse less that
   80 bpm for last 24 hours. Doing well on current regimen.
   - Amiodarone IV load has completed. Now starting PO amiodarone
   maintenance. Will have 400 mg amiodarone [**Hospital1 **] ending with AM dose on
   [**2144-8-13**] (7 total days).
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg QID.
   - EKGs yesterday showed NSR with QTc of 415. This QTc is not
   significantly changed from baseline. Continue to monitor EKGs
   periodically while giving amiodarone.
   - Cardiology has signed off. We will call if any additional issues
   present.
   # Febrile neutropenia (s/p cytoxan, doxorubin, etoposide, dexamethasone
   and procarbazine (last [**7-29**])): Fever and neutropenia appear resolved at
   this time.
   - F/U cultures, which are NGTD at this time.
   -GNR in blood are susceptible to current antibiotic regimen. Continue
   Cefipime, Metronidazole, and Vancomycin.
   - Monitor PICC line.
   # Ileus/abdominal distention: Physical exam is marginally improved
   since yesterday AM.
   - Patient is passing large bowel movements and large amounts of flatus
   without rectal tube. Will follow her by exam and discontinue daily KUB.
   Should get KUB again if exam changes or patient reports additional
   discomfort.
   -Replete lytes aggressively per sliding scale orders.
   # Hypoxia: Existed pre-admission and is likely related to tumor
   compression of pulmonary arteries and L main bronchus.  Has improved
   since admission. Patient now tolerating nasal cannula.
   - Monitor for improvement given treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma
   - Dexamethasone dosing has been completed.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   # Hemopericardium: ECHO shows residual, but improved hemopericardium.
   Likely not contributing significantly to current overall status.
   # Lymphoma: NSHL as per pathology from supraclavicular LN biopsy. Stage
   2b at least per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1422**].
   -s/p cytoxan, etoposide, doxarubacin and dex note.
   -will need ppx for PCP / HSV / VZV per BMT team
   - HSV labs reveal lip ulcer is due to HSV. Now treating Acyclovir 400
   mg [**Hospital1 **] for 10 days before switching to prophylactic regimen.
   # Anemia: Chronic, iron deficiency anemia. Now s/p chemo. Will continue
   to monitor.
   - Maintain Hct >25, plt >75 given history of hemopericardium
   # FEN: Doing well now on regular diet. Will continue with that as neuro
   status allows..
   # Proph: Bowel regimen, PPI, pneumoboots, Heaparin sub-cutaneous
   # CODE: DNR, may be intubated for procedures per family discussion.
   # ACCESS: peripheral; PICC

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation, who has been diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma and underwent modified EACOP treatment. She presented with febrile neutropenia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, ileus, and abdominal distention. The patient is currently on antibiotics for GNR bacteremia and has completed the Amiodarone IV load. She is being started on oral amiodarone maintenance. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is tolerating a regular diet. She has an improved physical exam since yesterday morning, with bowel movements and flatus. Laboratory results show resolving fever and neutropenia, normal electrolytes, and improved hemopericardium on echo. The patient's lymphoma stage is at least stage 2b. She has chronic iron deficiency anemia and requires continued monitoring. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be transferred to the floor once the Amiodarone IV load is completed.

Potential Medical Complications:

   80 bpm for last 24 hours. Doing well on current regimen.
   - Amiodarone IV load has completed. Now starting PO amiodarone
   maintenance. Will have 400 mg amiodarone [**Hospital1 **] ending with AM dose on
   [**2144-8-13**] (7 total days).
   - Continue Metoprolol 25 mg QID.
   - EKGs yesterday showed NSR with QTc of 415. This QTc is not
   significantly changed from baseline. Continue to monitor EKGs
   periodically while giving amiodarone.
   - Cardiology has signed off. We will call if any additional issues
   present.
   # Febrile neutropenia (s/p cytoxan, doxorubin, etoposide, dexamethasone
   and procarbazine (last [**7-29**])): Fever and neutropenia appear resolved at

   - F/U cultures, which are NGTD at this time.
   -GNR in blood are susceptible to current antibiotic regimen. Continue
   Cefipime, Metronidazole, and Vancomycin.
   - Monitor PICC line.
   # Ileus/abdominal distention: Physical exam is marginally improved
   since yesterday AM.
   - Patient is passing large bowel movements and large amounts of flatus
   without rectal tube. Will follow her by exam and discontinue daily KUB.
   Should get KUB again if exam changes or patient reports additional
   discomfort.
   -Replete lytes aggressively per sliding scale orders.
   # Hypoxia: Existed pre-admission and is likely related to tumor
   compression of pulmonary arteries and L main bronchus.  Has improved
   since admission. Patient now tolerating nasal cannula.
   - Monitor for improvement given treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma
   - Dexamethasone dosing has been completed.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   # Hemopericardium: ECHO shows residual, but improved hemopericardium.
   Likely not contributing significantly to current overall status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation, who has been diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma and underwent modified EACOP chemotherapy. She presented with febrile neutropenia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient also has a history of ileus and is currently experiencing abdominal distention. She has a chronic iron deficiency anemia and requires monitoring of her Hct and platelet levels. The patient's hypoxia is likely related to tumor compression of pulmonary arteries and the left main bronchus. She has an HSV lesion on her lip and has been treated with acyclovir. The patient's lymphoma stage is at least stage 2b, and she will need prophylaxis for PCP, HSV, and VZV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Febrile neutropenia: The patient may develop another episode of fever and neutropenia, especially if there is a breakthrough infection or inadequate response to the current antibiotic regimen.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: There is a possibility of recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which can lead to hemodynamic instability.
3. Abdominal distention and ileus: The patient's abdominal distention and ileus may worsen, leading to bowel obstruction or perforation.
4. Chronic iron deficiency anemia: The patient's anemia may progress further, leading to"

   This is a 59F with mental retardation w/ recent dx of nodular
   sclerosing hodgkins lymphoma s/p modified EACOP, ileus,  now with
   febrile neutropenia and afib with RVR  in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   # Atrial fibrillation with RVR (paroxysmal):Overnight, pulse rate
   decrease appeared to correlate to dosing with 25 mg Metoprolol.
   - Amiodarone IV load has completed. Now starting PO amiodarone
   maintenance. Will have 400 mg amiodarone [**Hospital1 **] ending with AM dose on
   [**2144-8-13**] (7 total days).
   - Continue Metoprolol QID.
   - EKG Check EKG this AM to evaluate QT interval while on continued
   amiodarone. EKG comparison yesterday showed QTc of 405 both prior to
   and 6 hours after restarting amiodarone IV load.
   # Febrile neutropenia (s/p cytoxan, doxorubin, etoposide, dexamethasone
   and procarbazine (last [**7-29**])): Fever and neutropenia appear resolved at
   this time.
   - f/u CXR and repeat cultures.
   -GNR in blood are susceptible to current antibiotic regimen. Continue
   Cefipime, Metronidazole, and Vancomycin.
   - Monitor PICC line.
   # Ileus/abdominal distention: Exam is not significantly changed since
   yesterday AM.
   - Should continue bowel decompression by way of rectal tube.
   -Daily KUB and serial abdominal exams to evaluate for worsening
   distention and for perforation.
   -Replete lytes aggressively per sliding scale orders.
   # Hypoxia: Existed pre-admission and is likely related to tumor
   compression of pulmonary arteries and L main bronchus.  Has improved
   since admission. Patient now tolerating nasal cannula.
   - Monitor for improvement given treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma
   - Dexamethasone dosing has been completed.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated.
   # Hemopericardium: ECHO shows residual, but improved hemopericardium.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation, recently diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma following modified EACOP treatment. She is currently in the ICU for febrile neutropenia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, ileus, and hypoxia. She has a history of chronic iron deficiency anemia and has undergone chemotherapy. The patient's current medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis), amiodarone IV and PO, metoprolol QID, cefipime, metronidazole, and vancomycin. She is also on a regular low-sodium diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) - The patient is being treated with amiodarone and metoprolol to manage her AFib. Close monitoring of the QT interval is necessary while on amiodarone due to the risk of QT prolongation.
2. Febrile neutropenia - Although the patient's fever and neutropenia appear resolved at the moment, there is a risk of recurrence. The current antibiotic regimen should be continued, and follow-up CXR and cultures should be repeated.
3. Ileus/abdominal distention - The patient's ileus has not significantly changed since yesterday. Continued bowel decompression with a rectal tube is recommended, along with daily KUB and serial abdominal"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo F with MR, Hodgkin's Disease, and [**Hospital 3282**] transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**]
   with febrile neutropenia and AF with RVR.
   1) AF with RVR: intermittently in sinus vs AF with controlled rate
   currently on IV amio and metoprolol
   -Will monitor QT.
   -Holding on anticoagulation given bloody nature of her pericardial
   effusion
   2) ID -  Likely source is gut translocation.  Abdominal exam with less
   distension over the last 3 days.  BCx with 1/4 GNR ecoli, enterobacter
   covered by Cefopime
    -continue cefepime/flagyl
    -Serial abdominal exams improving.
   3) Pericardial effusion:
     -Improved on recent TTE
   4) Ileus - Exam improved after rectal tube placed. -Will monitor with
   serial abd exams.
   5)  ADAT
   6) HD:  Further chemo plans per oncology
   7) Okay for transfer to BMT

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of MR (mental retardation), Hodgkin's Disease, and currently admitted to the ICU with febrile neutropenia and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR). She is being treated with IV amiodarone and metoprolol for AF with RVR, but anticoagulation is held due to her bloody pericardial effusion. 

The patient has been improving over the past few days. Her abdominal exam shows less distension, and blood cultures have revealed an infection likely caused by gut translocation. This infection is covered by the current antibiotics, cefepime and flagyl, so they will be continued. 

Her pericardial effusion has also improved, as shown by recent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). 

The patient is experiencing ileus, but it has improved after the placement of a rectal tube. Serial abdominal exams will be monitored to assess further improvement. 

Additional assessments include ADAT (which appears to be unrelated to the current situation) and further chemotherapy plans per oncology. The patient is also deemed okay for transfer to BMT (bone marrow transplant). 

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and she has been spending a total of 30 minutes of ICU care time."
