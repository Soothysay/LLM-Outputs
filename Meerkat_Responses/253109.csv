","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who presented with biomarkers indicating demand ischemia or NSTEMI in the setting of lower lobe pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has a history of COPD and alcohol abuse, and there are concerns about septic shock, hypotension, hyponatremia, prolonged QTc, and a rash. The patient is being treated with antibiotics, anticoagulants, and other medications for his various conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure could worsen if the pneumonia does not improve or if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's elevated troponin levels and wall motion abnormality, there is a risk of further cardiac damage or development of arrhythmias.
3. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible septic response, which can lead to organ failure and mortality if not promptly managed.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which can be caused by volume loss or SIADH. If not corrected, it may lead to neurological complications.
5. Prolonged QTc: The patient's prolonged QT interval increases the risk of arrhythmias and potential cardiac arrest.
6. Rash: The patient's chronic rash could be due to drug reactions or"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who presents with positive biomarkers in the setting of lower lobe pneumonia (LLL PNA) due to demand ischemia vs NSTEMI. The patient has been experiencing hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and is currently intubated. The patient also has a history of COPD and recent hospitalization in October 2022.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the underlying lung disease and the LLL PNA. Given the recent hospitalization, the patient will be treated with vancomycin and cefepime instead of azithromycin and ceftriaxone for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP).

2. Demand Ischemia vs NSTEMI: The patient's new wall motion abnormality suggests acute myocardial injury. Elevated troponin levels and mildly elevated CK-MB indicate myocardial damage. Considering the primary issue of pneumonia and possible septic picture, medical management will be favored for now, and cardiac catheterization will be deferred until the respiratory status is stable.

3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD exacerbation will be managed with nebulized bronchodilators (ipratropium and albuterol). Home medications such as fluticasone and Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol) will be held.

4. Atrial Fibrillation with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of biomarkers in the setting of lower left lobe pneumonia due to demand ischemia versus NSTEMI. He has hypovolemia versus septic picture. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, multi-lumen, arterial line, and antibiotics. His vital signs include a temperature of 36 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 41 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response. Physical examination reveals crackles in the lungs, right lower extremity edema, and warm skin with a diffuse rash. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, troponin T, and C-reactive protein. Imaging shows a wet read chest X-ray with ETT tip 4.5 cm from the carina, NGH and sidehole over the stomach, right PICC tip mid superior vena cava, and retrocardiac opacities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pneumonia and underlying lung disease. Given recent hospitalization, he will be given vancomycin/cefepime for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) instead of azithromycin/ceftazidime that he received at the previous hospital.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic alcoholism and multiple comorbidities. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress secondary to lower lobe pneumonia (LLPNA) with suspected demand ischemia or NSTEMI. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 36 bpm, blood pressure of 109/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP with FiO2 of 50%. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show elevated troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac injury, as well as elevated CK-MB levels, suggesting myocardial injury. There are also signs of renal dysfunction with an elevated creatinine level and low urine output. The patient has hyponatremia with a sodium level of 130 mEq/L and hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.3 mEq/L. Other lab abnormalities include elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated liver enzymes.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, prolonged QTc interval, hypotension, and a maculopapular rash. The rash has been present for three months and may be drug-related, potentially due to lisinopril or aml"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, chronic alcoholism, atrial fibrillation, and possibly ischemic heart disease. He presented with respiratory distress and was intubated due to pneumonia with lung disease. There are concerns about sepsis, hypovolemia, and demand ischemia versus non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has elevated troponin levels and a wall motion abnormality on imaging. He is currently on CPAP with a FiO2 of 40% and antibiotics have been changed to vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient also has hyponatremia, hypotension, a rash, hyperglycemia, and a history of ethanol abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's respiratory distress and elevated inflammatory markers, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory symptoms and the need for mechanical ventilation may progress to ARDS.
3. Myocardial Infarction: The elevated troponin levels and wall motion abnormality suggest a possible myocardial infarction.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can worsen during acute illness or stress.
5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's hyponatremia and elevated BUN"

   underlying lung disease. LFTs were normal at OSH. Differential includes
   viral pna and bacterial pna. Contribution from underlying lung
   disease.  Negative flu swab and legionella antigen.  Likely CAP even
   though patient had a recent hospitalization, appears to be lobar in
   nature.   Tele shows mild QTc prolongation at 500msec.
   - discontinue vancomycin, switch back to ceftriaxone from cefepime
   because pseudomonas unlikely.  Continue azithromycin to cover atypical
   pathogens, although also less likely because of lobar consolidation.

   # Demand ischemia vs NSTEMI:  Given new wall motion abnormality
   consider acute myocardial injury.  Patient has elevated troponin,
   mildly elevated CK-MB (MBI ~ 10).  Given that patient's primary issue
   is his pneumonia and possibly septic picture, will favor medically
   managing for now and defer cardiac cath after resp status is stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with pneumonia and demand ischemia, presenting with respiratory failure and elevated biomarkers indicative of a possible NSTEMI. The patient's medical history includes COPD, anemia of unclear etiology, atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response, prolonged QTc, and hyponatremia. The patient also has a history of alcoholism and is suspected to have hypocalcemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a need for close monitoring and appropriate interventions to support breathing.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient may be at risk for further cardiac complications due to the demand ischemia or NSTEMI. Monitoring EKG changes, cardiac enzymes, and planning for a cardiac catheterization to assess for coronary artery disease are important.
3. Infection: The patient has pneumonia, and it is crucial to treat the infection effectively to prevent its progression and potential complications such as sepsis.
4. Thromboembolic Events: Given the patient's immobilization and risk factors (CHADS2 score of 4), there is a concern for thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylaxis with heparin should be continued.
5. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcoholism, and withdrawal symptoms should be anticipated."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male who presented with positive biomarkers for demand ischemia versus NSTEMI. The patient also has pneumonia, likely secondary to underlying lung disease, and is currently being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. The differential diagnosis includes viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia. 

The patient's respiratory status has improved, as indicated by a decrease in FiO2 from 50% to 35% and successful extubation. However, there are concerns regarding the patient's demand ischemia vs NSTEMI, which is supported by new wall motion abnormality and elevated troponin levels. 

Other significant findings include anemia of unclear etiology, atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, prolonged QTc, hyponatremia, hypotension, and a rash that has been present for three months. The rash was initially thought to be drug-induced lupus erythematosis, but there are concerns for toxic epidermal necrosis or lichen planus. 

The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and requires management for withdrawal symptoms when extubated. There are also concerns about hyperglycemia and glaucoma. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia and underlying lung disease.
2. Demand ischemia vs NSTEMI with new wall motion abnormality and elevated troponin levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with positive biomarkers in the setting of pneumonia due to demand ischemia vs NSTEMI. The patient presents with chest discomfort and shortness of breath after a holiday. The patient also has a rash that began three months ago and stopped taking lisinopril and amlodipine. The patient's anti-histone antibodies were negative, making drug-induced lupus less likely. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, and there is a wall motion abnormality indicating acute myocardial injury. The patient is being medically managed for now and will undergo cardiac catheterization after respiratory status stabilizes. The patient has chronic alcoholism and is at risk for stroke, but not currently anticoagulated. The patient also has hyponatremia and a history of COPD. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been reported to be hypoxemic with pneumonia and underlying lung disease. There is a concern for viral or bacterial pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored.
2. Demand Ischemia vs NSTEMI: The patient has elevated troponin levels and a wall motion abnormality indicating acute myocardial injury. This could indicate ischemic heart disease. The patient is being medically managed for now and will undergo cardiac catheterization after respiratory status stabilizes.
3. Anemia: The patient has unclear etiology of anemia, likely secondary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male presenting with positive biomarkers in the setting of pneumonia due to demand ischemia vs NSTEMI. He has a history of COPD, alcoholism, and possible drug-induced lupus erythematosis. The patient has been experiencing a rash for the past 3 months, which could be related to medication side effects. He also has hyponatremia and hyperglycemia. The patient is currently on various medications including heparin, ASA, clopidogrel, simvastatin, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has reported hypoxemia and is suspected to have pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Demand ischemia vs NSTEMI: The patient has elevated troponin levels and a new wall motion abnormality, indicating a possible acute myocardial injury. This may be due to demand ischemia or NSTEMI.
3. Prolonged QTc: The patient has a mildly prolonged QTc interval, which could increase the risk of arrhythmias.
4. Anemia: The patient has unclear etiology anemia, likely secondary to alcoholism.
5. Atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response: The patient has chronic bradycardia and is at risk for stroke. However, he is not anticoagulated.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia,"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 72-year-old male with positive biomarkers in the setting of pneumonia due to demand ischemia.
- The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with a cutting balloon, underexpansion, and rotoblade with 1.5 burr. A 2.75x15mm bare-metal stent (BMS) was placed, and the result was good.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response and a CHADS2 score of 4, which is concerning for stroke risk.
- The patient has a prolonged QTc and hyponatremia.
- The patient has a rash that has been present for 3 months and may be related to a drug reaction, possibly to lisinopril or amlodipine.
- The patient has a history of ethanol abuse.
- The patient has hyperglycemia and glaucoma.
- The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, demand ischemia, and NSTEMI.

   Assessment and Plan
   72-year-old male presents with + biomarkers in setting of pneumonia due
   to demand ischemia.
   #. Respiratory failure: Reportedly hypoxemic. [**12-31**] pneumonia and
   underlying lung disease. LFTs were normal at OSH. Differential includes
   viral pna and bacterial pna. Contribution from underlying lung
   disease.  Negative flu swab and legionella antigen.  Likely CAP even
   though patient had a recent hospitalization, appears to be lobar in
   nature.   Tele shows mild QTc prolongation at 500msec.
   - continue CTX for now, consider d/c'ing - patient has been afebrile,
   oxygenation improved
   - follow up blood cultures
   - follow prolonged QT
   - trend WBC, T
   # Demand ischemia vs NSTEMI:  Given new wall motion abnormality
   consider acute myocardial injury.  The patient liklely has high grade
   LAD lesion given new WMA, but is not likely from acute plaque rupture.
   - Heparin gtt, ASA - until to cath lab
   - Clopidrogrel loading dose 300mg and then 75 mg QD
   - Simvastatin 80mg
   - CCath today
   # COPD: Continue treatment with MDI (ipatropium, albuterol).
   # Anemia: unclear etiology. Likely secondary to alcoholism
   - trend daily
   # Afib with slow ventricular response:  Chronically bradycardiac per
   patient's daughter.  Off [**Name2 (NI) 5863**] agents.  CHADS2 score of 4 (CHF, HTN,
   TIA) concerning for stoke risk, but patient is chronic alcoholic and
   fall risk, thus not anticoagulated.
   - Follow EKG
   - ASA 325mg daily
   - Hold beta-blockers
   # Prolonged QTc. Consider medication side-effect, ischemic heart
   disease and/or hypocalcemia.
   - follow EKG/telemetry
   - correct lytes PRN
   #  Na 130: hyponatremia likely due to volume loss.  Would also consider
   SIADH given lung process/stress.
   - trend chemistry
   - urine lytes
    #  Rash has been for 3 months per OSH report. Consider drug reaction
   to lisinopril per OSH report stopped med. [**2182-12-25**] Derm consult with BX
   suggested focal interface change consistent with drug eruption or
   drug-induced lupus erythematosis.  Drug-induced lupus more likely given
   subsequently positive [**Doctor First Name **].  Derm suggested amlodipine or lisinopril as
   possible culprits.  Family said that rash began as vesicles which
   collesced may be consistent with toxic epidermal necrosis. Also
   consider lichen planus per derm.
   - appreciate Derm consult
   - triamcinolone 0.1% per derm recs

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 72-year-old male with positive biomarkers in the setting of pneumonia due to demand ischemia.
- The patient underwent a cardiac catheterization that showed mid-distal anterolateral wall motion abnormality, likely due to a calcified lesion in the mid LAD. A percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) with a cutting balloon was performed, followed by rotablation with a 1.5 burr and placement of a 2.75x15mm bare metal stent (BMS). Post-dilation was done to >20 atm with a 2.75 NC balloon, resulting in a good angiographic outcome.
- The patient has been on nitroglycerin (NTG) post-cath lab for elevated pressures, and it is planned to wean NTG aggressively.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation (AF) is ongoing, and heparin gtt will be restarted until further decisions are made regarding AF management.
- The patient has allergies to lisinopril and amlodipine, both of which have caused rashes.
- The patient has received various antibiotics for his pneumonia, including azithromycin, cefepime, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/"
