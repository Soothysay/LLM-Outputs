   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old female with PMH of DM2, CHF, s/p PPM in [**2148**], chronic LE
   edema who presented to the ED after a visiting nurse found her to be
   febrile.
   .
   # Sepsis/Pneumonia: Patient has RUL infiltrate on CXR with [**Year (4 digits) **] and
   elevated white count. As she has no recent hospital admissions, this is
   likely a community acquired pneumonia. No history of aspiration. Pt is
   edentulous. Patient was transiently hypotensive in the ED, which
   resolved after 1.5L of IVF. Lactate=1.6 and the patient is currently
   normotensive, indicating that this is not severe sepsis. Overnight, BP
   continued to remain low. Temperature increased to 100.8 overnight and
   WBC has increased this morning to 14.1.
   - Blood cultures x2 pending
   - Continue on Levofloxacin as coverage for presumed CAP
   - Add Vancomycin for MRSA coverage
   - IVF Bolus for hypotension/low UOP
   - Send sputum for culture
   - If patient's fluid and O2 requirements increase, consider
   arterial/central line for hemodynamic monitoring as needed.
   - hold antihypertensives, including b-blocker, ace, Lasix
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has history of systolic CHF with EF=30%
   on [**2152-9-22**]. BNP=[**Numeric Identifier 1756**] in ED. Her baseline is not known. CXR on
   admission is inconsistent with a CHF exacerbation. Patient received
   1.5L IVF in the ED. AM CXR is also inconsistent with CHF exacerbation.
   Patient not complaining of shortness of breath.
   - Will monitor daily CXR and physical exam to assess acute exacerbation
   - Goal is for even fluid balance given comorbid chronic kidney disease
   - Patient on home lasix
 will hold for now as BP remains low with low
   UOP
   - Will restart beta blocker, ACE inhibitor tomorrow depending on BP
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Cr=1.3, BUN=27. Patient has baseline of approx
   1.3 over the past year. With BUN/Cr ratio >20, this may also be
   pre-renal. Patient has already received NS. There may possibly be
   underlying chronic kidney disease - either secondary to diabetes or
   poor cardiac output/chronic Lasix therapy. Will monitor daily labs to
   follow Cr, BUN, which remain stable this morning.
   - If drop in uop or rise in creat, w/u for ARF including urine lytes
   and bolus as needed.
   .
   # Left Leg Ulcer: Appears superficial without substantial erythema.
   Wound care with antibiotic ointment, moist barrier w/ sterile gauze.
   Consider wound c/s if worsening.
   .
   # Bacturia: Patient's UA in the ED showed many bacteria with few WBC
   and negative Leuk esterase. This likely represents asymptomatic
   bacturia.
   - Await urine culture
   - No intervention indicated at this time
   .
   # DM2: Hyperglycemic on admission. Hold glipizide. HgbA1c=7.5% on
   [**2153-9-6**]. Start regular insulin sliding scale.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Patient taking synthroid. Will continue.
   .
   # PPx: SC heparin, PPI
   .
   # Code: Full Code (confirmed with HCP)

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, and chronic left-sided edema. She presented to the emergency department after being found febrile by a visiting nurse. She has a right upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and an elevated white blood cell count, suggesting pneumonia. The patient was transiently hypotensive but responded to intravenous fluids. Her lactate level is elevated, indicating potential sepsis. Blood cultures are pending, and she is being treated with levofloxacin and vancomycin. The patient also has chronic systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30% but does not show signs of exacerbation on chest X-rays. Her baseline B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated. She has chronic renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.3 and a BUN/Cr ratio greater than 20, possibly indicating pre-renal azotemia. She has a left leg ulcer that appears superficial without substantial erythema, for which wound care is being provided. She also has asymptomatic bacteriuria, which is being monitored. The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypothyroidism, both of which are being managed with medication. She has been started on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient has been placed on full code status and is being cared for in"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with hypotension and suspected pneumonia. They have a history of aspiration, chronic left lower extremity ulcer, and recent diagnosis of hypothyroidism. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, vasopressors, and prophylactic heparin. Their vital signs show fever, tachycardia, low blood pressure, and normal oxygen saturation. Fluid balance and laboratory values are provided, indicating possible infection and kidney dysfunction. Imaging reveals opacities in the right upper lung zone and retrocardiac area. The patient's condition requires intensive care management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the presence of suspected pneumonia and fever, there is a risk of sepsis developing due to a systemic infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function, which may progress to AKI if not appropriately managed.
3. Ventricular Fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is paced, indicating a possible arrhythmia. Ventricular fibrillation is a serious complication that can lead to cardiac arrest.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures are in place, but regular monitoring is essential.
5. Pulmonary Embolism: If a DVT occurs, it can potentially lead to a pulmonary embolism, which can be life"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old female with PMH of DM2, CHF, s/p PPM in [**2148**], chronic LE
   edema who presented to the ED after a visiting nurse found her to be
   febrile.
   .
   # Sepsis/Pneumonia: Patient has RUL infiltrate on CXR with fever and
   elevated white count. As she has no recent hospital admissions, this is
   likely a community acquired pneumonia. No history of aspiration. Pt is
   edentulous. Patient was transiently hypotensive in the ED, which
   resolved after 1.5L of IVF. Lactate=1.6 and the patient is currently
   normotensive, indicating that this is not severe sepsis. Overnight, BP
   continued to remain low. Temperature increased to 100.8 overnight and
   WBC has increased this morning to 14.1. Blood pressure dropped this
   morning during AM rounds. Patient given 250cc fluid bolus as well as
   Levophed drip.
   - Blood cultures x2 pending
   - Continue on Levofloxacin as coverage for presumed CAP
   - Add Vancomycin for MRSA coverage
   - IVF Bolus for hypotension/low UOP. Continue Levophed. Wean when able.
   - Send sputum for culture
   - Attempted arterial line.
   - hold antihypertensives, including b-blocker, ace, Lasix
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has history of systolic CHF with EF=30%
   on [**2152-9-22**]. BNP=[**Numeric Identifier 1756**] in ED. Her baseline is not known. CXR on
   admission is inconsistent with a CHF exacerbation. Patient received
   1.5L IVF in the ED. AM CXR is also inconsistent with CHF exacerbation.
   Patient not complaining of shortness of breath.
   - Will monitor daily CXR and physical exam to assess acute exacerbation
   - Goal is for even fluid balance given comorbid chronic kidney disease
   - Patient on home lasix
 will hold for now as BP remains low with low
   UOP
   - Continue to hold beta blocker, ace inhibitor, lasix
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Cr=1.3, BUN=27. Patient has baseline of approx
   1.3 over the past year. With BUN/Cr ratio >20, this may also be
   pre-renal. Patient has already received NS. There may possibly be
   underlying chronic kidney disease - either secondary to diabetes or
   poor cardiac output/chronic Lasix therapy. Will monitor daily labs to
   follow Cr, BUN, which remain stable this morning.
   - If drop in uop or rise in creat, w/u for ARF including urine lytes
   and bolus as needed.
   .
   # Left Leg Ulcer: Chronic issue. Appears superficial without
   substantial erythema. Wound care with antibiotic ointment, moist
   barrier w/ sterile gauze. Consider wound c/s if worsening.
   .
   # Bacturia: Patient's UA in the ED showed many bacteria with few WBC
   and negative Leuk esterase. This likely represents asymptomatic
   bacturia.
   - Await urine culture
   - No intervention indicated at this time
   .
   # DM2: Hyperglycemic on admission. Hold glipizide. HgbA1c=7.5% on

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, and chronic left leg edema. She presented to the emergency department after being found febrile by a visiting nurse. The patient has a right upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, elevated white blood cell count, and fever, indicating a possible community-acquired pneumonia. She was transiently hypotensive in the emergency department but responded to intravenous fluids. Her blood pressure continued to be low overnight, and she received another fluid bolus along with a Levophed drip. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 95/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. 

The patient has several medical conditions including sepsis/pneumonia, chronic systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%, chronic renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, and a left leg ulcer. She also has asymptomatic bacteriuria and diabetes mellitus type 2. Additionally, she has hypothyroidism and is on synthetic thyroid hormone replacement therapy. 

The patient is currently on full code status and is admitted to the ICU for level 1"

   84 year old female with PMH of DM2, CHF, s/p PPM in [**2148**], chronic LE
   edema who presented to the ED after a visiting nurse found her to be
   febrile.
   .
   # Sepsis/Pneumonia: Patient has RUL infiltrate on CXR with fever on
   admission and elevated white count. Due to low blood pressure with SBP
   in the 80s at times, patient received an arterial line yesterday and
   levophed, which has subsequently been weaned due to higher BP. Patient
   given 250cc fluid bolus at 10pm for a MAP ~60. Culture data is positive
   for Legionella, which is covered by the levofloxacin which she has been
   receiving.
   - Blood cultures x2 pending
   - Continue on Levofloxacin as coverage for legionella
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA coverage
   - IVF Bolus for hypotension/low UOP.
   - Send sputum for culture
   - hold antihypertensives, including b-blocker, ace, Lasix

   # Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has history of systolic CHF with EF=30%
   on [**2152-9-22**]. BNP=[**Numeric Identifier 1756**] in ED with unknown baseline. Multiple CXR are
   inconsistent with a CHF exacerbation. Patient not complaining of
   shortness of breath.
   - Will monitor daily CXR and physical exam to assess acute exacerbation
   - Goal is for even fluid balance given comorbid chronic kidney disease
   and hypotension
   - Patient on home lasix
 will hold for now as BP remains low with low
   UOP
   - Continue to hold beta blocker, ace inhibitor, lasix
   # Bacturia: Patient's UA in the ED showed many bacteria with few WBC
   and negative Leuk esterase. Urine culture grew >100k enterococcus. This
   is covered by vancomycin.
   - Continue vancomycin
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Patient has baseline of approx 1.3 over the
   past year. With BUN/Cr ratio >20, this may also be pre-renal. Patient
   has already received NS. There may possibly be underlying chronic
   kidney disease - either secondary to diabetes or poor cardiac
   output/chronic Lasix therapy. Will monitor daily labs to follow Cr,
   BUN, which remain stable this morning.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, congestive heart failure, and chronic leg edema. She was admitted to the ICU with fever and a right upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient's blood pressure has been low, requiring arterial line placement and levophed weaning. She received a 250cc fluid bolus at 10pm for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) around 60. The patient's urine culture grew >100k enterococcus, which is being covered by vancomycin. The arterial line was placed on 10/10/2153 at 02:10 PM. The patient is also being treated for chronic systolic congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, pneumonia caused by Legionella, and a left leg ulcer. The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, so regular insulin sliding scale has been started. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently on cardiac/diabetic diet in the ICU. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening heart failure, further decline in renal function, development of antibiotic-associated side effects, progression of the leg ulcer, and potential hypoglycemia due to the insulin therapy."

              (Reference Range-Negative).
         Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
         Clinical correlation and additional testing suggested including
   culture and detection of serum antibody.
   Blood culture x2 pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old female with PMH of DM2, CHF, s/p PPM in [**2148**], chronic LE
   edema who presented to the ED after a visiting nurse found her to be
   febrile.
   .
   # Sepsis/Pneumonia: Patient has RUL infiltrate on CXR with fever on
   admission and elevated white count. Due to low blood pressure with SBP
   in the 80s at times, patient received an arterial line yesterday and
   levophed, which has subsequently been weaned due to higher BP. Patient
   given 250cc fluid bolus at 10pm for a MAP ~60. Culture data is positive
   for Legionella, which is covered by the levofloxacin which she has been
   receiving. Hyponatremia is also seen with Legionella as well.
   - Blood cultures x2 pending
   - Continue on Levofloxacin as coverage for legionella
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA coverage
   - IVF Bolus for hypotension/low UOP.
   - Send sputum for culture
   - hold antihypertensives, including b-blocker, ace, Lasix
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has history of systolic CHF with EF=30%
   on [**2152-9-22**]. BNP=[**Numeric Identifier 1756**] in ED with unknown baseline. Multiple CXR are
   inconsistent with a CHF exacerbation. Patient not complaining of
   shortness of breath.
   - Will monitor daily CXR and physical exam to assess acute exacerbation
   - Goal is for even fluid balance given comorbid chronic kidney disease
   and hypotension
   - Patient on home lasix
 will hold for now as BP remains low with low
   UOP
   - Continue to hold beta blocker, ace inhibitor, lasix
   # Bacturia: Patient's UA in the ED showed many bacteria with few WBC
   and negative Leuk esterase. Urine culture grew >100k enterococcus. This
   is covered by vancomycin.
   - Continue vancomycin
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Patient has baseline of approx 1.3 over the
   past year. With BUN/Cr ratio >20, this may also be pre-renal. Patient
   has already received NS. There may possibly be underlying chronic
   kidney disease - either secondary to diabetes or poor cardiac
   output/chronic Lasix therapy. Will monitor daily labs to follow Cr,
   BUN, which remain stable this morning.
   - If drop in uop or rise in creat, w/u for ARF including urine lytes
   and bolus as needed.
   .
   # Left Leg Ulcer: Chronic issue. Appears superficial without
   substantial erythema. Wound care with antibiotic ointment, moist
   barrier w/ sterile gauze. Consider wound c/s if worsening.
   .
   # DM2: Hyperglycemic on admission. Hold glipizide. HgbA1c=7.5% on
   [**2153-9-6**]. Start regular insulin sliding scale.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Patient recently prescribed synthroid by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1792**].
