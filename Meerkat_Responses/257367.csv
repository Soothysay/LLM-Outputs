","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

- The patient was placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress.
- A bronchoscopy was performed, revealing friable and erythematous tissue, and mucus extraction was done. An orogastric (OG) tube and endotracheal tube (ETT) were placed.
- The patient has allergies to losartan, causing angioedema and lip swelling; lisinopril, resulting in cough; penicillins, causing itching; and Flagyl, leading to wheezing.
- The patient received antibiotics, specifically cefepime and vancomycin, within the last 24 hours.
- The patient is receiving various infusions, including fentanyl, lansoprazole, midazolam, and heparin sodium.
- The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80/54 to 182/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient has sinus bradycardia and requires mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 576 mL and output of 250 mL.
- The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and other lab values within normal ranges"

","The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation, and recent UTI, pneumonia, and C. diff colitis presenting with acute onset of hypoxia. She has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to her impaired lung function at baseline and recent pneumonia exacerbation. The patient also has diastolic CHF exacerbation, as indicated by the complete white-out of her left hemi-thorax and markedly elevated pro-BNP levels. This suggests either left lung collapse, massive pleural effusion, and/or severe CHF exacerbation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation, and recent UTI, pneumonia, and C. difficile colitis. She presented with acute onset of hypoxia and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has impaired lung function due to recent pneumonia and an exacerbation of diastolic CHF, leading to a complete white-out of the left hemithorax and markedly elevated pro-BNP levels. The differential diagnosis includes left lung collapse, massive pleural effusion, and severe CHF exacerbation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Left lung collapse: This could be caused by a blockage of the airway, such as a mucus plug or foreign body, leading to inadequate ventilation of the left lung.
2. Massive pleural effusion: This refers to an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which can compress the lung and impair its function.
3. Severe CHF exacerbation: The patient's diastolic CHF may worsen, leading to fluid overload and pulmonary edema, causing further compromise in oxygenation and respiratory function.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and risk factors increase the likelihood of developing blood clots in the deep veins."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a medical history of COPD, diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation, and recent UTI, pneumonia, and C. difficile colitis. She presented with acute onset hypoxia and is currently intubated in the ICU. Her vital signs show hypotension, bradycardia, and normal oxygen saturation. The patient is on invasive ventilation, and her respiratory support includes a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 14, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and an ABG indicating respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia.

The patient's physical examination reveals cool skin, multiple skin tears, and diminished pulses in both lower extremities. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds coherently to verbal stimuli. Laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, decreased hemoglobin, leukocytosis, and elevated BNP. Imaging shows opacification of the left lung field, which has mostly resolved since yesterday.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's hypoxia is thought to be due to volume overload from mucus plugging, trachiomalacia, pneumonia, and volume overload. There is a concern for Pseudomonas infection based on gram stain results. The plan includes repeating bronchoscopy to evaluate the mucosa and assess the left lower lobe, aiming for extub"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/50 to 153/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is extubated from invasive ventilation but still requires supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for new symptoms related to the current ICU stay.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's recent extubation, there is a risk of respiratory distress or failure due to airway edema or secretions.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure readings indicate possible instability in cardiovascular function. There is a risk of hypotension or hypertension leading to organ dysfunction.
3. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics (Cefipime and Vancomycin) for an unknown infection. It is crucial to monitor for signs of infection and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Coagulation disorders: The patient's platelet count is slightly elevated at 328 K/uL, which could indicate an underlying coagulation disorder or be a result of recent medical interventions.
5. Renal impairment: The patient's creatinine level is within normal range"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation, and recent UTI, pneumonia, and C. difficile colitis. She presented with acute onset hypoxia, thought to be due to volume overload from mucus plugging, trachiomalacia, pneumonia, and volume overload. The patient is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation but has been extubated. She has multiple medical complications, including elevated lactate levels, atrial fibrillation, and C. difficile colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and current presentation with hypoxia and respiratory distress put her at risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of her oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to her prolonged mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Frequent assessment of her sputum culture and implementing appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and invasive lines increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin should be considered.
4. Stress ulcer: Prolonged critical illness and the use of invasive lines can predispose the patient to stress ulcers. Gastric prophylaxis with medications like proton pump inhibitors or H"

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year old woman with history of COPD, diastolic CHF, atrial
   fibrillation, and recent UTI, pneumonia, and c dif colitis presenting
   with acute onset of hypoxia.
   Hypoxia:  Thought to be due to volume overload from mucus plugging,
   trachiomalacia, PNA and volume overload.  GNR on GS concerning for
   pseudomonas.
   - Repeat bronchoscopy today to eval mucosa, assess LLL
   - Goal to extubate post bronchoscopy.  Will lower RR and tolerate some
   hypercapnea given h/o COPD to increase respiratory drive.  Low RSBI,
   though good prognosis.
   - f/u TTE
   - diuresis as tolerated
   - Was on Steroid (IV methylpred 40 mg q 12) for COPD exacerbation,
   start Prednisone taper PO tomorrow AM.  Albuterol/Ipratroprium
   - PEEP of 5
   - fent gtt/versed bolus for sedation
   - Vanc/Cefepime for PNA coverage 8 day course
   Elevated lactate: more likely related to severe hypoxia with markedly
   elevated work of breathing as opposed to systemic or regional
   hypoperfusion.  no clear medications to implicate.  appears
   hemodynamically stable and w/o abdominal pain to suggest mesenteric
   ischemia.  CXR negative for free air.
   - continue to trend
   - antibiotics as above
   C dif colitis: much decreased diarrhea per patient. will continue
   therapy until pneumonia directed antibiotics are completed.
   - continue po vanc per prior protocol
   Diabetes:  Has elevated blood sugars since resuming diet on steroids.
   Will add NPH this afternoon.  Required 10 U coverage q6 this afternoon,
   will start with NPH 10 U [**Hospital1 **].
   - Watch carefully while tapering steroids.
   Atrial fibrillation: currently sinus rhythm w/o ischemic changes.
   - monitor for need for rate control agents once sedation weans

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of COPD, diastolic CHF, atrial fibrillation, and recent UTI, pneumonia, and c-diff colitis. She presented with acute onset of hypoxia and is currently intubated in the ICU. The hypoxia is thought to be due to volume overload from mucus plugging, trachiomalacia, pneumonia, and volume overload. There is a concern for pseudomonas infection. The patient's current medications include midazolam, heparin sodium, and various antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of blood clots in the legs.
3. Stress ulcer: Critical illness and the use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and may be at risk for developing ventricular arrhythmias.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis/hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood sugars since resuming diet on steroids indicate a potential risk for uncontrolled diabetes.
6. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the"
