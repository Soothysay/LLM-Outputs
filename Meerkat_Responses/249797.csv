","The patient is a 71-year-old with melena and a drop in hematocrit (Hct). They received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), which increased their Hct from 24% to 28%. Hemolysis labs were negative. The patient's troponin trended up to 0.25, CK remained flat, and CPK was free. The patient had an episode of septic shock with a blood pressure (SBP) in the 80s, followed by a 500cc normal saline (NS) bolus, which increased SBP to the 120s.

The patient has a history of rash from adhesive tape and an elevated CK level due to Lipitor. They were previously on antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and metronidazole, which were discontinued at 09:05 AM. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and other ICU medications. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo man w/ CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, afib, EF 25-30%, h/o
   GIB, chronic anemia, CKD [**2-9**] lupus nephritis, who presents with
   lightheadedness & fatigue in the setting of a drop in his hematocrit
   and acute renal failure.
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Hct 28 in ED, then 24 on repeat in MICU
   after 1L IVF.  Down from baseline of low 30s--hct was 34 about 5 days
   ago. Pt reports dark stool over last few days. No N/V/abd pain. H/o
   duodenitis on EGD from [**2158**] & gastritis on prior.  [**Last Name (un) 236**] from [**2156**] w/
   Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids & diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.  In
   ED, G+ brown stool. Did not NG lavage in ED. Suspect pt has GIB given
   the above findings along w/ excessively elevated BUN (out of proportion
   to Crt).  Suspect UGIB rather than LGIB.  Also, of note, pt's INR
   supratherapeutic.  Hemolysis labs are negative. Pt currently HD, though
   he did have transient drop in SBP (80mmHg) after getting up to commode
   .  Got 2uPRBCs w/ inappropriate response.  Hct 26 this AM after 2uPRBC
   yesterday.  (
   - Two large bore IV
   - Transfuse additional 1 PRBC (may need lasix following)
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/u GI recs
no plans at present to scope, unless pt becomes unstable
   or does not adequately respond to transfusion

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He presents with lightheadedness, fatigue, and a drop in hematocrit. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and his hemoglobin level increased from 24% to 28%. Hemolysis labs are negative. The patient also has an episode of septic shock with a low blood pressure of 80s and received 500cc normal saline (NS) bolus, resulting in an increased blood pressure to 120s. The patient's troponin trended up to 0.25, CK was flat, and CP free. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute on chronic anemia: The patient's hematocrit dropped from 34% to 24% within five days. He reports dark stool over the last few days, which indicates possible gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has a history of duodenitis and gastritis, as well as grade 1 internal hemorrhoids and diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. The elevated BUN/Cr ratio suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding rather than lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and hemolysis labs are negative. The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and received 2uPRBCs with an inappropriate response."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He presents with lightheadedness, fatigue, and a drop in hematocrit. The patient received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and his hematocrit increased from 24% to 28%. However, his hematocrit dropped again to 26% and he was given a third unit of PRBCs. He also had an episode of septic shock with a blood pressure of 80s, and received a 500cc normal saline (NS) bolus which increased his blood pressure to 120s. The patient has negative hemolysis labs and elevated troponin trend. He has been diagnosed with acute on chronic anemia, acute renal failure, and suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient's INR is supratherapeutic and he is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of GIB, and his current presentation suggests that he may be experiencing another episode. This can lead to significant blood loss, drop in hematocrit, and acute renal failure due to hypoperfusion.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN levels and decreased urine output indicate possible acute renal failure. This could be related to the GIB, hypot"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (afib), and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He presents with lightheadedness, fatigue, and a drop in hematocrit level that did not respond to transfusion. The patient received his third unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) this morning. He experienced an episode of hypotension that responded to a 500 cc fluid bolus. Troponin levels are elevated at 0.25, but CK-MB is normal. The patient has received 2 units of pRBCs, and his hematocrit has increased from 24% to 28%. However, his current hematocrit level is 26%, so he was given a third unit. 

The patient has allergies to Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium), which caused an elevated CK level. He is currently receiving various medications including pantoprazole (Protonix), gemfibrozile, levothyroxine (Levothyro), folic acid, and pantoprozol.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate ranging from 65-67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/61-71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 3 liters of supplemental oxygen. He is on mechanical ventilation with a rhythm of RR (mech) s2, II/VI murmur, and an atrioventricular paced rhythm. His height is 71 inches, and he has received a total of 2,066 mL of fluids, with an output of 2,235 mL. He has received 559 mL of blood products.

Laboratory results show a hematocrit level of 26.6%, leukocyte count of 7.3 K/uL, platelet count of 134 K/uL, creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 115 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels including sodium (Na+) at 133 mEq/L, potassium (K+) at 5.7 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) at 108 mEq/L, magnesium (Mg++) at 2.1 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) at 4.4 mg/dL.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is likely experiencing a gastrointestinal bleed that is slowly ongoing as he remains transfusion-dependent. His international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated at 5.3, and he will receive a single dose of vitamin K to lower it. Since he has a prosthetic valve, he will need to have his INR checked three times a day (TID) and bridged with heparin if the INR is less than 2"

   normal. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-5-24**], findings
   are similar. Left ventricular ejection fraction was underestimated in

   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo man w/ CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, afib, EF 25-30%, h/o
   GIB, chronic anemia, CKD [**2-9**] lupus nephritis, who presents with
   lightheadedness and fatigue in the setting of a drop in his hematocrit
   and acute renal failure.
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Hct 28 in ED, then 24 on repeat in MICU
   after 1L IVF.  Down from baseline of low 30s--hct was 34 about 5 days
   ago.  Pt reports dark stool over last few days. No N/V/abd pain. H/o
   duodenitis on EGD from [**2158**] & gastritis on prior.  [**Last Name (un) 236**] from [**2156**] w/
   Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids and diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.
   In ED, G+ brown stool. Did not NG lavage in ED. Suspect pt has GIB
   given the above findings along w/ excessively elevated BUN (out of
   proportion to Crt).  Suspect UGIB rather than LGIB.  Also, of note,
   pt's INR supratherapeutic.  Hemolysis labs are negative. Pt currently
   remains HD stable.  Got 3uPRBCs w/ inappropriate response.

   - hold Coumadin; Vit K as needed to suppress further rise in INR.  Will
   need to check [**Hospital1 **] INRs for few days to be sure pt does not undershoot.
   If INR <2-2.5, would need to start heparin.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: suspect prerenal and related to
   GIB/poor PO intake.  Improving after IVF: 2.9-->2.5

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has a history of allergies to Lipitor and a rash, as well as elevated CK levels. They have been receiving various medications, including Vancomycin, Metronidazole, Pantoprazole, and other ICU medications. The patient's medical and family history are unchanged from admission, except for the new onset of chest pain.

24-hour events include an increase in INR to 6.3, which was managed with two doses of vitamin K. The patient received a fourth unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to a hematocrit (Hct) level of 25. No bowel movements, nausea, or vomiting were reported.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate (HR) of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 105/51 to 152/95 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrioventricular (AV) paced.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,998 mL, including 209 mL of intravenous fluids (IVF), 1,620 mL of oral intake (PO), and 547 mL of blood products. The total output consists of 2,575 mL of urine, 800 mL of drainage from an unknown source (NG), and a negative balance of 591 mL. 

The patient is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and maintains a SpO2 of 100%. An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH level of 7.21.

Physical examination findings include an echocardiogram showing a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40-45%, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, mild left ventricular dilation, and trace aortic regurgitation. The patient also has severe mitral annular calcification with mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid valve thickening, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and a trivial pericardial effusion.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell (WBC) and hematocrit (Hct) levels, along with decreased platelet (Plt) count. The patient's creatinine (Cr) level is within normal range, while troponin-T levels are within normal limits. Other lab values, including glucose and electrolytes, are also provided.

Imaging findings from the echocardiogram reveal a mildly dilated left atrium, symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, mildly dilated left ventricular cavity, mildly depressed left ventricular systolic function, dilated right ventricular cavity, normal free wall contractility, moderately dilated aortic root, bileaflet aortic valve prosth"

   Imaging: ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
   dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
   (LVEF= 40-45 %); no definite regional wall motion abnormality is
   identified although views are technically suboptimal. The right
   ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall contractility. The
   aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. A bileaflet
   aortic valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is upper
   normal for this prosthesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe mitral
   annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
   acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. The motion of the tricuspid prosthetic leaflets appears
   normal. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-5-24**], findings
   are similar. Left ventricular ejection fraction was underestimated in
   the prior report.
   Assessment and Plan
   71 yo man w/ CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, afib, EF 25-30%, h/o
   GIB, chronic anemia, CKD [**2-9**] lupus nephritis, who presents with
   lightheadedness and fatigue in the setting of a drop in his hematocrit
   and acute renal failure.
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Hct 28 in ED, then 24 on repeat in MICU
   after 1L IVF.  Down from baseline of low 30s--hct was 34 about 5 days
   ago.  Pt reports dark stool over last few days. No N/V/abd pain. H/o
   duodenitis on EGD from [**2158**] & gastritis on prior.  [**Last Name (un) 236**] from [**2156**] w/
   Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids and diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.
   In ED, G+ brown stool. Did not NG lavage in ED. Suspect pt has GIB
   given the above findings along w/ excessively elevated BUN (out of
   proportion to Crt).  Suspect UGIB rather than LGIB.  Also, of note,
   pt's INR supratherapeutic.  Hemolysis labs are negative. Pt currently
   remains HD stable.  Has been transfused a total of 5uPRBCs w/
   inappropriate response.

   - hold Coumadin; Vit K as needed to suppress further rise in INR.  Will
   need to check [**Hospital1 **] INRs for few days to be sure pt does not undershoot.
   If INR <2-2.5, would need to start heparin.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), mechanical aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, ejection fraction of 25-30%, chronic anemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to lupus nephritis, and other comorbidities. He presents with lightheadedness and fatigue, acute renal failure, and dark stool. The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and he has elevated troponin levels but with flat/nml CKs. His EKG has been unchanged, and he has had a few episodes of rest chest pain since admission. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient's presentation of dark stool, elevated BUN (out of proportion to creatinine), and a history of duodenitis and gastritis raise the suspicion of GIB, specifically upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to his use of Coumadin and high INR.
2. Acute on chronic anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels are dropping, indicating acute worsening of his chronic anemia. This could contribute to his symptoms of lightheadedness and fatigue.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as evidenced by elevated BUN and creat"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (afib), and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He presented with lightheadedness, fatigue, and a drop in hematocrit. He received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) since admission. The patient is currently being monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Medical Complications:
1) GI Bleed: The patient is likely experiencing a slow and ongoing gastrointestinal bleed, as he remains transfusion-dependent. The INR is elevated at 4.2, indicating a higher risk of bleeding. A single dose of vitamin K has been given, and if the INR is below 2.0, bridging with heparin may be considered. However, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is still planned to be avoided.

2) Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has improved with fluid and blood transfusions, as well as the correction of hyperkalemia.

3) CV: The patient is on Coumadin for his valve, with an INR target of 2.5-3. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was unremarkable, and the beta blocker will be restarted. Lasix may be used if needed during transfusions, and the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He presents with symptoms of lightheadedness, fatigue, and a drop in hematocrit. The patient received additional units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and responded to nitroglycerin for chest pain. 

Medical Complications:
1) GI bleed: The patient is likely experiencing a slow ongoing gastrointestinal bleed as he remains transfusion-dependent. 
2) Renal failure: The patient's renal function has improved with fluid and blood transfusions, but he still exhibits signs of hyperkalemia.
3) CV (cardiovascular): The patient is prescribed Coumadin for his valve replacement, aiming for an INR of 2.5-3. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) revealed no abnormalities, and the patient will restart a beta-blocker. Lasix may be used if needed during transfusions, with a goal hematocrit of >30.
4) Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels are suspected to be secondary to volume status, and will be monitored.
5) FEN (not specified): The patient will be advanced to a more comprehensive diet.

Please note that this summary and analysis are based on the provided progress note. Additional information or tests may be necessary to fully assess the patient's condition."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), resulting in an increase in hematocrit from 25.3% to 29.5%. The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) has decreased to 1.8, and heparin infusion has been initiated.

The patient's allergies include a rash and an elevated creatine kinase (CK) level, likely due to previous exposure to Lipitor (atorvastatin calcium). The last doses of antibiotics, Vancomycin and Metronidazole, were administered at 09:05 AM.

The patient is currently receiving several medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium, metoprolol, and others. Additionally, the patient's medical and family history has been reviewed, but no significant changes were noted.

Flow sheet data as of [**2160-9-4**] 05:08 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other pertinent information. The patient's temperature is within normal range, but there is no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, or pain.

Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 7.3, slightly elevated hemoglobin (Hct) of 29.5%, and a platelet count (Plt) of 134. Other lab values such as creatinine (Cr), troponin T, glucose, and electrolytes are within normal limits or show no significant changes.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is not mentioned in the provided information.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Bleeding due to low INR and heparin infusion.
2. Thrombosis due to prolonged immobilization and central venous catheters.
3. Infection due to antibiotic use and potential VAP.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration due to stress ulcer prophylaxis.
5. Hyperglycemia if glycemic control is not maintained.
6. Pulmonary complications such as atelectasis or pneumonia.
7. Cardiac events such as arrhythmias or myocardial ischemia.
8. Kidney injury due to hypotension or nephrotoxic medications.
9. Pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility.
10. Delirium or cognitive impairment due to ICU stay and sedation.

These potential complications should be closely monitored and managed to ensure the patient's well-being."

   71 yo man w/ CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, afib, EF 25-30%, h/o
   GIB, chronic anemia, CKD [**2-9**] lupus nephritis, who presents with
   lightheadedness and fatigue in the setting of a drop in his hematocrit
   and acute renal failure.
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Hct 28 in ED, then 24 on repeat in MICU
   after 1L IVF.  Down from baseline of low 30s--hct was 34 about 5 days
   ago.  Pt reports dark stool over last few days. No N/V/abd pain. H/o
   duodenitis on EGD from [**2158**] & gastritis on prior.  [**Last Name (un) 236**] from [**2156**] w/
   Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids and diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.
   In ED, G+ brown stool. Did not NG lavage in ED. Suspect pt has GIB
   given the above findings along w/ excessively elevated BUN (out of
   proportion to Crt).  Suspect UGIB rather than LGIB.  Also, of note,
   pt's INR supratherapeutic.  Hemolysis labs are negative. Pt currently
   remains HD stable.  Has been transfused a total of 5uPRBCs w/
   inappropriate response.
   - Two large bore IV
   - Will transfuse additional 1 PRBC (5^th unit) now, may need lasix
   following
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/u GI recs; current plan is to manage supportively without endoscopy
   - hold Coumadin; Vit K PRN
   -[**Hospital1 **] HCTs; transfuse for HCT <30 given CAD with episodes of CP
   #  Status post mechanical aortic valve replacement: requires regular
   anticoag.  INR 2.5-3 goal.  Currently 5.3.
   - hold Coumadin; Vit K as needed to suppress further rise in INR.  Will
   need to check [**Hospital1 **] INRs for few days to be sure pt does not undershoot.
   If INR <2-2.5, would need to start heparin.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: suspect prerenal and related to
   GIB/poor PO intake.  Improving after IVF: 2.9

   - Nitro PRN
   - Holding ASA and BB given bleed
   #Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Serum Na trending down in setting of probably
   decreased blood volume, thus suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia. Pt
   diet advanced today thus will monitor [**Hospital1 **] for further change.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and mechanical aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, ejection fraction 25-30%, history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), chronic anemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to lupus nephritis, and other comorbidities such as hypertension, hypothyroidism, gout, emphysema, and hypogonadism.

The patient presents with lightheadedness and fatigue in the setting of a drop in his hematocrit and acute renal failure. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been decreasing over time, from 34% five days ago to 24% currently. The patient reports dark stool over the last few days, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The presence of brown stool suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding rather than lower gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's INR is elevated, which is concerning for anticoagulation-related bleeding. The elevated troponin levels suggest myocardial injury, but with flat/nml CKs, it suggests demand ischemia rather than a new myocardial infarction. The patient's ejection fraction is noted to be 25-30%, indicating chronic systolic heart failure.

The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which may be due to renal dysfunction. The patient's sodium levels have resolved, but there was a"

   71 yo man w/ CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, afib, EF 25-30%, h/o
   GIB, chronic anemia, CKD [**2-9**] lupus nephritis, who presents with
   lightheadedness and fatigue in the setting of a drop in his hematocrit
   and acute renal failure.
   # Acute on chronic anemia: Hct 28 in ED, then 24 on repeat in MICU
   after 1L IVF.  Down from baseline of low 30s--hct was 34 about 5 days
   ago.  Pt reports dark stool over last few days. No N/V/abd pain. H/o
   duodenitis on EGD from [**2158**] & gastritis on prior.  [**Last Name (un) 236**] from [**2156**] w/
   Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids and diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.
   In ED, G+ brown stool. Did not NG lavage in ED. Suspect pt has GIB
   given the above findings along w/ excessively elevated BUN (out of
   proportion to Crt).  Suspect UGIB rather than LGIB.  Also, of note,
   pt's INR supratherapeutic.  Hemolysis labs are negative. Pt currently
   remains HD stable.  Has been transfused a total of 6uPRBCs w/
   incomplete response.

   anticoag.  INR 2.5-3 goal.  Currently 5.3.
   - con

   daily (will likely need to be on 2mg alternating w/ 1mg schedule as
   prior dosing made him supratherapeutic).  [**Month (only) 60**] also need to make INR
   goal less aggressive, ie, [**2-10**], though will need to d/w his
   cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1137**]

   Suspect demand ischemia over NSTEMI.
   - Hold ASA for now given bleed
   #Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Serum Na trending down in setting of probably
   decreased blood volume, thus suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia. Pt
   diet advanced today thus will monitor [**Hospital1 **] for further change.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), mechanical aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, ejection fraction 25-30%, history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), chronic anemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to lupus nephritis, and other comorbidities. The patient presents with lightheadedness and fatigue, along with a drop in hematocrit and acute renal failure. He also reports dark stool over the last few days. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of GIB, and his symptoms, including dark stool and a drop in hematocrit, suggest the possibility of ongoing bleeding.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, which could be secondary to GIB or pre-renal causes due to poor oral intake.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating potential hypotension, which could contribute to symptoms of lightheadedness and fatigue.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Hypercoagulable state: The patient's elevated INR"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He presents with lightheadedness, fatigue, and a drop in hematocrit. The patient received a total of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) yesterday and started on a heparin drip for subtherapeutic INR. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient is likely experiencing a slowly ongoing GI bleed as he remains transfusion-dependent. Further evaluation and management are recommended.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function has improved with fluid and blood transfusion, but there is evidence of hyperkalemia. Ongoing monitoring and management are necessary.
3. CV: The patient's INR is currently at 1.7, and a goal INR of 2.5-3 is suspected for the valve. Lowering the goal INR may be beneficial and should be discussed with Dr. [Last Name (STitle)]. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is unremarkable, and beta blockers can be restarted. Lasix can also be restarted, but aspirin is being held. The patient's transfusion goal hematocrit (Hct) is set at >30, and he will be transfused for less than 27.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hypon"
