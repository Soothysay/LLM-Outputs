   pleuritic pain and productive cough. CTA did not show infiltrate
   specifically but lung mass makes asessment difficult and pt is at risk
   for post-obstructive PNA. CTA neg for PE. Alternatively, pt's CP may be
   secondary to tumor irritation of the pleura although this should not
   cause fever and leukocytosis. EKG w/o ischemic changes and trop neg.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 75-year-old male with stage IV lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency. He presents with pleuritic chest pain, pneumonia (PNA), hypotension, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

The patient's pleuritic chest pain is likely due to PNA, which is supported by symptoms such as fever, elevated white blood cell count, and productive cough. Although a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) did not show any pulmonary embolism, the patient's lung mass increases the risk for post-obstructive PNA. An alternative explanation could be tumor irritation of the pleura; however, this should not cause fever and leukocytosis.

The patient has a history of immunosuppression from recent chemotherapy treatment. Therefore, broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin are initiated to cover for potential infections.

Atrial fibrillation is being rate-controlled with intravenous diltiazem, and the plan is to transition to oral diltiazem once the patient's condition stabilizes. The patient's hypotension may be attributed to several factors including nitroglycerin, sepsis, or atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Close monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and lactate levels, as well as obtaining urine output and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and anemia. The patient is currently in the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient underwent thoracentesis on 11/14/2177 at 10:00 AM, which involved tapping pleural effusion and obtaining a Legionella culture. The patient also received two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and various medications including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, phenylephrine, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's history of pneumonia and the current presence of sepsis indicate a risk for further infections. Monitoring for signs of worsening infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count, is essential.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's pre-existing COPD and recent pneumonia may increase the risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory rate is necessary.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of AFib puts him at risk for additional cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring of heart rhythm and blood pressure is important.
4. Bleeding: The use of anticoagulants like heparin sodium and the presence of anemia may increase the risk"

   pleuritic pain and productive cough. CTA did not show infiltrate
   specifically but lung mass makes asessment difficult and pt is at risk
   for post-obstructive PNA. CTA neg for PE. Alternatively, pt's CP may be

The patient is a 75-year-old male with stage IV lung cancer, diabetes type 2, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency. He presents with pleuritic chest pain, pneumonia, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but has a history of hypertension and is on blood pressure medications. Lactate levels are normal, indicating no evidence of sepsis at this time. However, possible prior sepsis should be considered.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient is immunosuppressed due to recent chemotherapy and presents with symptoms suggestive of post-obstructive pneumonia, including pleural effusion. He is receiving appropriate antibiotics but requires further evaluation with blood and urine cultures. An interventional pulmonary consult for tapping of effusion is recommended.
3. Pleuritic Chest Pain: The patient likely has PNA with fever, elevated white blood cell count, pleuritic pain, and productive cough. A CT angiography did not show any pulmonary embolism. The chest pain could also be secondary to tumor irritation of the pleura. Treatment includes pain management and addressing the underlying cause.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped from 33 to 24 today. There are no reports of bleeding, and the patient is guaiac negative. Possible causes include dil"

The patient's pleuritic chest pain is likely due to pneumonia, as evidenced by fever, elevated white blood cell count, and productive cough. The patient also has anemia, possibly multifactorial with dilutional effect from fluid administration and recent chemotherapy. He will be monitored closely, and his HCT will be followed. The patient's atrial fibrillation will be managed with digoxin for rate control. The patient's non-small cell lung cancer treatment plan will continue, including study medication (Anamorelin). His COPD management will involve continuing Advair and exchanging ipratropium for tiotropium. The patient's diabetes management will be addressed, and his chronic renal insufficiency will be monitored. Prophylactic measures include sc heparin for DVT, bowel regimen, and regular diet with 1L NS with KCl. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending further work-up and treatment, with a possible transfer to the floor later today."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with stage IV lung cancer, diabetes type 2, atrial fibrillation, and chronic renal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU due to pleuritic chest pain, pneumonia, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient underwent thoracentesis, which revealed an exudative pleural effusion without evidence of Legionella infection. He received a total of 800 cc of fluid removal. The patient was started on low-dose pressors for hypotension and is being treated for possible sepsis with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Legionella antigen testing was negative, so levofloxacin was stopped.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is currently on low-dose pressors to manage his hypotension. Close monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic status is essential to adjust the dose of the pressors appropriately.

2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has symptoms of pneumonia, including fever, elevated white blood cell count, pleuritic pain, and productive cough. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and blood and urine cultures are pending. Monitoring for any signs of clinical improvement or deterioration is crucial.

3. Pleural Effusion: The patient had an exudative pleural effusion, which was drained during thoracentesis. Further evaluation may be required to determine the"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who is currently undergoing experimental therapy and recent chemotherapy. He presented with fever and shortness of breath at home and was found to be hypertensive on arrival in the emergency department. The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to hypotension, and he became hypotensive. Fluid boluses were administered along with dopamine IV, which resulted in decreased heart rate.

The patient underwent thoracentesis, which revealed pleural fluid consistent with exudate. He was started on Zosyn, an antibiotic. The patient also received a blood transfusion of 2 units.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on November 14th at 11:00 AM, Vancomycin on November 15th at 1:00 AM, Piperacillin on November 15th at 6:00 AM, and Levofloxacin on November 15th at 10:00 AM.

The patient is currently receiving phenylephrine infusion at 0.5 mcg/kg/min. He is also on prophylactic Heparin Sodium, as well as other medications including ativan, neo, folate, SSI, simvastatin, advair, vanco, levo, zosyn,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer on experimental therapy and recent chemotherapy. He presented with fever, shortness of breath at home, and was found to be hypotensive in the emergency department. The patient became hypotensive again and required fluid boluses and diltiazem IV with decreased heart rate. Thoracentesis was performed, draining 800cc of fluid consistent with exudate. The patient has been started on Zosyn. He received 2 units of blood transfusion. Allergies are not known. The patient has been given various antibiotics including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, Piperacillin, Levofloxacin, and Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include Ativan, Neo, Folate, SSI, Simvastatin, Advair, Vanco, Levo, Zosyn, and Diltiazem (held). The patient's medical and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 90/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's weight is 86 kg, and height is 69 inches. Central venous pressure is 20"

   neutropenic at this time.  Pleural effusion was exudative, but not an
   empyema.
   -cont. Vanc, Zosyn; Levo stopped
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   .
   # Pleuritic CP: Patient likely has PNA with fever, elevated WBC,
   pleuritic pain and productive cough. CTA did not show infiltrate
   specifically but lung mass makes asessment difficult and pt is at risk
   for post-obstructive PNA. CTA neg for PE. Alternatively, pt's CP may be
   secondary to tumor irritation of the pleura although this should not
   cause fever and leukocytosis. EKG w/o ischemic changes and trop neg.
   - tx pain as below

   # Anemia: HCT stable at  24 today.  Patient is guiac negative, no
   reports of bleeding.  Possibly multifactorial with dilutional effect
   from 3L NS and recent chemotherapy.
   - continue to monitor
   - maintain active type and screen

   # Afib: Had some RVR this am.  Will stop diltiazem and load with
   digoxin to provide rate control without decreasing BP.  Will consider
   restarting diltiazem in the future when acute issues have resolved.
   Patient is not anticoagulated [**2-15**] lung mass and prior hemoptysis.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 75yo M w/stage IV lung cancer, DM type 2, afib, HTN, CRI p/w
   pleuritic CP, PNA, hypotention and afib with RVR.
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt has been off pressors since 9pm last night.  Received
   Diltiazem this AM for HR in 120s.  BP dropped to 80s systolic.  Pt is
   asymptomatic, feels well.
   - will transfuse 1 unit PRBCs for fluid resuscitation.  NS will likely
   be excreted given SIADH.  Will hold on restarting pressors until
   effects of Dilt wear off as pt is asymptomatic.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - continue Vanc, Zosyn, for possible sepsis; levo stopped given
   legionella antigen negative
   - continue to monitor on tele
   - holding enalapril
   - Continue digoxin for rate control to minimize BP effect
   - consider restarting B-blocker for rate control once BP improves
   .
   # Decreased WBCs: Not yet neutropenic; however decreased WBCs likely
   from chemotherapy on Monday.
   - check diff today
   - will continue to monitor for neutropenia
   .
   # PNA:  Pt is immunospupressed with recent chemo therapy although not
   neutropenic at this time.  Pleural effusion was exudative, but not an
   empyema.
   -cont. Vanc, Zosyn; Levo stopped
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - f/u pleural effusion cytology
   .
   # Pleuritic CP: Patient likely has PNA with fever, elevated WBC,
   pleuritic pain and productive cough. CTA did not show infiltrate
   specifically but lung mass makes asessment difficult and pt is at risk
   for post-obstructive PNA. CTA neg for PE. Alternatively, pt's CP may be
   secondary to tumor irritation of the pleura although this should not
   cause fever and leukocytosis. EKG w/o ischemic changes and trop neg.
   - tx pain as below
   .
   # Anemia: HCT stable at  24 today.  Patient is guiac negative, no
   reports of bleeding.  Possibly multifactorial with dilutional effect
   from 3L NS and recent chemotherapy.
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs this AM
   - maintain active type and screen
   .
   # Afib: Digoxin started yesterday.  Pt was tachy this AM in the 120s,
   responded to Dilt but dropped BP.  Will reassess and consider b-blocker
   in the PM.  Patient is not anticoagulated [**2-15**] lung mass and prior
   hemoptysis.
   - Digoxin load then dose daily
   - avoid albuterol
   - consider B-blocker this afternoon; would not continue with diltiazem
   given concern of hypotension
   .
   # Non-small cell lung ca: LLL mass with met to spine s/p radiation
   - stop zofran and switch to compazine per oncology recs.  Cont. ativan
   prn to avoid nausea
   - hydrocodone or tramadol PRN
   - will continue study trial medication Anamorelin
   .
   # COPD:
   - cont advair
   - exhange ipratropium for tioroptrium
   - avoid albuterol for now
   .
   # DM 2:
   - not on medications
   - SSI
   .
   # hx CRI: creatinine at baseline
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: sc heparin, bowel regimen
   .
   #) FEN: regular diet; 1L NS with KCl today; replete other lytes.
   - nutrition consult for poor PO intake
   .
   #) Access: PIVs
   .
   #) Code Status: Full
   .
   #) Dispo: pending further work-up and treatment; may be called out to

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old man with non-small cell lung cancer, admitted with fever, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. He was weaned off neo overnight and is doing better, still tachycardic. The patient has no known drug allergies. He received various antibiotics, including levofloxacin, piperacillin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. He is currently receiving heparin sodium as prophylaxis, along with other medications such as ativan, folate, simvastatin, advair, atrovent, digoxin, and others. The patient's medical, social, and family history remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted changes. Review of systems is also unchanged except as noted below.

The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.5 Fahrenheit), current temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius (97.6 Fahrenheit), heart rate of 111 beats per minute (105-127 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 88/47 mmHg to 126/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (10-27 insp/min), and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has atrial fibrillation as his heart rhythm. His weight is currently 86 kg (admission weight: 87.5 kg), and his height is 69 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 9 mmHg (5-12 mmHg). Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,538 mL (including 400 mL of IV fluids), output of 2,840 mL (including 2,195 mL of urine), and a negative balance of -302 mL. The patient is not receiving respiratory support, with an oxygen delivery device and SpO2 of 95%. His ABG results are unavailable.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress. His eyes and conjunctiva are pale, and his breath sounds are clear. He has trace edema in both lower extremities. His skin is warm, and his neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin at 8.1 g/dL, white blood cell count at 14.7 K/uL, platelet count at 233 K/uL, creatinine at 1.2 mg/dL, blood glucose at 147 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal ranges. Imaging shows no growth in blood or urine. The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP), and other anemia. He also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and acute renal failure, among other conditions.

Plan:
1. Continue beta-blocker for heart rate control, considering discontinuation of digoxin as it has had"

   A/P: 75yo M w/stage IV lung cancer, DM type 2, afib, HTN, CRI p/w
   pleuritic CP, PNA, hypotention and afib with RVR.
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt has been off pressors since 9pm last night.  Received
   Diltiazem this AM for HR in 120s.  BP dropped to 80s systolic.  Pt is
   asymptomatic, feels well.
   - will transfuse 1 unit PRBCs for fluid resuscitation.  NS will likely
   be excreted given SIADH.  Will hold on restarting pressors until
   effects of Dilt wear off as pt is asymptomatic.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - continue Vanc, Zosyn, for possible sepsis; levo stopped given
   legionella antigen negative
   - continue to monitor on tele
   - holding enalapril
   - Continue digoxin for rate control to minimize BP effect
   - consider restarting B-blocker for rate control once BP improves
   .
   # Decreased WBCs: Not yet neutropenic; however decreased WBCs likely
   from chemotherapy on Monday.
   - check diff today
   - will continue to monitor for neutropenia
   .
   # PNA:  Pt is immunospupressed with recent chemo therapy although not
   neutropenic at this time.  Pleural effusion was exudative, but not an
   empyema.
   -cont. Vanc, Zosyn; Levo stopped
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - f/u pleural effusion cytology
   .
   # Pleuritic CP: Patient likely has PNA with fever, elevated WBC,
   pleuritic pain and productive cough. CTA did not show infiltrate
   specifically but lung mass makes asessment difficult and pt is at risk
   for post-obstructive PNA. CTA neg for PE. Alternatively, pt's CP may be
   secondary to tumor irritation of the pleura although this should not
   cause fever and leukocytosis. EKG w/o ischemic changes and trop neg.
   - tx pain as below
   .
   # Anemia: HCT stable at  24 today.  Patient is guiac negative, no
   reports of bleeding.  Possibly multifactorial with dilutional effect
   from 3L NS and recent chemotherapy.
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs this AM
   - maintain active type and screen
   .
   # Afib: Digoxin started yesterday.  Pt was tachy this AM in the 120s,
   responded to Dilt but dropped BP.  Will reassess and consider b-blocker
   in the PM.  Patient is not anticoagulated [**2-15**] lung mass and prior
   hemoptysis.
   - Digoxin load then dose daily
   - avoid albuterol
   - consider B-blocker this afternoon; would not continue with diltiazem
   given concern of hypotension
   .
   # Non-small cell lung ca: LLL mass with met to spine s/p radiation
   - stop zofran and switch to compazine per oncology recs.  Cont. ativan
   prn to avoid nausea
   - hydrocodone or tramadol PRN
   - will continue study trial medication Anamorelin
   .
   # COPD:
   - cont advair
   - exhange ipratropium for tioroptrium
   - avoid albuterol for now

   - not on medications
   - SSI
   .
   # hx CRI: creatinine at baseline
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: sc heparin, bowel regimen
   .
   #) FEN: regular diet; 1L NS with KCl today; replete other lytes.
   - nutrition consult for poor PO intake
   .
   #) Access: PIVs

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 75yo M w/stage IV lung cancer, DM type 2, afib, HTN, CRI p/w
   pleuritic CP, PNA, hypotention and afib with RVR.
   # Afib:  Metoprolol increased to 50 q 6 hours, but pt still tachy in
   110s-120s, with occasional breakthrough to 140s.  Digoxin started
   yesterday, and therapeutic today.  This AM pt has BP in 90s to 100s,
   and has dropped pressures in response to dilt in past..  Patient is not
   anticoagulated [**2-15**] lung mass and prior hemoptysis.  Asymptomatic
   throughout.  Increased difficulty controlling may be due to large lung
   mass resulting in pressure on atria.
   -Contact cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1867**] re: optimal rate control approach
   - Digoxin load then dose daily
   - avoid albuterol
   # Hypotension: Pt has been off pressors for several days..  Received
   Diltiazem this AM for HR in 120s.  Pt is asymptomatic, feels well.
   Hypotn may well have been [**2-15**] pneumonia.  Blood cx and sputum cx are
   pending.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - continue Vanc, Zosyn, for possible sepsis; levo stopped given
   legionella antigen negative
   - continue to monitor on tele
   - holding enalapril
   - Continue digoxin for rate control to minimize BP effect
   .
   # Decreased WBCs: Patient has ANC of 900, and has not yet reached
   nadir; will likely become neutropenic.  On vanco and Zosyn today, may
   take off once all cultures come back negative.
   -          f/u cx, then consider d/cing antibiotics
   -          If pt spikes, re-start vanco and Zosyn and reculture.
   #Pleural effusion:  Pleural effusion was exudative, but not an
   empyema.
   - f/u pleural effusion cytology
   .
   # Pleuritic CP: Patient likely has PNA with fever, elevated WBC,
   pleuritic pain and productive cough. CTA did not show infiltrate
   specifically but lung mass makes asessment difficult and pt is at risk
   for post-obstructive PNA. CTA neg for PE. Alternatively, pt's CP may be
   secondary to tumor irritation of the pleura although this should not
   cause fever and leukocytosis. EKG w/o ischemic changes and trop neg.
   - tx pain as below
   .
   # Anemia: HCT stable at  24 today.  Patient is guiac negative, no
   reports of bleeding.  Possibly multifactorial with dilutional effect
   from 3L NS and recent chemotherapy.
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs this AM
   - maintain active type and screen
   .

   # Non-small cell lung ca: LLL mass with met to spine s/p radiation
   - stop zofran and switch to compazine per oncology recs.  Cont. ativan
   prn to avoid nausea
   - hydrocodone or tramadol PRN
   - will continue study trial medication Anamorelin
   #SIADH- likely contributing to decreasing sodium.  Given hypotension,
   not worth fluid restricting.
   # COPD:
   - cont advair
   - exhange ipratropium for tioroptrium
   - avoid albuterol for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with stage IV lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for pleuritic chest pain, pneumonia, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is irregularly irregular, and he has been experiencing episodes of supra ventricular tachycardia despite being on metoprolol. Digoxin has been started and is at therapeutic levels. The patient's large lung mass may be exerting pressure on the atria, making rate control difficult.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been off pressors for several days but has been given diltiazem to control his heart rate in the 120s. The patient is asymptomatic and feels well, but there is a possibility that his hypotension may be related to recent pneumonia. Blood cultures are pending.
3. Decreased White Blood Cells (WBCs): The patient's ANC is 900 and has not yet reached its nadir. He is expected to become neutropenic soon. The patient is currently on vancomycin and Zosyn, but once all cultures come back negative, the antibiotics may be discontinued. If the patient spikes a fever, the antibiotics will be restarted and recultured."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old male with stage IV lung cancer, diabetes type 2, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency presenting with pleuritic chest pain, pneumonia, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
- The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with recent episodes of hypotension. He was given Diltiazem for rate control, which resulted in a further drop in blood pressure. A unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) was transfused for fluid resuscitation due to the hypotension.
- The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for possible sepsis, although levofloxacin was stopped due to a negative legionella antigen.
- The patient's white blood cell count is slightly decreased, likely due to chemotherapy. It is important to monitor for neutropenia.
- The patient has a pleural effusion, which was exudative but not an empyema. Cultures and cytology of the pleural fluid will be followed up.
- The patient's pain is managed with pain medications as described below.
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration is low, possibly due to dilutional effects from recent chemotherapy. A unit of PRBCs was transfused to address the anemia.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation is being treated with digoxin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old male with stage IV lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type 2, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency. He presented with pleuritic chest pain, pneumonia, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
- The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuating vital signs and frequent interventions.
- He has been receiving multiple medications including metoprolol, heparin, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and digoxin.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated troponin T, and abnormal kidney function.
- The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has undergone several procedures such as angiography and central line placements.
- Potential medical complications include sepsis, acute kidney injury, arrhythmias, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and positive cultures suggest an ongoing infection, which can progress to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's decreased hemoglobin and abnormal kidney function tests indicate possible acute kidney injury, likely due to factors such as hypotension, medication use, or underlying chronic renal insufficiency.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent episodes of"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 75yo M w/stage IV lung cancer, DM type 2, afib, HTN, CRI p/w
   pleuritic CP, PNA, hypotention and afib with RVR.
   # Afib: After episode of Afib in 170s with hypotension, metoprolol
   increased to 75 mg PO q 6 hours, and patient has subsequently done
   well, with rates in 100s and better controlled BP.  Patient also on
   digoxin, at therapeutic levels. Patient is not anticoagulated [**2-15**] lung
   mass and prior hemoptysis.  Asymptomatic throughout.  Increased
   difficulty controlling may be due to large lung mass resulting in
   pressure on atria.
   -Continue 75 mg PO q 6 hours
   - Check digoxin level
   - avoid albuterol
   # Pericardial effusion/ EKG changes- Pt had EKG changes from baseline,
   with diffuse T wave abnormalities, in no geographic distribution, and
   without cardiac enzyme elevation.  Pericarditis most likely diagnosis,
   and echo showed no constrictive physiology or tamponade.  NSAIDs
   previously held due to uncertainty re: need to start ASA, and patient
   is asymptomatic.  If patient is to receive medication for pericarditis,
   indomethacin would be preferred to ibuprofen.
   -given that patient is asymptomatic, hold indomethacin
   -if patient becomes hypotensive, low threshold for echocardiogram to
   rule out tamponade
   # Decreased WBCs: Patient has ANC of 540, borderline neutropenic, and
   has not yet reached nadir; will likely become neutropenic.  On vanco
   and Zosyn for post-obstructive pneumonia, which is more likely to
   remain given anatomic abnormalities [**2-15**] malignancy
   -          Continue antibiotics pending results of blood cultures
   -          If pt spikes, re-culture.
   # Hypotension: Pt has been off pressors for several days.  Pt is
   asymptomatic, feels well.  Hypotn may well have been [**2-15**] pneumonia.
   Blood cx and sputum cx are pending.  Occasional mild hypotension due to
   atrial fibrillation.  Finally,  patient is still likely behind on
   fluids from poor POs.
   -Continue antibiotics as above
   - continue to monitor on tele
   - holding enalapril
   - Continue digoxin for rate control to minimize BP effect
   #Pleural effusion:  Pleural effusion was exudative, but not an empyema.
    [**Month (only) 11**] be malignant, but given lack of symptoms, would be unlikely to
   benefit from pleurex catheter at this time.
   -          f/u pleural effusion cytology
   -          consider repeat chest CT before leaving hospital to evaluate
   pneumonia.

   # Anemia: HCT stable at  24 today.  Patient is guiac negative, no
   reports of bleeding.  Possibly multifactorial with dilutional effect
   from 3L NS and recent chemotherapy.
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs this AM
