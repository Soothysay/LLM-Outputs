   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6446**] is a 60 year old male with past medical history of alcohol
   abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF, and COPD who
   presented intubated after witnessed seizure in the emergency
   department.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated in setting of seizure in
   order to protect airway and in anticipation of large anticipated doses
   of sedating medications. Per report there was no respiratory distress
   prior to intubation, and no significant amount of secretions. Chest
   x-ray with small bilateral effusions and atelectasis, however has a
   history of chronic effusions and is status-post VATS in [**2182**].
   - Wean to pressure support, decrease FiO2 and follow serial ABGs, will
   hope for SBT in morning and extubation if he is requiring only minimal
   ventilator support
   - If making secretions, will send off sputum cultures
   - Albuterol/atrovent MDI's
   - Balance need for sedation for withdrawal symptoms with attempting to
   not over suppress respiratory drive
   .
   #) Seizure: Patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal seizures, as
   well as intracranial hemorrhage. It is unknown when exactly his last
   drink was, and if he sustained any recent trauma, however head CT
   preliminary read was negative for any new pathology. His electrolytes
   appear to be within normal limits, however his phenytoin level is low
   at 3.6. It is unknown which, and how much, anti-seizure medications he
   was taking prior to admission. Correct dilantin level for albumin is
   4.29.
   - Will discuss with neurology benefits of reloading patient with
   dilantin. It remains unclear if he has seizures outside of alcohol
   withdrawal, but his prior bleeds may serve as a focus of irritation for
   further seizures. After discussing with neurology, will give additional
   dose of 500 mg of dilantin, then resume 250 mg [**Hospital1 7**] dosing, following up
   levels.
   - Follow up final head CT read
   - Monitor and repeat electrolytes closely (added on magnesium, calcium,
   phosphate)
   .
   #) History of alcohol withdrawal: Patient already on versed drip for
   sedation, which will also serve to help with any withdrawal.
   - IVF repletion
   - Monitor and replete electrolytes aggressively
   - Valium 10 mg Q10-15 minutes PRN CIWA >10, as load with valium will
   attempt to wean versed drip off, then plan for extubation
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Appears to be in atrial fibrillation. Improved with IVF
   and after treating withdrawal with benzodiazepams. Blood pressure is
   stable and does not appear to be in sustained RVR.
   - Continue to monitor trend on telemetry
   .
   #) Hand erythema: Not overly convincing at present for cellulitis,
   however will continue to monitor. He received a dose of vancomycin in
   the ED for possible cellulitis.
   .
   #) Diastolic CHF: Per records, patient has a history of diastolic CHF,
   however there are no echocardiograms in our system.
   - Monitoring BP, respiratory status closely.
   .
   #) COPD: Per records from last admission, patient was treated with
   albuterol, flovent, and spiriva. Currently he has no evidence of
   exacerbation.
   - Continue albuterol, flovent. Holding spiriva while intubated.
   .
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Per report, patient has not been on
   anticoagulation as outpatient, and ASA was held during last admission
   in [**2184-9-22**] due to his intracranial bleeding. He is likely not a
   candidate for anticoagulation given history of multiple types of
   bleeding and falls with seizures.
   - Monitor rate, no anticoagulation given history of intracerebral bleed
   and falls
   - repleting mg
   .
   #) Esophageal adenocarcinoma: Patient is status-post treatment, unclear
   if this has been followed up regularly. Not an acute issue--no mets
   noted on CT scan, however could miss these. Would consider MRI once
   withdrawal symptoms treated.
   .
   #) History of intraparenchymal hemorrhage, subdural: Per inital report,
   no new findings on head CT.
   - Follow up final head CT [**Location (un) **], mental status once off sedation and
   extubated.
   .
   #) Anemia: Per OMR records, patient's baseline during last stay appears
   to be 28-30. His MCV is 91.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Checking folate, B12 (although has reported allergy to folic acid,
   however he was given a dose in ED), iron studies
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF, and COPD. He presented intubated after a witnessed seizure in the emergency department. The patient is currently receiving invasive ventilation, and various medications including midazolam, dilantin, and heparin sodium.

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.9°C (100.2°F), while the current temperature is within normal range at 36.1°C (97°F). The heart rate is stable at 92 bpm, with a range of 89-121 bpm. Blood pressure readings show both systolic and diastolic values within normal limits. The respiratory rate is set at 14 breaths per minute with spontaneous respiration not recorded. The oxygen saturation level is maintained at 99%.

The patient's weight is currently 85.2 kg, which is slightly higher than the admission weight of 80 kg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,007 mL and an output of 1,707 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 820 mL. The patient has received a total of 1,230 mL of intravenous fluids.

The respiratory support indicates the use of an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode, set tidal volume (Vt) at 600 mL, respiratory rate (RR"

","Summary of Progress Note:
Mr. [Known lastname 6446] is a 60-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF, and COPD. He presented intubated after a witnessed seizure in the emergency department.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/77 mmHg to 139/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, receiving midazolam (Versed) and dilantin. He is also receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure, with a concern for aspiration given increased secretions. There are bilateral effusions seen on a chest X-ray, but no localized infiltrates. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and consider extubation this morning after sending sputum cultures. Albuterol/atrovent MDI's have been prescribed, and sedation with valium has been weaned off versed.

There is uncertainty regarding the seizure history, whether it is related to withdrawal, subdural hematoma (SDH), or primary epilepsy. A head CT was negative, but a follow-up final head CT read is pending."

 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6446**] is a 60 year old male with past medical history of alcohol
   abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF, and COPD who
   presented intubated after witnessed seizure in the emergency
   department.
   #) Respiratory failure: Patient was intubated in setting of seizure in
   order to protect airway and in anticipation of large anticipated doses
   of sedating medications, without any respiratory distress. CXR with
   bilateral effusions but no localized infiltrates. Given increased
   secretions now, concerning for aspiration.
   - SBT and extubation this morning after sending sputum cultures
   - Albuterol/atrovent MDI's
   - Sedation with valium, weaned of versed.
   - monitor closely for flash pulm edema insetting of reported diastolic
   CHF with removal of positive pressure.  Consider lasix prn, esp now
   that has received 2L IVF.
   #) Seizure: Unclear if seizure history is purely in setting of
   withdrawal or SDH or primary epilepsy. Reports last drink day prior to
   admission, alcohol level zero. No apparent trauma, head CT prelim was
   negative.
   - s/p dilantin dose and restarted home dose (level previously low)
   - Follow up final head CT read
   - follow and replete lytes
   #) History of alcohol withdrawal: On large doses of Valium per CIWA
   - IVF repletion
   - Folate (taken without reaction), MVI, thiamine
   #) Afib: Unclear if takes BB at home. Likely worsened by stress of
   withdrawal and low magnesium.
   - No anticoagulation given h/o falls and SDH
   #) Hand erythema: Not overly convincing at present for cellulites as no
   tenderness or warmth. He received a dose of vancomycin in the ED for
   possible cellulitis.
   - holding Abx for now.
   #) Diastolic CHF: Per records, patient has a history of diastolic CHF.
   - will check ECHO
   #) COPD: Per records from last admission, patient was treated with
   albuterol, flovent, and spiriva. Currently he has no evidence of
   exacerbation.
   - Continue albuterol, flovent. Holding spiriva while intubated.
   #) Esophageal adenocarcinoma: Patient is status-post treatment, unclear

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is Mr. [**Known lastname 6446**], a 60-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF, and COPD who presented intubated after experiencing a witnessed seizure in the emergency department.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving invasive ventilation. The trans thoracic echo shows mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity sizes and global biventricular systolic function, and a dilated ascending aorta. These findings indicate that the patient has mild pulmonary hypertension and mild left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved systolic function.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/98 to 176/114 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient's weight is 85.2 kg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, glucose level of 86 mg/dL, sodium level of 105 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.1 mEq/L, chloride level of 23 mEq/L, magnesium level of 1.9 mg/dL, and a blood urea nitrogen level of 11 mg/dL. The creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL, and the total CO2 level is 29.

The patient's imaging studies reveal mild dilation of the left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function, mild dilation of the aortic root at the sinus level, and mild dilation of the ascending aorta. There are no significant abnormalities detected in the mitral or aortic valves. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation is seen, and there is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Based on the patient's clinical presentation and the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include respiratory failure, seizure, alcohol withdrawal, atrial fibrillation, hand erythema, diastolic congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), esophageal adenocarcinoma, and falls with subsequent subdural hematoma (SDH).

These potential complications will require close monitoring and appropriate management by the healthcare team in the ICU. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to prevent further episodes of respiratory failure. Seizure management may involve continuing antiepileptic medication and ensuring electrolyte balance. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms should be managed with appropriate sedation and benzodiazepines. Atrial fibrillation management may include rate control and anticoagulation, depending on the patient's risk factors. Hand erythema should be reassessed for signs of cellul"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a past medical history of alcohol abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient presented to the emergency department intubated after a witnessed seizure.

Over the course of the day, the patient underwent several medical interventions, including a trans-thoracic echo, invasive ventilation, and blood product transfusions. The patient's condition was assessed using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA) scale, which indicated a score of 11-14. The patient was oriented to person only and did not know the place or date. He also displayed aggressive behavior, pulling out his IV and removing other monitoring devices.

The patient received Valium every 2 hours to manage alcohol withdrawal symptoms. A sitter was assigned to the patient overnight to ensure safety precautions were maintained. The patient's vital signs were monitored, and he required frequent reorientation.

The patient's lab results showed elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), and normal platelet count (Plt). Electrolyte levels were within normal range. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicated respiratory alkalosis. An echocardiogram revealed mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, mild symmetric left ventricular hypert"

   Imaging: [**3-14**] ECHO
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic
   function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
   motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The aortic root is mildly
   dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity sizes and global
   biventricular systolic function. Dilated ascending aorta.
   CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   Based on [**2182**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo
   findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions
   regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
   echocardiographic data.
   Assessment and Plan
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
   Mr. [**Known lastname 6446**] is a 60 year old male with past medical history of alcohol
   abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF, and COPD who
   presented intubated after witnessed seizure in the emergency
   department.
   #) Respiratory failure: resolved.  Now extubated.
   - Try to obtain pulse ox, pt currently refusing.
   #) Seizure: Unclear if seizure history is purely in setting of
   withdrawal or SDH or primary epilepsy. Reports last drink day prior to
   admission, alcohol level zero. No apparent trauma, head CT prelim was
   negative.
   - s/p dilantin dose and restarted home dose (level previously low)
   - follow and replete lytes
   #) History of alcohol withdrawal: On large doses of Valium per CIWA
   - Folate (taken without reaction), MVI, thiamine
   #) Afib: Unclear if takes BB at home. Likely worsened by stress of
   withdrawal and low magnesium.
   - No anticoagulation given h/o falls and SDH
   #) Hand erythema: Not overly convincing at present for cellulites as no
   tenderness or warmth. He received a dose of vancomycin in the ED for
   possible cellulitis.
   - holding Abx for now.
   #) Diastolic CHF: Per records, patient has a history of diastolic CHF.
   - ECHO did not show e/o diastolic dysfunction
   #) COPD: Per records from last admission, patient was treated with
   albuterol, flovent, and spiriva. Currently he has no evidence of
   exacerbation.
   - Continue albuterol, flovent. Holding spiriva while intubated.
   #) Esophageal adenocarcinoma: Patient is status-post treatment, unclear
   if this has been followed up regularly. Not an acute issue--no mets
   noted on CT scan, however could miss these. Would consider MRI once
   withdrawal symptoms treated.
   #) FEN: NPO, lytes prn, IVF prn
   #) PPx: SQH, PPI
   #) ACCESS: PIV
   #) FULL CODE
   #) Dispo: transfer to floor

","Summary of Progress Note:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6446**], a 60-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, seizures, intracranial bleed, diastolic CHF, and COPD, was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a witnessed seizure in the emergency department. He presented intubated and required invasive ventilation. The patient's CIWA score ranged from 11 to 14, indicating alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He was aggressive, disoriented, and uncooperative, pulling out his IV and refusing blood draws. The patient received Valium every 2 hours and showed some improvement as the night progressed. A sitter was assigned to ensure patient safety. His allergies include penicillins, ampicillin, and folic acid.

24-hour events included a trans thoracic echo, invasive ventilation initiation and termination, and administration of various medications such as midazolam, heparin sodium, metoprolol, and others. The patient's vital signs were monitored, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient had a history of seizures, and an ABG showed a pH of 7.48, indicating respiratory alkalosis. Physical examination revealed dysarthria without ataxia, and the patient refused further examination. The patient's labs showed elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Imaging revealed mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, mild symmetric left"
