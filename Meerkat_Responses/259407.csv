","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure, deep vein thrombosis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, and recent admission for caudo equina syndrome due to metastasis and missed hemodialysis. He presented with altered mental status, tachypnea, and hypoxemia after his hemodialysis session yesterday. The patient is on multiple medications including proton pump inhibitors, statins, antiplatelet agents, antibiotics, and other medications for his various conditions.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Delirium: The patient displays signs of delirium, including confusion and telling stories that are not true. There is no evidence of brain metastasis on head CT.
2. Tachycardia: The cause of the patient's tachycardia is unclear, possibly due to pain and lack of beta-blocker use, which has improved since.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has chronically elevated white blood cell count, but there is no evidence of a new infection.
4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension.
5. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient is on hemodialysis.
6. Left Common Femoral Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a DVT and is currently not taking Coumadin due to a high INR level.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted for cauda equina syndrome due to metastasis and missed HD. The patient developed altered mental status, tachypnea, and hypoxemia after HD yesterday. He received intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and chest X-ray, which showed bilateral opacities consistent with metastasis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has delusions, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. He also has a history of chronic systolic HF, spinal mets, and CAD. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and delusions suggest delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, metabolic disturbances, or medications.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, but the cause is unclear. It could be due to pain, lack of beta-blocker medication, or another underlying condition.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which can indicate an infection or inflammation. However, there is no evidence of new infection.
4. Hypertension: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old individual with a history of metastatic lung cancer and cauda equina syndrome. They were admitted to the ICU with complaints of chest pain and back pain following dialysis. The patient is tachycardic, delirious, and experiencing respiratory alkalosis and metabolic alkalosis. They have a mild troponin elevation, which may indicate possible mild demand ischemia, although it does not appear to be an acute event. Imaging results show no evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection but reveal unchanged appearances of innumerable bilateral spiculated pulmonary nodules, low-attenuation foci within the liver, and multiple osseous metastatic lesions, consistent with metastatic disease. The patient's chest X-ray shows multifocal bilateral parenchymal opacities, which are likely due to known bilateral metastatic disease, although there is a slight possibility of underlying pneumonia at the left base. The patient has been started on ASA, beta-blocker, and statin therapy. They are also on a decelerating dose of steroids. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, but there is uncertainty regarding their wishes, and this will be discussed with the family today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows opacities that could be indicative of pneumonia. It is important to monitor the patient for signs of infection and consider appropriate treatment if necessary."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with metastatic lung cancer and cauda equina syndrome. He presented with complaints of chest pain and back pain after dialysis, and was found to be tachycardic, tachypneic, and delirious. The patient and his wife agreed to be DNR/DNI and plan to send him home with hospice care after his hospital stay.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely secondary to pain and withdrawal of beta blocker therapy. Pain control measures, such as oxycontin/oxycodone and lidocaine patch, should be implemented.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, characterized by tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis. This may be related to underlying malignancy. Pain control measures should be continued to alleviate respiratory distress.
3. Delirium: The patient appears to be delirious, likely secondary to pain and steroids. Lidocaine patch for pain control may help avoid systemic toxicity.
4. Metastatic lung cancer with spinal mets, cauda equina: There are no chemotherapy options available for this condition. Continuing the decadron taper is recommended.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be secondary to decadron. Defer antibiotics at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with metastatic lung cancer, cauda equina syndrome, and chronic renal failure on hemodialysis. He presented with chest pain and back pain after dialysis, tachycardia, tachypnea, and delirium. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and adhesive tape. His vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 126/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission. 

Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary: The patient has a new infiltrate on chest X-ray, which may indicate the development of right basilar consolidation. This could be a sign of pneumonia, and if accompanied by spikes in fever or hypoxia, coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) should be considered.
2. Cardiac: The patient experienced chest pain and had mild troponin elevation, which could be related to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and potential demand ischemia. However, a cardiac troponin test was negative, and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed no signs of pulmonary embolism (PE) or dissection. Therefore, it is likely that the chest pain and troponin elevation are secondary to progression of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and metastatic poorly differentiated cancer. He is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, likely due to volume overload from a missed HD session. The patient's current complaints include respiratory distress. The family has discussed goals of care, with a likely do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status. There is ongoing discussion regarding the role of HD and decisions for home hospice.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening metastatic disease leading to respiratory distress.
2. Volume overload from missed HD session.
3. Chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation.
4. Delirium or altered mental status.
5. Leukocytosis without evidence of infection.
6. Coumadin use with high INR levels.
7. Poor glycemic control.
8. Potential for further complications related to ESRD."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple medical problems including congestive heart failure (CHF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and metastatic poorly differentiated cancer.
- He has been admitted multiple times recently, most recently for respiratory failure requiring intubation due to volume overload from a missed HD session.
- The patient's current chief complaint is respiratory distress.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate between 64-122 bpm, blood pressure between 117/61 mmHg and 156/70 mmHg, respiratory rate between 11-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.
- The patient is not responding to commands or voice, only to tactile stimuli.
- Labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased hematocrit and troponin T levels.
- The patient's ESRD requires hemodialysis tomorrow, and his Coumadin is on hold due to high INR.
- The patient has chronic systolic heart failure and worsening metastatic disease, which may be causing his tachypnea.
- The patient's prognosis is very poor, and a family meeting has been planned to discuss goals of care, including the possibility of do not resuscitate/do not intubate/do not hospitalize (DNR/DNI/DNH) and decisions regarding going home with hospice.
- The patient's nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and communication plan will be reviewed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and high respiratory rate indicate a risk of respiratory failure. This could be due to worsening metastatic disease or volume overload from missed HD sessions.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible infection, although there is no evidence of infection mentioned in the note.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status/delirium is worsening, which may affect his ability to respond to commands or voice, and could potentially lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's history of missed HD sessions and signs of fluid overload (e.g., decreased blood pressure) suggest a risk of fluid overload, which can worsen heart failure and other complications.
5. Bleeding: The high INR indicates a potential risk for bleeding, especially considering the patient's use of Coumadin and the need to hold it.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CHF and systolic heart failure increases the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or exacerbation of heart failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 y/o with metastatic lung cancer c/b cspine mets and cauda equina
   syndrome, here with complaints of chest pain and back pain after
   dialysis, found to be tachycardic, tachypnic, and delirous.
   .
   Pulmonary: New infiltrate on CXR from yesterday although may have been
   component of volume overload as was pre-HD, if spikes fever or becomes
   hypoxic would likely need coverage of HAP as has been in-house
   >72hours.
   - Sputum sample today
   - Repeat CXR.
   Chest pain:  Mild troponin elevation c/w ESRD and ? mild demand
   ischemia.  Does not appear to have been acute event.  CTA is negative
   for PE and dissection and also in the setting of an INR of 5.  Troponin
   elevated from baseline but negative CKs and EKG essentially unchanged.
   Likely secondary to progression of underlying lung cancer
   - Continue ASA, beta block, statin.  Consider discontinuing medical
   management of coronary artery disease per discussion with palliative
   care.
   .
   Tachycardia: Likely secondary to pain and withdrawl of beta blocker
   -Pain control with oxycontin/oxycodone and lidocaine patch
   .
   Respiratory distress: Tachypneic and in respiratory alkalosis on
   admission.  Also found to be hypoxic secondary to mucous plugging.
   Likely related to underlying malignancy.
   -Pain control
   .
   Delirium, Pain: appears secondary to pain and steroids.
   - Lidocaine patch for pain control as may avoid systemic toxicity
   .
   Metastatic lung cancer with spinal mets, cauda equina: No chemo options
   -continue decadron taper
   .
   Leukocytosis: CT chest unchanged, and patchy opacities likely secondary
   to mets.  Sputum sample is negative.  Likely secondary to decadron
   -Defer antibiotics at this time
   .
   Anemia: At baseline
   .
   Supratherapeutic INR: holding coumadin for now, will reconsider long
   term benefit given goals of care.  INR supratherapeutic yesterday.
   .
   Renal failure: HD yesterday.
   .
   Code: yesterday patient had said he would like to be DNR/DNI, and to go

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with metastatic lung cancer and cauda equina syndrome. He was admitted to the ICU with complaints of chest pain and back pain after dialysis. The patient is tachycardic, tachypneic, and delirious. He has an elevated white blood cell count and troponin levels. The patient's chest pain is likely due to progression of underlying lung cancer. His respiratory distress is related to underlying malignancy and mucous plugging. The patient's delirium is secondary to pain and steroids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Development of right basilar consolidation - The patient has a new infiltrate on CXR, which may indicate the development of right basilar consolidation.
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) - The patient has been in the hospital for more than 72 hours, increasing the risk for HAP. Spikes in fever or hypoxia could suggest this complication.
3. Coronary artery disease - The patient has mild troponin elevation, which may indicate demand ischemia due to chest pain. However, a cardiac troponin elevation could also suggest acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE) - The patient's tachycardia and chest pain could be indicative of a PE. However, a CTA was negative for PE and dissection.
5. Delirium - The patient is delir"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M with MMP including CHF, DVT, ESRD on HD, metastatic poorly
   differentiated CA, likely NSLCA. He is s/p multiple recent
   admissions, most recently from [**3-7**] - [**2198-3-22**] for respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, thought due to volume overload
   from a missed HD session.
   Anemia: may have been spurious lab, only bumped to 25, possible
   etiologies would be GI- not obvious, RP bleed or rectal sheath
   hempatoma (does have an elevated INR) In terms of how aggressivel yot
   pursue we need to further clarify goals of care
   Tachycardia:  Resolved with beta-blocker
   Tachypnea:  RR is still a little high, but oxygenation is adequate on
   RA.  Likely due to worsening metastatic disease
   Leukocytosis:  No evidence of infection.
   ESRD: HD tomorrow
   Left DVT: Coumadin on hold with high INR
   Chronic systolic HF
   Altered mental status/delirium:  worse this AM, not repsonding to staff
   or family
   Given performance status/decubes, etc.  Prognosis overall is very poor.
   Plan for family meeting today at 2:30 and Pallicative Care to return
   for formal follow up as well.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including congestive heart failure (CHF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and metastatic poorly differentiated cancer, likely non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient has had recent admissions for respiratory failure requiring intubation, thought to be due to volume overload from a missed HD session.

The patient's current issues include anemia, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, ESRD requiring HD tomorrow, left DVT with Coumadin on hold due to high INR, chronic systolic heart failure, and altered mental status/delirium. The patient's prognosis is very poor given his performance status and other factors.

Plan:
- Family meeting today at 2:30 to discuss prognosis and goals of care.
- Palliative care to return for formal follow-up.
- Continue ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's recent admission for respiratory failure and ongoing tachypnea indicate a risk of further respiratory compromise.
2. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis without evidence of infection suggests a potential risk for developing infections while in the ICU.
3. Bleeding: The elevated"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the patient is in the ICU due to the presence of various interventions and treatments mentioned in the note.

The patient received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to increase their hematocrit (HCT) to 16.9. They have an allergy to penicillins and adhesive tape, resulting in a rash.

The patient is currently on several medications, including oxycodone, pantoprazole, Dex taper, lopressor, lidocaine patch, and Tylenol. The last dose of antibiotics is not specified.

There are no reported changes to the patient's medical history, social history, family history, or review of systems except where noted above and below.

The flow sheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant information. The patient's temperature is within normal range, with a maximum recorded temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F) and a current temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F). Their heart rate is stable at 72 beats per minute, with a blood pressure range of 126/56-134/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M with MMP including CHF, DVT, ESRD on HD, metastatic poorly
   differentiated CA, likely NSLCA. He is s/p multiple recent
   admissions, most recently from [**3-7**] - [**2198-3-22**] for respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, thought due to volume overload
   from a missed HD session.
   Anemia: may have been spurious lab, only bumped to 25, possible
   etiologies would be GI- not obviously bleeding however, versus RP bleed
   or rectal sheath hematoma (does have an elevated INR) In terms of how
   aggressively  to pursue we need to further clarify goals of care with
   sons. [**Name (NI) **] repeat hct this afternoon.
   Tachypnea:  RR is still a little high, but oxygenation is adequate on
   RA.  Likely due to worsening metastatic disease
   Leukocytosis:  No evidence of infection. All cx neg to date- ?
   ESRD: HD tomorrow
   Left DVT: Coumadin on hold with high INR
   Chronic systolic HF
   Altered mental status/delirium:  improved after HD
   Given performance status/decubes, etc.  Prognosis overall is very poor.
   Pt will be chaning his HCP to his son [**Name (NI) 591**] [**Name (NI) 2547**] and we are awaiting

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple medical problems including congestive heart failure (CHF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and metastatic poorly differentiated cancer. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times, most recently for respiratory failure requiring intubation due to volume overload from a missed HD session.

The patient's current condition includes anemia with a hematocrit (HCT) of 16.9%, which may be spurious or due to gastrointestinal bleeding, rectal sheath hematoma, or retroperitoneal bleed. Tachypnea is present with a respiratory rate (RR) still slightly high, but oxygenation is adequate on room air. Leukocytosis is noted with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 20.5, but there is no evidence of infection as all cultures are negative.

The patient has chronic systolic heart failure, altered mental status/delirium, and is on hemodialysis for ESRD. His prognosis is very poor given his performance status and other comorbidities. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleeding: The patient may have an underlying gastrointestinal bleed contributing to his anemia. This can be confirmed through further evaluation such as end"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M with MMP including CHF, DVT, ESRD on HD, metastatic poorly
   differentiated CA, likely NSLCA. He is s/p multiple recent
   admissions, most recently from [**3-7**] - [**2198-3-22**] for respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, thought due to volume overload
   from a missed HD session.
   Hypoxia/Resp Distress: likely asp event based on timing and worsening
   CXR this AM. NPO Speech and Swallow eval. Need to address nutrition
   with family.
   Anemia: may have been spurious lab, only bumped to 25, stable though
   with repeat at 23. Possible etiologies would be GI- not obviously
   bleeding however, versus RP bleed or rectal sheath hematoma (does have
   an elevated INR)
   In terms of how aggressively  to pursue we need to further clarify
   goals of care with sons.
   Leukocytosis:  [**Name2 (NI) 59**] evidence of infection but suspect recurrent
   aspiration based on this AM events
    All cx neg to date- ? working theory had been steroids and no source
   of infection. Will empirically cover with Levo and Flagyl
   ESRD: HD today
   Left DVT: Coumadin on hold with high INR, get coags with HD and may
   need Vit K to get back in range
   Pain control: increased oxycontin to TID, prn breakthrough for turns
   Given performance status/decubes, etc.  Prognosis overall is very poor.

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple medical problems including congestive heart failure (CHF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and metastatic poorly differentiated cancer, likely non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He has been admitted multiple times recently, most recently for respiratory failure requiring intubation due to volume overload from a missed HD session.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia/respiratory distress, anemia, leukocytosis, and ESRD. His leukocytosis is suspected to be due to recurrent aspiration, and he will be empirically covered with antibiotics Levo and Flagyl. His ESRD requires HD today. His left DVT treatment is on hold with a high INR, so coagulation tests will be obtained during HD and may need Vitamin K to get back in range.

The patient's prognosis is very poor, and he will be changing his healthcare provider to his son. The family's goals of care need to be clarified today. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his disposition is possible transfer to the floor, but this depends on clarifying the family's goals of care with the evolving healthcare provider.

Overall, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, infection, bleeding due to elevated INR, and further deterioration of renal function."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple comorbidities who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and adhesive tape. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/65 to 154/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery. The patient's maximum oxygen saturation dropped to the 70s after breakfast but improved after suctioning.

The patient has received Kayexylate for a potassium level of 6.1. There is no mention of any recent interventions or procedures performed. The patient's blood products and fluid balance are within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, increased creatinine level, and normal troponin-T levels. Other lab values such as potassium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's oxygen saturation dropped to the 70s after breakfast, indicating a possible respiratory issue. Continuous monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygen saturation is crucial.
2. Hypogly"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 M with MMP including CHF, DVT, ESRD on HD, metastatic poorly
   differentiated CA, likely NSLCA. He is s/p multiple recent
   admissions, most recently from [**3-7**] - [**2198-3-22**] for respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, thought due to volume overload
   from a missed HD session.
   Hypoxia/Resp Distress: likely asp event based on timing and worsenign
   CXR this AM. NPO Speech and Swallow eval. Need to address nutrition
   with family.
   Anemia: may have been spurious lab, only bumped to 25, stable though
   with repeat at 23. Possible etiologies would be GI- not obviously
   bleeding however, versus RP bleed or rectal sheath hematoma (does have
   an elevated INR)
   In terms of how aggressively  to pursue we need to further clarify
   goals of care with sons.
   Tachypnea:  RR is still a little high, but oxygenation is adequate on
   RA.  Likely due to worsening metastatic disease
   Leukocytosis:  No evidence of infection. All cx neg to date- ? working
   theory had been steroids and no source of infection.
   ESRD: HD today
   Left DVT: Coumadin on hold with high INR, get coags
   Pain control: increased oxycontin to TID, prn breakthrough for turns
   Given performance status/decubes, etc.  Prognosis overall is very poor.
   Pt will be chaning his HCP to his son [**Name (NI) 591**] [**Name (NI) 2547**] and we are awaiting

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple medical problems including congestive heart failure, deep vein thrombosis, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and metastatic poorly differentiated cancer, likely not surgically resectable. He has been admitted multiple times recently, most notably from [**3-7**] to [**2198-3-22**] for respiratory failure requiring intubation due to missed hemodialysis session. The patient's current condition includes hypoxia/respiratory distress, anemia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, and a left deep vein thrombosis on Coumadin hold with high INR. The patient's overall prognosis is very poor, and the attending physician plans to change healthcare power of attorney to the patient's son.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced oxygen saturation in the 70s after breakfast and required suctioning. This may indicate a worsening respiratory condition, possibly exacerbated by metastatic cancer or volume overload.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, but it is unclear if this is a true anemia or a spurious result. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
3. Tachypnea: The patient's respiratory rate is still elevated, likely due to worsening metastatic disease.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old individual with metastatic lung cancer and cauda equina syndrome. The patient presents with respiratory distress, likely due to the progression of underlying disease, volume overload, and aspiration events. The patient also exhibits tachycardia, possibly secondary to pain and withdrawal of beta-blocker medication, as well as delirium, likely related to pain and possibly steroids.

The patient has metastatic lung cancer with spinal mets and cauda equina syndrome, with no chemotherapy options available. Pain management is recommended, along with a continuation of morphine, oxycodone, and lidocaine patch. Steroids will be discontinued on [**4-13**], which is the end of his taper.

The patient has leukocytosis, with a WBC count of 20.5. The CT chest is unchanged, and patchy opacities are likely secondary to mets. Sputum samples are negative, suggesting that antibiotics may not be necessary at this time.

The patient has anemia, with a Hct level of 22.7. Transfusion is recommended for Hct <21. The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and Coumadin is being held for now, with plans to reconsider long-term benefit given the goals of care.

Renal failure is also present, and the patient is on HD (hemodialysis) protocol and sevelamer therapy. The patient"

   requiring intubation, thought due to volume overload
   from a missed HD session.
   1. Hypoxia/Resp Distress: likely asp. event based on timing and
   worsening CXR this AM. NPO Speech and Swallow eval. Need to address
   nutrition with family.
   2. Anemia: may have been spurious lab, only bumped to 25, stable though
   with repeat at 23. Possible etiologies would be GI- not obviously
   bleeding however, versus RP bleed or rectal sheath hematoma (does have
   an elevated INR)  In terms of how aggressively  to pursue we need to
   further clarify goals of care with sons.
   Leukocytosis:  [**Name2 (NI) 59**] evidence of infection but suspect recurrent

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple medical problems including congestive heart failure (CHF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and metastatic poorly differentiated cancer. The patient has been admitted multiple times recently, most notably for respiratory failure requiring intubation due to volume overload from a missed HD session.

The patient's current issues include hypoxia/respiratory distress, anemia, leukocytosis, and ESRD. The hypoxia is likely due to an aspiration event, and the patient requires a speech and swallow evaluation. The anemia may be spurious and could be caused by gastrointestinal bleeding, retroperitoneal bleed, or rectal sheath hematoma. The leukocytosis is evidence of infection, but the working theory is recurrent aspiration. The patient's ESRD requires ongoing management with HD.

The patient has a left DVT and is currently on Coumadin, but with a high INR, the Coumadin is on hold. The patient's pain control has been increased, and they are being turned every two hours to prevent bedsores. The patient's prognosis is very poor, and there is a plan to meet with the patient's sister to discuss changing healthcare providers.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for recurrent aspiration events, which can lead to pneumonia. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including congestive heart failure (CHF), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and metastatic poorly differentiated cancer, likely non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He has had multiple recent admissions, most recently for respiratory failure requiring intubation due to volume overload from a missed HD session.

The patient aspirated several times yesterday with eating and is currently experiencing hypoxia/respiratory distress, likely due to an aspiration event based on the timing and worsening chest X-ray this morning. A speech and swallow evaluation is needed, and nutrition needs to be addressed with the family.

The patient's anemia may have been a spurious lab result, as it was stable with a repeat at 23. Possible etiologies include gastrointestinal bleeding, retroperitoneal bleed, or rectal sheath hematoma, considering the elevated INR. Aggressive pursuit of the anemia's etiology needs further clarification of goals of care with the sons.

Leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.5 is evidence of infection, but recurrent aspiration based on this morning's events is more likely. All cultures have been negative to date, so coverage with Levo and Flagyl may be empirically given if the chest X-ray worsens today.

The patient underwent hemodialysis yesterday and has a"
