   some component of splinting due to pain.  Currently tachycardic &
   hypertensive, making adequate urine.  CT shows extensive inflammation,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of severe pancreatitis, who underwent a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. He was transferred to the ICU for severe pancreatitis, elevated lactate, and anion gap, likely complicated by ethanol (ETOH) withdrawal. The patient presented with a Ranson score of 1 and required aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation. He also has new oxygen requirements, possibly due to growing pleural effusions and some component of splinting due to pain. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of severe pancreatitis and is currently showing signs of complications such as pleural effusions and possible necrosis.
2. Ethanol Withdrawal: The patient is exhibiting symptoms of ETOH withdrawal, including increased sedation requirements and tachycardia.
3. Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure that may be due to ETOH withdrawal or pain.
4. Chronic Pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain, and it needs to be managed after weaning from the ventilator.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, and Gemfibrozil is being held due to being NPO (nothing by mouth).
6. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance needs close monitoring, as he received aggressive IV fluids.

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of severe pancreatitis and previous distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. He was transferred to the ICU due to severe pancreatitis, elevated lactate levels, and suspected ethanol withdrawal. The patient has been intubated overnight for increased CO2 levels and a CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is ordered to evaluate for necrotizing pancreatitis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is tachycardic and hypertensive. He is receiving aggressive IV fluids and sedation with propofol, midazolam, and fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest the possibility of necrotizing pancreatitis. This condition can lead to systemic inflammation, organ failure, and sepsis.
2. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and is showing signs of withdrawal. This can result in severe symptoms such as seizures, hallucinations, and delirium tremens.
3. Respiratory complications: Intubation and mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to severe pancreatitis and prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of infection, including bacterial sepsis.
5. Hypotension and shock: Aggressive fluid resuscitation may be required to maintain"

   37 y/o with PMHx of ETOH pancreatitis s/p distal pancreatectomy and
   splenectomy now transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with severe pancreatitis, elevated
   lactate & anion gap, likely complicated by ETOH withdrawal.
   .
   # Pancreatitis: Pt with h/o severe pancreatitis c/b ARDS & requiring
   splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy. Pt presented with Ransons score
   of 1 but rising lactate and requiring aggressive IVF resussitation. Pt
   with new O2 requirement likely due to growing pleural effusions with
   some component of splinting due to pain.  Currently tachycardic &
   hypertensive, making adequate urine.  CT shows extensive inflammation,
   but unable to assess for necrosis without IV contrast. Will need repeat
   imagine after elective intubation to better assess for presence of
   necrosis.
   - will electively intubate now
   - Place central venous line
   - Aggressive IV fluid boluses with LR &/or Levophed if needed to
   maintain MAP > 65 and UOP > 30cc/hr
   - f/u Surgery Recs, will need addl imaging CT vs MRI
   - add Imipenem if any e/o necrosis
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures
   - Trend WBC count & fever curve
   - Strict NPO & place OG tube to intermittent suction
   .
   # ETOH Withdrawal: Pt was being treated with Diazepam 5mg q2hr for CIWA
   scale, will transition to Fentanyl & Midazolam gtt once intubated
   - SW consult once extubated
   - Midazolam gtt for now, titrate to adequate sedation
   .
   # Asthma: Pt on mainly different inhalers, unclear baseline reactive
   airway disease or degree of medication compliance
   - albuterol & atrovent nebs after intubated
   - f/u ABGs
   .
   # Hypertension: likely due to ETOH withdrawal vs pain
   - hold anti-HTN, treat withdrawal & pain with fentanyl/versed gtt
   .
   # Chronic Pain: Pt will be NPO on fentanyl gtt while intubated
   - will need to restart chronic pain regimen including Methadone after
   wean from vent
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: holding Gemfibrozil given strict NPO
   .
   # FEN: NPO with OG tube to intermittent suction
   - replete lytes aggressively
   - aggressive IVF resussitation

   Acute respiratory failure: RR on vent increased after most recent ABG
   demonstrating resp acidosis. Will recheck ABG and adjust vent settings
   as needed.
   Sedation: Currently on Midazolam, Fentanyl, Propofol gtt.
     Suspect high sedation requirement due to chronic medicines (klonipin
   10mg daily/oxycodone/methadone at baseline) and EtOH withdrawal
     Increase Fentanyl/Midazolam and wean propofol off as tolerated

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with alcoholic pancreatitis. He was intubated overnight and a central venous line (CVL) was placed. The patient has multiple allergies, including shellfish, Topamax, and Augmentin. He is currently receiving propofol, fentanyl, and midazolam infusions, as well as other medications. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for acute respiratory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a heart rate of 135 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121-155 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 252 mg/dL. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, amylase, and lipase levels, with decreased hemoglobin and platelet count. Liver function tests indicate elevated ALT and AST levels, while kidney function tests show elevated creatinine and BUN levels. Imaging reveals small lung volumes on chest X-ray. The patient remains acutely ill but shows improvement in some laboratory values. The plan is to continue bowel rest and supportive care, with serial liver function tests and consideration for surgery. Sedation will be adjusted as needed, and close monitoring of the patient's condition will be maintained. Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory failure, worsening pancreatitis, infections due to"
