   Assessment and Plan
   37 yoF w/ a h/o DMI c/b gastroparesis, here with gastroparesis-
   developed hypoxia worsening x 2 days and subjective SOB, orthopnea and
   PND and multifocal opacities on CXR- difficult to wean from NRB
   supplemental oxygen.
   .
   Plan:
   # HYPOXIA: very large A-a gradient (>500) in the setting of a
   multifocal process on CXR.  WBC and chills but no fevers, WBC has been
   increasing and was normal on presentation as well as throughout with
   development of C diff.  She had 2 units PRBC transfused for a hct below
   baseline (baseline per OSH records was low 20s).  HCT was 20 on [**9-4**]
   and she was transfused 2 units PRBC for this on [**9-4**].  She woke up
   early that a.m. with PND and chest pressure.  She has had negative
   enzymes and lack of EKG changes.  Her CXR was initially read as
   pulmonary edema however she has no CHF history.  She continues to have
   orthopnea and PND.  Chest CT without contrast yesterday no official
   read yet but spoke with radiology - with bilateral air space opacities
   most consistent with TRALI, ARDs, or bilateral pneumonia.  V/Q scan
   completed, not yet read.
   -given proximate blood transfusion would keep TRALI at top of
   differential, sent TRALI labs to blood bank yesterday PM
   -also given obstruction and vomiting would keep aspiration and
   multifocal pneumonia as a possible source especially given wbc count,
   no cough however
   - considered pulmonary edema as a possibility however echo obtained
   yesterday is normal- The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
   septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
   aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral
   valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
   The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   -cont supportive measures, such as nebs prn and supplemental oxygen for
   possible ARDs or TRALI
   - treat for aspiration PNA with vanco/cefepime - decided to add IV
   flagyl yesterday with chest CT results
   -patient is full code, if needs intubation would do ARDS net
   ventilation strategy
   -blood cultures all no growth to date
   - urine legionella negative
   - urine culture no growth
   .
   # C diff: C diff colitis on this admission presenting with diarrhea
   however now has no diarrhea any longer and abd is benign.
   -she is on PO vancomycin, continue PO vanc, added IV flagyl for
   aspiration coverage (also good for c. diff)
   - 2 negative c diff since previous positive
   .
   # Gastroparesis and abdominal pain with associated n/v: her symptoms
   are improving.  She had a GJ tube in the past, and it was felt by GI
   that she again needed a GJ tube for both decompression and tubefeeding.
   GJ tube was placed on [**8-30**] by IR. Patient then had severe pain and it
   was noted on CT scan that she had intussusception of her duodenum into
   her stomach with gastric outlet obstruction.  She had an NGT placed
   with 1300cc of bilious fluid removed. IR emergently repositioned the
   tube.
   .
   # FEN:
   - restarted tube feeds
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: has resolved, Cr is now at baseline of 0.9.
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #. Diabetes type 1, uncontrolled, with complications of autonomic
   insufficiency, gastroparesis, and periperal neuropathy. HgbA1c was 8.0.
   -gastroparesis improving as above
   -will decrease standing insulin dose given lack of tube feeds, give
   sliding scale and adjust accordingly.
   -was on lantus 4 qam and 9qhs and sliding scale insulin prior to
   transfer but is on much greater dose at home

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of depression, bipolar disorder, diabetes type 1, and complications such as autonomic insufficiency, gastroparesis, and peripheral neuropathy. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and hypoxia, which has been worsening over the past two days. The patient also has a history of C. difficile colitis, anemia, and iron deficiency.

Upon admission, the patient was given supplemental oxygen through a non-rebreather mask. Her blood cultures showed no growth, and her urine cultures were negative. The patient received antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia, including vancomycin and cefepime. She also received IV metronidazole for aspiration coverage and treatment of C. difficile.

The patient's chest X-ray initially showed pulmonary edema, but further imaging revealed bilateral airspace opacities consistent with TRALI, ARDS, or bilateral pneumonia. A V/Q scan was completed but not yet read. The patient's 2D echocardiogram showed no evidence of pulmonary edema or other cardiac abnormalities.

The patient's gastroparesis has improved with supportive measures, and her acute renal failure has resolved. She has been started on tube feeds again and her diabetes type 1 is being managed with insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's risk factors for aspiration, such as gastroparesis, make her susceptible to developing aspiration pneumonia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 and gastroparesis. She presented with respiratory distress and has been experiencing worsening hypoxia, subjective shortness of breath, orthopnea, and pulmonary congestion. The patient's chest X-ray showed multifocal opacities, and a chest CT scan without contrast revealed bilateral airspace opacities, which are most consistent with Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI), Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), or bilateral pneumonia.

The patient's blood transfusion history includes receiving two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) on [9-4] for a hematocrit (HCT) below baseline, and she also woke up early in the morning with palpitations and chest pressure. The patient's initial CXR was read as pulmonary edema, but she has no history of congestive heart failure (CHF). An echocardiogram obtained yesterday showed a normal left atrium size, no atrial septal defect, normal left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size, normal regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%), no ventricular septal defect, normal right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion, structurally normal aortic and mitral valves with no regurgitation or stenosis, and no pericardial effusion. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was normal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of IDDM (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and gastroparesis who was admitted for worsening gastroparesis with a G-J (gastrojejunostomy) tube. The patient experienced hypoxia and respiratory distress, leading to transfer to the ICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/76 mmHg to 153/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated with an endotracheal tube and on non-rebreather oxygen delivery.

Physical examination findings reveal well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, no abnormalities in the cardiovascular system, bilateral crackles and wheezes in the lungs, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and warm skin without rash or jaundice. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movements.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose level is significantly high at 600 mg/dL. Imaging reveals extensive bilateral infiltrates with areas of ground-glass and consolidation on a CT chest scan.

","The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of IDDM (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and gastroparesis who presented with worsening gastroparesis and was placed on a G-J (gastrojejunostomy) tube. She also has a history of hypoxia and respiratory distress, leading to transfer to the ICU.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/76 to 153/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on non-rebreather oxygen and has an endotracheal tube in place.

On physical examination, she appears well-nourished and has normal pupillary reactions. Her cardiovascular examination reveals a normal pulse and normal heart sounds without murmurs. She has crackles and wheezes in her respiratory system, indicating possible pulmonary edema or infection. Her abdomen is soft with bowel sounds present, but there is tenderness on the left side post G-J tube. Her extremities are warm and well-perfused, and her neurological examination is normal.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, leukocyte count of 560 K/uL, platelet count of 404,000/uL, sodium level of 136 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L, glucose"

   Assessment and Plan
   37 yoF w/ a h/o DMI c/b gastroparesis, here with gastroparesis-
   developed hypoxia worsening x 2 days and subjective SOB, orthopnea and
   PND and multifocal opacities on CXR- difficult to wean from NRB
   supplemental oxygen.
   .
   Plan:
   # HYPOXIA: very large A-a gradient (>500) in the setting of a
   multifocal process on CXR.  WBC and chills but no fevers, WBC has been
   increasing and was normal on presentation as well as throughout with
   development of C diff.  She had 2 units PRBC transfused for a hct below
   baseline (baseline per OSH records was low 20s).  HCT was 20 on [**9-4**]
   and she was transfused 2 units PRBC for this on [**9-4**].  She woke up
   early that a.m. with PND and chest pressure.  She has had negative
   enzymes and lack of EKG changes.  Her CXR was initially read as
   pulmonary edema however she has no CHF history.  She continues to have
   orthopnea and PND.  Chest CT without contrast yesterday no official
   read yet but spoke with radiology - with bilateral air space opacities
   most consistent with TRALI, ARDs, or bilateral pneumonia.  V/Q scan
   completed, not yet read.
   -given proximate blood transfusion would keep TRALI at top of
   differential, sent TRALI labs to blood bank yesterday PM
   -also given obstruction and vomiting would keep aspiration and
   multifocal pneumonia as a possible source especially given wbc count,
   no cough however
   - considered pulmonary edema as a possibility however echo obtained
   yesterday is normal- The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
   septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
   aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral
   valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
   The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   -cont supportive measures, such as nebs prn and supplemental oxygen for
   possible ARDs or TRALI
   - treat for aspiration PNA with vanco/cefepime - decided to add IV
   flagyl yesterday with chest CT results
   -patient is full code, if needs intubation would do ARDS net
   ventilation strategy
   -blood cultures all no growth to date
   - urine legionella negative
   - urine culture no growth
   .
   # C diff: C diff colitis on this admission presenting with diarrhea
   however now has no diarrhea any longer and abd is benign.
   -she is on PO vancomycin, continue PO vanc, added IV flagyl for
   aspiration coverage (also good for c. diff)
   - 2 negative c diff since previous positive
   .
   # Gastroparesis and abdominal pain with associated n/v: her symptoms
   are improving.  She had a GJ tube in the past, and it was felt by GI
   that she again needed a GJ tube for both decompression and tubefeeding.
   GJ tube was placed on [**8-30**] by IR. Patient then had severe pain and it
   was noted on CT scan that she had intussusception of her duodenum into
   her stomach with gastric outlet obstruction.  She had an NGT placed
   with 1300cc of bilious fluid removed. IR emergently repositioned the
   tube.
   .
   # FEN:
   - restarted tube feeds, feed through J part
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: has resolved, Cr is now at baseline of 0.9.
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #. Diabetes type 1, uncontrolled, with complications of autonomic
   insufficiency, gastroparesis, and periperal neuropathy. HgbA1c was 8.0.
   -gastroparesis improving as above
   - consider now increasing insulin as needed based on increased tube
   feedings
   -was on lantus 4 qam and 9qhs and sliding scale insulin prior to
   transfer but is on much greater dose at home
   .
   # Anemia, iron deficiency: Hct 22-23 at baseline, s/p 2uPRBC with new
   HCT > 30.  continue to trend.
   -guiac stools
   -outpatient C scope

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of depression, bipolar disorder, diabetes type 1, gastroparesis, and iron deficiency anemia. She was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath, hypoxia, and a multifocal process on chest X-ray. The patient's symptoms include orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and chest pressure. She also has a history of diabetes with complications such as autonomic insufficiency, gastroparesis, and peripheral neuropathy.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (heart rate of 112 bpm) and tachypnea (respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute). Her blood pressure is 163/55 mmHg. She is on supplemental oxygen via a non-rebreather mask, with an oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20.2 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, slightly elevated blood glucose level of 193 mg/dL, and normal creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. Her electrolytes show a slightly low potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L and a normal sodium level of 134 mEq/L.

The patient's chest CT without contrast shows bilateral air space opacities most consistent with TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury),"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and hypoxia. She has been experiencing tachypnea and tachycardia, and received Ativan and Lasix IV without improvement. Her ABGs showed low oxygen levels, leading to the placement of BIPAP. A CT Thorax revealed bilateral diffuse ground glass and consolidative changes in the lungs, indicating atypical pneumonia or non-cardiogenic edema. She also has stable bilateral pleural effusion, decreasing pneumoperitoneum from recent surgery, and prominent right breast tissue. Allergies include penicillins, iodine, and unknown allergies. She has been on multiple antibiotics since admission. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia, high blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and good oxygen saturation. Fluid balance is within normal limits. She is receiving various ICU medications and has been monitored for hemodynamic status, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other parameters. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and altered electrolyte levels. The patient is currently on nutrition support, has multiple IV lines, and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is currently unknown, and her disposition is pending further evaluation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:

   Assessment and Plan
   37 yoF w/ a h/o DMI c/b gastroparesis, here with gastroparesis-
   developed hypoxia worsening x 2 days and subjective SOB, orthopnea and
   PND and multifocal opacities on CXR- difficult to wean from NRB
   supplemental oxygen.
   .
   Plan:
   # HYPOXIA: Very large A-a gradient, bilateral alveolar infiltrates on
   CXR, increase WBC, but no fevers. Symtoms started after transfusion.
   Patient continues to have orthopnea. V/Q scan negative for PE, echo
   showed EF 65%. Given the current information TRALi is still at the top
   of the differential diagnoses. Since her diarrhea is getting off with
   antibiotics we will stop PNA treatment and have low threshold to
   restart.
   -Stop Vanc/Cefepime
   - F/u antibody results
   - CXR tomorrow
   - Continue Facemask O2; may re-do gas if getting tired and re-assess
   -cont supportive measures, such as nebs prn and supplemental oxygen for
   possible ARDs or TRALI
   -patient is full code, if needs intubation would do ARDS net
   ventilation strategy
   -blood cultures all no growth to date
   - urine legionella negative
   - urine culture no growth
   .
   # C diff: C diff colitis on this admission presenting with diarrhea.
   Patient has gotten worse in the last 24 [**Last Name (LF) 1201**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] stopped antibiotics
   and will only continue PO vanc and IV flagyl. On [**8-31**] she was C diff
   toxin positive.
   -she is on PO vancomycin and  IV flagyl
   .
   # Gastroparesis and abdominal pain with associated n/v: her symptoms
   are improving.  She had a GJ tube in the past, and it was felt by GI
   that she again needed a GJ tube for both decompression and tubefeeding.
   GJ tube was placed on [**8-30**] by IR. Patient then had severe pain and it
   was noted on CT scan that she had intussusception of her duodenum into
   her stomach with gastric outlet obstruction.  She had an NGT placed
   with 1300cc of bilious fluid removed. IR emergently repositioned the
   tube.
   .
   # FEN:
   - will need to follow nutrition recs and swith to other tube feeds,
   since current is associated with diarrhea.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: has Creatinine trending up. Does not meet
   criteria for renal failure yet.
   -          Urine lytes
   -          UA
   .
   #. Diabetes type 1, uncontrolled, with complications of autonomic
   insufficiency, gastroparesis, and periperal neuropathy. HgbA1c was 8.0.
   -gastroparesis improving as above
   - consider now increasing insulin as needed based on increased tube
   feedings
   -was on lantus 4 qam and 9qhs and sliding scale insulin prior to
   transfer but is on much greater dose at home

   #. Depression/Bipolar Disorder: continued remeron, seroquel, fluoxetine
   .
   # Access: Patient will need central line since no good peripheral
   access. LIJ was tried, but patient did not tolerate being down for
   procedure, so left femoral will be placed

The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of depression/bipolar disorder, diabetes type 1, uncontrolled with complications of autonomic insufficiency, gastroparesis, and peripheral neuropathy. She was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath and hypoxia. The patient has been experiencing tachypnea and tachycardia, and despite receiving Ativan and Lasix IV, there was no improvement. An arterial blood gas test revealed low oxygen levels, and she was placed on BiPAP.

CT Thorax results show bilateral diffuse ground glass and consolidative changes of the lungs with no cavitary lesion, which could indicate atypical pneumonia or non-cardiogenic edema. There is also a stable bilateral pleural effusion and decreasing pneumoperitoneum from recent surgery. Prominent right breast tissue is noted.

The patient has multiple allergies, including penicillins, iodine, and unknown allergens. She received antibiotics, including cefepime, metronidazole, and vancomycin, and various infusions and medications. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 163/55 to 116/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. She is on non-rebreather oxygen delivery.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (437 K/uL),"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of IDDM (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and gastroparesis who has been admitted to the ICU. She presents with hypoxic respiratory distress and diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The attending physician suspects either TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury) or post-aspiration as the cause of her symptoms.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, tachypnea, and normal blood pressure. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on non-rebreather mask. She is currently receiving NIPPV (non-invasive positive pressure ventilation) and has been on high FiO2 requirement. The ABG (arterial blood gas) results indicate a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 54 mmHg, PaO2 of 202 mmHg, HCO3- of 26 mEq/L, and BE of -4 mEq/L.

Laboratory tests reveal leukocytosis with a WBC count of 20.2 K/uL, anemia with an Hct of 27.3%, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 22.1 K/uL, and elevated liver enzymes with AST and ALT levels above the normal range. The blood cultures are negative for bacterial growth. The stool culture is positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Chest"

   Assessment and Plan
   37 yoF w/ a h/o DMI c/b gastroparesis, here with gastroparesis-
   developed hypoxia worsening x 2 days and subjective SOB, orthopnea and
   PND and multifocal opacities on CXR- difficult to wean from NRB
   supplemental oxygen.
   .
   Plan:
   # HYPOXIA: Bilateral alveolar infiltrates on CXR, WBC trending down,
   afebrile fevers. Symtoms started after transfusion. Patient continues
   to have orthopnea. V/Q scan negative for PE, echo showed EF 65%. Given
   the current information TRALi is still at the top of the differential
   diagnoses.  Pt with cont SOB and tachypnea.  Pt was reintubated.  Pt
   ABG showed ph 7.28 and pCO2 of 57.
   - will cont to monitor resp status on ARDS ventilation protocol.
   - Will place a-line
   - F/u antibody results
   - CXR tomorrow
   -cont supportive measures, such as nebs prn and supplemental oxygen for
   possible ARDs or TRALI
   .
   # C diff: C diff colitis on this admission presenting with diarrhea.
   Pt with cont diarrhea.  Will continue PO vanc and IV flagyl. On [**8-31**]
   she was C diff toxin positive.
   -she is on PO vancomycin and  IV flagyl
   .
   # Gastroparesis and abdominal pain with associated n/v: her symptoms
   are improving.  GJ tube was placed on [**8-30**] by IR. Patient then had
   severe pain and it was noted on CT scan that she had intussusception of
   her duodenum into her stomach with gastric outlet obstruction.
   # FEN:
   - will need to follow nutrition recs and
   # Acute Renal Failure: has Creatinine trending up. Pt with decreased
   UOP.  Was given 1.5L fluid challenge with minimal response.  FeNa =
   1%.  Likely prerenal etiology
   - will monitor UOP and give additional fluid challenge if ness.
   - will trend Cr
   .
   #. Diabetes type 1, uncontrolled, with complications of autonomic
   insufficiency, gastroparesis, and periperal neuropathy. HgbA1c was 8.0.
   -gastroparesis improving as above
   - consider now increasing insulin as needed based on increased tube
   feedings
   -was on lantus 4 qam and 9qhs and sliding scale insulin prior to
   transfer but is on much greater dose at home
   .
   # Anemia, iron deficiency: Hct 22-23 at baseline, s/p 2uPRBC with new
   HCT > 30.  continue to trend.
   -guiac stools
   -outpatient C scope
   .
   #. Depression/Bipolar Disorder: continued remeron, seroquel, fluoxetine
   .
   # Access: Patient will need central line since no good peripheral
   access. LIJ was tried, but patient did not tolerate being down for

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of depression, bipolar disorder, diabetes type 1, anemia, and irritable bowel syndrome. She has been admitted to the ICU with worsening hypoxia, orthopnea, and shortness of breath. The patient's symptoms started after a transfusion, and a V/Q scan was negative for pulmonary embolism. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 65%, and the patient is still under consideration for TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury).

The patient has also been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis and is experiencing diarrhea. She is currently receiving oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole. The patient had a Gastrostomy tube placed due to gastroparesis and abdominal pain. However, it was noted that there was intussusception of her duodenum into her stomach with gastric outlet obstruction on a CT scan.

The patient is also being treated for acute renal failure with a rising creatinine level and decreased urine output. She has been given a fluid challenge with minimal response, and her fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 1%, indicating a likely pre-renal cause.

Other conditions mentioned in the progress note include anemia, depression/bipolar disorder, and diabetes type 1 with complications of autonomic insufficiency, gastroparesis, and peripheral neuropathy.

   37 yoF w/ a h/o DMI c/b gastroparesis, here with gastroparesis-
   developed hypoxia worsening x 2 days and subjective SOB, orthopnea and
   PND and multifocal opacities on CXR- difficult to wean from NRB
   supplemental oxygen.
   .
   Plan:
   # HYPOXIA: Bilateral alveolar infiltrates on CXR, WBC trending down,
   afebrile fevers. Symtoms started after transfusion. Patient continues
   to have orthopnea. V/Q scan negative for PE, echo showed EF 65%. Given
   the current information TRALi is still at the top of the differential
   diagnoses as well as aspiration pneumonitis.  Pt with cont SOB and
   tachypnea.  Pt was reintubated.  Pt ABG showed ph 7.28 and pCO2 of 57.
   - will cont to monitor resp status on ARDS ventilation protocol.
   - Will place a-line
   - F/u antibody results
   - CXR tomorrow
   -cont supportive measures, such as nebs prn and supplemental oxygen for
   possible ARDs or TRALI
   .
   # C diff: C diff colitis on this admission presenting with diarrhea.
   Pt with cont diarrhea.  Will continue PO vanc and IV flagyl. On [**8-31**]
   she was C diff toxin positive.
   -she is on PO vancomycin and  IV flagyl
   .
   # Gastroparesis and abdominal pain with associated n/v: her symptoms
   are improving.  GJ tube was placed on [**8-30**] by IR. Patient then had
   severe pain and it was noted on CT scan that she had intussusception of
   her duodenum into her stomach with gastric outlet obstruction.
   # FEN:
   - will need to follow nutrition recs and
   # Acute Renal Failure: has Creatinine trending up. Pt with decreased
   UOP.  Was given 1.5L fluid challenge with minimal response.  FeNa =
   1%.  Likely prerenal etiology
   - will monitor UOP and give additional fluid challenge if ness.
   - will trend Cr
   .
   #. Diabetes type 1, uncontrolled, with complications of autonomic
   insufficiency, gastroparesis, and periperal neuropathy. HgbA1c was 8.0.
   -gastroparesis improving as above
   - consider now increasing insulin as needed based on increased tube
   feedings
   -cont lantus [**3-15**] and sliding scale insulin.
   # Anemia: Hct 22-23 at baseline, Hct 23.6 and trending down, no
   evidence of active bleeding.  Continue to trend.
   - will check afternoon Hct
   -guiac stools
   -outpatient C scope
   .
   #. Depression/Bipolar Disorder: continued remeron, seroquel, fluoxetine

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of depression, bipolar disorder, diabetes type 1, anemia, and gastroparesis. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia, worsening over two days, bilateral alveolar infiltrates on chest X-ray, and symptoms starting after a transfusion. The patient has a large A-a gradient, increased WBC count, and no fevers. The V/Q scan was negative for pulmonary embolism, and an echo showed an ejection fraction of 65%. The patient is full code, and if needed, would be intubated with an ARDS net ventilation strategy. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms of hypoxia, worsening over two days, bilateral alveolar infiltrates on chest X-ray, and a large A-a gradient suggest the possibility of ARDS.
2. C. difficile colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis, presenting with diarrhea. Antibiotics were stopped, and she is now on PO vancomycin and IV flagyl.
3. Gastroparesis: The patient has a history of gastroparesis, which has been improving. However, she had a GJ tube placed due to severe pain and gastric outlet obstruction caused by intussusception of the duodenum into the stomach.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creat"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus and gastroparesis. She presented with hypoxia, worsening over two days, and subjective shortness of breath, orthopnea, and peripheral neuropathy. She also has multifocal opacities on chest X-ray and is difficult to wean from non-rebreather supplemental oxygen. The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress and had an arterial blood gas showing a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, PaO2 of 136 mmHg, and HCO3- of 28 mEq/L. She is on vancomycin and IV flagyl for an unidentified infection. The patient has low urine output and increased lactate levels. Her white blood cell count is elevated. She has anemia, renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), Clostridium difficile infection, and gastroparesis. She is sedated and unable to provide history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient has bilateral alveolar infiltrates on chest X-ray, worsening hypoxia, and respiratory distress, which are consistent with ARDS. The patient is already on ARDS ventilation protocol and being closely monitored.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient has symptoms of diarrhea and positive C. difficile toxin. She is currently being treated with oral vancomycin and IV flagyl.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.4, and she has decreased urine output. Further evaluation and management of renal function are needed.
4. Gastroparesis: The patient has a history of gastroparesis, which is improving with medical management.
5. Type 1 diabetes mellitus: The patient has uncontrolled diabetes with complications of autonomic insufficiency, gastroparesis, and peripheral neuropathy. Insulin management needs to be adjusted based on increased tube feedings.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, but there is no evidence of active bleeding. Monitoring Hct and investigating possible causes of anemia would be appropriate.
7. Intussusception of the duodenum into the stomach: The patient had a CT scan showing intussusception of the duodenum into the stomach with gastric outlet obstruction. This condition needs to be addressed appropriately.
8. Depression/Bipolar disorder: The patient is on medication for depression and bipolar disorder. Continued monitoring and management of mental health are necessary.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information may be required to fully assess the patient's condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus and gastroparesis. She was admitted to the ICU with worsening hypoxia, subjective shortness of breath, orthopnea, and multifocal opacities on chest X-ray. She is difficult to wean from nonrebreather supplemental oxygen. She has been intubated due to respiratory distress. The patient has a low urine output, and her blood glucose levels are uncontrolled. She has a history of depression/bipolar disorder and is currently on several medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms of hypoxia, worsening respiratory distress, and bilateral alveolar infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of ARDS. This condition is characterized by severe lung injury, leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory failure.

2. C. difficile infection (CDI): The patient has a positive C. difficile toxin and is presenting with diarrhea. CDI is a common cause of antibiotic-associated colitis and can lead to severe complications if left untreated.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has an elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output, indicating potential kidney dysfunction. AKI can occur due to various causes, such as dehydration, sepsis, or nephrotoxic drugs.

4. Gastroparesis: The patient has a history of gastroparesis, which"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DMI) who has been admitted to the ICU for gastroparesis. She developed hypoxia and worsening respiratory distress, which led to intubation. The patient has difficulty weaning from supplemental oxygen and has been on Vancomycin and IV Flagyl for an unknown infection.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 105/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube ventilation with FiO2 set at 40%.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance with no acute distress. Pupils are non-reactive to light, cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds, and peripheral pulses are present bilaterally. Chest examination reveals symmetric expansion with bronchial breath sounds and rhonchi. Abdominal examination shows soft abdomen with bowel sounds present. Neurologic examination indicates sedation and unresponsive to commands.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (17.9 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (7.6 g/dL), increased creatinine (1.4 mg/dL), elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated lactate levels. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates respiratory alkalosis (pH"

The patient is a 37-year-old woman with a history of IDDM who was initially admitted for gastroparesis. She developed hypoxia and was transferred to the ICU, where she was intubated due to increased work of breathing, persistent hypoxia, and worsening hypercapnea. She has a history of allergies to penicillins, iodine, and unknown substances. She received a pRBC transfusion, which led to the development of hypoxia over 36 hours. Her current medications include cefepime, vancomycin, metronidazole, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, fentanyl, midazolam, and Flagyl. She is also receiving nutritional support through ProBalance at 50 mL/hour.

Assessment and Plan:

   Assessment and Plan
 ANEMIA, OTHER: As below, will transfuse a unit of pRBCs given Hct
   ~23% and low urine output; no compelling e/o hemolysis from yesterday
   labs.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I: Continue Lantus, RSSI and follow
   blood sugars.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Her creatinine is
   stable but her UOP remains borderline. She may benefit from colloid in
   the form of pRBCs given she appears predisposed to leaking fluid into
   her interstitium given her low intravascular oncotic pressure.
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**]):
   Differential initially included TRALI, however she has not demonstrated
   any significant improvement over the past several days
 TRALI ought to
   have improved over the past several days. Given her persistent hypoxia
   and gastrointestinal issues she is at risk for aspiration events, it
   certainly possible that her acute respiratory failure was [**1-12**]
   aspiration pneumonitis versus infection. Bronch with BAL may help in
   elucidating any active infection or other causes of her decompensation.
   In addition, would strive to keep plateau pressures at or below 30 in
   the setting of [**Doctor Last Name 76**].
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM
   DIFFICILE): Continue Flagyl and follow clinically.
   ACCESS:  Will change to right IJ today and d/c central line. Consider
   A-line.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 37F DM, gastroparesis now with hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Etiology remains unclear
 aspiration, infection,
   inflammation, hemorrhage are all could explain her decompensation.

   Agree with plan to sedate and continue low tidal volume ventilation
   while obtaining diagnostic information via flexible bronchoscopy. Will
   place arterial line and resite central line as well. To improve
   synchrony, will increase fentanyl and start haldol. If this is not
   successful, will add propofol and vecuronium x1. Will continue to treat
   c. diff and diabetes as note. Will check PM hematocrit and consider
   tansfusion. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

- General appearance: No acute distress, intubated and sedated
- Cardiovascular: Normal heart rhythm, no murmurs
- Respiratory/chest: Symmetric expansion, clear breath sounds
- Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION
   Patient continues with low blood pressure. Requiring Neosynephrine and
   Levophed, which can be increased. Patient received fluid bolus
   overnight. Unclear etiology of hypotension. EKG did not reveal any
   abnormalities. CXR after R IJ placement showed no evidence of
   pneumothorax. Patient
s extremities were warm. Not auto-PEEPing
   overnight when hypotensive.
   -          Continue Neosynephrine and Levophed
   -          Maintain even fluid balance. Bolus if needed.
   -          Check Echo today. Consider IVF if decreased LV volume
   -          Check mixed venous saturation
   -          Check [**Last Name (un) **] stim to assess for adrenal insufficiency
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   This is less likely to be TRALI as she has not improved within [**12-12**]
   days. Etiology of ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**] may be infectious. Sputum culture and BAL
   results still pending. Also possibility of non-pulmonary infection.
   Will do CT scan to assess for intraabdominal pathology.
 BRONCHOSCOPY
   Performed yesterday. Patient started on IV vancomycin, meropenam and
   levofloxacin for question of aspiration pneumonia. Performed again
   overnight, revealing copious pus.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Chronic renal insufficiency. Creatinine and BUN increased today. Likely
   due to hypotension overnight. Urinalysis from [**9-10**] reveals granular
   casts, consistent with ATN.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Chronic iron deficiency anemia. Guiaic positive stools yesterday with
   HCT continuing to drop. Received 1 unit of PRBC last night starting at
   7:30PM. HCT = 22.2
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I
   Continue Insulin sliding scale and fixed dose insulin.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old woman with possible TRALI. She has been intubated and sedated. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications including vasopressors, antibiotics, and insulin. Her condition remains critical, and she is experiencing hypotension, respiratory distress, renal failure, anemia, and diabetes mellitus. She also has a history of iron deficiency anemia and positive C. difficile toxin. Her vital signs are unstable, with a fever of 100.8°F, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 92/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She has widespread heterogeneous opacities on chest X-ray, suggesting possible multifocal pneumonia or ARDS. Her laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal kidney function tests. She is also receiving nutrition through tube feeds and has a Foley catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires continuous monitoring and management with vasopressors. The underlying cause of hypotension needs further investigation.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's symptoms and chest X-ray findings suggest the possibility of ARDS, which can be life-threatening. Treatment involves supportive care with mechanical ventilation and addressing the underlying cause.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and B"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION
   Patient continues with low blood pressure. Requiring Neosynephrine and
   Levophed, which can be increased. Patient received fluid bolus
   overnight. Unclear etiology of hypotension. EKG did not reveal any
   abnormalities. CXR after R IJ placement showed no evidence of
   pneumothorax. Patient
s extremities were warm. Not auto-PEEPing
   overnight when hypotensive.
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   This is less likely to be TRALI as she has not improved within [**12-12**]
   days.
 BRONCHOSCOPY
   Performed yesterday. Patient started on meropenam and levofloxacin for
   question of aspiration pneumonia. Performed again overnight, revealing
   copious pus.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Chronic renal insufficiency. Creatinine and BUN increased today. Likely
   due to hypotension overnight.
   - Transfuse 1 unit PRBC today.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Chronic iron deficiency anemia. Guiaic positive stools yesterday with
   HCT continuing to drop. Received 1 unit of PRBC last night starting at
   7:30PM. HCT = 22.2
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I
   Continue Insulin sliding scale.

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION
   Patient continues with low blood pressure. Requiring Neosynephrine and
   Levophed, which can be increased. Patient received fluid bolus
   overnight. Unclear etiology of hypotension. EKG did not reveal any
   abnormalities. CXR after R IJ placement showed no evidence of
   pneumothorax. Patient
s extremities were warm. Not auto-PEEPing
   overnight when hypotensive.
   -          Continue Neosynephrine and Levophed
   -          Maintain even fluid balance. Bolus if needed.
   -          Check Echo today. Consider IVF if decreased LV volume
   -          Check mixed venous saturation
   -          Check [**Last Name (un) **] stim to assess for adrenal insufficiency
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   This is less likely to be TRALI as she has not improved within [**12-12**]
   days. Etiology of ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**] may be infectious. Sputum culture and BAL
   results still pending. Also possibility of non-pulmonary infection.
   Will do CT scan to assess for intraabdominal pathology.
 BRONCHOSCOPY
   Performed yesterday. Patient started on IV vancomycin, meropenam and
   levofloxacin for question of aspiration pneumonia. Performed again
   overnight, revealing copious pus.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Chronic renal insufficiency. Creatinine and BUN increased today. Likely
   due to hypotension overnight. Urinalysis from [**9-10**] reveals granular
   casts, consistent with ATN.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   Chronic iron deficiency anemia. Guiaic positive stools yesterday with
   HCT continuing to drop. Received 1 unit of PRBC last night starting at
   7:30PM. HCT = 22.2

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old woman with possible TRALI (transfusion-related acute lung injury) who is currently intubated and sedated. She has been experiencing hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, anemia, diabetes mellitus (type I), and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she remains hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Imaging studies show bilateral widespread heterogeneous opacities consistent with multifocal pneumonia or ARDS. The patient's renal function has deteriorated, and she has evidence of iron deficiency anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is concerning and requires ongoing management with vasopressors. The etiology of her hypotension is unclear, and further evaluation is needed.
2. ARDS: The patient's lung injury has progressed to ARDS, characterized by severe hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. This condition can lead to respiratory failure and multiorgan dysfunction.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function has worsened, as indicated by increased creatinine and BUN levels. This may be due to hypotension, and careful fluid management is essential.
4. Anemia: The patient has chronic iron deficiency anemia, which may contribute to her overall clinical picture. Blood transfusion"

   COMPARISON: None available.
   TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain
   without
   the administration of IV contrast.
   FINDINGS: There is no evidence for hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
   ischemia. The [**Doctor Last Name 1359**]-white differentiation is preserved. The ventricles
   and
   sulci are normal in size and configuration. The basilar cisterns are
   preserved. The osseous structures are unremarkable without evidence for
   suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is mild mucosal thickening
   in
   the anterior ethmoid air cells. The sphenoid and maxillary sinuses are
   clear.
   The mastoid air cells are opacified on the right, with question of a
   small
   air-fluid level, and partially opacified on the left, a finding typical
   with
   prolonged intubation.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No acute intracranial process including no hemorrhage, edema, mass
   effect,
   or infarction.
   2. Opacification of mastoid air cells, which can be found in patients
   with
   prolonged intubation.

   Assessment and Plan
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   PaO2/FiO2 = 137. This is consistent with ARDS. Etiology is unclear at
   this point. Sputum cultures and BAL cultures are negative so far.
   Patient continues to be afebrile. CT Scan yesterday confirmed bilateral
   infiltrates, but has not revealed any additional information at this
   time. Associated respiratory acidosis with superimposed metabolic
   acidosis, likely due to recent diarrhea and IV fluids.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Continue IV vancomycin, Meropenam, Levofloxacin
 HYPOTENSION
   Patient weaned off pressors overnight. BP = 128/70 (91) at this time
   without pressors. [**Last Name (un) 567**] Stim test showed adequate response by the
   adrenal glands. This makes adrenal insufficiency less likely as a
   source of her hypotension.
   - Continue to monitor. Bolus as needed
   - Echo today to assess LV function
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   HCT = 22.2 this morning. Stable. Continue to monitor. Consider
   transfusion if this drops further.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I
   Insulin drip recently discontinued as her BS=55. She will receive long
   acting Lantus as basal coverage. Will continue to monitor her blood
   sugars closely.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with respiratory failure. She is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has a history of penicillin allergies and unknown allergies to iodine-containing substances. She has been admitted to the ICU with worsening lung disease, suggesting worsening pneumonia or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. The patient has been on various medications including insulin, vancomycin, meropenem, and levofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 137, which is consistent with ARDS. The etiology is unclear at this point. Sputum cultures and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures are negative so far. The patient has bilateral infiltrates on CT scan, but no additional information has been revealed. Associated respiratory acidosis with superimposed metabolic acidosis is likely due to recent diarrhea and IV fluids.

2. Hypotension: The patient was weaned off pressors overnight and her blood pressure is currently stable without pressors. However, the patient's adrenal insufficiency should be monitored, as indicated by the cortisol stimulation test showing an adequate response by the adrenal glands.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) level is 22.2%, which is stable. Close monitoring is recommended, and transfusion may be considered if the HCT drops further"

   FINDINGS: There is no evidence for hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
   ischemia. The [**Doctor Last Name 1359**]-white differentiation is preserved. The ventricles
   and
   sulci are normal in size and configuration. The basilar cisterns are
   preserved. The osseous structures are unremarkable without evidence for
   suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is mild mucosal thickening
   in
   the anterior ethmoid air cells. The sphenoid and maxillary sinuses are
   clear.
   The mastoid air cells are opacified on the right, with question of a
   small
   air-fluid level, and partially opacified on the left, a finding typical
   with
   prolonged intubation.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No acute intracranial process including no hemorrhage, edema, mass

   Assessment and Plan
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   PaO2/FiO2 = 137. This is consistent with ARDS. Etiology is unclear at
   this point, though most likely consistent with aspiration with a
   chemical pneumonitis. Sputum cultures and BAL cultures are negative so
   far. Patient continues to be afebrile. CT Scan yesterday confirmed
   bilateral infiltrates, but has not revealed any additional information
   at this time. Associated respiratory acidosis with superimposed
   metabolic acidosis, likely due to recent diarrhea and IV fluids. Echo
   reveals normal LV function with EF>55%.
   - Continue supportive care. Wake patient daily.
   - Maintain even fluid balance.
   - Perform esophageal pressure balloon and consider increasing PEEP to
   maintain low FiO2.
   - Continue IV Vancomycin, Levofloxacin
   - Discontinue Meropenam.
 HYPOTENSION
   Patient weaned off pressors overnight. BP = 128/70 (91) at this time
   without pressors. [**Last Name (un) 567**] Stim test showed adequate response by the
   adrenal glands. This makes adrenal insufficiency less likely as a
   source of her hypotension.
   - Continue to monitor. Bolus as needed if CVP is low.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   HCT = 22.2 this morning. Stable. Continue to monitor. Consider
   transfusion if this drops further.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I
   Insulin drip recently discontinued as her BS=55. She will receive long
   acting Lantus as basal coverage. Will continue to monitor her blood
   sugars closely. Will follow endocrine recommendations.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Evidence of ATN. BUN and Creatinine elevated, but stable. Continue to
   monitor.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been unstable, with worsening lung disease suggesting worsening pneumonia or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Her arterial line was replaced, and insulin therapy was adjusted due to hypoglycemia. The patient's blood cultures, sputum culture, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures are negative so far. A CT scan of the head, chest, and abdomen without contrast shows no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or ischemia. The patient has mild mucosal thickening in the anterior ethmoid air cells and opacification of mastoid air cells, which can be seen in prolonged intubation. The patient is also experiencing hypotension, anemia, type I diabetes mellitus, acute renal failure, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's fluid balance, vital signs, and laboratory values are being closely monitored, and appropriate interventions are being made accordingly."

   COMPARISON: None available.
   TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain
   without
   the administration of IV contrast.
   FINDINGS: There is no evidence for hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
   ischemia. The [**Doctor Last Name 1359**]-white differentiation is preserved. The ventricles
   and
   sulci are normal in size and configuration. The basilar cisterns are
   preserved. The osseous structures are unremarkable without evidence for
   suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is mild mucosal thickening
   in
   the anterior ethmoid air cells. The sphenoid and maxillary sinuses are
   clear.
   The mastoid air cells are opacified on the right, with question of a
   small
   air-fluid level, and partially opacified on the left, a finding typical
   with
   prolonged intubation.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No acute intracranial process including no hemorrhage, edema, mass
   effect,
   or infarction.
   2. Opacification of mastoid air cells, which can be found in patients
   with
   prolonged intubation.

   Assessment and Plan
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   PaO2/FiO2 = 137. This is consistent with ARDS. Etiology is unclear at
   this point, though most likely consistent with aspiration with a
   chemical pneumonitis. Sputum cultures and BAL cultures are negative so
   far. Patient continues to be afebrile. CT Scan yesterday confirmed
   bilateral infiltrates, but has not revealed any additional information
   at this time. Associated respiratory acidosis with superimposed
   metabolic acidosis, likely due to recent diarrhea and IV fluids. Echo
   reveals normal LV function with EF>55%.
   - Continue supportive care. Wake patient daily.
   - Maintain even fluid balance.
   - Perform esophageal pressure balloon and consider increasing PEEP to
   maintain low FiO2.
   - Continue IV Vancomycin, Levofloxacin
   - Discontinue Meropenam.
 HYPOTENSION
   Patient weaned off pressors overnight. BP = 128/70 (91) at this time
   without pressors. [**Last Name (un) 567**] Stim test showed adequate response by the
   adrenal glands. This makes adrenal insufficiency less likely as a
   source of her hypotension.
   - Continue to monitor. Bolus as needed if CVP is low.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   HCT = 22.2 this morning. Stable. Continue to monitor. Consider
   transfusion if this drops further.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I
   Insulin drip recently discontinued as her BS=55. She will receive long
   acting Lantus as basal coverage. Will continue to monitor her blood
   sugars closely. Will follow endocrine recommendations.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Evidence of ATN. BUN and Creatinine elevated, but stable. Continue to
   monitor.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   - Continue PO Vancomycin and IV Flagyl
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:
   Comments: Tube feed discontinued yesterday. Based on official CT read,
   consider restarting tube feeds at 10 cc/hr. Will discuss with GI first.
   Glycemic Control:  Comments: Lantus 3 units. If Insulin drip used, run
   D10 at 20cc/hr to prevent hypoglycemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU for various medical conditions including anemia, type 1 diabetes mellitus, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, insulin, and anticoagulants. Vital signs are within normal limits, but the patient has tachycardia and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance, indicating fluid overload. Laboratory results indicate several abnormalities including elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal kidney function. Microbiology tests are pending. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Proper care measures such as head of bed elevation, daily wake-up trials, and respiratory secretion management should be implemented to reduce this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin and compression stockings should be continued.
3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines increase the risk of nosocomial infections,"

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   ARDS of unclear etiology. Likely aspiration with chemical pneumonitis.
   Sputum cultures and BAL cultures are negative. Blood cultures pending.
   Patient continues to be afebrile. CT Scan two days ago confirmed
   bilateral infiltrates. Official CT read indicated normal abdomen and
   brain. Patient
s fluid balance is -230ml over last 24 hours.
   - Continue supportive care. Wake patient daily.
   - Maintain even fluid balance. Consider diuresis today.
   - Perform esophageal pressure balloon and consider increasing PEEP to
   maintain low FiO2.
   - Consider discontinuing IV Vancomycin, Levofloxacin as cultures
   continue to be negative.
 HYPOTENSION
   Patient not requiring pressors. BP has been stable over past 24 hours.
   Currently 151/75 (104).
   - Continue to monitor. Bolus as needed if CVP is low.
 ANEMIA, OTHER

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type I, who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of unclear etiology. The patient's current condition includes tachycardia, hypotension, anemia, and possible acute renal failure. The patient has been sedated and unable to provide history. 

Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient has bilateral infiltrates on CT scan, consistent with ARDS. The exact cause is unclear, but likely aspiration with chemical pneumonitis. The patient is receiving supportive care, including mechanical ventilation with PRVC/AC mode, low tidal volume ventilation, and low FiO2. 

2. Anemia: The patient's HCT is 18.8%, indicating anemia. A transfusion of 1 unit PRBC is planned today.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been stable over the past 24 hours without the need for pressors. Monitoring and bolus administration of fluids as needed if central venous pressure (CVP) is low.

4. Diabetes Mellitus Type I: The patient is on an insulin drip with 0.5 units/hour and Lantus 2 units [Hospital1]. D50W is given as needed for blood sugar less than 70.

5. Acute Renal Failure: Evidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). B"

   Assessment and Plan
   37 year old female with DM Type 1 admitted initially for gastroparesis,
   transferred to ICU with respiratory distress after receiving blood
   transfusion and tube feeds with ARDS.
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   ARDS of unclear etiology. Likely aspiration with chemical pneumonitis.
   Sputum cultures and BAL cultures are negative. Blood cultures pending.
   Patient continues to be afebrile. CT Scan two days ago confirmed
   bilateral infiltrates. Official CT read indicated normal abdomen and
   brain. Patient
s fluid balance is -230ml over last 24 hours.
   - Continue supportive care. Wake patient daily.
   - Maintain even fluid balance. Consider diuresis today.
   - Perform esophageal pressure balloon and consider increasing PEEP to
   maintain low FiO2.
   - Consider discontinuing IV Vancomycin, Levofloxacin as cultures
   continue to be negative.
 HYPOTENSION
   Patient not requiring pressors. BP has been stable over past 24 hours.
   Currently 151/75 (104).
   - Continue to monitor. Bolus as needed if CVP is low.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, admitted initially for gastroparesis and transferred to the ICU with respiratory distress after receiving a blood transfusion and tube feeds. She was diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of unclear etiology, likely aspiration with chemical pneumonitis. The patient has bilateral infiltrates on CT scan and negative sputum and BAL cultures. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient is already diagnosed with ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory failure and potentially death if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been stable over the past 24 hours, but close monitoring is required, and bolus administration of fluids may be necessary if the central venous pressure (CVP) is low.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) level is 18.8%, indicating anemia. A blood transfusion with one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) has been ordered.
4. Diabetes Mellitus Type 1: The patient requires insulin therapy to maintain glycemic control. Insulin infusion and Lantus injections have been prescribed.
5. Acute Renal Failure: There is evidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of renal function is necessary, and further intervention may be required if"

The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of Type 1 diabetes mellitus, admitted initially for gastroparesis and transferred to the ICU due to respiratory distress after receiving a blood transfusion and tube feeds. The patient was diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), likely caused by aspiration with chemical pneumonitis. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 127/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient has several medical complications, including anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.1 g/dL, acute renal failure, and possible acute kidney injury (ATN) with stable BUN and creatinine levels. The patient also has evidence of nutritional deficiencies, indicated by an INR of 1.9 and albumin level of 1.4 g/dL. The patient is receiving supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, insulin infusion for glycemic control, and various prophylactic measures such as DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention.

   Assessment and Plan
   37 year old female with DM Type 1 admitted initially for gastroparesis,
   transferred to ICU with respiratory distress after receiving blood
   transfusion and tube feeds with ARDS.

 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   ARDS of unclear etiology. Likely aspiration with chemical pneumonitis.
   Patient with hypoxia following/during blood transfusiom twice now,
   though TRALI less likely. Sputum cultures and BAL cultures are
   negative. Blood cultures pending. Patient continues to be afebrile. CT
   Scan two days ago confirmed bilateral infiltrates. Official CT read
   indicated normal abdomen and brain. Diuresis with furosemide tried
   yesterday, although patient unable to tolerate with fall in BP. By ABG,
   respiratory acidosis currently. FiO2 increased.
   - Will again try to wean off FiO2 again. Given respiratory acidosis,
   will increase respiratory rate can continue to monitor ABGs.
   - Plateau pressure elevated, although is likely necessary given
   increased intraabdominal pressure
   - Continue supportive care. Wake patient daily.
   - Maintain even fluid balance
 will try to diuresis again this
   morning. Given low albumin, will try higher furosemide drip and titrate
   as necessary
   - Vancomycin IV and levofloxacin discontinued.
 HYPOTENSION
   Pressors restarted. Currently on Levophed. Unclear source, although
   elevated PEEP may be contributing to decreased preload
 less likely
   given that pressure is very labile.
   - Continue to monitor. Bolus as needed if CVP is low.

 ANEMIA, OTHER
   HCT inproved this morning appropriately following transfusion. Unable
   to tolerate >1 unit pRBC yesterday given hypoxia
 unclear if reaction
   to blood or fluid overload.
   - Continue to monitor..

   Lantus 2 units [**Hospital1 **], and D50W as needed for blood sugar less than 70.
   Patient has occasional episodes of hypoglycemia that should improve
   with addition of TPN.
   - Follow-up [**Hospital1 772**] recs
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Improving. Evidence of ATN. BUN and Creatinine stable.
   - Continue to monitor.
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   - Continue PO Vancomycin and IV Flagyl
   Patient has not been receiving tube feeds. INR =1.9, Albumin = 1.4.
   These indicate nutritional deficiencies. GI continues to suggest that
   tube feeds should not be utilized
   - TPN started [**2143-8-14**].
   - Give Vitamin K IV to treat the elevated INR.
   - Check LFTs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus, initially admitted for gastroparesis. She was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory distress after receiving blood transfusion and tube feeds, diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The ARDS is of unclear etiology, with likely aspiration causing chemical pneumonitis. The patient has hypoxia following/during blood transfusions, although Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) is less likely. Sputum and BAL cultures are negative, while blood cultures are pending. The patient remains afebrile, and a CT scan confirmed bilateral infiltrates. The official CT read indicated normal abdomen and brain. Diuresis with furosemide was attempted but not tolerated due to a fall in blood pressure. The patient is currently on pressure support with good effect, and FiO2 has been increased. ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis, so there are plans to wean off FiO2 again and increase respiratory rate. Plateau pressure is elevated due to increased intraabdominal pressure. Supportive care continues, with daily awakening of the patient. Fluid balance is being maintained, and diuresis will be tried again today with a higher dose of furosemide. 

The patient also has hypotension, for which pressors were restarted and the patient is currently on Levophed. The source of hypotension is unclear"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), admitted initially for gastroparesis and transferred to the ICU with respiratory distress after receiving a blood transfusion and tube feeds. She has been diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), anemia, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, C. difficile infection, and is currently on multiple medications including insulin, furosemide, norepinephrine, and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's condition of ARDS can lead to further respiratory complications such as worsening hypoxia, pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
2. Hypotension: The patient's unstable blood pressure may lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia can result in decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, leading to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure can progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately, leading to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
5. C. difficile Infection: If left untreated, the C. difficile infection can cause severe colitis and sepsis.
6. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's inability to receive tube feeds due to GI concerns and low albumin levels indicate a risk of developing nutritional deficiencies"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 1 admitted initially for gastroparesis. She was transferred to the ICU with respiratory distress after receiving a blood transfusion and tube feeds, and is currently diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), anemia, renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 1, Clostridium difficile infection, and other conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient has developed ARDS, which is characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the alveoli. This can lead to low oxygen levels in the blood and respiratory failure. The patient's condition may deteriorate if oxygenation does not improve.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, indicated by elevated creatinine levels. If left untreated, renal failure can progress to end-stage renal disease and require dialysis.
3. Diabetes Mellitus Type 1: The patient requires tight glycemic control to prevent hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Poorly controlled diabetes can lead to complications such as ketoacidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis, and long-term complications like neuropathy and nephropathy.
4. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient has a C. difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis. If not treated effectively, it can lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 who is currently admitted to the ICU for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient's condition has been deteriorating, with intermittent drops in blood pressure, worsening acidosis, and refractory hypoxemia despite high FiO2. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and volume control, but plateau pressures are elevated. The patient has been paralyzed with cisatracurium. 

Medical Complications:
1. ARDS: The patient's primary issue is ARDS, which is causing severe respiratory distress and difficulty in oxygenation.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing intermittent drops in blood pressure, indicating potential hypotension.
3. Acidosis: The patient's acidosis is worsening, indicating a disturbance in the body's acid-base balance.
4. Hypoxemia: Despite being on high FiO2, the patient's PaO2 remains low, indicating severe oxygenation issues.
5. Elevated Plateau Pressures: The elevated plateau pressures suggest that the patient's lungs are not adequately ventilating, leading to further respiratory compromise.
6. Paralysis: The patient has been paralyzed with cisatracurium to facilitate mechanical ventilation.
7. Fever: The patient has had a fever, indicating an infectious or inflammatory process.
8. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is negative, suggesting potential dehydration or excessive fluid removal.

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 ARDS
   Patient continues to be in respiratory failure with increasing FiO2
   requirements. Patient required bag ventilation overnight due to
   decrease oxygen saturation.
   - Continue supportive care with mechanical ventilation
   - Vancomycin and Meropenem started empirically secondary to fever spike
   - Await cultures
 POSSIBLE PULMONARY EMBOLISM
   Increasing CO2, which is indicative of increasing dead space, and
   elevated temperature overnight are consistent with pulmonary embolism.
   Patient started on heparin drip empirically.
 ANEMIA, OTHER
   HCT=21.1 today. Plan to transfuse today.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Rising BUN with stable Cr likely due to hypovolemia. This should
   improve with blood transfusion.
 MALNUTRITION
   Elevated INR and decreased albumin evidence of poor nutritional status.
   - Continue TPN
 EDEMA, PERIPHERAL
   Lasix started to decreased edema/anasarca. Resulted in decreased blood
   pressure and was subsequently discontinued.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I
   Continue insulin drip and lantus 2 units [**Hospital1 **].
 C. DIFFICILE INFECTION (C DIFF, CDIFF COLITIS, CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE)
   Continue PO Vancomycin and IV Flagyl

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old obese male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type I, anemia, renal failure, malnutrition, peripheral edema, and previous C. difficile infection. The patient presented to the hospital with symptoms of pneumonia, aspiration, ARDS, possible pulmonary embolism, anemia, acute renal failure, malnutrition, peripheral edema, and type I diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with increasing FiO2 requirements, vasopressin, and levophed due to hypotension. The patient has a fever and is receiving vancomycin and meropenem empirically. The patient's condition continues to deteriorate with worsening acidosis, hypoxemia, and hypotension despite maximum support.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as fever and respiratory distress, indicate a possible infection in the lungs.
2. Aspiration: The patient's history of obesity and the presence of pneumonia suggest the possibility of aspiration, which can lead to lung infections.
3. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's worsening respiratory status, including hypoxemia and the need for increasing FiO2, are consistent with ARDS.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The increasing CO2 levels and elevated temperature overnight suggest the possibility of a pulmonary embolism.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The rising BUN with"
