   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo F w/ hodgkin's s/p autosct, ITP, now with altered mental status,
   syncopal episode and transient hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: the patient is an extremely high aspiration
   risk given ?vocal cord paralysis and recent dysphagia. Was in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   1 week ago for a similar hypoxic episode, thought to be secondary to
   aspiration at that time. The patient has since developed bibasilar
   infiltrates on CXR and on exam, had no breath sounds at the left base.
   She has been on very broad spectrum antibiotics for this.
   Currently, the differential diagnosis of the hypoxia witnessed during
   today's syncopal event includes a new aspiration pneumonitis (likely
   given hx and secretions) in the setting of an already brewing pna in
   the LLL, PE (possible since only on boots s/p brain surgery, however no
   other changes and has radiographic findings that support infectious
   etiology), acute coronary syndrome (but EKG unchanged and negative set
   of cardiac enzymes).
   - will treat for asp pneumonitis with supportive care, suctioning, O2
   etc. Satting very well on minimal supplemental O2 right now.
   - continue flagyl and vanco for now to also cover potential
   intracranial infection, would prefer cefepime instead of aztreonam for
   postoperative neurosurgical infection, but patient is pen allergic.
   - repeat sputum cx and assess interval change on CXR
   - although PE is quite possible, there continues to be no evidence of
   RH strain on EKG, and there is no appreciable difference in her
   tachycardia as this has been ongoing.  Will treat other etiologies and
   consider CTA in am if remains hypoxic.
   - continue nebs as per previous
   .
   # Hypotension: patient was transiently hypotensive to the 80's during
   this syncopal episode, she has not been taking good PO's in last 24
   hours or so, secondary to nausea. Her pressure rebounded quickly with
   minimal fluids and has remained stable. Could be infection, but patient
   is afebrile and is otherwise not appearing bacteremic.
   - continue to monitor.
   - small boluses as required given history of systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, albeit mild.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: the patient was thought to have CNS lymphoma
   vs. paraneoplastic syndrome vs. PML explaining her difficulty with
   vocal cord paralysis, and proximal weakness, although the biopsy is
   still pending, the findings so far are inconsistent with lymphoma or
   PML. Currently, in the setting of today's syncopal episode, a stat head
   CT showed new edema surrounding the site of biopsy. This is concerning
   for infection. Neurosurgery is on board.  Cultures, EBV PCR, and [**Male First Name (un) 561**]
   Virus PCR from CSF were all negative. HSV PCR was negative.
   - MRI with gad to further evaluate edema
   - continue antibiotics but ?coverage for intraparenchymal brain abscess
   that covers anaerobes
   - holding on steroids per neurosurg for now
   - q2h neuro checks
   - f/u brain bx results
   - f/u pending studies
   .
   # Tachycardia: baseline HR appears to be 100-110 for last several
   days.  Sinus tachy on EKG.  [**Month (only) 51**] be in setting of hypoxia and anxiety.
   Also consider PE as above.  Tachycardia may also be worsening her
   diastolic dysfunction leading to increased pulm congestion.
   - continue metop [**Hospital1 **] as scheduled.
   .
   # Cards Pump: Echo showed decreased EF with systolic dysfunction and
   diastolic dysfunction. No evidence of volume overload on exam, on
   contrary, likely there is some hypovolemia given syncope and transient
   hypotension.
   - rate control with metoprolol
   .
   # Cards vascular: no known hx CAD.  Monitor on telemetry.
   - BB
   - hold on ASA for now.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: had been receiving IV Vitamin K and now INR has
   normalized.  Coagulopathy thought [**1-7**] liver involvement of cancer
   - trend daily
   .
   # Recent seizure/neuro: continue keppra 1500 [**Hospital1 **].  no evidence of
   seizure activity on exam.
   .
   # Lymphoma: defer to heme/onc for further management, ?chemo
   - continue antifungal
   .
   # anemia: has been in mid-20s. Goal HCT is >21.
   - note: needs irradiated blood [**1-7**] to SCT

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma, post autosct, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and altered mental status. She presented with respiratory distress, hypoxia, and syncope. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to bibasilar infiltrates on CXR and no breath sounds at the left base. The differential diagnosis includes aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The plan is to treat for aspiration pneumonitis with supportive care and suctioning. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued to cover potential intracranial infection. 

The patient also experienced hypotension during the syncopal episode but rebounded quickly with minimal fluids. There are no signs of infection, so monitoring will continue. 

Regarding the altered mental status, the patient had a stat head CT showing new edema surrounding the site of biopsy, which is concerning for infection. Neurosurgery is on board, and cultures, EBV PCR, and HSV PCR from CSF were all negative. An MRI with gadolinium will be done to further evaluate the edema, and antibiotics will be continued to cover for an intraparenchymal brain abscess.

The patient has tachycardia, which may be due to hypoxia, anxiety, or PE. Rate control with metoprolol will be continued.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of hematologic malignancy and splenectomy, who is currently in the ICU for further management. She has been experiencing recurrent episodes of hypoxia, which may be due to aspiration pneumonia. Other considerations include pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, and acute coronary syndrome. She also has frontal lobe edema post-biopsy, corrected anemia and thrombocytopenia, and is being monitored closely for any neurological changes. The patient's syncope is likely a vasovagal episode caused by volume depletion. She also has pancytopenia secondary to lymphoma and requires ongoing antifungal therapy. Her hypothyroidism is being managed with synthroid. She has been NPO (nothing by mouth) in preparation for potential neurosurgical intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of recurrent episodes of aspiration puts her at risk for developing aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy is necessary.
2. Pulmonary edema: Although the patient appears to be volume down, there is still a possibility of pulmonary edema. Monitoring for worsening respiratory symptoms and considering gentle diuresis if needed.
3. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's high risk for thromboembolic events due to malignancy, it is important to consider the possibility of pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation with a CT angiogram may be"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo F w/ hodgkin's s/p autosct, ITP, now with altered mental status,
   syncopal episode and transient hypoxia.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: the patient is an extremely high aspiration
   risk given ?vocal cord paralysis and recent dysphagia. Was in the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   1 week ago for a similar hypoxic episode, thought to be secondary to
   aspiration at that time. The patient has since developed bibasilar
   infiltrates on CXR and on exam, had no breath sounds at the left base.
   She has been on very broad spectrum antibiotics for this.
   Currently, the differential diagnosis of the hypoxia witnessed during
   today's syncopal event includes a new aspiration pneumonitis (likely
   given hx and secretions) in the setting of an already brewing pna in
   the LLL, PE (possible since only on boots s/p brain surgery, however no
   other changes and has radiographic findings that support infectious
   etiology), acute coronary syndrome (but EKG unchanged and negative set
   of cardiac enzymes).
   - will treat for asp pneumonitis with supportive care, suctioning, O2
   etc. Satting very well on minimal supplemental O2 right now.
   - continue flagyl and vanco for now to also cover potential
   intracranial infection, would prefer cefepime instead of aztreonam for
   postoperative neurosurgical infection, but patient is pen allergic.
   - repeat sputum cx and assess interval change on CXR
   - although PE is quite possible, there continues to be no evidence of
   RH strain on EKG, and there is no appreciable difference in her
   tachycardia as this has been ongoing.  Will treat other etiologies and
   consider CTA in am if remains hypoxic.
   - continue nebs as per previous
   .
   # Hypotension: patient was transiently hypotensive to the 80's during
   this syncopal episode, she has not been taking good PO's in last 24
   hours or so, secondary to nausea. Her pressure rebounded quickly with
   minimal fluids and has remained stable. Could be infection, but patient
   is afebrile and is otherwise not appearing bacteremic.
   - continue to monitor.
   - small boluses as required given history of systolic and diastolic
   dysfunction, albeit mild.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: the patient was thought to have CNS lymphoma
   vs. paraneoplastic syndrome vs. PML explaining her difficulty with
   vocal cord paralysis, and proximal weakness, although the biopsy is
   still pending, the findings so far are inconsistent with lymphoma or
   PML. Currently, in the setting of today's syncopal episode, a stat head
   CT showed new edema surrounding the site of biopsy. This is concerning
   for infection. Neurosurgery is on board.  Cultures, EBV PCR, and [**Male First Name (un) 561**]
   Virus PCR from CSF were all negative. HSV PCR was negative.
   - MRI with gad to further evaluate edema
   - continue antibiotics but ?coverage for intraparenchymal brain abscess
   that covers anaerobes
   - holding on steroids per neurosurg for now
   - q2h neuro checks
   - f/u brain bx results
   - f/u pending studies
   .
   # Tachycardia: baseline HR appears to be 100-110 for last several
   days.  Sinus tachy on EKG.  [**Month (only) 51**] be in setting of hypoxia and anxiety.
   Also consider PE as above.  Tachycardia may also be worsening her
   diastolic dysfunction leading to increased pulm congestion.
   - continue metop [**Hospital1 **] as scheduled.
   .
   # Cards Pump: Echo showed decreased EF with systolic dysfunction and
   diastolic dysfunction. No evidence of volume overload on exam, on
   contrary, likely there is some hypovolemia given syncope and transient
   hypotension.
   - rate control with metoprolol
   .
   # Cards vascular: no known hx CAD.  Monitor on telemetry.
   - BB
   - hold on ASA for now.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: had been receiving IV Vitamin K and now INR has
   normalized.  Coagulopathy thought [**1-7**] liver involvement of cancer
   - trend daily
   .
   # Recent seizure/neuro: continue keppra 1500 [**Hospital1 **].  no evidence of
   seizure activity on exam.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's disease, post-autoimmune stem cell transplantation (SCT), and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The patient presented with altered mental status, a syncopal episode, and transient hypoxia. 

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory distress due to vocal cord paralysis and recent dysphagia. She has bibasilar infiltrates on CXR and no breath sounds at the left base. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

The differential diagnosis for the hypoxia includes aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute coronary syndrome. The patient is being treated for aspiration pneumonitis with supportive care, and further investigations such as repeat sputum CX and assessment of interval changes on CXR are planned. The possibility of PE is also being considered, with a potential computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the morning if hypoxia persists.

The patient also experienced hypotension during the syncopal episode, which may be secondary to poor oral intake and nausea. Close monitoring and small boluses of fluids are being administered.

An altered mental status was initially thought to be due to CNS lymphoma, paraneoplastic syndrome, or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). However, recent findings suggest infection as the cause, and cultures, EBV PCR, and ["

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxemia and syncope. The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, brain edema/lesion in the frontal lobe, hypotension, seizures, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and a fungal line infection. The patient is currently in the ICU and receiving various treatments including antimicrobials, IV fluids, Cepra, and Fluconazole. The patient's condition is improving, with improved respiratory status and reduced FiO2 requirement. The patient is tolerating nasal cannula with SaO2 >95%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory complications such as worsening hypoxemia, lung abscess, or sepsis.
2. Brain edema/lesion in frontal lobe: This could potentially cause increased intracranial pressure, seizures, or neurological deficits.
3. Hypotension: The patient's episode of hypotension responded to IV fluids, but there is a risk of recurrent hypotension if fluid balance is not maintained properly.
4. Seizures: Although the patient had a seizure, it was likely due to the brain biopsy site. However, there is still a risk of recurrent seizures due to the underlying brain lesion.
5. Hodgkin's lymphoma: The patient has recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma, which may require additional chemotherapy or radiation treatment. Complications"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) who underwent stem cell transplantation (SCT) and is also suffering from immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) after splenectomy. The patient experienced transient hypotension and hypoxia during a syncopal episode.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxia, frontal lobe edema post-biopsy, diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, persistent fluid in the sphenoid sinus, and opacification of the right lateral mastoid air cells. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she has been diagnosed with coag-negative staphylococcal infection in her urine.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Hypoxia: The likely cause of hypoxia is aspiration pneumonia (APNA) due to recurrent episodes of aspiration, along with clinical improvement on antibiotics. Other considerations include Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). If the patient worsens or remains hypoxic, a repeat chest X-ray and consideration of gentle diuresis or adding Bactrim/Azithromycin for PCP/atypical coverage based on the film may be necessary. A computed tomography angiogram (CTA) may also be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   Syncope, hypoxemia --> aspiration pneumonia.
   Hypoxemia -- attributed to aspiration.
   Pneumonia -- aspiration, LLL > RLL.  Antimicrobials.
   Confusion/Delerium -- possible attributed to underlying CNS process.
   Unclear contribution of medications (ex. Zofran) and ICU psychosis.
   Consider repeat Head CT to assess for interval change.
   Hodgkin's Lymphoma -- recurrent.  CHemotherapy.
   Nutritional support -- Resume TF via PEG.
   Pancytopenia -- attributed to ChemoRx.  Recommendations per Heme/Onc
   team.
   Syncope -- no further episodes.  Attributed to hypvolemia +/- vasovagal
   episode.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. He has a history of Hodgkin's Lymphoma and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells and platelets yesterday. He appears to be somewhat more delirious and confused today, although he is more alert and interactive. The patient is experiencing visual hallucinations. He has no allergies to penicillins. The patient received antibiotics (Aztreonam, Metronidazole, and Vancomycin) overnight. His vital signs show a temperature of 35.9 degrees Celsius, blood pressure of 106/56 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.21. On physical examination, the patient is well-nourished, has a surgical scar on his forehead, and has no acute distress. The patient's cardiovascular examination is normal, with no murmurs or signs of heart failure. His extremities are warm, and there is no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. He is oriented to person and shows purposeful movement. His tone is normal. 

Lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, leukopenia with a white blood cell"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of hematologic malignancy who is currently in the ICU. She has undergone stem cell transplantation (SCT) and splenectomy, and has experienced episodes of hypotension and hypoxia in the past. The patient is currently experiencing confusion, hallucinations, and delirium. She has a provisional diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics. The patient's MS changes and frontal lobe edema are being closely monitored, and a repeat CT scan is planned for tomorrow. The patient's low platelet count and anemia are being corrected, and she is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her syncope is likely due to a vasovagal episode, and her lymphoma status post chemotherapy is being managed by the BMT team. The patient also has hypothyroidism, PPX, and FEN plans in place. The patient's family has been informed and consent is documented in the chart. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of recurrent episodes of aspiration increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. The provisional diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia and clinical improvement on antibiotics suggest that this is a potential complication.
2. Pulmonary edema: Although the patient appears to be volume down, pulmonary edema is another consideration for her hypoxia.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Due to her high risk of malignancy, PE is also a consideration"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) post stem cell transplantation (SCT) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) post splenectomy. The patient experienced transient hypotension and hypoxia in the setting of a syncopal episode. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, which has now resolved with good oxygen saturation on room air. She is suspected to have aspiration pneumonia (APNA) given imaging findings, history of recurrent episodes of aspiration, and clinical improvement on antibiotics. Other considerations include Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, the EKG remains unchanged, and cardiac enzymes are negative, making ACS less likely.

The patient is on vancomycin, flagyl, and aztreonam for prophylactic therapy of possible infections post brain biopsy. However, since there is no longer concern for brain abscess, it is planned to discontinue these antibiotics and switch to levofloxacin tomorrow for possible pneumonia.

The patient's mental status change is most likely due to medications, disorienting nature of the ICU. The repeat CT scan is planned for tomorrow to rule out worsening of subacute bleed in the setting of low platelets.

The patient has a history of persistent tachycardia of unknown etiology and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with Hodgkin's Lymphoma, initially admitted for aspiration pneumonia. She presented back to the ICU with a syncopal episode accompanied by hypotension and hypoxia, which was likely vasovagal. The patient has persistent visual hallucinations but no more syncope. Her head CT showed no significant changes, with no evidence of abscess. She is unable to provide her own history due to encephalopathy.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, including hives and rash. Her last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin on 07/08/2108 at 07:38 PM, Metronidazole on 07/09/2108 at 05:48 AM, and Aztreonam on 07/09/2108 at 08:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 90 bpm (87-108 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 84/50 mmHg to 152/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (16-27 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Her heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Flowsheet data shows that she has received a total input of 1,322 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an output of 1,660 mL, resulting in a balance of -338 mL. She has received respiratory support but is not currently on oxygen delivery devices. Her ABG results are pending.

Physical examination findings include no acute distress, pupils that are equal, round, and reactive to light, normocephalic head, no endotracheal or nasogastric tubes, and no signs of lymphadenopathy. Her cardiovascular examination reveals a normal point of maximal impulse and S1 and S2 sounds, but S2 is distant. Her extremities are cool and clammy, and she has absent peripheral pulses bilaterally in her lower extremities. Her skin is not assessed. Neurologic examination shows that she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to time, place, and person, but movement, tone, and strength are not assessed.

Lab results include a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, leukocyte count of 51 K/uL, platelet count of 97 mg/dL, sodium level of 22 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.1 mEq/L, blood glucose level of 90 mg/dL, bicarbonate level of 26.0%, and creatinine level of 0.3 mg/dL. Other lab values, including WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, and electrolytes, are provided in the attached image.

   Assessment and Plan
   Problems:
   1)       syncope
   2)       Pneumonia-aspiration
   .
   Confusion/Delerium/Hollucinations
 No metabolic abnormalities now.
   Unclear relationship of this finding to her recent bx. Patient denies
   abnormal aromas/smells that might indicate temporal lobe seizures.
   Consider an EEG.
   Continues on antibiotics for presumed aspiration pneumonia. Oxygenation
   excellent without supplemental oxygen.
   Hodgkin's Lymphoma -- recurrent.  CHemotherapy.
   Nutritional support -- Resume TF via PEG.
   Pancytopenia -- attributed to ChemoRx.  Recommendations per Heme/Onc
   team.
   Syncope -- no further episodes.  Attributed to hypvolemia +/- vasovagal
   episode.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 30 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's Lymphoma. She was initially admitted for aspiration pneumonia and has since been transferred back to the ICU due to a syncopal episode with hypotension and hypoxia. The patient experienced persistent visual hallucinations, but was not upset by them. Her head CT showed no significant changes, and there were no signs of abscess. 

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, hives, and rash. She received antibiotics including vancomycin, metronidazole, and aztreonam. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/50 mmHg to 152/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of fatigue. She is unable to provide her own history due to encephalopathy. 

Her physical examination reveals a normocephalic head, no poor dentition, no endotracheal or nasogastric tubes, and no cervical lymphadenopathy. She has a systolic murmur heard throughout the precordium and radiating to the neck. Her extremities show absent pulses in both lower extremities, and she"
