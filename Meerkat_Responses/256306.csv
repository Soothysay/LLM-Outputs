","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, cirrhosis of the liver, impaired skin integrity, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 65/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient is currently receiving IV fluids and has been given a bolus of 250cc, which showed good effect. An ultrasound of the abdomen revealed multiple stones in the gallbladder, an enlarged spleen, moderate amount of ascites, and normal flow in the portal veins. No free air or evidence of obstruction was observed on the abdominal film. Stool studies have been sent for analysis. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (5.2), liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 14/25), and a slightly low platelet count (54). The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 152 mg/dL, and other electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated at 9.0, while the Hct and Plt levels are within normal range. The patient's TropT, Glucose, and other lab values are within normal limits"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Patient more normotensive today.  Diarrhea losses probably
   larger than estimated and patient has chronic volume losses.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Continue flagyl/CTX for now (day #2)
   - Could check cortisol, TSH (not yet done)
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derrangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures
   -Consider diagnostic paracentesis given ascites on US if abdominal pain
   or persistent sx
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   -Trend lactate
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   -Continue Abx for now
   - F/U Nutrition consult
   - Consider fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   1.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U other stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, stop antibiotics.
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   -Repeat EKG
   -Consider ECHO if weakness/hypotension persist
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 57 which is lower than it
   has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a
   component of splenic sequestration, given known history of portal
   hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (up slightly today but in setting of
   hemoconcentration)
   .
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - consider dental consult.
   # FEN: prn IVF, replete electrolytes aggressively,  Renal Diet
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   # Disposition: Call out to floor if not extremely hypotensive.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, as well as pulmonary embolism (PE). He presented to the emergency department with complaints of weakness and confusion. On examination, he had hypotension, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels, raising concerns for sepsis. The patient's baseline blood pressure is typically in the 70s systolic. He has been experiencing diarrhea, estimated to be around 5 liters per day, which has been a chronic issue but may have worsened recently. His diarrhea contributes to weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities. The patient's troponin levels have been consistently low, indicating no acute cardiac event. He also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 57, likely due to splenic sequestration. The patient's mouth pain is attributed to denture malalignment. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of hypotension, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels suggests the possibility of sepsis. Prompt management and further investigation are necessary to identify the source of infection.
2. Diarrhea: The patient's chronic and severe diarrhea can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition. It is important to quantify the"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Two episodes of hypotension to 50s/30s overnight but patient
   was mentating well, given recent HD received gentle 250 cc bolus.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Continue flagyl/CTX for now (day #2)
   - Could check cortisol, TSH (not yet done)
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derrangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures
   -Consider diagnostic paracentesis given ascites on US if abdominal pain
   or persistent sx
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   -Trend lactate
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   -Continue Abx for now
   -Nutrition consult
   -Consider fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   1.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U other stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   .
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been .21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   -Repeat EKG
   -Consider ECHO if weakness/hypotension persist
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 57 which is lower than it
   has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a
   component of splenic sequestration, given known history of portal
   hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (up slightly today but in setting of
   hemoconcentration)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cryptogenic cirrhosis with ascites requiring paracentesis, and pulmonary embolism (PE). He presented to the emergency department with complaints of weakness and confusion. The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, including one episode while sleeping with a blood pressure reading of 51/32 mmHg. His mentation was fine during this episode, and he responded well to a 250cc fluid bolus. An ultrasound revealed multiple stones in the gallbladder and an enlarged spleen. Moderate ascites was also observed, with normal flow seen in the portal veins. An abdominal film showed no signs of free air or obstruction. Stool studies have been sent for analysis. The patient has no known drug allergies. He received metronidazole and ceftriaxone on [**2106-5-7**]. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 65/34 mmHg to 66/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 101% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.0 K/uL, slightly low hem"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. The patient had a conversation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] regarding the utility of fat pad biopsy for amyloidosis. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] does not believe that the patient's amyloidosis is secondary to end-stage renal disease (ERSD), but suggests that the patient may have systemic amyloidosis of another etiology. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] also recommends consulting with a gastroenterologist regarding the management of diarrhea, as he feels it is contributing to the patient's current symptoms and compromising overall care. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] also suggests contacting the patient's hepatologist, Dr. [**Name (NI) 2912**], for input.

Additionally, the patient complained of left shoulder pain today, reportedly after a fall several days ago prior to admission. Plain films were obtained and showed a distal clavicular fracture with superior displacement, subluxation of the humeral head. An orthopedic consult was requested, who recommended obtaining a dedicated axillary view film and sling for comfort when out of bed.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were metronidazole at 02:00 AM on [**2106-5-8**] and ceftriaxone at 04:00 AM on the same date.

The patient is currently receiving various ICU medications and other medications as well.

There are no changes to the patient's medical and family history mentioned in the progress note.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the new complaint of left shoulder pain.

Flow sheet data as of [**2106-5-8**] 07:04 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant information. The patient's temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F) with a maximum temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F) and current temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F). The patient's heart rate is 89 beats per minute with a range of 87-111 bpm. Blood pressure readings are 71/49 mmHg with a range of 54-93/32-58 mmHg. Respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute with a range of 15-22 insp/min. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Total intake is 2,417 mL with 221 mL given through total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Total output is 840 mL via the oral route, 1,577 mL via intravenous fluids, and 0 mL of blood products. Urine output is not mentioned. No information is provided regarding nasogastric (NG) tube, stool,"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Patient more normotensive today.  Diarrhea losses probably
   larger than estimated and patient has chronic volume losses.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Continue flagyl/CTX for now (day #3)
   - f/u  cortisol, TSH
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Consider diagnostic paracentesis given ascites on US if abdominal pain
   or persistent sx
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   -Trend lactate
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   -Continue Abx for now
   - F/U Nutrition consult
   - Consider fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   1.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - resend other stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, stop antibiotics.
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 51 which is lower than it
   has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a
   component of splenic sequestration, given known history of portal
   hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Message left with dental consult.

   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cryptogenic cirrhosis with ascites, and pulmonary embolism (PE). He was admitted to the ICU with complaints of weakness and confusion. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, diarrhea, elevated troponin levels, thrombocytopenia, and mouth pain. The vital signs show a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 71/49 mmHg to 60/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is currently receiving intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels raise concerns for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid status, and ongoing assessment for signs of infection are necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requires careful fluid management. Bolus normal saline (NS) should be administered for blood pressures below 70 mmHg, and the renal team will monitor fluid status and blood pressure closely during hemodialysis sessions.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's significant diarrhea may contribute to weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances. Quantifying the volume of diarrhea"

   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Unifying diagnoses could include systemic
   amyloidosis (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is
   [**Name2 (NI) 14361**] positive, but patient has historically refused testing).
   Patient has had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may
   contribute.

   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of ESRD on HD, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs. He was admitted to the ICU with complaints of weakness and confusion. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, leukocytosis, elevated lactate, diarrhea, and elevated troponin levels. He also has thrombocytopenia, a clavicle fracture, and mouth pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count and increased lactate suggest the possibility of an infection, which could be severe if not treated promptly.
3. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has a history of frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which can contribute to weakness and confusion.
4. Diarrhea: The patient's chronic and voluminous diarrhea may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and weakness.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count could increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Clavicle Fracture: The patient has a clavicle fracture, which may require immobilization and pain management.
7. Mouth Pain: The patient's upper gum pain may indicate dental issues and could potentially lead to complications if not managed properly.

   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis.  Elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis but has normalized. Patient more hypotensive after HD and unable
   to be called out, but continues to mentate well.  Responeded to 250 cc
   bolus..  Diarrhea losses probably larger than estimated and patient has
   chronic volume losses.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are
   consistent with patient
s baseline and not cause for special concern or
   pressors. Cortisol at 3:00 AM = 22.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of dental issues. The patient has been in the ICU since [**2106-5-6**] and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's blood pressure remains low, ranging from 51-155 mmHg systolic and 33-97 mmHg diastolic. The patient's heart rate is within normal limits, ranging from 84-123 beats per minute. Respiratory rate is also within normal limits, ranging from 12-23 breaths per minute. The patient's temperature is stable, ranging from 97.6-97.9 degrees Celsius.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are within normal limits. Electrolyte levels are within normal range except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. Glucose levels are elevated.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's consistently low blood pressure indicates a potential risk for hypotension. This could be due to sepsis or other underlying conditions.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure or severe respiratory distress.
3. Infection: Elevated white blood cell count and presence of lesions in the mouth may suggest an ongoing infection.
4. Renal Dysfunction: Although the"

   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Patient more normotensive today.  Diarrhea losses probably
   larger than estimated and patient has chronic volume losses.  Per Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are consistent with patient
   baseline and not cause for special concern or pressors. Cortisol at
   3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Consider diagnostic paracentesis given ascites on US if abdominal pain
   or persistent sx
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   -Trend lactate
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, stop antibiotics.
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   or restart loperamide
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 51 which is lower than it
   has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a
   component of splenic sequestration, given known history of portal
   hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs
   - Orabase PRN for mouth pain
   - Consider Peridex rinse if lesions develop (antimicrobial) per dental
   recs
   #ESRD. Plan for HD Tuesday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cryptogenic cirrhosis with ascites requiring paracentesis, and pulmonary embolism (PE). He was admitted to the ICU with complaints of weakness and confusion. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels, raising concerns for sepsis. His baseline blood pressure is in the 70s, which is consistent with his chronic volume losses and ESRD. The patient's weakness and confusion could be due to metabolic derangements from liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy or renal failure, although dialysis was performed recently. Infection is also a possibility, with high white blood cell count and increased lactate levels suggesting a potential source from the peritoneum, blood, pulmonary, or biliary system. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and leukocytosis raise concerns for sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, infection parameters, and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be important.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Although the ammonia level is low, the patient's confusion may still be related to hepatic encephalopathy secondary to liver failure. Monitoring for changes in mental status and hepatic function will be necessary.
3. Diarrhea: The patient reports voluminous diarrhea, which can contribute to"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Patient more normotensive today.  Diarrhea losses probably
   larger than estimated and patient has chronic volume losses.  Per Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are consistent with patient
   baseline and not cause for special concern or pressors. Cortisol at
   3:00 AM = 22.

   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.

   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x

   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, stop antibiotics.

   or restart loperamide
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.

   tolerated.
   - F/U final read of plain films

   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 51 which is lower than it
   has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, and pulmonary embolism (PE). He was admitted to the ICU with complaints of weakness and confusion. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate levels, which raise concern for sepsis. He also has chronic volume losses due to diarrhea and chronic hypotension as a baseline. The patient's weakness and confusion could be attributed to various factors such as metabolic derangements from liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy or renal failure, infection, or malnutrition.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest a possible infection, which can lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites raises the possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause confusion and mental status changes.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which can contribute to weakness and other systemic complications.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's low albumin level indicates possible malnutrition, which can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of infections.
5. Chronic volume losses: The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and pulmonary embolism. He was admitted to the ICU with complaints of weakness and confusion. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, elevated lactate levels, leukocytosis, and diarrhea. He also has a history of chronic volume losses and an elevated baseline blood pressure in the 70s.

Assessment and Plan:

1. HYPOTENSION: The patient's baseline blood pressure is in the 70s and is not considered a cause for concern. Fluid boluses will be given based on clinical examination and maintenance fluids to match losses. Bolus normal saline will be administered for blood pressures below 70, and the renal team will monitor fluid status and blood pressure during hemodialysis sessions.

2. WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Possible causes include metabolic derangements due to liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy or renal failure. Infection is also a possibility, with high white blood cell count and increased lactate levels suggesting a potential source from the peritoneum, blood, pulmonary, or biliary system. Albumin levels are significantly lower than previously recorded, indicating possible malnutrition as a contributing factor to weakness. Systemic amyloidosis and HIV infection are being considered as unifying diagnoses. Frequent electrolyte abnormalities may also contribute to the patient's weakness"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis.  Elevated lactate which raised concern for
   sepsis but has normalized. Patient more hypotensive after HD and unable
   to be called out, but continues to mentate well.  Responded to 250 cc
   bolus..  Diarrhea losses probably larger than estimated and patient has
   chronic volume losses.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are
   consistent with patient
s baseline and not cause for special concern or
   pressors. Cortisol at 3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx without change
   - stopped midodrine yesterday as no change in abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Unifying diagnoses could include systemic
   amyloidosis (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is
   [**Name2 (NI) 14361**] positive, but patient has historically refused testing).
   Patient has had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may
   contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult for [**Last Name (un) **] with bxs once infectious workup negative
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   - restart loperamide today
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   # Clavicle fracture: Sling for comfort per ortho recs. Activity as
   tolerated. Pain control appropriate at this time
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 47 from 51 which is lower
   than it has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may
   have a component of splenic sequestration, given known history of
   portal hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs
   - Orabase PRN for mouth pain
   - Consider Peridex rinse if lesions develop (antimicrobial) per dental
   recs
   #ESRD. Plan for HD Tuesday, follow up renal recs.
   # FEN: prn IVF, replete electrolytes aggressively,  Renal Diet
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   # Disposition: Likely stay in ICU for now given low BPs, consider call
   out as his BPs are stable.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (last dialysis on 05/06), cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, as well as pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient was admitted from the emergency department with complaints of weakness and confusion.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, which is not considered a cause for concern given the patient's baseline blood pressure in the 70s systolic. The patient also has leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels, which raised concerns for sepsis but have normalized. The patient responded well to a 250 cc bolus and continues to be alert and oriented.

The patient's diarrhea is significant, with reported volumes of up to 5 liters daily. This chronic issue contributes to weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities. The patient's C. difficile test came back negative twice.

Other findings include elevated troponin levels, which may be a new baseline in the setting of ESRD. The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. The patient also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 47, which is lower than his usual range of 90-100. This could be due to splenic sequestration secondary to portal hypertension and splenomegaly.

The patient has a"
