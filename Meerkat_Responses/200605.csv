   Assessment and Plan
   48 y/o with history of neuromuscular disorder, paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation s/p ablation today, hypotensive after protamine and
   difficult to extubate.
   Respiratory distress: patient difficult to extubate after case.
   attempted briefly, but since patient was hypotensive, sent to CCU.
   - CXR to check ET tube placement
   - ABG now
   - check NIF
   - attempt to extubate in the AM
   - propofol for sedation
   Hypotension: since getting protamine in the EP lab. likely protamine
   reaction, since it can cause sudden, transient drop in blood pressure
   with rapid infusion. now normotensive on minimal phenylephrine.
   afebrile and no white count so sepsis unlikely. likely transient, now
   resolving
   - wean phenylephrine as tolerated
   - check UA, CXR
   - discontinue sheaths in the AM, still has 2 right femoral and 1 left
   femoral sheath.
   Atrial fibrillation: s/p ablation.
   - will continue coumadin for now
   - continue propafenone for now
   - check INR In MA
   Mitochondrial Neuromuscular disorder: If patient unable to extubate in
   the AM, may need neurology consult.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old individual with a history of neuromuscular disorder and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who underwent ablation. The patient experienced hypotension after receiving protamine and had difficulty being extubated.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 61-76 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 65-88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

The patient has received infusions of phenylephrine and propofol. They are also on other ICU medications and have a few other medications listed. There are no known drug allergies.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress after the case. The patient was difficult to extubate and was sent to the CCU due to hypotension. 

The patient's physical examination shows clear lungs, a supple neck, and no signs of jugular venous distention. The cardiac examination reveals a normal S1 and S2 without murmurs, lifts, or thrills. There are no abnormal findings in the abdomen or extremities. 

Laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, and blood glucose"

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of neuromuscular disorder, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who underwent ablation and experienced hypotension after receiving protamine, making it difficult to extubate. The patient is currently sedated, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/57 mmHg to 126/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a sinus rhythm and adequate fluid balance.

The patient is receiving infusions of phenylephrine and propofol for hemodynamic support and sedation, respectively. They have multiple IV lines, including two right femoral and one left femoral sheath, which will need to be removed in the morning.

Laboratory results indicate normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, glucose, and electrolytes, except for slightly low calcium and magnesium levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs, no jugular venous distention, and no peripheral edema. Neurological examination shows the patient opening his eyes, responding to voice, and moving all extremities upon command.

The patient's current assessment includes respiratory distress due to difficulty in extubation, hypotension"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old with a history of neuromuscular disorder and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who underwent ablation today. They are currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient experienced respiratory distress after the case yesterday and was difficult to extubate. They are being ventilated with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and a PEEP of 8 cmH2O. The FiO2 is set at 75% and the SpO2 is 92%. The patient's blood pressure is low at 98/57 mmHg, and they have a heart rate of 72 beats per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 92% on 100% FiO2. The ABG results show a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 32, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 127. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin is 15.4 g/dL, and platelet count is 169 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation, daily wake-up calls, and mouth care should"

   48 y/o with history of neuromuscular disorder, paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation s/p ablation today, hypotensive after protamine and
   difficult to extubate.
   Respiratory distress: Difficult to extubate after case yesterday.
   Likely from chronic meuromuscular disorder.  Does not look overloaded
   on exam.  Making mild progress on the vent.
   - repeat CXR to check ET tube placement
   - check NIF
   - attempt to today
   - propofol for sedation
   Hypotension: Probably from protamine in the EP lab.  Also vent causes
   hypotension.
   - weanes off neo
   - f/u UA, CXR
   - discontinue sheaths, still has 2 right femoral and 1 left femoral
   sheath.
   Atrial fibrillation: s/p pulm vein isolation.
   - will continue coumadin for now
   - continue propafenone
   - [**Doctor Last Name **] of hearts monitor
   - check INR
   Mitochondrial Neuromuscular disorder: If patient unable to extubate in
   the AM, may need neurology consult.

   48 y/o with history of neuromuscular disorder, paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation s/p ablation admitted for hypotension after protamine
   which resolved and difficult extubation now with ongoing hypoxia.
   Hypoxia: Likely from chronic neuromuscular disorder and diaphragmatic
   weakness +/- aspiration and atelectasis given dependent bibasilar
   parenchymal opacities on Chest CT.  Extubated with ongoing hypoxia. It
   is possible that this is chronic but this is unclear.
   - incentive spirometer
   - aspiration precautions, nectar thickened liquids, video swallow on
   Monday or as an outpt
   - will likely need home O2 which has been set up if goes over weekend

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 48-year-old with a history of neuromuscular disorder, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and recent ablation. They were admitted for hypotension after protamine administration, which resolved, and had difficulty extubation. The patient is currently experiencing ongoing hypoxia.

Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's hypoxia may be due to diaphragmatic weakness and atelectasis. These factors increase the risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or worsening hypoxia.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has been recommended aspiration precautions and nectar-thickened liquids, indicating a concern for aspiration pneumonia. This condition can lead to respiratory distress and sepsis.

3. Pulmonary Embolism: Although the CT angiography did not show any pulmonary embolism, it is still a possibility considering the patient's immobilization and other risk factors.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of DVT formation. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent this complication.

5. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and recent ablation. Monitoring and continued use of anticoagulation therapy are necessary to prevent cardiac complications such as stroke or thromboembolism.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old individual with a history of neuromuscular disorder, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and recent ablation. The patient was admitted for hypotension after receiving protamine, which resolved, and had difficulty with extubation. Currently, the patient is experiencing ongoing hypoxia.

The assessment suggests that the hypoxia is likely due to chronic neuromuscular disorder and diaphragmatic weakness, possibly exacerbated by aspiration and atelectasis. The patient has dependent bibasilar parenchymal opacities on Chest CT. The patient has been extubated but still has hypoxia, which may be chronic in nature.

The plan includes using an incentive spirometer to improve lung volumes, taking aspiration precautions, providing nectar-thickened liquids, and conducting a video swallow on Monday or as an outpatient. The patient will also require home oxygen, which has been set up. Repeat NIF (Negative Inspiratory Force) and VC (Vital Capacity) measurements by pulmonary will be done. The patient will appreciate pulmonary recommendations and an echocardiogram will be performed today.

The patient's atrial fibrillation, which was treated with pulmonary vein isolation, has been successful as the patient has been in normal sinus rhythm since. The patient will continue on coumadin for now and propafenone. The doctor of hearts will monitor the patient on discharge.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 48-year-old with a history of a neuromuscular disorder and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who was admitted for hypotension after receiving protamine and had difficult extubation.
- The patient is currently experiencing ongoing hypoxia, likely due to a chronic neuromuscular disorder and diaphragmatic weakness, possibly accompanied by aspiration and atelectasis.
- The patient has bibasilar parenchymal opacities on chest CT, which may indicate chronic hypoxia.
- The patient's current plan includes incentive spirometer use, aspiration precautions, thickened liquids, video swallow, and potential home oxygen therapy.
- Additional tests and consultations are recommended, including a pulmonary follow-up, repeat NIF and VC, echocardiogram, and possible neurology consultation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's hypoxia and diaphragmatic weakness could lead to further respiratory complications such as pneumonia, worsening atelectasis, or respiratory failure.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: Given the patient's difficulty in mobilizing secretions and potential aspiration risk, there is a possibility of developing aspiration pneumonia.
3. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic anticoagulation is being administered.
4. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old with a history of neuromuscular disorder and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, admitted for hypotension after protamine administration and difficult extubation. The patient is currently experiencing ongoing hypoxia, likely due to chronic neuromuscular disorder and diaphragmatic weakness. Other findings include mild right ventricular enlargement with preserved wall motion, biatrial enlargement, and dependent bibasilar parenchymal opacities on chest CT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's ongoing hypoxia may be caused by chronic neuromuscular disorder and diaphragmatic weakness. It is also possible that aspiration and atelectasis are contributing factors due to the bibasilar opacities on the chest CT.
2. Mitochondrial Neuromuscular Disorder: The patient's low sats may be related to diaphragmatic weakness and inability to mobilize secretions. Considering a neuro consult if not improved.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation post pulmonary vein isolation, but has been in normal sinus rhythm since. Monitoring on tele, continuing coumadin, and propafenone.
4. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which has since resolved. It was likely caused by protamine in the EP lab.
5. Thyroid Nodule: The patient has a thyroid nodule,"
