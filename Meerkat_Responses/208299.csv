","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of asthma and pan-sinusitis, both of unclear etiology. She has been admitted with bilateral upper lobe findings on CT scan. The differential diagnosis includes asthma exacerbation, infection, inflammatory lung condition (Churg-Strauss syndrome or Aspergillus), hypoxemic respiratory failure, and other possible conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's history of asthma increases the risk of an asthma exacerbation, which can lead to respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
2. Infection: Given the recent course of antibiotics and prednisone, as well as the bilateral upper lobe infiltrates, there is a possibility of a pulmonary infection, such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or atypical pneumonia. This could worsen the patient's respiratory status and lead to sepsis.
3. Churg-Strauss syndrome: The patient's recent eosinophilia and history of asthma and sinus disease raise suspicion for Churg-Strauss syndrome, a vasculitis that can affect various organs, including the lungs. It can cause respiratory complications and organ damage.
4. Aspergillus infection: The presence of bilateral upper lobe infiltrates and eosinophilia may suggest an Aspergillus infection, particularly allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) or invasive aspergillosis. These infections can cause significant"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo female with hx of CAD (with NSTEMI post ERCP), COPD on home O2,
   apspiration PNA who was recently discharged home and is now re-admitted
   with increasing hypoxemia in the setting of hyptertension at home now
   with new NSTEMI
   > Hypoxemia: likely CHF/CAD in setting of severe HTN (syst dysfunction
   elevated BNP); in addition may have PNA (dry cough, fever) and
   component of chronic COPD. Finally she has what looks like an increase
   in left sided effusion (although on the abdominal cuts of a previous CT
   there was no effusion). Will obtain a Chest CT today, will use theTTE
   to help guide whether it should be PE protocol, if there are signs of
   RV impairment then will pursue PE-CT
   -Continue diuresis (TBB goal even to net neg 500 cc)
   - Brief course of PO prednisone 40 mg PO x 5 days Day 1 = [**12-11**].
   - CT scan
   -Repeat ECHO  [**12-11**] given concern for evolving infarct
   -bronchodilators
   -Levoflox/Flagyl continued post ERCP x 7 day course, will await the
   results of CT scan to decide on whether we need to cont course for
   aspiration.
   > NSTEMI: likely demand ischemia, but she clearly has CAD with a new
   troponin rise on this admission concerning for a second  NSTEMI again
   in the setting of demand. Appreciate cardiology input. She may go to
   the cath lab for re-vascularization.
   -Continue ASA, plavix, heparin, ACE-I,  statin, BB for HR 50-60.
   Notably no previous coronary cath.
   - repeat TTE
   > Fever: PNA?, LLE cellulitis?, viral infection?, U/A is normal,
   LFT/Lip normal. She has remained Afebrile since her admission.
   -Continue levaquin/flagyl as above
   -Vanco for ? cellulitis
   -Follow up clx data.
    .> Lower ext swelling: appears to be consistent with cellulitis.There
   is no evidence of DVT on LENI.
   - cont vanco for cellulitis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted to the ICU for increasing hypoxemia, new NSTEMI, and suspected pneumonia. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and an elevated respiratory rate. Physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, a distended abdomen, and tenderness in both lower extremities. Laboratory results indicate anemia, leukocytosis, elevated troponin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's chest X-ray shows no evidence of effusion, but there is a concern for left-sided pleural effusion. The patient's condition is critical, and she is currently on multiple medications including diuretics, steroids, antibiotics, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels may be due to her underlying COPD, pneumonia, or congestive heart failure. This can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not promptly treated.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has experienced a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, which indicates reduced blood flow to the heart. If left untreated, it can lead to a full-blown heart attack or result in chronic ischemic heart disease.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, and abnormal"

The differential includes asthma exacerbation, infection, inflammatory lung condition (AEP, Churg-Strauss, Aspergillus), hypoxemic respiratory failure, and others. She may have asthma, sinus disease with a Churg-Strauss like process or AEP. Less likely would be ABPA, adult onset presentation of CF or ciliary dyskinesia. From an infectious standpoint, possibilities include CAP, atypical organisms, viral process, and TB. PCP seems unlikely as well. A biopsy of the sinus in 12/23 showed prominent eosinophilia.

Plan:
- Bronchoscopy with LUL lavage
- Continue broad coverage including Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Vancomycin
- Check GM and 1,3 glucan
- Check serum precip for Aspergillus, Check IgE, ESR, ANCA (P and C)
- Solumedrol 125 mg IV q 8h
- Check Pro-BNP
- Other issues per ICU resident note

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Given the patient's recent course of antibiotics and prednisone, as well as the presence of eosinophilia, there is a risk of infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are already being administered"

   lobe pna is atypical findings, ddx includes aspergillus, silicosis, tb,
   eosinophillic pna (difficult to interpret since on steroids and has

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of asthma and sinusitis. She presented with shortness of breath for three days and was admitted to the MICU for an asthma exacerbation and pneumonia. The patient has been on steroids for the past month, which may have immunocompromised her. Her physical examination shows difficulty breathing with wheezes in both upper and lower fields. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 95/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 94%. Her laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, elevated glucose level, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has been started on IV solumedrol, albuterol/ipratropium nebs, levofloxacin, and zosyn for presumed immunocompromised state with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Additional tests and treatments are planned, including an ANCA serology, bronchoscopic evaluation, and outpatient pulmonary function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest pneumonia. The specific pathogens causing the pneumonia need to be identified and treated appropriately.

2. Asthma Exacerbation: The patient's history of asthma and current symptoms indicate an asthma exacerbation. Aggressive management with bronchodilators and corticosteroids is necessary"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of asthma and pan-sinusitis, admitted with bilateral upper lobe findings on CT scan and prominent blood and BAL eosinophilia. She is currently being treated for hypoxemic respiratory failure with high-dose steroids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and other supportive measures. The leading diagnosis is Churg-Strauss syndrome, with alternate possibilities including chronic eosinophilic pneumonia and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Further investigations and follow-up are planned to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. The patient will require long-term steroid therapy and prophylaxis for potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Churg-Strauss syndrome: This is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and damage to various organs, including the lungs, skin, and nervous system. It can lead to complications such as pulmonary infiltrates, eosinophilic pneumonia, asthma exacerbations, and peripheral neuropathy.
2. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: This condition involves recurrent episodes of pneumonia caused by eosinophils, which are a type of white blood cell. Complications may include respiratory distress, coughing, wheezing, and chest pain.
3. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA): ABPA is an allergic reaction to the fungus Aspergillus, commonly seen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of asthma and pan-sinusitis, admitted for bilateral upper lobe findings on CT scan. The differential diagnosis includes asthma exacerbation, infection, inflammatory lung condition (AEP, Churg-Strauss syndrome, Aspergillus), hypoxemic respiratory failure, and other conditions. The patient underwent bronchoscopy with lavage and biopsy, broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, and various laboratory tests including GM, 1,3 glucan, serum precipitins for Aspergillus, IgE, ESR, and ANCA. The patient is also receiving steroids, insulin for glycemic control, and prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Asthma exacerbation: The patient has a history of asthma, which can worsen due to triggers or underlying inflammation.
2. Infection: Given the bilateral upper lobe infiltrates and recent eosinophilia, there is a concern for an infectious etiology such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or atypical pathogens.
3. Inflammatory lung condition: Conditions like AEP (Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis), Churg-Strauss syndrome, or ABPA (Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis) should be considered due to the presence of eosinophilia and respiratory symptoms.
4. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of asthma and pan-sinusitis. She was admitted with bilateral upper lobe findings on CT scan and prominent blood and BAL eosinophilia, which is consistent with either Churg-Strauss syndrome or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP). The leading diagnosis at this point is Churg-Strauss syndrome (ANCA testing pending), with alternate possibilities including CEP and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The patient's treatment includes high-dose steroids, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and coverage for potential infections. Further follow-up is needed for pathology and clinical data, as well as testing for GM and 1,3 glucan, serum precipitins for Aspergillus, IgE levels, and ANCA (P and C). The patient will be converted from IV solumedrol to oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day after an additional day of IV treatment, along with PCP prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics and coverage for potential infections, indicating a concern for ongoing or developing infections.
2. Steroid-induced complications: High-dose steroids can have various side effects, including immunosuppression, increased risk of infections, mood changes, weight gain, and osteoporosis.
3. Churg-Strauss syndrome complications: This autoimmune condition can lead to organ damage, including the lungs, heart, kidneys, and nerves.
4. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia complications: This condition can cause respiratory failure and pulmonary infiltrates.
5. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis complications: This condition can lead to bronchiectasis and worsening asthma symptoms.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prophylactic measures are in place, but there is still a risk of developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters.
7. Stress ulcer: Prophylactic medication is being used to prevent stress ulcers, but they can still occur.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
9. Medication interactions: The patient is on multiple medications, and there may be potential drug interactions that need to be monitored."

She was admitted to the MICU for an asthma exacerbation and pneumonia (PNA). The patient's current symptoms include dyspnea, and she has bilateral pulmonary infiltrates seen on imaging. She is immunocompromised due to steroid administration. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/59 to 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.1 K/uL, slightly low platelet count (Plt) of 229, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 120 mg/dL, and elevated glucose level of 183 mg/dL. Other notable lab values include elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient is currently receiving various treatments including intravenous (IV) steroids, bronchodilators, and antibiotics. She is also being monitored for potential complications such as Legionella, blood"

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of asthma, sinusitis, and recent steroid administration. She was admitted to the MICU for an asthma exacerbation and pneumonia. The patient presented with shortness of breath for three days and was found to have upper lobe pneumonia with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, which were new since the previous year. 

Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the patient is presumed to be immunocompromised due to the past month's steroid administration. Sinus biopsy from one year prior showed eosinophils, and there are no risk factors for tuberculosis. The constellation of sinus and pulmonary findings may suggest a cystic fibrosis picture, although it is less likely given the normal CT scan from five months ago. Other differential diagnoses considered include Aspergillus, silicosis, sarcoidosis, eosinophilic pneumonia, and Churg-Strauss syndrome.

The patient has been started on intravenous solumedrol for asthma exacerbation, albuterol/ipratropium nebs for respiratory support, and ancillary serologies for ANCA. Antibiotic coverage has been provided with levofloxacin and zosyn due to the findings of bilateral CT and recent cipro administration. Smears, sputum cultures, and PCP smear are pending, along with galactomannan testing. A bronchoscopic evaluation is planned, as well as outpatient pulmonary function tests.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of asthma and pan-sinusitis, admitted with bilateral upper lobe findings on CT scan and prominent blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) eosinophilia. The patient's recent course included antibiotics and prednisone treatment. The leading diagnosis at this point is Churg-Strauss syndrome (ANCA testing pending), with alternate possibilities including chronic eosinophilic pneumonia and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The patient's sinus biopsy in [**2123**] revealed prominent eosinophilia. Infectious workup on BAL is negative. The patient will need a long slow taper of steroids, follow-up pathology, transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) due to concern for myocardial involvement, discontinuation of antibiotics, follow-up immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and conversion from intravenous (IV) solumedrol to oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day starting on [**12-15**]. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), calcium, and vitamin D supplementation will also be initiated. The patient's tachycardia may be related to volume depletion or Churg-Strauss syndrome, and a fluid challenge will be attempted to assess volume status. Other issues are noted in the ICU resident's progress note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of asthma and pan-sinusitis, both of unclear etiology. She was admitted with bilateral upper lobe findings on a CT scan and prominent blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) eosinophilia. These findings are consistent with either Churg-Strauss syndrome (also known as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis) or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. The patient also has hypoxemic respiratory failure, unclear pulmonary history, and normal pulmonary function tests (PFTs). She has recently taken antibiotics and prednisone, although it is unclear if she was actually taking the prednisone. 

Assessment and Plan:
The leading diagnosis at this point is Churg-Strauss syndrome (ANCA testing pending). Alternate possibilities include chronic eosinophilic pneumonia and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The treatment plan includes high-dose steroids, coverage for infection pending final culture data, follow-up pathology and clinical data, and monitoring for other issues such as DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient will need a long slow taper of steroids, PCP prophylaxis when off antibiotics, and will be transferred to the floor."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-inch, 58.3 kg male admitted to the ICU with no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/65 to 117/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the addition of crackles in the right lung base. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.2 g/dL, platelet count of 14.2 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 120 to 183 mg/dL. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the right lung base and trace edema in both lower extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary complications: The presence of crackles in the right lung base may indicate a potential pulmonary complication such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient is receiving prophylactic heparin, there is still a risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobility"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of asthma and pan-sinusitis, admitted with bilateral upper lobe findings on CT scan and prominent blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) eosinophilia. She has been treated with antibiotics and prednisone, but it is unclear if she has been taking them. The patient is currently experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, with essentially normal pulmonary function tests (PFTs). The leading diagnosis at this point is Churg-Strauss syndrome (also known as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis), with alternate possibilities including chronic eosinophilic pneumonia and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). ANCA testing is pending, and other tests have ruled out infectious causes. The patient will require a long slow taper of steroids, follow-up pathology, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) due to concern for myocardial involvement, discontinuation of antibiotics, follow-up IgE levels, and conversion to oral prednisone. Tachycardia is present and may be related to volume depletion or Churg-Strauss syndrome. Fluid resuscitation will be attempted to assess volume status. Other issues mentioned in the ICU resident's note include nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and she is planned for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure could worsen if she develops further lung complications or if her underlying condition progresses.
2. Cardiac involvement: The concern for myocardial involvement suggests a potential risk of cardiac complications, which may require further evaluation and management.
3. Steroid tapering: The long slow taper of steroids poses a risk of adrenal insufficiency if not managed carefully. Monitoring of cortisol levels and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency should be considered during the tapering process.
4. Infection: Although initial infectious workup was negative, the patient remains at risk for infections due to immunosuppression from steroids and possibly Churg-Strauss syndrome.
5. Thrombotic events: The patient is at increased risk for thrombotic events such as DVT and possibly pulmonary embolism due to her condition and immobilization in the ICU.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Steroid use can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially in patients with a history of ulcers or gastrointestinal disorders.
7. Osteoporosis: Long-term steroid use can lead to decreased bone density and increased risk of fractures. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is important to prevent osteoporosis.
8. Mental health issues: Steroid use can cause mood swings, anxiety, and depression. Regular monitoring of mental health is essential.
9. Adrenal crisis: Abrupt discontinuation of steroids can lead to adrenal crisis, characterized by severe fatigue, hypotension, abdominal pain, and confusion. Gradual tapering of steroids is crucial.

These are potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and manage any complications promptly to ensure the best possible outcome."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of asthma and sinusitis, who was admitted to the MICU for an asthma exacerbation and pneumonia (pna). She presented with shortness of breath for three days. Upon admission, she had upper lobe pneumonia with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, which were new since December 21st. She is considered immunocompromised due to steroid administration. There are no risk factors for tuberculosis (TB), and alternative diagnoses such as Aspergillus, silicosis, sarcoid, eosinophilic pna, and Churg-Strauss syndrome (ctdz) are also being considered. 

BAL culture showed significant eosinophilia, raising concerns for Churg-Strauss syndrome, which may have been precipitated by Singulair or could be a chronic issue. The patient has been receiving IV solumedrol, albuterol/ipratropium nebs, levofloxacin, and zosyn for treatment. ANCA serologies are pending. 

The patient also has pansinusitis, with all sinuses showing significant disease. She has received FQ antibiotics in the past and will undergo an endoscopic revision. 

Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/65 to 117/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation"
