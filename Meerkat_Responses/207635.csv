","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of liver disease and is diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/53 to 154/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is a serious complication that requires immediate attention. The low oxygen saturation and the need for mechanical ventilation indicate significant respiratory dysfunction.

2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has been diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome, which is a type of kidney failure caused by severe liver disease. This condition can worsen the patient's overall prognosis and may require dialysis or other renal support.

3. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient has liver function abnormalities, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and abnormal bilirubin levels. This suggests ongoing liver dysfunction, which can have various implications for the patient's health.

4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the invasive lines and catheters in"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 M w/ ESLD now listed for transplant, here w/ hepato-renal
   syndrome, rising bilirubin, coagulopathy, thromobcytopenia and
   transferred w/ hypoxia and tachypnea after receiving IV contrast.
   # Hypoxia/tachypnea: Large A-a gradient and still requiring a NRB to
   maintain O2 sats.  DDx from pulmonary edema from volume overload and
   renal failure vs PE given LLE DVT (but has an IVC filter and not a
   candidate for anticoagulation) vs aspiration pneumonitis vs alveolar
   hemorrhage (given recent hct drop and asymmetric pulmonary infiltrates,
   although no hemoptysis).
   - continue NRB for now
   - placed an a-line
   - HD tonight w/ goal of 2 KG fluid removal
   - IVC filter in place for DVT and will hopefully prevent PE
   - Vanc/Zosyn will be continued for possible Hospital Aquired PNA
   - nebs prn
   - will try BIPAP if decompensates further (body habitus c/w possible
   OSA)
   # Anemia: Macrocytic.  Likely mixed etiology from cirrhosis, renal
   disease, phlebotomy but hct did not increase appropriately to 2 U PRBC
   yesterday.  No clear source of bleeding.  Having large volume BM w/o
   frank blood.  No large pleural effusions.  Could be from alveolar
   hemorrhage but no hemoptysis.  HCT was stable over the course of the
   day.  Hemolysis labs mixed w/ elevated Bili, very low haptoglobin but
   w/o increased LDH and poor liver synthetic function.  Smear w/o
   schistocytes.
   - will transfuse 1 U PRBC w/ goal hct > 25 given possible bleeding
   - trend q 6 hrs for now
   - T&S
   # Acute renal failure: Presumed to be from hepato-renal syndrome.  Now
   requiring dialysis.
   - HD tonight
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue octreotide, midodrine
   # Hep C/ EtOH cirrhosis: MELD is 43.  Was just listed for transplant
   and is being followed by transplant surgery.  Bili continues to rise as
   does INR.  Also w/ thrombocytopenia.
   - follow lfts, coags, plts
   - continue lactulose, rifaxamin
   - Cholestyramine for pruritis in addition to hydroxazine
   - Cardiology consult requested given mild pulm HTN and possible
   pulmonic stenosis (does this affect transplant)
   - Await final read on MRV of liver
   - Appreciate hepatology and transplant recs
   # IDDM: BS not well-controlled since admission w/ range from 195-314
   today.
   - continue Glargine 40 U w/ [**Hospital1 1663**] for now, will not increase for now as
   NPO
   # LLE DVT: s/p IVC filter.  Not a candidate for anticoagulation given
   coagulopathy.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now given hypoxia
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI
   # Access: peripheral X 1, RSC HD line (placed [**2-12**]), R art line placed
   [**2-14**].
   - PICC requested

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) listed for transplant. He has been admitted to the ICU with hepato-renal syndrome, rising bilirubin, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hypoxia, and tachypnea after receiving IV contrast. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 146/70 mmHg to 154/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on a nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented but appears mildly dyspneic. Physical examination reveals jaundice, crackles at the left base, and rhonchi with bronchial breath sounds on the right side. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, low hemoglobin, low platelets, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging and microbiology results are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient has a large A-a gradient and requires a non-rebreather mask (NRB) to maintain oxygen saturation. Differential diagnoses include pulmonary edema due to volume overload, renal failure, pulmonary embolism (PE), aspiration pneumonitis, and alveolar hemorrhage.

   This is a 50 M w/ ESLD now listed for transplant, here w/ hepato-renal
   syndrome, rising bilirubin, coagulopathy, thromobcytopenia and
   transferred w/ hypoxia and tachypnea after receiving IV contrast.
   # Hypoxia/tachypnea: Large A-a gradient and requiring NC to maintain O2
   sats.  DDx from pulmonary edema from volume overload and renal failure
   vs alveolar hemorrhage given recent hct drop and asymmetric pulmonary
   infiltrates.
   - NL, NRB or BIPAP Prn
   - HD today w/ goal of 2 KG fluid removal
   - Vanc/Zosyn will be continued for possible Hospital Aquired PNA
   - nebs prn
   # Anemia: Macrocytic.  Likely mixed etiology from cirrhosis, renal
   disease, phlebotomy but hct did not increase appropriately to 2 U PRBC
   yesterday.  Could be from alveolar hemorrhage but no hemoptysis.  HCT
   was stable over the course of the day.  Hemolysis labs mixed w/
   elevated Bili, very low haptoglobin but w/o increased LDH and poor
   liver synthetic function.  Smear w/o schistocytes.
   - will transfuse 1 U PRBC w/ goal hct > 25 given possible bleeding
   - trend q 6 hrs for now
   - T&S
   - ANCA, Anti-GBM antibodies, Cryoglobulin
   - Add Fibrinognen
   - Defer bronchoscopy until after success/failure of HD in resolving
   volume status
   # Acute renal failure: Presumed to be from hepato-renal syndrome.  Now
   requiring dialysis.
   - HD tonight
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue midodrine, D/C midodrine
   # Hep C/ EtOH cirrhosis: MELD is 43.  Was just listed for transplant
   and is being followed by transplant surgery.  Bili continues to rise as
   does INR.  Also w/ thrombocytopenia.
   - follow lfts, coags, plts
   - continue lactulose, rifaxamin
   - Cholestyramine for pruritis in addition to hydroxazine
   - Cardiology consult requested given mild pulm HTN and possible
   pulmonic stenosis (does this affect transplant)
   - Await final read on MRV of liver
   - Appreciate hepatology and transplant recs
   - Cardiology consult for pre-op evaluation/Echo results interpretation
   # IDDM: BS not well-controlled since admission w/ range from 195-314
   today.
   - continue Glargine 40 U w/ [**Hospital1 1663**] for now, will not increase for now as
   NPO

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) listed for transplant. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has hepato-renal syndrome, rising bilirubin levels, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and recent hypoxia and tachypnea after receiving intravenous contrast. 

The patient's current assessments and plans include:
- Hypoxia/tachypnea: The patient requires supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation levels. Differential diagnoses include pulmonary edema due to volume overload and renal failure, as well as alveolar hemorrhage given recent hematocrit drop and asymmetric pulmonary infiltrates. Non-invasive ventilation, nebulizers, and hemodialysis are recommended.
- Anemia: The patient has macrocytic anemia, likely from mixed causes such as cirrhosis, renal disease, and phlebotomy. The patient did not respond appropriately to red blood cell transfusion, which could be due to alveolar hemorrhage, but no hemoptysis was observed. Hemolysis labs show mixed results with elevated bilirubin, very low haptoglobin, but without increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and poor liver synthetic function. Smear without schistocytes. The patient will receive another unit of packed red blood cells with a goal hematocrit >25, and hemoglobin trend will be monitored. Further tests including total and"

   This is a 50 M w/ ESLD now listed for transplant, here w/ hepato-renal
   syndrome, rising bilirubin, coagulopathy, thromobcytopenia and
   transferred w/ hypoxia and tachypnea after receiving IV contrast.
   # Hypoxia/tachypnea: Large A-a gradient and requiring NC to maintain O2
   sats.  DDx from pulmonary edema from volume overload and renal failure
   vs alveolar hemorrhage given recent hct drop and asymmetric pulmonary
   infiltrates.
   - NL, NRB or BIPAP Prn
   - ? D/C Vanc/Zosyn will be continued for possible Hospital Aquired PNA
   - nebs prn
   # Anemia: Macrocytic.  Likely mixed etiology from cirrhosis, renal
   disease, phlebotomy but hct did not increase appropriately to 2 U PRBC
   yesterday.  Could be from alveolar hemorrhage but no hemoptysis.  HCT
   was stable over the course of the day.  Hemolysis labs mixed w/
   elevated Bili, very low haptoglobin but w/o increased LDH and poor
   liver synthetic function.  Smear w/o schistocytes.
   - will transfuse 1 U PRBC w/ goal hct > 25 given possible bleeding
   - trend q 6 hrs for now
   - T&S
   - ANCA, Anti-GBM antibodies, Cryoglobulin Pending
   - Add Fibrinognen
   - Defer bronchoscopy until after success/failure of HD in resolving
   volume status
   # Acute renal failure: Presumed to be from hepato-renal syndrome.  Now
   requiring dialysis.
   - appreciate renal input
   - continue midodrine, D/C octreotide
   # Hep C/ EtOH cirrhosis: MELD is 43.  Was just listed for transplant
   and is being followed by transplant surgery.  Bili continues to rise as
   does INR.  Also w/ thrombocytopenia.
   - follow lfts, coags, plts
   - continue lactulose, rifaxamin
   - Cholestyramine for pruritis in addition to hydroxyzine
   - Cardiology consult requested given mild pulm HTN and possible
   pulmonic stenosis (does this affect transplant)
   - Await final read on MRV of liver
   - Appreciate hepatology and transplant recs
   - Cardiology consult for pre-op evaluation/Echo results interpretation
   # IDDM: BS not well-controlled since admission w/ range from 195-314
   today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who is listed for a liver transplant. The patient presents with multiple medical complications, including hepato-renal syndrome, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hypoxia, tachypnea, anemia, acute renal failure, hepatitis C, alcohol cirrhosis, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (IDDM). The patient also has a history of left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is not a candidate for anticoagulation due to coagulopathy.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 58 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient appears alert and oriented but is mildly dyspneic.

Physical examination reveals jaundice, icteric sclera, dry mucous membranes, clear oropharynx, supple neck, crackles at the left lung base, regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops, soft abdomen with mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), mildly distended abdomen, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organ"

The patient has several medical complications including hepato-renal syndrome, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hypoxia, tachypnea, anemia, acute renal failure, hypertension, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (IDDM).

The patient's current assessment includes:
1. Hypoxia/tachypnea: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress with oxygen saturation between 88-92% on 6 liters of nasal cannula. Differential diagnosis includes pulmonary edema from volume overload and renal failure versus alveolar hemorrhage given the recent hematocrit drop and asymmetric pulmonary infiltrates. Noninvasive ventilation, nebulizers, and bronchoscopy are being considered.
2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped, potentially due to coagulopathy, renal failure, blood loss from procedures, and epistaxis. The patient received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with an appropriate increase in hematocrit.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient is presumed to have acute renal failure from hepato-renal syndrome. Continuous hemodialysis (HD) is being continued, along with midodrine and discontinuation of octreotide.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and Hepatitis C, admitted to the ICU with fluid overload and hypoxemia. The patient received hemodialysis (HDX2) and experienced a drop in hematocrit (Hct) from 24 to 21. The patient is also on several medications including Percodan, codeine, mucomyst, cholestyramine, rifaximin, and midodrine.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/59 to 151/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has sinus bradycardia and exhibits crackles in the bases of the lungs.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 3.0 mg/dL, blood glucose (Glucose) at 203 mg/dL, and total bilirubin (T Bili) at 53.7. The patient's platelet count (Plt) is low at 42,000/mm³, and the hemoglobin (Hct) continues to drop despite receiving blood products. Other lab values such as white blood cell count (WBC), potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), phosphate (PO4), and liver enzymes are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include ongoing hemodialysis to remove excess fluid, increasing humidification to address hypoxemia, discontinuing antibiotics as there is no evidence of infection, and considering the possibility of alveolar hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding causing the drop in Hct.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate inadequate oxygen supply to the body tissues. If not addressed promptly, it may lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.

2. Fluid overload: The patient's admission with fluid overload suggests an imbalance in fluid levels within the body. If left untreated, it can result in pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, or electrolyte imbalances.

3. Anemia: The drop in hematocrit (Hct) indicates a decrease in red blood cell count. Severe anemia can lead to fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and other complications.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's low platelet count and ongoing bleeding indicated by the dropping Hct suggest a possible coagulation disorder. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.

5. Infection: Although antibiotics have been discontinued due to lack of evidence of infection, the patient's elevated temperature (fever) could indicate an underlying infection. Prompt identification and treatment of any infection is crucial to prevent complications.

6. Alveolar hemorrhage: The patient's symptoms"
