   Assessment and Plan
   31M with biliary atresia who underwent liver transplantation at the age
   of 5 on tacro, ESRD on HD through HD tunnel cath, presents with 3 days
   of nonproductive cough, left sided chest pain, and dyspnea, with
   leukocytosis, bandemia, tachycardia, and a large effusion on CT scan.
   Likely sepsis in the setting of pneumonia with a large effusion.
   Etiology of effusion is unclear. Likely multifactorial: possible
   parapneumonic, related to pulmonary htn, and certainly related to low
   albumin.
   The source of sepsis is not clear yet either. Lungs are possible given
   the ct findings. Abd ct needs a final read; colitis is possible given
   the ct, as is cystitis. Will follow up cultures. Given his
   immunosuppression he is at risk for a large number of infections. Also
   will consider TTE if no infectious source identified.
   Altered mental status is likely from hepatic encephalopathy in the
   setting of infection. Will continue to treat the underlying cause and
   continue.
   Immediate plan is to perform an us-guided diagnostic and therapeautic
   after FFP and DDAVP while we continuing abx.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplantation at 5 years old, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He presents with symptoms of nonproductive cough, left-sided chest pain, dyspnea, leukocytosis, bandemia, tachycardia, and a large pleural effusion on CT scan. The patient is likely experiencing sepsis in the setting of pneumonia with a large effusion. The source of the sepsis is unclear, with possible etiologies including the lungs, abdomen, or urinary tract. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy in the setting of infection. Immediate plans include performing an ultrasound-guided diagnostic and therapeutic procedure after fluid resuscitation and desmopressin administration while continuing antibiotic therapy. Dialysis is pending, and the liver team is following up on the patient's condition. ICU care includes renal nutrition, glycemic control, and systemic anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation suggests sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death if not promptly treated.
2. Pneumonia: The large pleural effusion and leukocytosis indicate a possible pneumonia, which may require aggressive antibiotic treatment.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be due to hepatic en"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) presenting with symptoms of left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise for one week. He is currently in the ICU due to sepsis, likely related to GPC bacteremia and pneumonia. The patient also has a left pleural effusion, which is an exudative parapneumonic effusion. There is a possibility of mild colitis, and the patient is encephalopathic with advanced liver disease. He is on hemodialysis for ESRD and has had recent interventions such as thoracentesis and placement of central lines.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications if not managed appropriately.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms and imaging findings suggest pneumonia, which can progress to severe respiratory distress and require mechanical ventilation.
3. Pleural Effusion: The left pleural effusion needs to be addressed to prevent further complications such as respiratory compromise or infection.
4. Liver Disease: The patient's advanced liver disease may lead to complications like hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and hepatorenal syndrome.
5. ESRD: The patient's kidney failure requires ongoing management with hemodialysis to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presents with symptoms of left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise for one week. He has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely related to GPC bacteremia and pneumonia. The patient also has a left pleural effusion, which is an exudative parapneumonic effusion. There is suspicion of bowel wall thickening, possibly mild colitis. The patient's liver disease is progressing to end-stage cirrhosis, and he remains encephalopathic. He is currently on hemodialysis for ESRD and has an elevated liver enzyme level. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, respiratory distress due to pleural effusion or pneumonia, further deterioration of liver function, and complications related to ESRD."

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presents with symptoms of left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise for one week. The patient has several medical complications, including sepsis likely related to GPC bacteremia and pneumonia, left pleural effusion classified as a complex parapneumonic effusion, suspected bowel wall thickening possibly due to mild colitis, and end-stage cirrhosis of the transplanted liver.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. In this case, it is likely related to GPC bacteremia and pneumonia. Immediate follow-up blood cultures for speciation, sputum sample, straight catheterization and urine analysis, and continuation of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics are recommended.

2. Left Pleural Effusion: The patient has an exudative complex parapneumonic effusion in the left pleural space. This condition requires further evaluation and management. Follow-up CT chest to assess for trapped lung, consultation with thoracic surgery regarding the need for chest tube placement, analysis of pleural fluid culture, and oxygen delivery via nasal cannula"

   I have seen and examined the patient with the fellow and agree
   substantially with the assessment and plan as above with the following
   modifications/emphasis:
   Overnight, brought to ICU for mental status change, chest pain, and
   cough.  Found to have left sided pleural effusion, multi-focal
   pneumonia, GPC bacteremia, and worsened abdominal pain.  Thoracentesis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He presents with symptoms of left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise for one week. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis likely related to GPC bacteremia and pneumonia. He also has a left pleural effusion classified as a complex parapneumonic effusion. The patient's abdominal pain may be due to RUQ pathology, SBP, or constipation. Additionally, the patient shows signs of end-stage cirrhosis of the transplanted liver, including encephalopathy, ascites, and asterixis. The patient's tacro level was elevated, so it was held. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, cough, and the presence of a pleural effusion suggest pneumonia. The exudative nature of the effusion indicates a complex parapneumonic effusion, which can lead to respiratory distress and potential septic shock if not treated promptly.
2. Bacteremia, GPC: The patient has a GPC bacteremia, which increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock. Prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics is necessary to prevent further complications.
3. S/P liver transplant: The patient's history of liver transplant puts"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presents with symptoms of left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise for one week. The patient's medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient likely has MSSA bacteremia and pneumonia, which can lead to sepsis. Leukocytosis is improving, and tachycardia has improved with volume resuscitation and sedation. Blood pressure remains stable.

2. Altered mental status: The patient is encephalopathic with signs of liver dysfunction, such as asterixis. This may be related to end-stage cirrhosis of the transplanted liver.

3. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has chronic pleural effusion, liver cirrhosis, and ESRD. Liver function tests show abnormalities.

4. Pleural effusion: The patient has an exudative complex parapneumonic effusion in the left pleural space, which is positive for MSSA. A chest tube has been placed.

5. Bowel wall thickening: Possible mild colitis or underdistension is observed. Increased lactulose dosage has helped increase bowel movements.

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presents with left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise for one week. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress following chest tube placement for a left pleural effusion. The patient has MSSA bacteremia and pneumonia, and his leukocytosis is improving. He also has altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. Other findings include liver function abnormalities, chronic pleural effusion, renal failure (ESRD), cirrhosis of the liver, coagulopathy, and bowel wall thickening.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis due to MSSA bacteremia and pneumonia. Close monitoring of vital signs and organ functions is essential to manage this condition effectively.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has an exudative complex parapneumonic effusion on the left side, which was treated with chest tube placement. It is important to continue monitoring the fluid output and assessing the effectiveness of the chest tube drainage.
3. Liver Failure: The patient has cirrhosis of the transplanted liver, leading to hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy. Close monitoring of liver function and adjusting medications accordingly is necessary"

","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a chief complaint of bacteremia and chest pain. The patient has undergone several procedures including a drain removal, chest tube placement, and dialysis catheter stop. The patient has also been intubated due to respiratory effort and decreased alertness.

The patient's medical history includes liver cirrhosis, chronic pleural effusion, renal failure (ESRD), coagulopathy, and altered mental status. The patient's allergies include Ibuprofen and an unknown allergy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 92/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on invasive ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST, set tidal volume of 500 mL, set respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, plateau pressure of 23 cmH2O, and peak inspiratory pressure of 30 cmH2O.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, elevated blood glucose, prolonged PT/INR, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.41, PaO2 of 246, and PaCO2 of 48 mmHg.

The patient's flow sheet data indicates a positive fluid balance of 2,581 mL since the previous day. The patient's drain output has been significant, with nearly 1 L drainage overnight. The patient's urine output is 225 mL, and their blood product transfusion was 582 mL.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the patient's renal function, hepatic encephalopathy due to liver dysfunction, sepsis secondary to bacteremia, and respiratory complications due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient's altered mental status may also be attributed to multiple factors such as hepatic encephalopathy, sepsis, or medication effects."

","The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presents with one week of left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has several medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has MSSA bacteremia and pneumonia, leading to sepsis. His leukocytosis is improving, and tachycardia has improved with volume resuscitation and sedation. His blood pressure remains stable.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is encephalopathic, likely due to cirrhosis of the transplanted liver. He is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose therapy is being continued to manage this condition.
3. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, indicating liver dysfunction. He is receiving rifaximin to reduce ammonia production.
4. Pleural effusion: The patient has a left-sided pleural effusion, which is exudative and complex parapneumonic. MSSA was cultured from the fluid, and a chest tube has been placed.
5. Bowel wall thickening: There is a possibility of mild colitis or underdistension of the bowel. Lactulose has been increased to promote bowel movements and reduce abdominal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presented with left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise for one week. The patient has several medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has MSSA bacteremia and pneumonia, which is likely related to the MSSA infection in the pleural effusion. The patient's tachycardia has improved with volume resuscitation and sedation, but the blood pressure remains stable. The leukocytosis is improving.

2. Altered Mental Status (not delirium): The patient remains encephalopathic with ascites and asterixis. This could be due to end-stage cirrhosis of the transplanted liver. The patient's elevated liver enzymes and low albumin levels suggest ongoing liver dysfunction.

3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has an exudative complex parapneumonic effusion positive for MSSA. A chest tube was placed, and the patient developed respiratory distress and was intubated.

4. Bowel Wall Thickening: The patient may have mild colitis or underdistension. Increasing lactulose has improved bowel movements, and stool cultures are pending.

5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely related to pneumonia and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presented with symptoms of left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise one week ago. The patient's current condition includes sepsis with MSSA bacteremia and infected pleural effusion, liver function abnormalities, chronic pleural effusion, renal failure (ESRD), cirrhosis of the liver, coagulopathy, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has MSSA bacteremia and an infected pleural effusion, which can lead to sepsis. Immediate management includes appropriate antibiotic therapy and source control measures.

2. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has liver function abnormalities and cirrhosis of the transplanted liver. This may result in hepatic encephalopathy and increased risk of infections. Management includes lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, monitoring of liver function tests, and consultation with a liver specialist.

3. Chronic Pleural Effusion: The patient has a chronic pleural effusion, which can compromise respiratory function. Intervention such as thoracentesis or chest tube placement may be required for symptom relief and infection control.

4. Renal Failure (ESRD): The patient has end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electroly"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia who has undergone a liver transplant and is currently experiencing several medical complications.

The patient presents with sepsis due to MSSA bacteremia and an infected pleural effusion. The team suggests considering bronchoscopy to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of the infection. Surveillance cultures are being continued, and the plan is to replace the hemodialysis catheter today or on Thursday.

The patient also has respiratory issues, including a large left hydropneumothorax, likely due to fluid overload. The chest tube is making an abrupt turn with mild kinking at its site. There are also right upper and lower lung infectious airspace opacities. The team plans to attempt pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) today.

In terms of end-stage cirrhosis of the transplanted liver, the patient remains encephalopathic with ascites and asterixis. The liver team recommends repeating the tacrolimus level, aiming for a goal close to 5, and continuing lactulose per liver team guidance. Rifaximin is also being continued, and the liver consult team's recommendations are being followed.

The patient has anemia, which is currently stable at 30% hematocrit. Trending daily and checking for guaiac stools are part of the ongoing management.

Regarding end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the patient had their last hemodialysis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia who underwent a liver transplant and is now presenting with symptoms of left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise. He has been diagnosed with sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction), altered mental status (not delirium), liver function abnormalities, pleural effusion (chronic), renal failure (end-stage), and cirrhosis of the liver. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/51 mmHg to 122/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal a right IJ non-occlusive thrombus at the site of line removal, left lower lobe/lingula collapse with large left hydropneumothorax, and increased pericardial effusion. 

The patient is currently on multiple medications, including nafcillin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, tacrolimus, and lactulose. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presents with symptoms of left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise for one week. The patient remains tachycardic and borderline hypotensive at times. Blood cultures are negative since February 11th, but a catheter tip is positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) on February 13th. The patient has chronic pleural effusion, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, renal failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent tachycardia and borderline hypotension may indicate ongoing infection, despite negative blood cultures. The presence of MSSA in the catheter tip suggests a potential source of infection.
2. Liver failure: The patient's worsening liver function, as indicated by increasing bilirubin levels and coagulopathy, may lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and ascites.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, particularly during trials of pressure support ventilation (PSV).
4. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) may require ongoing hemodialysis management, and there is a"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He presents with one week of left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise. The patient remains tachycardic and hypotensive at times. Blood cultures are negative since February 11th, and a catheter tip was positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) on February 13th. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including sepsis, severe liver function abnormalities, pleural effusion, renal failure, cirrhosis of the liver, coagulopathy, and anemia. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been experiencing low blood sugar levels, and finger sticks will be done every six hours.
2. Sepsis: The patient's infection is being managed with nafcillin, flagyl for possible Clostridium difficile colitis on CT, and further investigation is needed.
3. Empyema: The patient's empyema will continue to be drained with computed tomography (CT).
4. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures are negative since February 11th, and nafcillin will be continued.
5. Respiratory: A pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial will be conducted today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presents with symptoms of left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise for one week. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient remains tachycardic and borderline hypotensive at times, indicating possible sepsis. Despite normal WBC count and absence of fever, blood cultures remain negative since February 11th. The catheter tip is positive for Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) on February 13th. Therefore, it is important to continue nafcillin and follow up with blood cultures.

2. Empyema: The patient has a plan to continue drainage with computed tomography (CT). Thoracic recommendations should be followed up.

3. MSSA Bacteremia: Blood cultures have been negative since February 11th. Nafcillin should be continued.

4. Respiratory: A positive pressure ventilation (PSV) trial is scheduled today.

5. End-stage Cirrhosis of transplanted liver: The patient's total bilirubin (TBili) is trending up, indicating worsening liver function. Coagulopathy is also worsening, and the patient remains encephalopathic with ascites"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presents with symptoms of left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise for one week.

24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line, dialysis catheter, and temporary left internal jugular (LIJ) line. The patient experienced significant bleeding at the cath site and received blood products (1 unit packed red blood cells and 2 units fresh frozen plasma). Nafcillin was increased to 2g IV q4h per Infectious Disease (ID) and Pharmacy.

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with the following settings: tidal volume (Vt) set at 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 7 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 52. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) is maintained at 95%.

Physical examination findings include icteric sclera, significant conjunctival edema, left eye echymosis, bloody turbinates bilaterally, supple neck with elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), clear lung sounds on the right side, and bronchial breath"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia who underwent a liver transplant. The patient presents with symptoms including left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise. The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and is on hemodialysis (HD).

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient remains tachycardic and borderline hypotensive at times. Blood cultures are negative, but a catheter tip is positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). The plan includes continuing nafcillin, flagyl for possible Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis seen on CT scan, following up with blood glucan levels, and waiting for culture results.

2. Empyema: The plan is to continue drainage with computed tomography (CT) and follow up with thoracic recommendations.

3. MSSA Bacteremia: Blood cultures remain negative since February 11th. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) were negative for vegetations. The patient is being treated with nafcillin at 2 g IV q4h.

4. Respiratory Failure: A pressure support ventilation (PSV) trial is planned today.

","The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He presents with symptoms including left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise for one week. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions:

1. Sepsis: The patient remains tachycardic and borderline hypotensive at times, with normal white blood cell (WBC) count and absence of fever. Blood cultures have remained negative since February 11th, and the catheter tip was positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) on February 13th. The plan is to continue nafcillin and flagyl for possible Clostridioides difficile colitis seen on CT scan until a second C. difficile negative test result is obtained. Follow-up blood cultures, fungal cultures, and ID recommendations are also mentioned. Stress dose steroids should be continued.

2. Empyema: The plan is to continue drainage with computed tomography (CT) and follow up with thoracic recommendations.

3. MSSA Bacteremia: Blood cultures have been negative since February 11th. Transthoracic echocardiography (TEE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TTE) are negative for vegetations. Nafcillin should be continued at 2 g IV q4h.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a medical history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. He presented with one week of left chest pain, cough, and generalized malaise. The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including sepsis, empyema, ESLD (end-stage liver disease), respiratory distress, and ESRD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient remains tachycardic but with normal blood pressure on stress dose steroids. Cultures are being followed, and the patient will be cleared of infection before relisting for transplant.
2. Empyema: Plan to continue drainage with CT-guided intervention.
3. ESLD: The patient's bilirubin levels are trending up, although the INR is somewhat stable. Increase PO lactulose and taper down propofol. Follow up liver recommendations, monitor tacro level, and likely restart today given tapering steroids.
4. Respiratory Distress: Trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) today, barrier to extubation likely muscle weakness.
5. ESRD: Temporary line placed. Tolerated continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) well overnight. Discuss with renal starting HD.

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis, respiratory failure, and decompensated liver disease. The patient also has empyema and MSSA bacteremia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has MSSA bacteremia and empyema, indicating a risk of further infections. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent or treat any additional infections.

2. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are worsening, suggesting ongoing liver failure. This could lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and other complications related to liver dysfunction.

3. Kidney failure: Although the patient has ESRD, there is a concern regarding acute kidney injury or further deterioration of renal function. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting treatment accordingly is essential.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and extubation may be limited by poor mental status, likely related to worsening encephalopathy. Continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters and weaning sedation cautiously are recommended.

5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is relatively stable, but close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters is necessary to detect any signs of cardiovascular compromise.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis, respiratory failure, and decompensated liver disease. The patient also has empyema and MSSA bacteremia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given in the note include:

1. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has ongoing MSSA bacteremia despite receiving appropriate antibiotics. Continued monitoring and compliance with the prescribed antibiotics are necessary to prevent further complications.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which may be related to worsening encephalopathy due to liver failure. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status and gradual weaning of sedation are recommended to assess and manage this condition effectively.

3. Empyema: The patient has empyema, and it is planned to keep the chest tube in place until Monday. This decision is based on the potential space in the left lower lobe (LLL) filling with fluid and becoming infected again. Waiting until the patient has received a full week of antibiotics before considering removing the chest tube is advised.

4. Coffee Ground Emesis: The patient vomited overnight, and the cause could be related to gastritis, esophagitis, or gastropathy."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently experiencing cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac around the heart. This can restrict the heart's ability to pump effectively. The patient also has pleural effusion, gastrointestinal bleed, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, chronic pleural effusion, renal failure (ESRD), and coagulopathy.

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia with a heart rate of 115 bpm and low blood pressure ranging from 103/62 mmHg to 130/125 mmHg. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been given 1-2 liters of IVF to maintain blood pressures.

The patient has been placed on the schedule for a pericardial window procedure by thoracic surgery on Monday. This procedure aims to relieve the pressure on the heart caused by the accumulated fluid.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including gastrointestinal bleed, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, chronic pleural effusion, renal failure (ESRD), and coagulopathy. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormalities in liver enzymes and kidney function tests.

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics (metronidazole and nafcillin), pain management with fentanyl, and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's fluid"

   2. Interval increase in multifocal patchy opacities, some of which may
   have
   early cavitation when compared to prior exam. This is concerning for

   worsening of infectious process.
   3. Interval increase in right pleural effusion. Left lower lobe
   collapse and

   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
   ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are structurally normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. Mild to moderate ([**11-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   a moderate sized pericardial effusion. The pericardium may be
   thickened. There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent
   with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis, respiratory failure, decompensated liver disease, and found to have empyema and MSSA bacteremia. The patient's current condition includes pericardial effusion with tamponade, gastrointestinal bleed, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, pleural effusion, renal failure, and coagulopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient has a large pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition where fluid accumulation around the heart impairs its ability to pump effectively.
2. Infection: The patient has MSSA bacteremia and empyema, indicating an ongoing infection. This increases the risk of further complications such as sepsis and spread of infection to other organs.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver function continues to deteriorate, leading to complications like hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy. These can affect mental status, increase the risk of bleeding, and impair other organ functions.
4. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD, and his renal function is further compromised, requiring hemodialysis. This can lead to"

   retained
   contrast due to renal failure.

   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
   ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are structurally normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. Mild to moderate ([**11-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   a moderate sized pericardial effusion. The pericardium may be
   thickened. There is right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent
   with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
- He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis, respiratory failure, decompensated liver disease, and found to have empyema and MSSA bacteremia.
- The patient's course has been complicated by cardiac tamponade, pneumonia, MSSA bacteremia, respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, liver function abnormalities, chronic pleural effusion, renal failure, and coagulopathy.
- He is currently intubated due to poor mental status and worsening encephalopathy in the setting of worsening liver failure.
- The patient has a pericardial effusion with tamponade, which requires further evaluation and management.
- There are plans for either pericardial drain or window placement.
- The patient's pneumonia is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the need for bronchoscopy is being discussed.
- MSSA bacteremia is being treated with nafcillin, and there is a discussion about broadening antibiotic coverage given the presence of cavitary lesions.
- The patient's respiratory failure is limiting extubation, and the decision to wean sedation will be made based on mental status and potential need for procedures.
- The patient is experiencing coffee ground gastrointestinal drainage, which"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is cardiac tamponade, which is confirmed by a trans thoracic echo showing increased pericardial effusion. The patient has also been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, chronic pleural effusion, end-stage renal disease, and coagulopathy.

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia with a heart rate of 115 bpm and hypotension with a blood pressure of 103/62 mmHg. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 537 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.18.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.4 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels at 25.0%, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 128 to 158 mg/dL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and abnormal renal function tests (creatinine/Cr).

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and renal failure awaiting transplant. He has MSSA pneumonia, pericardial effusion, worsened liver function, tamponade, pneumonia, adrenal insufficiency, respiratory failure, coffee ground emesis, ESLD, and ESRD. The patient is intubated, sedated, and minimally responsive. He is hemodynamically stable with IVF support, and his MAP is maintained above 80. The patient has a history of allergies to ibuprofen and unknown medications. He has been receiving various antibiotics, including metronidazole and nafcillin, as well as other medications such as pantoprazole, fentanyl, rifaximin, lidocaine patch, calcium, nafcillin, keppra, thiamine, lactulose, hydrocortisone, pantoprazole, chlorhexadine, and prn fentanyl. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Tamponade: The patient has physiological tamponade due to the increased pericardial effusion. If the fluid remains posterior, the patient may require a pericardial window.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has MSSA pneumonia. He is currently receiving nafcillin, but additional cultures may be needed to guide antibiotic therapy. There is a low threshold to broaden antibiotic coverage.
3. Adrenal insufficiency"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and renal failure awaiting transplant. The patient has MSSA pneumonia and is now experiencing pericardial effusion with worsened liver function. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Tamponade: The patient has physiological tamponade due to the increased pericardial effusion. This condition can lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic instability if not managed promptly.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) pneumonia. If not appropriately treated, the infection can worsen, leading to sepsis and septic shock.

3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient is being tapered off steroids, which can lead to adrenal insufficiency. This condition can result in hypotension and electrolyte imbalances if not managed with appropriate hormone replacement therapy.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient's mental status is limited by encephalopathy and sedation, which can contribute to respiratory failure. Weaning off sedation and optimizing neurological function are crucial to improve respiratory status.

5. Coffee ground emesis: The patient is experiencing coffee ground emesis, which can be indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding. This condition needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further bleeding and stabilize the patient.

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and renal failure, awaiting transplant. He is currently admitted with MSSA pneumonia and has developed a pericardial effusion. The patient's condition has worsened, including liver function.

24-hour events:
- Coffee ground emesis from post-pyloric Dobhoff tube and OG tube
- Improved mental status in the setting of increased lactulose
- CT chest with increased pericardial effusion, stat TTE with physiological tamponade and posterior fluid collection
- Thoracic surgery planning pericardial window, overnight maintained MAP > 80 with IVF boluses
- Changed tacro to am dosing

Medical Complications:
1. Tamponade: The patient is currently hemodynamically stable with IVF support. A stat TTE is recommended to assess possible percutaneous procedure. If fluid remains posterior, a pericardial window will be needed. Volume should be repleted as needed to maintain MAP > 65.
2. Pneumonia: Continue nafcillin with dosing per infectious disease service. A chest tube will remain until abx on board for more than 7 days, and IP following. Additional culture data should be obtained due to the rising WBC count.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: Tapering steroids from 25 mg hydrocortisone to 25 mg qday starting on 2-21.
4. Respiratory failure: Limited by mental status [12-27] encephalopathy and sedation.
5. Coffee ground emesis: Improving, getting PPI.
6. ESLD: Worsening bilirubin. Liver/transplant svc following. Rifaximin, lactulose, and maintaining tacro level at 5 are advised.
7. ESRD: CVVH held with a plan to transition to HD. A tunneled catheter will be needed.
8. GOC: Attempt to arrange a family meeting today.

ICU care:
- Nutrition: Novasource Renal (Full) at 45 mL/hour.
- Glycemic control: Regular insulin sliding scale.
- Lines: Arterial line, PICC line, dialysis catheter.
- Prophylaxis: DVT - boots, stress ulcer - pantoprazole, VAP - chlorhexidine.
- Code status: Full code.

Please note that the patient's condition is complex, and the listed medical complications may not be exhaustive. It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical progress."

He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis, respiratory failure, and decompensated liver disease. The patient also has empyema and MSSA bacteremia.

The patient's current condition includes pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, gastrointestinal bleed, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, chronic pleural effusion, and coagulopathy. The patient underwent a pericardial window placement but experienced acute hypoxia requiring an increase in FiO2, and crepitus was felt. PEEP was dropped to 2, and thoracic surgery was called to attempt stripping drains with some clot removal. Repeat chest X-ray showed reaccumulation of some pleural fluid, and the patient's oxygen saturation improved spontaneously. Additional blood products were given overnight, and the patient was dialyzed.

The plan for tomorrow includes a 3 pm family meeting with hepatology, transplant, and renal teams to discuss the patient's current status. ID suggested no change in antibiotics at this time. Tacrolimus (tacro) level is 2.5, and hepatology suggested repeating it daily. A doffhoff catheter was placed, and an attempt to place a post-p"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis, respiratory failure, decompensated liver disease, and found to have empyema and MSSA bacteremia. The course of treatment has been complicated by cardiac tamponade, hemothorax, pneumonia/MSSA bacteremia, respiratory failure, ESLD (end-stage liver disease), ESRD, and right hip pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient has developed cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac, compressing the heart and impairing its function. This can lead to decreased cardiac output and hypotension.
2. Hemothorax: The patient also has a hemothorax, which is the accumulation of blood in the pleural space. This can lead to respiratory distress and compromised lung function.
3. Pneumonia/MSSA bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia and pneumonia. If left untreated, this can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis, respiratory failure, decompensated liver disease, empyema, and MSSA bacteremia. The patient's course has been complicated by cardiac tamponade, hemothorax, pneumonia/MSSA bacteremia, respiratory failure, ESLD, and ESRD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient had a pericardial window placement by thoracic surgery due to cardiac tamponade. The patient will continue to be monitored for drain output, and blood tests for CBC and coagulation factors will be done every 6 hours. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) will be given for an INR > 1.5.
2. L Hemothorax: The patient underwent thoracotomy for pericardial window placement and now has a hemothorax. The drain output will be monitored, and coagulation factors will be replenished as above.
3. Pneumonia/MSSA Bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia has been cleared, but nafcillin will be continued at the current dosage. The patient is advised to discuss with the ID team regarding a possible switch to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a medical history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis, respiratory failure, decompensated liver disease, and found to have empyema and MSSA bacteremia. The patient's condition has been further complicated by cardiac tamponade, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's cardiac tamponade requires immediate attention as it can lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic instability. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTECHO) should be performed to assess the extent of the effusion and its impact on cardiac function. Pericardial drain or window placement may be necessary.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia, likely due to the aspiration of gastric contents. This condition can worsen respiratory failure and increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated, and a bronchoscopy may be considered for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has coffee-ground aspirate from the orogastric tube, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. This bleeding may be related to portal hypertension and variceal bleeding. Close monitoring of vital"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with end-stage liver disease, renal failure, and a history of biliary atresia, awaiting transplant. He was admitted with MSSA pneumonia/bacteremia and has since undergone pericardial window and drain placement due to tamponade. The patient also has a left hemothorax and is on mechanical ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Tamponade: The patient's pericardial drain output and hemodynamics will continue to be monitored. The patient's hct, coagulation parameters, and platelet count will be checked every 6 hours, aiming for hct > 25, INR < 1.5, and platelets > 50. The ID team will be consulted regarding the transition from nafcillin to cefazolin.
2. Left hemothorax: Drain output will be monitored with stripping as needed.
3. Pneumonia: Nafcillin will be continued versus cefazolin.
4. Respiratory failure: Vent weaning will be attempted, and a dilaudid drip will be started.
5. ESLD: Tacrolimus levels will be followed, aiming for a target level on 2/28. Rifaximin and lactulose will be continued.
6. Renal failure: The patient tolerated HD yesterday with TBB even. Phoslo will be discontinued.

The patient is a 31-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), renal failure, and a history of biliary atresia. He is awaiting a transplant and was admitted with MSSA pneumonia/bacteremia. The patient underwent a pericardial window and drain placement due to tamponade and is now experiencing hemothorax.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Tamponade: The patient had a pericardial window/drain placement to relieve tamponade. Monitoring of drain output and hemodynamics will continue. The patient's hematocrit (hct), coagulation profile, and platelet count will be checked every 6 hours. The target hct is > 25, INR < 1.5, and platelets > 50. Consultation with the Infectious Disease (ID) team is needed for transitioning from nafcillin to cefazolin.

2. L hemothorax: The patient has a left hemothorax. Drain output and stripping will be monitored.

3. PNA (pneumonia): The patient is currently receiving nafcillin, which may be switched to cefazolin.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is limited by pain, and mental status clearing is anticipated. Ventilator weaning and starting a dilaudid drip are planned.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease), renal failure, and a history of biliary atresia awaiting transplant. He presented with MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) pneumonia/bacteremia and subsequently underwent pericardial window and drain placement due to pericardial tamponade.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Tamponade: The patient had a pericardial tamponade, which has been managed by placing a pericardial window and drain. It is important to monitor the drain output and hemodynamics closely. The patient should be kept sedated and ventilated as needed. Blood counts, coagulation parameters, and INR should be monitored every 6 hours until target levels are achieved (hct > 25, INR < 1.5, platelets > 50).
2. Left hemothorax: The patient has a left hemothorax, which may require repeat chest tube placement and drainage. A repeat CT scan should be done once the patient is no longer requiring transfusion to assess the pleural vs parenchymal component.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has MSSA pneumonia, and antibiotics should be continued with either nafcillin or cefazolin.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation. Weaning to CPAP/PS"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis, respiratory failure, decompensated liver disease, empyema, and MSSA bacteremia. The patient's condition has been further complicated by cardiac tamponade.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is hypotensive, and there is concern for persistent infection or a new infectious source, especially in the setting of surgery. Broadened antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and cefepime has been continued.
2. Pneumonia/MSSA Bacteremia: Nafcillin has been continued for known MSSA bacteremia and MSSA pneumonia.
3. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient has evidence of cardiac tamponade, which is a potentially life-threatening condition where fluid accumulation around the heart impairs its ability to pump effectively. Further evaluation and management are required.
4. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests continue to worsen, indicating worsening liver failure, likely related to persistent infections. Immunosuppression with tacrolimus should be continued, and lactulose and rifaximin should be continued as well.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient has tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) overnight and is awake,"

   Mr [**Known lastname 8404**] has responded well to hydrocortisone in stress doses last
   night for developing hypotension.
   His antibiotics have been broadened for concerns of re-developing
   septic shock.
   He has increasing secretions and volume overload by exam / CXR. His
   echo did not show any concerning features for pericardial constraint or
   LV dysfunction. He will likely have chest tube and pericardial drains

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis, respiratory failure, decompensated liver disease, and found to have empyema and MSSA bacteremia. The patient's condition has been complicated by cardiac tamponade. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving vasopressin, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), pantoprazole (Protonix), fentanyl, and midazolam (Versed). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Persistent infection: Despite broadened antibiotic coverage, there is concern for persistent infection or new infectious source, especially considering the recent surgery.
2. Sepsis: The patient remains at risk for sepsis due to ongoing infection.
3. Cardiac tamponade: The patient has had cardiac tamponade, which is a potentially life-threatening condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardium, causing compression of the heart.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and may continue to struggle with respiratory failure.
5. Liver failure: The patient's liver function continues to worsen, indicating ongoing liver failure.
6. Renal failure: The patient has E"

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He was admitted with MSSA sepsis, respiratory failure, decompensated liver disease, and was found to have empyema and MSSA bacteremia. The patient's condition has been further complicated by cardiac tamponade.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with MSSA sepsis, which has been treated with broadened antibiotic coverage. Monitoring for any signs of recurrent sepsis is crucial.

2. Pneumonia/MSSA bacteremia: The patient has ongoing pneumonia and bacteremia caused by MSSA. Continuous monitoring of blood cultures and adjustment of antibiotic therapy may be necessary.

3. Mental status changes: The patient remains intermittently agitated but awake. Close observation for any further deterioration in mental status is essential.

4. Cardiac tamponade: The patient has developed cardiac tamponade, which has been managed with a pericardial window. Continuous monitoring of hemodynamic status and potential complications related to the procedure is important.

5. Pleural effusion: The patient has a hemothorax that is stable, and the chest tubes will be removed today. Monitoring for any signs of reaccumulation or infection is necessary.

6. Respiratory failure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, pericardial effusion with tamponade, gastrointestinal bleed, altered mental status (not delirium), liver function abnormalities, chronic pleural effusion, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and coagulopathy.

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 107 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117/80 to 94/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on ventilator support. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.8 degrees Celsius.

The patient has been receiving various medications including seroquel for agitation, antibiotics such as nafcillin, vancomycin, and cefepime, pain management with hydromorphone and fentanyl, as well as pantoprazole for stress ulcers. The patient also has arterial and central venous lines, a PICC line, and a dialysis catheter in place.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis, respiratory failure, decompensated liver disease, and found to have empyema and MSSA bacteremia. The patient's course has been complicated by cardiac tamponade.

The patient's medical complications include sepsis with organ dysfunction, pericardial effusion with tamponade, gastrointestinal bleed, altered mental status (not delirium), liver function abnormalities, pleural effusion (chronic), renal failure (ESRD), and coagulopathy.

The patient's current plan includes continuing broadened antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and cefepime, discontinuing nafcillin if no positive cultures, restarting stress dose steroids at hydrocortisone 100mg IV q8hrs then weaning, following up with cultures, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viral load, resending galactomannan and beta-glucan, and weaning vasopressin as tolerated.

Additionally, the patient had a pericardial window procedure and the echocardiogram showed no re-accumulation of pericardial fluid."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia who underwent a liver transplant. He presented with MSSA sepsis, respiratory failure, decompensated liver disease, empyema, and MSSA bacteremia. The patient's current conditions include severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, pericardial effusion with tamponade, gastrointestinal bleed, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, chronic pleural effusion, end-stage renal disease, and coagulopathy.

The patient's recent medical events include a pericardial window procedure, removal of thoracic drains, extubation, continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and ongoing management of various other conditions such as ESLD (end-stage liver disease), ESRD (end-stage renal disease), hip pain, and nutritional support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include persistent infections leading to sepsis, worsening liver failure, respiratory failure, renal failure, coagulopathy, and complications related to the patient's history of avascular necrosis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and renal failure. He is currently admitted to the ICU for various medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with MSSA pneumonia and bacteremia. He is also suffering from tamponade secondary to pericardial effusion, empyema, mental status changes (encephalopathy), and renal failure. The patient has multiple lines and tubes inserted, including an arterial line, PICC line, dialysis catheter, and endotracheal tube for mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has MSSA pneumonia and bacteremia, which increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Organ Failure: The patient already has renal failure, and there is a concern for potential hepatic, cardiovascular, or respiratory organ failure due to his underlying conditions.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or complications related to extubation.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a prolonged PTT and INR, indicating a coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding.
5. Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes may persist or worsen, potentially leading to further encephalopathy.
6. Infection Control: With multiple lines and tubes in place, there is a risk of introducing or spreading healthcare-associated infections."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease. He was admitted with MSSA sepsis, respiratory failure, decompensated liver disease, and found to have empyema and MSSA bacteremia. His course has been complicated by cardiac tamponade.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been treated for MSSA sepsis and is no longer hypotensive or requiring pressors. However, there is a risk of recurring sepsis due to persistent infections.
2. Pneumonia/MSSA Bacteremia: The patient is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime for MSSA bacteremia and pneumonia. There is a risk of treatment failure or development of antibiotic resistance.
3. Mental Status: The patient remains intermittently agitated but awake. There is a risk of delirium or further decline in mental status.
4. Pericardial Effusion with Tamponade: The patient underwent pericardial window and is scheduled for drain removal today. There is a risk of recurrent tamponade if the effusion reaccumulates.
5. L Hemothorax: The patient has stable hemothorax, and thoracics planning on removing tubes today. There is a risk of bleeding or complications during the removal procedure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sepsis, respiratory failure, decompensated liver disease, empyema, and MSSA bacteremia. The patient's condition has been further complicated by cardiac tamponade. The patient's sepsis is currently being managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime. His mental status remains intermittently agitated but awake, and he is being started on seroquel for agitation. The patient underwent pericardial window surgery and has a scant drain output. The thoracic surgeon plans to remove the chest tubes today. The patient's left hemothorax is stable and the chest tubes will also be removed today. The patient tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) overnight and is awake, alert, and able to gag, which suggests readiness for extubation. The patient's worsening liver failure is likely related to persistent infections, and he will continue to receive immunosuppression with tacrolimus. His ESLD (end-stage liver disease) is being managed with lactulose, rifaximin, and follow-up liver recommendations. The patient has a history of avascular necrosis and is experiencing right hip pain, which is being controlled with dil"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He was admitted with MSSA sepsis, respiratory failure, decompensated liver disease, and found to have empyema and MSSA bacteremia. The patient's course has been complicated by cardiac tamponade. 

The patient's current condition includes severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, pericardial effusion with tamponade, gastrointestinal bleed, altered mental status, liver function abnormalities, chronic pleural effusion, and coagulopathy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has already experienced MSSA bacteremia and sepsis, which can lead to further systemic infection and organ dysfunction.
2. Cardiac tamponade: The presence of a pericardial effusion causing tamponade may compromise heart function and hemodynamics.
3. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has had gastrointestinal bleeding, which can result in significant blood loss and require urgent intervention.
4. Liver failure: The patient's decompensated liver disease and liver function abnormalities indicate a risk for continued liver failure.
5. Renal failure: The patient has ESRD, and there is a risk of worsening renal function.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy increases the risk of bleeding complications.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, and they have been diagnosed with MSSA sepsis, pleural effusion, and ESLD (end-stage liver disease). The patient has undergone several interventions including chest tube and pericardial drain removal, extubation, and placement of a doboff (likely referring to a feeding tube). 

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia (heart rate of 110 bpm), hypertension (blood pressure of 143/91 mmHg), and an elevated respiratory rate (23 breaths per minute). Oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation. 

Physical examination reveals an anxious appearance, poor dentition, clear breath sounds, trace lower extremity edema, and muscle wasting. Neurologically, the patient is oriented, follows commands, and has purposeful movements with decreased muscle tone.

Laboratory results indicate abnormal liver function tests (elevated AST, ALT, bilirubin, and INR), renal dysfunction (elevated creatinine), electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia), and elevated white blood cell count. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's medical history includes ESLD, renal failure, and an upcoming scheduled course of antibiotics for MSSA pneumonia. The assessment and plan include ongoing management of infection, adrenal insufficiency, mental status changes, pleural effusion, ESL"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), renal failure, and a recent history of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia that led to empyema and pericardial effusion. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone chest tube and pericardial drain removal. He was previously on mechanical ventilation but is now extubated and receiving CPAP/PSV support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of MSSA pneumonia, empyema, and pericardial effusion. Although he is currently on appropriate antibiotics, there is a risk of ongoing or recurrent infection, especially since he is in the ICU.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has been diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency, and his hydrocortisone dosage will be decreased to 50 mg daily. Insufficient cortisol replacement can lead to hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and poor wound healing.
3. Mental status changes: The patient has shown improvement in his mental status, and Seroquel, a medication used for sedation, will be discontinued. However, there is still a need for close monitoring of his neurological function.
4. Liver disease: The patient's ESLD is improving, as evidenced by improving liver function tests (LFTs), bilirubin, and INR. However, he continues"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease. He was admitted with MSSA sepsis, respiratory failure, decompensated liver disease, and empyema. His course has been complicated by cardiac tamponade. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis/Pneumonia/MSSA bacteremia: The patient remains hemodynamically stable with no new positive culture results. He is afebrile and has a normal white blood cell count, indicating improving infection. The plan includes weaning off stress dose steroids, continuing treatment with Cefepime and Vancomycin for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and following up with chest x-rays.
2. Mental status: The patient is fully oriented today. The plan includes decreasing lactulose to 30 mL due to excessive stool output and continuing rifaximin.
3. Abdominal pain: No abdominal pain was observed on examination today. The possibility of pain yesterday could be attributed to gas. The plan does not include an abdominal CT.
4. Post-pericardial window: The patient remains hemodynamically stable.
5. Left hemothorax: The chest x-ray from today is difficult to interpret. A repeat x-ray is planned for tomorrow.
6. End-stage liver disease (ESLD): The patient's total bilirubin level is improving, likely reflecting improving"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and renal failure, awaiting a transplant. He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) pneumonia and is now in the ICU. The patient's condition has been critical, but there have been some improvements. He is now extubated and tolerating enteral nutrition. However, he still faces several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Pneumonia/Infection: The patient has MSSA pneumonia and there is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He will continue receiving cefepime and vancomycin for VAP treatment for seven days, followed by a restart of nafcillin. A follow-up chest X-ray is planned on 02-26.
2. Abdominal Distension: The patient has abdominal distension, but without pain and with active bowel sounds. An abdominal CT has been postponed for today, but may be done on 12-27. Lactulose dosage will be decreased to [Hospital1] dosing.
