","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of lymphoma (cancer) admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing fever and required invasive ventilation. There are multiple lines and tubes inserted, including a PICC line, endotracheal tube, and arterial line. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have a fever of 102.9째F. The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia (low white blood cell count) and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. The patient's ABG values indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.33 and PaCO2 of 42 mmHg. The patient's blood culture results show an increase in colony counts for both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. The patient's urine output has been low, with only 670 mL in the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on invasive ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): With multiple lines and tubes inserted, there is a risk of developing a bloodstream infection, especially if proper sterile techniques are not followed.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection, which could lead"

   1. Respiratory failure.  Unclear etiology of rapidly worsening hypoxic
   respiratory failure.  Patient on broad spectrum antibiotics currently
   dapto/zosyn/leavquin/vori.  DDx is infectious (viral, less likely
   bacterial or PCP in setting of negative cultures), DAH, ARDS lymphoma.
   Appreciate ID input.
   - continue dapto/zosyn/levaquin/vori
   - bactrim for empiric PCP therapy
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u BAL results
   - thoracics consult for VATs
   - repeat bronch, BAL to r/o PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] empiric steroids
   - f/u galactomannan, beta glucan
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  Patient developed hypotension following intubation.
   Had low urine output initially which improved with fluid boluses.
   Switched from neo to norepi as HR decreased.
   - neo to keeps MAPS > 65 due to marked tachcyardia
   - follow UOP
   - fluid boluses as need to keep MAPs> 65 and to wean pressors
   - repeat venous oxygen saturation

   3.  Tachycardia.  Patient with sinus tachycardia to 140s in setting of
   respiratory distress, fevers, and hypovolemia.  Responded to IVFs and
   intubation.  Currently HR 67.
   - monitor on tele

   5.  Fevers.  Ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers.  Only localizing
   symptoms is respiratory distress.  Additionally, enterococcus growing
   from JP drain at splenectomy site (though not clear if this is
   colonization of the drain).
   - empiric broad spectrum antibiotics given immunocompromized state
   - ID following

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who is currently undergoing nitrogen mustard therapy. He presents with persistent neutropenic and asplenic fevers, progressive respiratory failure, and hypotension. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. He also has tachycardia, likely due to respiratory distress, hypovolemia, and fever. Laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and signs of metabolic acidosis. The patient has a history of refractory DLBCL and is now on day +16 of nitrogen mustard therapy with slowly recovering counts.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has progressive respiratory failure, and the etiology is unclear. Possible causes include infectious processes such as bacterial, viral, or Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or lymphoma-related complications. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and further diagnostic tests are needed to identify the underlying cause.
2. Hypotension: The patient developed hypotension following intubation, which improved with fluid boluses. Pressor support has been started, and close monitoring of blood pressure and urine output is required.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia in the"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who is currently undergoing nitrogen mustard therapy. He has been experiencing persistent neutropenic and asplenic fevers, along with progressive respiratory failure. The patient is now intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to worsening hypoxic respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8째C (96.5째F), heart rate of 58 bpm (tachycardia), blood pressure of 91/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including daptomycin, levofloxacin, voriconazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 48 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, sodium of 112 mEq/L, potassium of 3.1 mEq/L, and platelet count of 26,000/mm3. The patient's blood cultures are negative, but Enterococcus species have been identified from the joint fluid culture. 

Imaging reveals patchy bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, which may indicate pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is also reported to have ground glass"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and hypotension. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. 

On admission, the patient's vital signs were unstable with hypotension and tachycardia. He required immediate intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. The initial workup revealed a left lower lobe pneumonia and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Since admission, the patient's condition has been fluctuating. He required norepinephrine support to maintain blood pressure but was successfully weaned off by 3 AM. The patient received multiple blood transfusions due to thrombocytopenia. Cultures from the JP drain grew Enterococcus species, which was resistant to most antibiotics except for linezolid. The patient's antibiotic regimen has been adjusted accordingly.

Laboratory results show leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and impaired renal function. Imaging revealed bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. Blood cultures have been negative, ruling out bacterial sepsis. The patient tested negative for Clostridium difficile and respiratory viral antigens. 

The patient remains on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volumes and a moderate level of PEEP. His blood pressure is stable, but his mental status remains altered. The patient"

   SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION-This is in neutropenic patient with
   asplenic status and with significant and persistent insult seen with
   VRE only positive cultures seen.  Unfortunately the source here remains
   to be clearly defined with possible VRE and with possible pulmonary
   source being considered.
   -Daptomycin/Zosyn/Levoflox to continue
   -Levophed weaned to off and will continue to favor pressors over fluids
   ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE-He has PIP=21, Pplat=16 and PEEP=5 all with
   good oxygenation and this is much less consistent with ARDS given P/F
   ratio being favorable and this morning would make diagnosis consistent
   with [**Doctor Last Name 11**].  This may be related to overall sepsis picture but patient
   also with some hydrostatic edema noted.  We do have concern for
   possible infectious source in the lungs but with bronchoscopy negative
   to date.
   -Will move to PSV today
   -Will continue to support with antibiotics and look to return to
   capacity for spontenous breathing trial and move to extubation with
   volume status optimized
   -We see little evidence of acute active bacterial pneumonia at this
   time.
   -So
move to PSV this morning, look to keep I/O even and wean off
   pressors and minimize sedation.
   -Follow up BAL cultures

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who is admitted with sepsis and respiratory failure. He has undergone splenectomy and is currently neutropenic. The patient remains on mechanical ventilation with a requirement for levophed to support blood pressure.

Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis, which is characterized by an ongoing infection that has led to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. The source of the infection is not clearly defined but may involve VRE (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci) and a possible pulmonary source.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, indicated by high pressures in the lungs (PIP=21, Pplat=16) and low oxygen levels (SpO2=94%). This condition may be related to sepsis or hydrostatic edema in the lungs. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a plan to wean off levophed and optimize volume status for a spontaneous breathing trial and eventual extubation.

3. Malignancy: The patient has a history of relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which requires future treatment planning considering the current clinical worsening.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Organ Dysfunction: Due to sepsis, the patient is at risk of developing organ dysfunction, particularly in the lungs, kidneys, liver, and heart."

   1. Respiratory failure.  Unclear etiology of rapidly worsening hypoxic
   respiratory failure.  Patient on broad spectrum antibiotics currently
   dapto/zosyn/leavquin/vori.  DDx is infectious (viral, less likely
   bacterial or PCP in setting of negative cultures x 2), DAH, ARDS
   lymphoma.  Appreciate ID input.  Continues to be neutropenic with ANC
   of 221.
   - CXR today ?pulmonary edema vs ARDS.
   - continue dapto/zosyn/levaquin/vori; only +culture to date is VRE from
   JP drain. Dapto sensitivities pending.
   - bactrim discontinued [**3-24**].

   2.  Hypotension.  Patient developed hypotension following intubation.
   Had low urine output initially which improved with fluid boluses.
   Switched from neo to norepi as HR decreased.
   - neo to keeps MAPS > 65 due to marked tachcyardia
   - follow UOP
   - fluid boluses as need to keep MAPs> 65 and to wean pressors
   - repeat venous oxygen saturation
   .
   3.  Tachycardia.  Patient with sinus tachycardia to 140s in setting of
   respiratory distress, fevers, and hypovolemia.  Responded to IVFs and
   intubation.  Currently HR 58.
   - monitor on tele
   - tylenol for fevers
   - ivfs as needed, though currently euvolemic

   4.  DLBCL.  Patient with refractory DLBCL.  Now day +18 of nitrogen and
   counts are slowly recovering.
   - transfuse to Hct of 25, Plts > 30
   - continue neupogen
   - BMT following
   - daily CBC with diff/ anc
   .
   5.  Fevers.  Ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers.  Only localizing
   symptoms is respiratory distress.  Additionally, VRE growing from JP
   drain at splenectomy site (though not clear if this is colonization of
   the drain).
   - empiric broad spectrum antibiotics given immunocompromized state
   - ID following
   - f/u cultures
   - thoracics consult for possible vats
   .
   6. Abdominal collections.  Given ongoing fevers and JP drain positive
   for enterococcus, concerning for abscess versus colonization.  Switched
   from vanco to dapto on [**3-23**].
   - continue dapto; await final sensitivities
   - surgery following

- The patient has persistent neutropenic and asplenic fevers, along with progressive respiratory failure.
- Ground glass opacities on imaging suggest worsening infectious disease, possibly opportunistic pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including daptomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Levofloxacin, and Voriconazole.
- The patient's respiratory failure is of unclear etiology, with differential diagnoses including infectious causes, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), ARDS, and lymphoma.
- The patient's neutrophil count is low at 221.
- The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, requiring fluid boluses and the use of norepinephrine.
- The patient's heart rate has been elevated, initially in the 140s but now stable at 58.
- The patient's urine output has improved with fluid resuscitation.
- The patient's metabolic acidosis has improved to 22 today with the use of a bicarbonate drip.
- The patient has ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers, with only respiratory distress as a localized symptom.

   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 yo male s/p auto BMT [**12-12**] with relapsed DLBCL d+19
   of nitrogen mustard therapy with persistent neutropenic and asplenic
   fevers (s/p splenectomy [**2176-2-20**]) and progressive respiratory failure,
   with worsening ground glass opacities with concern for worsening
   infectious disease.
   .
   #. Respiratory failure.  Unclear etiology of rapidly worsening hypoxic
   respiratory failure.  Weaned significantly on vent over yesterday, but
   still hypoxic on SBT this am, and now back on PSV [**2106-8-12**].  CXR this am
   somewhat improved over yesterday, c/w pulmonary edema, and patient is +
   12L since admission to ICU (day 4). Given neutropenia, infectious cause
   is of concern. Patient on broad spectrum antibiotics currently
   dapto/zosyn/leavquin/vori.  Aspergerllus antigen + at 0.53, but likely
   false positive from concurrent zosyn.  Thoracics declined VATS.
   Lactate trending down.  Will continue treatment with broad antibiotics,
   and try to diurese today.
   - repeat CXR
   - continue dapto/zosyn/levaquin/vori
   - lasix 20mg IV now, goal negative 1L today
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - empiric steroids
   - f/u galactomannan, beta glucan, and final BAL cultures.
   .
   #.  Hypotension.  On admission, concern for sepsis.  Now lactate
   trending down, off all pressors this am.
   - follow MAP, fluid bouls prn to keep MAP > 65
   - follow UOP
   .
   #.  DLBCL s/p nitrogen mustard with neutropenia.  Patient with
   refractory DLBCL.  Now day +19 of nitrogen and counts are slowly
   recovering.  ANC 288.
   - transfuse to Hct of 25, Plts > 30
   - continue neupogen
   - BMT following
   - daily CBC with diff/ anc
   .
   #.  Fevers.  Ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers.  Only localizing
   symptoms is respiratory distress.  Additionally, VRE growing from JP
   drain at splenectomy site (though not clear if this is colonization of
   the drain).
   - empiric broad spectrum antibiotics given immunocompromised state,
   consider peeling back once ANC recovers.
   - ID following
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #. Abdominal collections.  Given ongoing fevers and JP drain positive
   for enterococcus, concerning for abscess versus colonization.  Switched
   from vanco to dapto on [**3-23**]. VRE daptomycin sensitive.
   - continue dapto
   - surgery recs
   .
   #. Glycemic control.
   - regular ISS given steroid use
   .
   #. Metabolic acidosis.  Bicarb improved to 22 today, now off bicarb
   drip, pH 7.37
   - follow lytes, ABGs

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who underwent an auto BMT 12/12 with relapsed DLBCL. He is experiencing persistent neutropenic and asplenic fevers, progressive respiratory failure, and worsening ground glass opacities on chest X-ray. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure and is currently intubated in the ICU. He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including dapto, zosyn, levaquin, and vori. The patient's lactate levels are trending down, and he is no longer on pressors. His ANC is 288, and he has received a platelet transfusion. There are concerns about an infectious disease, possibly opportunistic pneumonia or ARDS. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is worsening, despite being on mechanical ventilation. There is an ongoing concern for the etiology of this condition, with infectious causes being of particular concern due to the patient's immunocompromised state.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's chest X-ray shows worsening diffuse airspace opacities, suggesting pulmonary edema. This may further contribute to respiratory distress and hypoxia.
3. Infectious disease: Given the patient's neutropenia and asplenic status, there is a high risk of opportunistic infections. The patient has already tested positive for As"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has a history of lymphoma (cancer) and has undergone thoracic surgery, which was declined by the patient. The patient's mental status is described as ""c"". The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including Bactrim, Daptomycin, Levofloxacin, Voriconazole, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/50 to 114/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 104 and 189 mg/dL. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and decreased platelet count. Imaging reveals worsening diffuse airspace opacities in both lungs, more prominent on the right side, suggesting opportunistic pneumonia possibly complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's microbiology tests are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's worsening diffuse airspace opacities and the history of hypoxemic respiratory failure suggest a possible development of ARDS. This condition can lead to severe lung inflammation"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yo male with renal cell CA and lymphoma now returning with febrile
   neutropenia and is s/p splenectomy and has had nitrogen mustard therapy
   for recurrent lymphoma and is admitted with respiratory failure and
   evolution of diffuse ground glass opacities.  We have maintained a
   broad differential on the source of these infiltrates but we have not
   seen definative return of culture results from BAL to point to source
   of infection and are left with possible non-infectious causes such as
   alveolar hemorrhage or organizing pneumonitis.
   1)Respiratory Failure-patient with primary issue of hypoxia
   maintains reasonable tolerance of PSV support but is quite depndent on
   PEEP which when combined with the rapid change in CXR across 2 days is
   most consistent with contribution from pulmonary edema which may be in
   part caridiogenic but also non-cardiogenic
   -Will move to diuresis today
   -Will continue to provide PEEP at 8-10 today
   -Will continue with broad spectrum antibiotics
   -Concluding diagnosis may well be idiopathic pneumonitis and would
   agree that we have significant risk out of proportion to benefit with
   poor healing and risk of bleeding.  Will cotinue to discuss based on
   clinical response across time.
   2) LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   -Mustard Rx given
   -Follow for return of counts
   3) SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION-
   -Levophed off this morning
   -Continue broad spectrum antibiotics

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 yo male s/p auto BMT [**12-12**] with relapsed DLBCL d+19
   of nitrogen mustard therapy with persistent neutropenic and asplenic
   fevers (s/p splenectomy [**2176-2-20**]) and progressive respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Respiratory failure.  Unclear etiology of rapidly worsening hypoxic
   respiratory failure.  Weaned significantly on vent over psat few days.
   Currently on  PSV 8/9 PEEP/40 FiO2.  CXR this am somewhat improved over
   yesterday, c/w pulmonary edema, and patient is + 8.9 L since admission
   to ICU (day 4). Given neutropenia, infectious cause is of concern.
   Patient on broad spectrum antibiotics currently
   dapto/zosyn/leavquin/vori.  Aspergerllus antigen + at 0.53, but likely
   false positive from concurrent zosyn.  Thoracics declined VATS.
   Lactate trending down.  Will continue treatment with broad antibiotics,
   and diuresed yesterday with IV lasix with good UOP.
   - repeat CXR in AM.
   - continue dapto/zosyn/levaquin/vori
   - continue with lasix diuresis today, goal negative 1L ; [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - empiric steroids; tapered to 60mg solumedrol IV q 12 yesterday.
   - f/u galactomannan, beta glucan.
   .
   #.  Hypotension.  On admission, concern for sepsis.  Now lactate
   trending down, off all pressors since yesterday.
   - follow MAP, fluid bouls prn to keep MAP > 65
   - follow UOP
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Na of 150 over past few days.  Free water flushes
   increased yesterday but due to high residuals, tube feeds were held so
   IV D5W started.
   - Trend Na on D5W IVF maintenance fluids.
   .
   #Pancytopenia:  Secondary to chemotherapy, improving. Anti-PLT antibody
   negative. Consider also checking HIT-Ab, as PLTs seem to consistently
   be low.
   -Trend [**Hospital1 7**] CBC.
   - Transfuse for HCT>21, PLTs > 30.
   .
   #.  DLBCL s/p nitrogen mustard with neutropenia.  Patient with
   refractory DLBCL.  Now day +20 of nitrogen and counts are slowly
   recovering.  ANC 400.
   - transfuse to Hct of 25, Plts > 30
   - continue neupogen
   - BMT following
   - daily CBC with diff/ anc
   .
   #.  Fevers.  History of ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers.  Only
   localizing symptom is respiratory distress.  Additionally, VRE growing
   from JP drain at splenectomy site (though not clear if this is
   colonization of the drain).
   - empiric broad spectrum antibiotics given immunocompromised state,
   consider peeling back once ANC recovers.
   - ID following
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #. Abdominal collections.  Given ongoing fevers and JP drain positive
   for enterococcus, concerning for abscess versus colonization.  Switched
   from vanco to dapto on [**3-23**]. VRE daptomycin sensitive.
   - continue dapto
   - surgery recs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) 12/12. He presented with persistent neutropenic and asplenic fevers, progressive respiratory failure, and was admitted to the ICU on day 4.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2 C (98.9 F)
- Heart rate: 80 bpm
- Blood pressure: 118/59 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 92%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at 8 cmH2O PEEP and 40% FiO2. His ABG results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 207, and oxygen consumption is 10.2 L/min.

Laboratory results include:
- White blood cell count: 0.4 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 25.9%
- Platelet count: 11 K/uL
- Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
- Total bilirubin: 2.4 mg/dL
- Glucose: 158 mg/dL

Imaging studies reveal interval improvement in right lower lobe (RLL) and left lower lobe (LLL) opacities on chest X-ray. Microbiology tests show multiple blood cultures negative for growth, while sputum culture is positive for oropharyngeal flora, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is negative.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has worsening hypoxic respiratory failure of unclear etiology. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and the patient is being weaned off mechanical ventilation as tolerated. Repeat chest X-ray is planned.
2. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with septic shock but is now off all pressors. MAP will be monitored, and fluid boluses will be given as needed to maintain MAP > 65.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated at 150 mg/dL. IV D5W is being administered to correct this.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is secondary to chemotherapy, but counts are slowly improving. Anti-PLT antibody testing is negative, and consideration will be given to checking HIT-Ab due to consistently low platelet counts.
5. DLBCL: The patient has refractory DLBCL and is now day +20 of nitrogen mustard therapy. ANC is 400, and further management will include transfusion to Hct of 25, Pl"

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of auto BMT and relapsed DLBCL who is currently experiencing respiratory failure. He has been treated with nitrogen mustard therapy and is now presenting with persistent neutropenic and asplenic fevers, as well as progressive respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is of unclear etiology, but there is concern for an infectious cause due to his neutropenia. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has shown improvement on the ventilator.

The patient also has hypotension, which was initially thought to be due to sepsis but is now trending down. His lactate levels are also decreasing, and he is off all pressors since yesterday. 

Furthermore, the patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 150 over the past few days. This may be due to high residuals from free water flushes, leading to the decision to start IV D5W.

Additionally, the patient has pancytopenia secondary to chemotherapy. His counts are slowly recovering, and he is currently taking neupogen to stimulate the production of white blood cells. 

The patient's history of ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers is still present, and he has localized symptoms of respiratory distress. There is also a concern for abdominal collections, particularly since the patient's JP drain is positive for enterococcus. Surgery recommendations are being considered to address this issue.

Finally, the patient is on regular insulin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with recurrent lymphoma admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure and diffuse ground glass opacities. He has been treated empirically for pneumonia and efforts have been made to maintain a negative fluid balance, with some improvement in his chest X-ray. However, the patient still requires significant oxygen support and his ventilation is being maintained above 10, raising concerns about possible extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure and ongoing requirement for significant oxygen support indicate a potential complication related to his respiratory function.
2. Pneumonia: Despite treatment, the patient's condition suggests the possibility of pneumonia, which may require further evaluation and management.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels indicate a potential electrolyte imbalance that needs to be addressed with free water replacement.
4. Lymphoma: The patient's underlying malignancy may contribute to his overall health status and treatment decisions.
5. Venous Thromboembolism (DVT): Given the patient's immobility and other risk factors, there is a potential risk for developing blood clots in the legs or lungs.
6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, which should be monitored and managed accordingly.
7. Fluid Balance: The patient's negative fluid balance needs to be closely"

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of splenectomy and recent postoperative status, currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including fatigue, diaphoresis, abdominal pain over the incision site, elevated blood sugar levels, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, and possible infection.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, with a heart rate of 113 beats per minute. Blood pressure is within normal limits at 141/72 mmHg. Respiratory rate is controlled at 20 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation remains at 99%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.6째C.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 7 K/uL, indicating a possible infection. Hemoglobin levels are also slightly low at 7.9 g/dL. Blood glucose levels are elevated at 180 mg/dL. Electrolyte imbalances include hyponatremia with a sodium level of 28 mEq/L and hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L.

Imaging studies reveal an improvement in the left lower lobe effusion, but no evidence of free air or obstruction in the kidneys. Microbiology results show no growth for both sputum and C.diff tests.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 yo male s/p auto BMT [**12-12**] with relapsed DLBCL d+19
   of nitrogen mustard therapy with persistent neutropenic and asplenic
   fevers (s/p splenectomy [**2176-2-20**]) and progressive respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Respiratory failure.  Unclear etiology of rapidly worsening hypoxic
   respiratory failure.  Weaned significantly on vent over psat few days.
   Had been on  PSV 8/8 PEEP/40 FiO2 until this AM then required switch to
   AC in setting of abdominal pain.  CXR this am somewhat improved over
   yesterday, c/w pulmonary edema, and patient is + 7.3 L since admission
   to ICU (day 5). Given neutropenia, infectious cause is of concern.
   Patient on broad spectrum antibiotics currently
   dapto/zosyn/leavquin/vori.  B-glucan from [**3-23**] +112; false positives
   can be seen with amox-clav acid, but given that this was negative
   [**3-16**].  Lactate had been trending down, slightly increased over past day
   from 2.3 -> 4.2, now 3.2 this AM.  Will continue treatment with broad
   antibiotics, and diuresed yesterday with IV lasix with good UOP.
   - repeat CXR in AM.
   - continue dapto/zosyn/levaquin/vori
   - continue with lasix diuresis today, goal negative 1L ; [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - empiric steroids; tapered to 40mg solumedrol IV q 12 yesterday.
   - repeat galactomannan, beta glucan.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain. Acute onset of abdominal pain this morning with
   evidence of possible hernia vs. scar formation under incision site with
   minimal oozing BRB from distal part of incision concerning for
   ?herniation of bowel, esp as lactate increased over past few days.
   Other possibile cause of abdominal pain could be abscess formation.
   KUB without evidence of perforation or obstruction, but pt warrants
   further evaluation with CT abd today given acute change from baseline.
   Surgery saw pt this AM and felt that this was less likely hernia and
   more likely scar formation.
   - f/u surgery recs
   - f/u KUB final read
   - On broad spectrum antibiotics to cover GNs.
   - CT abd/pelvis to rule out abscess, hernia, other acute process.
   .
   #.  Hypotension.  On admission, concern for sepsis.  Lactate was
   trending down, now slowly creeping up, off all pressors for 2 days.
   - follow MAP, fluid bolus prn to keep MAP > 65
   - follow UOP
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Na of 150 over past few days.  IV D5W x 2L given
   yesterday with resolution and serum Na of 143 this AM.
   - Trend Na and give D5W IVF prn.
   .
   #Pancytopenia:  Secondary to chemotherapy, improving. Anti-PLT antibody
   negative. Consider also checking HIT-Ab, as PLTs seem to consistently
   be low. PLTs 7 this AM, so giving 1u PLTs.
   -Trend [**Hospital1 7**] CBC.
   - Transfuse for HCT>21, PLTs > 10 per BMT recs.
   .
   #.  DLBCL . s/p nitrogen mustard with neutropenia.  Patient with
   refractory DLBCL.  Now day +21 of nitrogen and counts are slowly
   recovering.  ANC 400 yesterday now 208.
   - transfuse to Hct of 25, Plts > 10
   - continue neupogen
   - BMT following
   - daily CBC with diff/ anc
   .
   #.  Fevers.  History of ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers.  Now
   only low grade temps of 99F.  VRE growing from JP drain at splenectomy
   site (though not clear if this is colonization of the drain).
   - empiric broad spectrum antibiotics given immunocompromised state,
   consider peeling back once ANC recovers.
   - ID following
   - f/u cultures
   - follow fever curve now with new abd pain.
   .
   #. Abdominal collections.  Given ongoing fevers and JP drain positive
   for enterococcus, concerning for abscess versus colonization.  Switched
   from vanco to dapto on [**3-23**]. VRE daptomycin sensitive.
   - continue dapto
   - surgery recs

","Summary:
- Patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of auto bone marrow transplant (BMT) and relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
- He presented with respiratory failure and was intubated.
- The patient had been on mechanical ventilation but required an increase in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) due to worsening hypoxic respiratory failure.
- His condition improved, but he developed abdominal pain and diaphoresis, leading to a suspicion of possible hernia or abscess formation.
- The patient also had hypernatremia, which was corrected with IV D5W.
- He has ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers, for which broad-spectrum antibiotics have been given.
- The patient's pancytopenia is improving, and he is receiving platelet transfusions.
- His blood counts are slowly recovering after nitrogen mustard therapy.
- There is concern for possible abdominal collections or abscesses, and further evaluation with CT abdomen/pelvis is planned.
- The patient's condition remains unstable, and he is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen, potentially leading to further hypoxia and the need for increased ventilatory support.
2. Abdominal pain and possible hernia or abscess formation: The patient's abdominal pain could be indicative of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 yo male s/p auto BMT [**12-12**] with relapsed DLBCL d+19
   of nitrogen mustard therapy with persistent neutropenic and asplenic
   fevers (s/p splenectomy [**2176-2-20**]) and progressive respiratory failure.
   .
   #. Respiratory failure.  Unclear etiology of rapidly worsening hypoxic
   respiratory failure.  Weaned significantly on vent over psat few days.
   Had been on  PSV 8/8 PEEP/40 FiO2 until this AM then required switch to
   AC in setting of abdominal pain.  CXR this am somewhat improved over
   yesterday, c/w pulmonary edema, and patient is + 7.3 L since admission
   to ICU (day 5). Given neutropenia, infectious cause is of concern.
   Patient on broad spectrum antibiotics currently
   dapto/zosyn/leavquin/vori.  B-glucan from [**3-23**] +112; false positives
   can be seen with amox-clav acid, but given that this was negative
   [**3-16**].  Lactate had been trending down, slightly increased over past day
   from 2.3 -> 4.2, now 3.2 this AM.  Will continue treatment with broad
   antibiotics, and diuresed yesterday with IV lasix with good UOP.
   - repeat CXR in AM.
   - continue dapto/zosyn/levaquin/vori
   - continue with lasix diuresis today, goal negative 1L ; [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - empiric steroids; tapered to 40mg solumedrol IV q 12 yesterday.
   - repeat galactomannan, beta glucan.
   .
   # Abdominal Pain. Acute onset of abdominal pain this morning with
   evidence of possible hernia vs. scar formation under incision site with
   minimal oozing BRB from distal part of incision concerning for
   ?herniation of bowel, esp as lactate increased over past few days.
   Other possibile cause of abdominal pain could be abscess formation.
   KUB without evidence of perforation or obstruction, but pt warrants
   further evaluation with CT abd today given acute change from baseline.
   Surgery saw pt this AM and felt that this was less likely hernia and
   more likely scar formation.
   - f/u surgery recs
   - f/u KUB final read
   - On broad spectrum antibiotics to cover GNs.
   - CT abd/pelvis to rule out abscess, hernia, other acute process.
   .
   #.  Hypotension.  On admission, concern for sepsis.  Lactate was
   trending down, now slowly creeping up, off all pressors for 2 days.
   - follow MAP, fluid bolus prn to keep MAP > 65
   - follow UOP
   .
   # Hypernatremia.  Na of 150 over past few days.  IV D5W x 2L given
   yesterday with resolution and serum Na of 143 this AM.
   - Trend Na and give D5W IVF prn.
   .
   #Pancytopenia:  Secondary to chemotherapy, improving. Anti-PLT antibody
   negative. Consider also checking HIT-Ab, as PLTs seem to consistently
   be low. PLTs 7 this AM, so giving 1u PLTs.
   -Trend [**Hospital1 7**] CBC.
   - Transfuse for HCT>21, PLTs > 10 per BMT recs.
   .
   #.  DLBCL . s/p nitrogen mustard with neutropenia.  Patient with
   refractory DLBCL.  Now day +21 of nitrogen and counts are slowly
   recovering.  ANC 400 yesterday now 208.
   - transfuse to Hct of 25, Plts > 10
   - continue neupogen
   - BMT following
   - daily CBC with diff/ anc
   .
   #.  Fevers.  History of ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers.  Now
   only low grade temps of 99F.  VRE growing from JP drain at splenectomy
   site (though not clear if this is colonization of the drain).
   - empiric broad spectrum antibiotics given immunocompromised state,
   consider peeling back once ANC recovers.
   - ID following
   - f/u cultures
   - follow fever curve now with new abd pain.
   .
   #. Abdominal collections.  Given ongoing fevers and JP drain positive
   for enterococcus, concerning for abscess versus colonization.  Switched
   from vanco to dapto on [**3-23**]. VRE daptomycin sensitive.
   - continue dapto
   - surgery recs
   .
   #. Glycemic control.
   - regular ISS given steroid use

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) 19 days ago. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure, abdominal pain, hypotension, hypernatremia, pancytopenia, and fevers.

The patient's respiratory failure is of unclear etiology, with worsening hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been weaned off the pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is now on assist-control ventilation (AC). Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and there is concern for an infectious cause given his neutropenic state.

The patient is also experiencing abdominal pain, which may be due to a hernia or abscess formation. A CT abdomen/pelvis has been ordered to evaluate the cause of the pain. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover gram-negative organisms.

He is hypotensive and off all pressors for the past two days. The lactate levels have been trending up, indicating possible sepsis. MAP should be monitored, and fluid boluses should be given as needed to maintain a MAP greater than 65.

The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 150. IV D5W has been given to correct the electrolyte imbalance.

Pancytopenia is secondary to chemotherapy, but it is improving. Anti-platelet antibodies are negative, so platelet transf"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has a history of recurrent lymphoma. The patient's recent events include new abdominal pain at the incision site, worsening infection in the lungs, nodules in the liver, small pleural effusion, and small fluid collection at the inferior gastric margin. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about rising lactate levels. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and low platelet count. Imaging studies reveal several abnormalities, including GGO in the lung, nodules in the liver, and small pleural effusion. The patient's current diagnosis includes respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, lymphoma, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and the presence of infection in the lungs increase the risk of further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: The patient is already showing signs of worsening infection, including abdominal pain and lung abnormalities. There is a risk of developing sepsis or septic shock if the infection spreads or if the antibiotics fail to control the infection.
3. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of bleeding parameters and cautious use of invasive"

   admitted to ICU with recurrent respiratory failure.  He has persistent
   respiratory failure with hypoxa and continued need for PEEP and PSV
   support.
   1)       RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])-
   -Continue with negative fluid balance
   -Will continue to support with hydration peri-CT scan
   -Will decreased PEEP to 5 and FIO2 to 40%
   -If continued hypoxemia seen and worsening with wean will have to move
   to diuresis
   -Continue with Solumedrol
   2)Metabolic Alkalosis-
   -Will have to be careful with further diruesis and with ongoing steroid
   dosing
   -If return to diuresis needed will have to consider Carbonic Anhydrase
   Inhibitor with possible diamox
   -Will lead to decrease in severity of apnea and certral impairment of
   drive

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, who was admitted to the ICU for recurrent respiratory failure. He has persistent respiratory failure with hypoxia and requires ongoing support with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV). The patient also has metabolic alkalosis and sepsis without organ dysfunction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent respiratory failure is a significant concern. If the hypoxemia worsens and the patient is unable to wean off ventilation, this could lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2) Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which needs to be carefully managed, especially with ongoing diuretic use and steroid dosing. This can lead to complications such as worsening of apnea and central impairment of drive.
3) Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis is currently classified as without organ dysfunction, there is a risk of progression to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
4) Liver Dysfunction: The increased nodules in the liver seen on CT scan suggest underlying liver dysfunction, which can further complicate the patient's condition and increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
5) Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has decreased platelets,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) 12/12. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure, abdominal pain with fluid collections, metabolic acidosis, pancytopenia, and fevers. The patient has been treated with various medications and interventions, including nitrogen mustard therapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics, diuretics, steroids, and blood transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of infectious process and fluid overload. Daily chest X-rays will be performed to monitor progress, and adjustments to PEEP and FiO2 settings will be made as tolerated.
2. Abdominal Pain/Abdominal Fluid Collections: The patient's abdominal pain has improved, but there are new fluid collections on CT scan that may be drainable endoscopically. Surgery recommendations will be followed, and feasibility of endoscopic drainage will be discussed with the ERCP team.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to contraction alkalosis from diuresis and steroid use. Close monitoring of electrolytes is advised.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is secondary to chemotherapy. Although counts are slowly recovering, frequent transfusions of platelets and PRBCs are still required. Trend"

   CXR today: worsening infiltrates
   Imaging: CT Chest:
   1. Significant worsening of bilateral ground-glass opacity and
   bibasilar
   consolidations with small bilateral pleural effusions compatible with
   widespread infectious process, particularly given its acute onset and
   worsening since the exmination of [**2176-3-19**]. A component of
   failure/volume overload may also be present given the central
   ground-glass opacification.
   2. Small fluid collection inferior to the gastric body with drain in
   the left
   upper quadrant. It is difficult to assess whether the drain is within
   the
   collection or directly adjacent to it. However, given its location, it
   does
   not appear to be amenable to radiology image-guided drainage; and if
   clinically indicated, endoscopic aspiration may be considered.
   3. Persistent mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The
   retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy may be related to patient's lymphoma or
   be
   reactive in the setting of infection. Given close proximity to the
   nephrectomy bed with soft tissue concerning for RCC recurrence, renal
   cell carcinoma is also a consideration. Persistent linear enhancing
   focus among surgical clips in the left nephrectomy bed appear similar
   to outside examinations dating to 4/[**2175**].
   4. Small new liver lesions, concerning for lymphomatous involvement
   versus
   infection.
   5. Increased now moderate abdominal ascites.
   6. Persistent splenic vein thrombosis.

 note
   above.
   Mr [**Known lastname **] is unable to wean on decreasing CPAP/ PSV support today with
   clear evidence for accessory muscle use, worsening hypoxemia and
   diaphoresis. This, despite RSBI of 35.
   His CXR does NOT look improved and has both interstitial and alveolar
   infiltrates in Rt> Lt lung without effusions. His BM Bx and splenectomy
   specimens both reveal extensive lymphomatous involvement.
   I have discussed this with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 21**] today and my hopes for extubation
   are low since there has not been resolution of infiltrates even with
   steroids. VATS unlikely to change the outcome significantly.
   His ANC is 840.
   We will increase steroids for another 48 hrs as ANC returns in the hope
   that the inflammatory component may respond. Oncology team will decide
   regarding need for repeat BM Bx but suspect family meeting will be
   needed to review overall goals of care given lack of improvement on
   ventilator.

His current vital signs include a temperature of 38째C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 132/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals diaphoresis and significant respiratory distress. Laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies indicate worsening bilateral ground-glass opacities and bibasilar consolidations on CT chest, consistent with a widespread infectious process. The patient's condition is complicated by refractory DLBCL, neutropenia, asplenia, pancytopenia, fevers, and possible pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray and CT scan suggest ongoing respiratory failure. This could be due to worsening lymphoma, superimposed infection, or pulmonary edema.
2. Infection: The patient"

   CXR today: worsening infiltrates
   Imaging: CT Chest:
   1. Significant worsening of bilateral ground-glass opacity and
   bibasilar
   consolidations with small bilateral pleural effusions compatible with
   widespread infectious process, particularly given its acute onset and
   worsening since the exmination of [**2176-3-19**]. A component of
   failure/volume overload may also be present given the central
   ground-glass opacification.
   2. Small fluid collection inferior to the gastric body with drain in
   the left
   upper quadrant. It is difficult to assess whether the drain is within
   the
   collection or directly adjacent to it. However, given its location, it
   does
   not appear to be amenable to radiology image-guided drainage; and if
   clinically indicated, endoscopic aspiration may be considered.
   3. Persistent mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The
   retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy may be related to patient's lymphoma or
   be
   reactive in the setting of infection. Given close proximity to the
   nephrectomy bed with soft tissue concerning for RCC recurrence, renal
   cell carcinoma is also a consideration. Persistent linear enhancing
   focus among surgical clips in the left nephrectomy bed appear similar
   to outside examinations dating to 4/[**2175**].
   4. Small new liver lesions, concerning for lymphomatous involvement
   versus
   infection.
   5. Increased now moderate abdominal ascites.
   6. Persistent splenic vein thrombosis.

   worsening today, focal infiltrates, no signs of fluid overload.  Likely
   worsening of lymphoma, with possible contribution of infectious process
   and some element of pulmonary edema.    If worsening lymphoma is the
   primary cause of his respiratory failure, he may not be able to be
   extubated.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). He is currently experiencing respiratory failure, as indicated by his use of significant accessory muscles to breathe and discomfort off sedation. The CT scan shows widespread infectious process with bilateral ground-glass opacity and bibasilar consolidations, suggesting a worsening of lymphoma, infectious process, and possible pulmonary edema. The patient's respiratory failure may not allow for extubation if worsening lymphoma is the primary cause.

The patient has abdominal pain and fluid collections, with improved pain today. A fluid collection on CT may be new or ineffectively draining with the current drain. The patient is neutropenic and on steroids, making it difficult to assess possible infection. The culture from the drain was susceptible to daptomycin.

The patient has pancytopenia secondary to chemotherapy, but counts are slowly recovering. He requires frequent transfusions of platelets and packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The ANC (absolute neutrophil count) is 850.

The patient has ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers. A VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci) was growing from the jejunostomy (JP) drain at the splenectomy site. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to his immunocompromised state, and the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has a history of lymphoma and is currently experiencing worsening bilateral ground-glass opacity and bibasilar consolidations on CT chest, indicating a widespread infectious process. The patient also has small bilateral pleural effusions and a fluid collection inferior to the gastric body with a drain in the left upper quadrant. There is persistent mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, which could be related to the patient's lymphoma or be reactive in the setting of infection. The patient has new liver lesions, increased abdominal ascites, and persistent splenic vein thrombosis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they developed tachypnea, tachycardia, and difficulty breathing at midnight, which improved with sedation and increased pressure support. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics since admission, including daptomycin, voriconazole, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Blood cultures were drawn, and a mini-BAL was performed, showing no microorganisms on gram stain. The patient is currently receiving nutrition through a pulmonary tube and is being managed for respiratory failure, electrolyte/fluid disorder, lymphoma, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of auto bone marrow transplantation (BMT), relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, significant ground glass opacities on CT scan, worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray (CXR), and fluid overload. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38째C (100.4째F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 132/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient's laboratory results show an increased white blood cell count (WBC) of 14,000 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 7.7 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) of 51,000 /uL. The patient's renal function tests reveal a serum creatinine (Cr) level of 0.9 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 34 mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 103 mEq/L. 

Imaging studies show significant worsening of bilateral ground-glass opacity and bibasilar consolidations with small bilateral pleural effusions compatible with widespread infectious process. There is also a small fluid collection inferior to the gastric body with a drain in the left upper quadrant. 

The patient's microbiology results indicate no microorganisms seen on gram stain from mini-balanced arterial line (BAL), and preliminary respiratory culture results are pending. 

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory failure: Significant ground glass opacities on CT scan. Improvement on CXR over yesterday with fluid balance even yesterday. Likely combination of infectious process, fluid overload (as lasix responsive in prior days).
   - Daily CXR
   - Continue dapto/zosyn/levaquin/vori
   - Decrease PEEP to 5, FiO2 to 40, if does not tolerate, continue to diurese
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   - Continue steroids

2. Abdominal pain/abdominal fluid collections: Pain improved today. Fluid collection on CT may be new and/or ineffectively draining with current drain. Difficult to assess possible"

   Imaging: CT Chest:
   1. Significant worsening of bilateral ground-glass opacity and
   bibasilar
   consolidations with small bilateral pleural effusions compatible with
   widespread infectious process, particularly given its acute onset and
   worsening since the exmination of [**2176-3-19**]. A component of
   failure/volume overload may also be present given the central
   ground-glass opacification.
   2. Small fluid collection inferior to the gastric body with drain in
   the left
   upper quadrant. It is difficult to assess whether the drain is within
   the
   collection or directly adjacent to it. However, given its location, it
   does
   not appear to be amenable to radiology image-guided drainage; and if
   clinically indicated, endoscopic aspiration may be considered.
   3. Persistent mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The
   retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy may be related to patient's lymphoma or
   be
   reactive in the setting of infection. Given close proximity to the
   nephrectomy bed with soft tissue concerning for RCC recurrence, renal
   cell carcinoma is also a consideration. Persistent linear enhancing
   focus among surgical clips in the left nephrectomy bed appear similar
   to outside examinations dating to 4/[**2175**].
   4. Small new liver lesions, concerning for lymphomatous involvement
   versus
   infection.
   5. Increased now moderate abdominal ascites.
   6. Persistent splenic vein thrombosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) 12 days ago. He presented with respiratory failure and has been diagnosed with a widespread infectious process, particularly given its acute onset and worsening since admission. The patient is neutropenic and asplenic with persistent fevers. He also has pancytopenia secondary to chemotherapy, metabolic acidosis, and abdominal fluid collections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with significant ground-glass opacities on CT scan. There is improvement on CXR over yesterday, but the patient is still likely to have a combination of an infectious process and fluid overload. Daily CXR should be continued, and efforts should be made to decrease PEEP and FiO2 as tolerated.
2. Abdominal pain and abdominal fluid collections: The patient has pain that has improved today, but there is a fluid collection on CT that may be new or ineffectively draining with the current drain. The fluid collection may be amenable to endoscopic drainage. Surgery recommendations should be followed up, and the final CT read should be discussed to assess the feasibility of endoscopic drainage of the fluid collection.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis likely due to contraction alkalosis from diuresis and the effect of steroids. Ly"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 yo male s/p auto BMT [**12-12**] with relapsed DLBCL d+22
   of nitrogen mustard therapy with persistent neutropenic and asplenic
   fevers (s/p splenectomy [**2176-2-20**]) and progressive respiratory failure.
   #. Respiratory failure.
   Did poorly on SBT yesterday, using significant accessory muscles to
   breath, look very uncomfortable off sedation on exam.
   RT attempted to wean to psv5/peep5 but became tachypneic with rr >38,hr
   >130 and c/o sob.
   Significant ground glass opacities on CT scan.  Chest x-ray worsened
   yesterday, focal infiltrates, no signs of fluid overload.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   worsening of lymphoma, with possible contribution of infectious process
   and some element of pulmonary edema.    If worsening lymphoma is the
   primary cause of his respiratory failure, he may not be able to be
   extubated.
   - daily CXR
   - continue dapto/zosyn/levaquin/voriconazole
   - increase pressure support, sedation to comfort
   - continue steroids in order to decrease inflammatory process; on
   methylprednisolone 40mg IV Q12h since yesterday
   - Goals of care discussion by BMT
   # Abdominal Pain/Abdominal Fluid Collections.
   Pain improved today?...
   Fluid collection on CT may be new and/or ineffectively draining with
   current drain.  Per CT read may be drainable endoscopically.  Difficult
   to assess possible infection as patient neutropenic and on steroids.
   Last culture from drain was VRE susceptible to daptomycin.
   - follow lactate
   - f/u surgery recs
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics.
   #Pancytopenia:
   Secondary to chemotherapy, improving, though still requiring frequent
   transfusions of platelets and PRBCs.  Given 1 U PRBC this am.
   - Trend [**Hospital1 7**] CBC.
   - Transfuse for HCT>21, PLTs > 10 per BMT recs.
   #.  DLBCL
   s/p nitrogen mustard with neutropenia.  Patient with refractory DLBCL.
   Now day +22 of nitrogen and counts are slowly recovering.  ANC 850
   - transfuse to Hct of 25, Plts > 10
   - continue neupogen
   - BMT following
   - daily CBC with diff/ anc
   #.  Fevers
   History of ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers.  Now only low grade
   temps of 99F.  VRE growing from JP drain at splenectomy site (though
   not clear if this is colonization of the drain).
   - empiric broad spectrum antibiotics given immunocompromised state,
   consider peeling back once ANC recovers.
   - ID following
   - f/u cultures
   #. Glycemic control.
   -          regular ISS given steroid use
   #. Goals of care
   Given apparent progression of lymphoma, difficulty weaning from vent,
   may need to readdress goals of care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of auto bone marrow transplant (BMT), relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and persistent neutropenic and asplenic fevers. The patient is currently experiencing progressive respiratory failure and has been intubated in the ICU.

The patient's respiratory distress and worsening chest X-ray indicate a possible worsening of lymphoma, which may contribute to respiratory failure. Ground glass opacities on the CT scan suggest an infectious process, while focal infiltrates on the chest X-ray may indicate pulmonary edema. The patient's condition is complicated by the fact that he may not be able to be extubated if worsening lymphoma is the primary cause of his respiratory failure.

The patient also has abdominal pain and fluid collections, with a culture from the drain showing vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) susceptible to daptomycin. The abdominal pain has improved today, and there may be a new or ineffectively draining fluid collection that could potentially be managed endoscopically. 

The patient has pancytopenia secondary to chemotherapy, but his counts are slowly recovering. He is still requiring frequent transfusions of platelets and packed red blood cells (PRBCs). 

The patient's fevers are currently low-grade and have been associated with ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers. The source of the fever is unclear, but VRE"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) 12/12 with refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). He has been experiencing persistent neutropenic and asplenic fevers, progressive respiratory failure, and pancytopenia. The patient's condition has worsened despite treatment, and he is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes a splenectomy performed on 02/20/2176.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, with worsening ground glass opacities on CT scan and focal infiltrates on chest x-ray. This suggests a possible infectious process contributing to his respiratory failure. There is also a possibility of pulmonary edema contributing to his respiratory distress.

2. Infectious complications: The patient has a history of ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers, indicating an increased risk for infections. The presence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) from the drain at the splenectomy site further supports the likelihood of an ongoing or recurrent infection.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is likely secondary to lymphoma and possibly the last chemotherapy round three weeks ago. It is essential to monitor the patient's blood counts closely and provide appropriate transfusions as per BMT recommendations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 yo male s/p auto BMT [**12-12**] with relapsed DLBCL d+22
   of nitrogen mustard therapy with persistent neutropenic and asplenic
   fevers (s/p splenectomy [**2176-2-20**]) and progressive respiratory failure.
   #. Respiratory failure.
   Did poorly on SBT yesterday, using significant accessory muscles to
   breath, look very uncomfortable off sedation on exam.
   RT attempted to wean to psv5/peep5 but became tachypneic with rr >38,hr
   >130 and c/o sob this AM.
   Significant ground glass opacities on CT scan.  Chest x-ray worsened
   yesterday, focal infiltrates, no signs of fluid overload.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   worsening of lymphoma, with possible contribution of infectious process
   and some element of pulmonary edema.    If worsening lymphoma is the
   primary cause of his respiratory failure, he may not be able to be
   extubated.  DCed levo and zosyn yesterday, per ID.
   - daily CXR
   - continue daptomycin day #10 , meropenem/gentamicin day#2 ,
   voriconazole
   - f/u gent trough [**4-1**] am
   - increase pressure support, sedation to comfort
   - continue steroids in order to decrease inflammatory process; on
   methylprednisolone 40mg IV Q12h since yesterday
 will decrease back to
   previous dose tomorrow AM
   - Goals of care discussion by BMT
   # Abdominal Pain/Abdominal Fluid Collections.
   Pain improved.  Fluid collection on CT likely not infectious.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   drainable but procedure in this patient would be risky for infection
   given neutropenia and steroids.  Last culture from drain was VRE
   susceptible to daptomycin.  Lactate within normal limits.
   - follow lactate
   - f/u surgery recs
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - goals of care discussion w primary oncologist Monday
   #Pancytopenia:
   Secondary likely to lymphoma and possibly last chemotherapy round three
   weeks ago. Improving, though still requiring frequent transfusions of
   platelets and PRBCs.
   - Trend [**Hospital1 7**] CBC.
   - Transfuse for HCT>21, PLTs > 10 per BMT recs.
   #.  DLBCL
   s/p nitrogen mustard with neutropenia.  Patient with refractory DLBCL.
   Now day +23 of nitrogen and counts are slowly recovering.  [**Doctor First Name 272**] Ct
   760.  Lymphoma present in bone marrow and elsewhere, likely has spread
   to lungs making extubation difficult.
   - transfuse to Hct of 25, Plts > 10
   - continue neupogen
   - BMT following
   - daily CBC with diff/ anc
   #.  Fevers
   History of ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers.   Low grade fevers
   persist.  VRE growing from JP drain at splenectomy site (though not
   clear if this is colonization of the drain).
   - empiric broad spectrum antibiotics given immunocompromised state,
   consider peeling back once ANC recovers >1000
   - ID following
   - f/u cultures
   #. Glycemic control.
   -          regular ISS given steroid use
   #. Goals of care
   Given apparent progression of lymphoma, difficulty weaning from vent,
   will need to readdress goals of care.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM:
   I have seen and examined the patient and concur with the note above by
   Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10501**].
   Mr [**Known lastname **] is alert but unable to tolerate the wean on the ventilator
   with easy tachypnea and diaphoresis on CPAP/ PSV of [**8-11**] cms
   I am concerned he will be unable to sustain spontaneous ventilation in
   the absence of clearing of infiltrates and O2 need.
   Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 21**] will speak with his wife regarding his wishes for prolonged
   heroic support.
   In the meantime, we will continue antibiotics and steroids and low
   level sedation as he continues to be assisted on the ventilator.
   Antibiotics per ID staff recs.

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of auto bone marrow transplant (BMT), relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and persistent neutropenic and asplenic fevers. He is currently in the ICU with progressive respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has worsening ground glass opacities on CT scan, with focal infiltrates seen on chest x-ray. There are no signs of fluid overload.
- The patient has a history of relapsed DLBCL, and the worsening lymphoma may contribute to his respiratory failure.
- The patient's pain has improved, but there is a fluid collection on CT that is likely not infectious. This fluid collection is drainable but poses a high risk for infection due to neutropenia and steroid use.
- The patient has pancytopenia, likely secondary to lymphoma and chemotherapy. His counts are slowly recovering, but he still requires frequent transfusions.
- The patient has ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers. A VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) was grown from the joint protection drain at the splenectomy site.
- The patient's glycemic control needs to be monitored due to steroid use.
- Goals of care discussion with the primary oncologist is planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to worsening lymphoma, infectious process, or pulmonary edema"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 yo male s/p auto BMT [**12-12**] with relapsed DLBCL d+24
   of nitrogen mustard therapy with persistent neutropenic and asplenic
   fevers (s/p splenectomy [**2176-2-20**]) and progressive respiratory failure.
   #. Respiratory failure.
   Did poorly on SBT yesterday, using significant accessory muscles to
   breath, look very uncomfortable off sedation on exam.
   RT attempted to wean to psv5/peep5 but became tachypneic with rr >38,hr
   >130 and c/o sob this AM.
   Significant ground glass opacities on CT scan.  Chest x-ray worsened
   yesterday, focal infiltrates, no signs of fluid overload.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   worsening of lymphoma, with possible contribution of infectious process
   and some element of pulmonary edema.    If worsening lymphoma is the
   primary cause of his respiratory failure, he may not be able to be
   extubated.  DCed levo and zosyn yesterday, per ID.
   - daily CXR
   - continue vancomycin day #1 = [**2176-3-31**], meropenem day#1= [**2176-3-30**] ,
   voriconazole [**2176-3-16**]
   - increase pressure support, sedation to comfort
   - continue steroids per BMT recs in order to decrease inflammatory
   process; on methylprednisolone 40mg IV Q12h
   - Goals of care discussion by BMT
   # Abdominal Pain/Abdominal Fluid Collections.
   Pain improved.  Fluid collection on CT likely not infectious.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   drainable but procedure in this patient would be risky for infection
   given neutropenia and steroids.  Last culture from drain was VRE
   susceptible to daptomycin.  Lactate within normal limits.
   - f/u surgery recs
   - d/ced daptomycin per ID recs
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - goals of care discussion with primary oncologist Monday
   # Pancytopenia:
   Secondary likely to lymphoma and possibly last chemotherapy round three
   weeks ago. Improving, though still requiring frequent transfusions of
   platelets and PRBCs.
   - Trend [**Hospital1 7**] CBC.
   - Transfuse for HCT>21, PLTs > 10 per BMT recs.
   #.  DLBCL
   s/p nitrogen mustard with neutropenia.  Patient with refractory DLBCL.
   Now day +24 of nitrogen and counts are slowly recovering.  Gran Ct
   1550.  Lymphoma present in bone marrow and elsewhere, likely has spread
   to lungs making extubation difficult.
   - transfuse to Hct of 25, Plts > 10
   - continue neupogen
   - BMT following
   - daily CBC with diff/ anc
   #.  Fevers
   History of ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers.   Low grade fevers
   persist.  VRE growing from JP drain at splenectomy site (though not
   clear if this is colonization of the drain).  GPCs growing from last
   sputum cx.
   - empiric broad spectrum antibiotics given immunocompromised state,
   consider peeling back once ANC recovers >1000
   - ID following
   - f/u cultures
   #. Glycemic control.
   - regular ISS given steroid use
   #. Goals of care
   - given apparent progression of lymphoma, difficulty weaning from vent,
   will need to readdress goals of care.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of autologous bone marrow transplantation (auto BMT) and relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The patient has been experiencing persistent neutropenic and asplenic fevers, progressive respiratory failure, and refractory DLBCL.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as they are intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The chest X-ray shows worsening findings consistent with a possible worsening of lymphoma, pulmonary edema, and an infectious process. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem, and has been switched from daptomycin to Vanc due to better pulmonary coverage. The patient's blood cultures have grown gram-positive cocci in pairs/clusters, and the sputum culture is negative for Pneumocystis jirovecii.

The patient's abdominal pain has improved, but there is a fluid collection on CT that is likely not infectious. The patient has pancytopenia secondary to lymphoma and chemotherapy, requiring frequent transfusions of platelets and packed red blood cells (PRBCs).

The patient's goals of care discussion will be addressed by the BMT team, taking into consideration the apparent progression of lymphoma and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

Overall, the patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, fevers, pancytopenia, abdominal pain/fluid collections"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 yo male s/p auto BMT [**12-12**] with relapsed DLBCL d+24
   of nitrogen mustard therapy with persistent neutropenic and asplenic
   fevers (s/p splenectomy [**2176-2-20**]) and progressive respiratory failure.
   #. Respiratory failure.
   Did poorly on SBT yesterday, using significant accessory muscles to
   breath, look very uncomfortable off sedation on exam.
   RT attempted to wean to psv5/peep5 but became tachypneic with rr >38,hr
   >130 and c/o sob this AM.
   Significant ground glass opacities on CT scan.  Chest x-ray worsened
   yesterday, focal infiltrates, no signs of fluid overload.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   worsening of lymphoma, with possible contribution of infectious process
   and some element of pulmonary edema.    If worsening lymphoma is the
   primary cause of his respiratory failure, he may not be able to be
   extubated.  DCed levo and zosyn yesterday, per ID.
   - daily CXR
   - continue vancomycin day #1 = [**2176-3-31**], meropenem day#1= [**2176-3-30**] ,
   voriconazole [**2176-3-16**]
   - increase pressure support, sedation to comfort
   - continue steroids per BMT recs in order to decrease inflammatory
   process; on methylprednisolone 40mg IV Q12h
   - Goals of care discussion by BMT
   # Abdominal Pain/Abdominal Fluid Collections.
   Pain improved.  Fluid collection on CT likely not infectious.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   drainable but procedure in this patient would be risky for infection
   given neutropenia and steroids.  Last culture from drain was VRE
   susceptible to daptomycin.  Lactate within normal limits.
   - f/u surgery recs
   - d/ced daptomycin per ID recs
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - goals of care discussion with primary oncologist Monday
   # Pancytopenia:
   Secondary likely to lymphoma and possibly last chemotherapy round three
   weeks ago. Improving, though still requiring frequent transfusions of
   platelets and PRBCs.
   - Trend [**Hospital1 7**] CBC.
   - Transfuse for HCT>21, PLTs > 10 per BMT recs.
   #.  DLBCL
   s/p nitrogen mustard with neutropenia.  Patient with refractory DLBCL.
   Now day +24 of nitrogen and counts are slowly recovering.  Gran Ct
   1550.  Lymphoma present in bone marrow and elsewhere, likely has spread
   to lungs making extubation difficult.
   - transfuse to Hct of 25, Plts > 10
   - continue neupogen
   - BMT following
   - daily CBC with diff/ anc
   #.  Fevers
   History of ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers.   Low grade fevers
   persist.  VRE growing from JP drain at splenectomy site (though not
   clear if this is colonization of the drain).  GPCs growing from last
   sputum cx.
   - empiric broad spectrum antibiotics given immunocompromised state,
   consider peeling back once ANC recovers >1000
   - ID following
   - f/u cultures
   #. Glycemic control.
   - regular ISS given steroid use
   #. Goals of care
   - given apparent progression of lymphoma, difficulty weaning from vent,
   will need to readdress goals of care.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) 12/12 and has relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). He is currently day +24 of nitrogen mustard therapy and is experiencing persistent neutropenic and asplenic fevers, progressive respiratory failure, and pancytopenia. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Imaging studies show ground glass opacities on CT scan and focal infiltrates on chest x-ray. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening respiratory status suggests potential respiratory failure. The ground glass opacities on CT scan and focal infiltrates on chest x-ray indicate possible pulmonary involvement, which could be due to infectious processes, worsening lymphoma, or pulmonary edema. If the primary cause is worsening lymphoma, it may not be possible to extubate the patient.

2. Infections: The patient has ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers, indicating an increased risk of infections. The presence of GPCs in the sputum culture suggests a possible bacterial infection. Additionally, VRE was found in the drain from the splenectomy site. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but further evaluation and management are needed given the immunocompromised state of the patient.

3. Abdominal Pain/Fluid Collections: The patient has abdominal pain and fluid collections"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 60-year-old male who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (auto BMT) 12 days ago due to relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). He received nitrogen mustard therapy but continues to be neutropenic and asplenic with persistent fevers. The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, and he is now on mechanical ventilation (CPAP/PSV mode) with significant ground glass opacities on the CT scan. The chest x-ray also shows worsening infiltrates. There are no signs of fluid overload. 

The patient's abdominal pain has improved, but there is a fluid collection on CT that is likely not infectious. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to neutropenia. His pancytopenia is secondary to lymphoma and possibly the last chemotherapy round. He is requiring frequent transfusions of platelets and packed red blood cells (PRBCs). 

The patient's lymphoma is refractory, and his counts are slowly recovering after nitrogen mustard therapy. His lymphoma is present in the bone marrow and elsewhere, and there is evidence of spread to the lungs, making extubation difficult. 

The patient has a history of ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers. There is also growth of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) from the joint puncture drain at the splenectomy site. 

The patient's glycemic control is a concern due to steroid use. 

The patient's goals of care need to be readdressed considering the apparent progression of lymphoma and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and he is already on mechanical ventilation. The ground glass opacities on the CT scan and worsening infiltrates on the chest x-ray indicate possible pulmonary edema or worsening lymphoma involvement in the lungs. If the lymphoma is the primary cause of respiratory failure, the patient may not be able to be extubated.

2. Infection: The patient is neutropenic and asplenic, increasing the risk of infections. The presence of ongoing fevers and growth of VRE from the joint puncture drain at the splenectomy site suggests an ongoing infectious process.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is secondary to lymphoma and possibly the last chemotherapy round. This increases the risk of bleeding and infection due to low levels of platelets, white blood cells, and red blood cells.

4. Abdominal pain and fluid collections: Although the patient's abdominal pain has improved, there is a fluid collection on CT that is likely not infectious. However, the risk of infection is still present due to the patient's immunocompromised state.

5. DLBCL progression: The patient's lymphoma is refractory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of lymphoma, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He has been receiving mechanical ventilation and is on multiple antibiotics due to concerns of sepsis. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. Fluid balance reveals a net intake of 3,131 mL and output of 3,545 mL with a negative balance of -414 mL. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 197. His lab results show leukopenia with a WBC count of 1.3 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 11 k. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is acute respiratory failure, which may lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, indicating the need for close monitoring and potential correction to avoid complications related to electrolyte imbalances.
3. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis, which can progress to septic shock and organ dysfunction if not promptly treated.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 yo male s/p auto BMT [**12-12**] with relapsed DLBCL d+25
   of nitrogen mustard therapy with persistent neutropenic and asplenic
   fevers (s/p splenectomy [**2176-2-20**]) and progressive respiratory failure.
   #. Respiratory failure.
   Did poorly on SBT yesterday, using significant accessory muscles to
   breath, look very uncomfortable off sedation on exam.
   RT attempted to wean to psv5/peep5 but became tachypneic with rr >38,hr
   >130 and c/o sob this AM.
   Significant ground glass opacities on CT scan.  Chest x-ray worsened
   yesterday, focal infiltrates, no signs of fluid overload.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   worsening of lymphoma, with possible contribution of infectious process
   and some element of pulmonary edema.    If worsening lymphoma is the
   primary cause of his respiratory failure, he may not be able to be
   extubated.  DCed levo and zosyn yesterday, per ID.
   - daily CXR
   - continue vancomycin day #1 = [**2176-3-31**], meropenem day#1= [**2176-3-30**] ,
   voriconazole #[**2176-3-16**]
   - increase pressure support, sedation to comfort
   - continue steroids per BMT recs in order to decrease inflammatory
   process; on methylprednisolone 40mg IV Q12h
   - Goals of care discussion by BMT
   # Abdominal Pain/Abdominal Fluid Collections.
   Pain improved.  Fluid collection on CT likely not infectious.  [**Month (only) 51**] be
   drainable but procedure in this patient would be risky for infection
   given neutropenia and steroids.  Last culture from drain was VRE
   susceptible to daptomycin.  Lactate within normal limits.
   - f/u surgery recs
   - d/ced daptomycin per ID recs
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - goals of care discussion with primary oncologist Monday
   # Pancytopenia:
   Secondary likely to lymphoma and possibly last chemotherapy round three
   weeks ago. Improving, though still requiring frequent transfusions of
   platelets and PRBCs.
   - Trend [**Hospital1 7**] CBC.
   - Transfuse for HCT>21, PLTs > 10 per BMT recs.
   #.  DLBCL
   s/p nitrogen mustard with neutropenia.  Patient with refractory DLBCL.
   Now day +24 of nitrogen and counts are slowly recovering.  Gran Ct
   1550.  Lymphoma present in bone marrow and elsewhere, likely has spread
   to lungs making extubation difficult.
   - transfuse to Hct of 25, Plts > 10
   - continue neupogen
   - BMT following
   - daily CBC with diff/ anc
   #.  Fevers
   History of ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers.   Low grade fevers
   persist.  VRE growing from JP drain at splenectomy site (though not
   clear if this is colonization of the drain).  GPCs growing from last
   sputum cx.
   - empiric broad spectrum antibiotics given immunocompromised state,
   consider peeling back once ANC recovers >1000
   - ID following
   - f/u cultures
   #. Glycemic control.
   - regular ISS given steroid use
   #. Goals of care
   - given apparent progression of lymphoma, difficulty weaning from vent,
   will need to readdress goals of care.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 60-year-old male who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (auto BMT) 12 months ago and is currently experiencing a relapse of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The patient has been treated with nitrogen mustard therapy but continues to have persistent neutropenic and asplenic fevers. He also has progressive respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever of 102.4째F, with a maximum temperature of 39.1째C and a current temperature of 38.1째C. His heart rate is elevated at 116 bpm, blood pressure is low at 104/60 mmHg, respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell count ranging from 1.5 to 1.8 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with platelet counts between 11 and 42 K/uL, and elevated creatinine levels at 0.7 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate possible infection and inflammation.

The patient's imaging studies reveal ground glass opacities on the CT scan, which could be consistent with pulmonary involvement of lymphoma"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who has undergone an autologous bone marrow transplant (auto BMT) and received nitrogen mustard therapy. The patient presents with persistent neutropenic and asplenic fevers, progressive respiratory failure, and pancytopenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has shown worsening respiratory function, evidenced by ground glass opacities on CT scan and focal infiltrates on chest x-ray. This suggests possible pulmonary edema or worsening lymphoma contributing to respiratory failure.

2. Infection: The patient has persistent fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, indicating a potential ongoing infection. The presence of VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci) and GPCs (Gram-positive cocci) in cultures suggests a resistant infection that may require tailored antibiotic treatment.

3. Abdominal pain and fluid collections: The patient has abdominal pain, and a CT scan reveals fluid collection, which is likely not infectious. However, due to neutropenia and steroid use, any invasive procedure to drain the fluid carries a high risk of infection.

4. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which is likely secondary to lymphoma and recent chemotherapy. This condition requires frequent transfusions of platelets and packed red blood cells (PR"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) 12/12 for relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). He is currently day +26 post nitrogen mustard therapy and has persistent neutropenic and asplenic fevers. The patient also has progressive respiratory failure, with worsening lymphoma possibly contributing to the respiratory failure. He has focal infiltrates on chest x-ray and ground glass opacities on CT scan, suggesting an infectious process and possible pulmonary edema. The patient's pancytopenia is secondary to lymphoma and chemotherapy, requiring frequent transfusions. His fevers are ongoing and low-grade, with VRE growing from the JP drain at the splenectomy site. GPCs are growing from the last sputum culture. The patient's glycemic control is being managed with regular insulin subcutaneous injections (ISS). There is a need for a goals of care discussion given the apparent progression of lymphoma and difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is worsening, making extubation difficult. The presence of ground glass opacities on CT scan suggests an infectious process or pulmonary edema.
2. Infection: The patient has ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers, with VRE growing from the JP drain at the splenectomy site and GPC"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) 12 days ago due to relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). He is currently experiencing persistent neutropenic and asplenic fevers, progressive respiratory failure, and pancytopenia. The patient also has abdominal pain and fluid collections, which are not likely infectious. The patient's DLBCL is refractory, and there is evidence of lymphoma spread to the lungs, making extubation difficult. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to worsening lymphoma, infectious process, and possible pulmonary edema. If the primary cause is worsening lymphoma, the patient may not be able to be extubated.
2. Infections: The patient has ongoing neutropenic and asplenic fevers, and cultures have grown VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus) from the JP drain at the splenectomy site and GPCs (Gram-positive cocci) from the sputum culture. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being given, and the ID (infectious disease) team is following up.
3. Abdominal Pain/Fluid Collections: The patient's abdominal pain has improved, but there are fluid collections on CT scan that are likely not infectious. These collections may be drainable, but the procedure carries a risk of infection due to neut"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male who underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) 12/12 for relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and has been experiencing persistent neutropenic and asplenic fevers, progressive respiratory failure, pancytopenia, and refractory DLBCL. The patient's condition is complicated by several potential medical complications.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The cause of respiratory failure is multifactorial, including worsening lymphoma, infectious process, and possible pulmonary edema. There are focal infiltrates seen on chest x-ray, but no signs of fluid overload. Daily chest x-rays will be continued to monitor the patient's respiratory status. The decision to extubate the patient will depend on the underlying cause of respiratory failure.

2. Abdominal Pain/Abdominal Fluid Collections: The patient has abdominal pain and fluid collections, which are likely related to his underlying lymphoma. The fluid collection is not infectious, but it is not drainable due to the patient's neutropenia and steroid use. Surgery recommendations will be followed up for further management.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which is secondary to lymphoma and possibly the last chemotherapy round three weeks ago. The patient's blood counts are dropping despite initial"
