","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of increasing abdominal distention. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and received bolus IV fluids, antibiotics, and other medications. An EEG was performed but the results are pending. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/74 mmHg to 157/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 48 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 17 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.36, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 353, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 55.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increasing abdominal distention likely related to severe constipation and possible fecal impaction.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions and left greater than right airspace consolidation, likely atelectasis.
3. Medullary and caliceal calcifications involving atrophic and scarred kidneys bilaterally, suggestive of underlying medullary nephrocalcinosis.
4. Gluteal, pelvic, and psoas musculature wasting as well as multiple decubitus ulcerations extending to the bony surfaces. Regions of sclerosis are noted within the adjacent upper sacrum and right ischial tuberosity which likely reflect changes from subacute or chronic osteomyelitis. Acute osteomyelitis cannot be completely excluded and should be correlated with clinical exam.

Please note that the potential medical complications mentioned above are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and correlation with clinical findings are necessary to confirm these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 54 yr old C6 paraplegic with suprapubic catheter, recurrent
   UTI, hx of pseudoseizures presenting with episode of non responsiveness
   now resolved, and concern for urosepsis.
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient with increasing oxygen
   requirement, found to be hypoxic upon transfer to the floor.  Initial
   ABG 7.26/86/81, at which point MICU consult was obtained.  Upon initial
   MICU evaluation, patient was minimally responsive to sternal rub with
   ABG 7.27/86/50.  Intubation on floor as above.  ABG consistent with
   acute on chronic respiratory acidosis.  Chronicity likely [**3-7**] to
   ?COPD/emphysema from 1ppd with poor mechanical reserve [**3-7**]
   quadriplegia.  Worsening could be [**3-7**] occult infection with elevated
   lactate, distended abdomen.  R leg erythematous, warm.  Given Lovenox
   on floor for ?DVT.   Note, patient ate sandwhich prior to intubation,
   so continued concern for aspiration event.  Ddimer 729.
   - Continue AC ventilation, fentanyl / versed sedation
   - Chlorhexidate
   - HOB elevation
   - RSBI daily with SBT when indicated
   - CXR upon arrival for ET placement/NGT placement
   - ABG on vent
   - Outside records RE:PMH with pulmonary disease / quadraplegia
   - LENI to r/o DVT R leg
   #Episode of unresponsiveness: Resolved upon ED presentation and initial
   arrival to floor.  Alert and oriented x 3 talking fluently. Then with
   respiratory failure as above.  Unclear whether related to infection
   potential urosepsis, related to psychiatric illness, over sedation with
   medications. Hx of pseudoseizures as per limited Pmhx, allergies to
   dilantin and tegretol. Medication related a possibility given
   amitry/baclofen/oxycodone/risperdal/ativan. Rapidly changing
   ventilatory status as above.  Now appears unresponsive may have been
   worsening hypercarbia.  Ddimer 729.

   - Flagyl for potential GI source
   - telemetry
   - seizure precautions
   - aspiration precautions
   - f/u urine cx, blood cx
   - Continue mechanical ventilation as above
   # Hyperlactatemia: With multiple possible sources as above.  Did have
   some interval improvement on repeat.  Likely [**3-7**] infection vs poor
   perfusion and hypoxia.  Another potential source is bowel ischemia
   given distension.  Prior to intubation, however, patient reportedly
   denied any TTP, no bloody rectal output.  Cannot CTA given contrast
   allergy
   - Antibiotics as above
   - Culture as above
   # Abdominal distension: Unclear etiology.  Is quadraplegic and with
   multiple bowel meds, likely has some underlying poor motility.  Also
   with C.dif and reportedly had decreased stool output for several days,
   concerning for constipating C.diff.  Lastly, s/p intubation and bag
   mask ventilation with possible gas trapping.  Lastly, given lactate,
   some concern for ischemia as above, but no h/o of vasculopathy.  Does
   have AAA, so could have dissection, but would suspect it to be more
   painful upon presentation.
   - Culture as above
   - Send C.diff x 3
   - CT abdomen with po contrast via NGT.
   # Acidosis: As above. Concern for chronic respiratory acidosis with
   compensatory elevated bicarbonate, now with acute decompensation.
   - Ventilation
   - Goal to extubate
   - Obtain outside records to assess underlying etiology
   # ? Positive UA- Given indwelling suprapubic catheter, could represent
   colonization vs true pathogen.
   - Follow-up urine culture
   - Wound care/change suprapubic catheter
   - antibiotics as above
   # C6 quad: Holding meds for spacticity given sedation.
   - Restart outpatient medications as status improves
   # LE swelling and erythema: Right leg with BKA.  Upon presentation with
   potential cellulitis, no evidence of necrotizing fascitis.  Per report
   prior to transfer to the ICU, his RLE was not painful and was with
   normal sensation. Given swelling and hypoxia, will obtain LENI.
   -Vanc/zosyn for cellulitis

   - Obtain VA/PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1528**]
   # Anemia: unknown baseline to 36. No active bleeding on initial exam
   per report.  Given Lovenox upon arrival to the floor given concern for
   DVT in RLE and unable to obtain CTA.  Difficulty intubation.  Now with
   bloody secretions being suctioned from airway.  Also with known AAA.
   Repeat HCT upon arrival to floor  30.9 in setting of IV resuscitation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of C6 paraplegia, recurrent UTIs, and pseudoseizures. He presented with an episode of non-responsiveness, concern for urosepsis, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and possible DVT. The patient has multiple medical complications including abdominal distention, small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right airspace consolidation, medullary and caliceal calcifications in the kidneys, gluteal, pelvic, and psoas musculature wasting, and decubitus ulcerations. The patient also has anemia, hyperglycemia, and a history of AAA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Increasing abdominal distention: The patient's abdominal distention is likely related to severe constipation and possible fecal impaction. There are no CT findings to suggest ischemia.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions and left greater than right airspace consolidation: These findings are likely due to atelectasis.
3. Medullary and caliceal calcifications in the kidneys: This suggests underlying medullary nephrocalcinosis. Bilateral hypoattenuating renal lesions are likely benign cysts.
4. Gluteal, pelvic, and psoas musculature wasting as well as multiple decubitus ulcerations: These findings indicate chronic pressure ulcers.
5. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has worsening hypercarbia, which may"

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis,clinically  improved.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- good progress. Underlying COPD, receiving good
   regimen.  Taper steroids once extubated.
   SEPSIS -- good response to current managment.  Thigh and scrotal
   erythema improved.  With GPC bacteremia likely cellulitis as source,
   although also consider UTI, indwelling hardware.  Continue empirical
   antimicrobials.
   UTI -- may or may not be etiology of sepsis.  With fecal contamination
   or urine, may be contaminant, but consider [**Last Name (un) **]-vesicular fistula.
   Repeat U/A and culture.
   FLUIDS -- replete.  Monitor I/O, maintain balance.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO until extubated.
   QUADRAPLEGIA -- no new problems.  Continue current care.
   POSSIBLE OSTEOmyelitis -- identified by CT scan.   [**Month (only) 11**] be resolving
   infection, but need to confirm evaluation to date by recent records.
   [**Month (only) 11**] need dedicated Spine CT or MRI. Deep-seeded osteo may be source of
   seeding of cellulitis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They are tolerating intermittent passive spontaneous breathing mode with a decreasing level of support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with normal heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient has a history of underlying COPD and is receiving appropriate treatment. They show signs of improvement from sepsis, with improved thigh and scrotal erythema. Empirical antimicrobials are being continued. The patient may or may not have a urinary tract infection, which could potentially be a source of sepsis. Fluid balance is replete, and nutritional support is planned after extubation. The patient has quadriplegia and is being managed accordingly. There are concerns about possible osteomyelitis, and further evaluation with dedicated spine imaging is needed. The patient's code status is full code, and they are expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given that the patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, and monitoring of respiratory system compliance and incentive spirometry (RSBI) are being implemented to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Critically ill patients have an increased"

   continue vanc for total of 14 days; if cultures are negative, treat for
   7 day course for cellulitis.
   # Sepsis. Pt now afebrile without leukocytosis. Sources include urine
   (although first UCx appeared potentially fecally contaminated; 2^nd UCx
   pending with +UA for UTI), cellulitis, PNA, osteomyelitis.
 GPCs with
   Coag-Neg Staph in BCx of 1 bottle; surveillance BCx pending.
   Hyperlactemia resolved. Cellulitis resolving.
   -          Surveillance blood cultures pending
   -          Cont Vanc for Coag Neg Staph/ [**Last Name (un) 1540**] 500mg IV q6 for potential
   ESBL Ecoli UTI (given pt has hx of resistant ESBL UTIs). Wait for UCx
   for possible ESBL EColi UTI vs Coag neg staph vs enterococcus.
   -          Will obtain MRI of L spine/pelvis w/o contrast to evaluate
   for Osteomyelitis, enterosacral fistula.
   #h/o sacral decubitus ulcer: Chronic, 6mo long issue. Denies pain
   although sensation questionable considering quadraplegia. CT shows
   multiple decubital ulcers extending to bony surfaces with
   ?subacute/chronic OM. ?re possibility of uro-enteric fistula
   considering fecal contamination in original urine sample.
   -          MRI of pelvis/L spine
   # Abdominal distension: Slightly decreased after CT abdomen showed FOS.
   Multiple BMs over past 24hrs.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of C6 quadriplegia, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pseudoseizures, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and sepsis. He has been admitted to the ICU with acute hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient was extubated without any issues over the past 24 hours. His mental status has improved, and he is currently on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen with a mid-high 90s saturation. The etiology of his respiratory failure includes a COPD flare, pneumonia, and abdominal distension. A lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENI) was negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's respiratory status has improved with the resolution of constipation and abdominal distension. He is being weaned off Flagyl. Steroids have been continued for a COPD flare with a fast taper. Vancomycin has been started at 1 gram intravenous every 12 hours for gram-positive cocci/coagulase-negative Staphylococcus in blood culture, and surveillance blood cultures are pending. If follow-up cultures suggest bacteremia, vancomycin will be continued for a total of 14 days; if cultures are negative, treatment will be for 7 days for cellulitis. The patient remains afebrile without leukocytosis. Sources of sepsis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of C6 quadriplegia, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pseudoseizures, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and sepsis. The patient was recently extubated without any issues and is currently on 4LNC with an oxygen saturation level of mid-high 90s. The etiology of acute hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure is suspected to be COPD flare, pneumonia, or abdominal distension. The patient's mental status has improved significantly. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Hypoxic Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status needs to be closely monitored for improvement. Resolution of constipation and abdominal distension may aid in the improvement of respiratory status.

2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs, including ESBL-producing E. coli. There is a possibility of an ongoing UTI, especially considering the presence of leukocytosis and positive urine analysis for white blood cells. Surveillance blood cultures are pending to determine the appropriate antibiotic treatment.

3. Cellulitis: The patient's cellulitis is resolving, but it still requires close monitoring. 

4. Osteomyelitis: An MRI of the L spine/pelvis without contrast will be obtained to evaluate for osteomyelitis. 

5. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of C6 quadriplegia, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pseudoseizures, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and sepsis. The patient was previously intubated but has now been extubated without any issues. His mental status has improved, and he is on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

The patient's respiratory status is improving with the resolution of constipation and abdominal distension. He is currently being treated for an acute hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, possibly due to a COPD flare, pneumonia, or abdominal distension.

The patient has several medical complications, including sepsis, which may be caused by multiple sources such as urine, cellulitis, pneumonia, and osteomyelitis. He also has chronic pressure ulcers and a possible uro-enteric fistula. His renal function has improved, but he still has anemia and electrolyte imbalances that need to be managed.

The patient's psychiatric history includes paranoid schizophrenia, and he is currently on risperidone, trazodone, and amitriptyline. His nutritional status is being monitored, and he is receiving a bowel regimen to manage abdominal distension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing signs of sepsis, with potential sources including urine, cellulitis, pneumonia, and osteomyelitis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of quadriplegia, suprapubic catheter, recurrent UTIs, pseudoseizures, and COPD. He presented with acute hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient has been extubated without issue, and his mental status has improved. He is currently on 4LNC with mid-high 90s oxygen saturation. The etiology of respiratory failure is uncertain, possibly due to a COPD flare or pneumonia. 

The patient's sepsis is now resolved, and he is afebrile without leukocytosis. Potential sources of infection include the urinary tract, cellulitis, pneumonia, and osteomyelitis. Surveillance blood cultures have been obtained, and the patient will undergo further evaluation for cellulitis and consider an L-spine evaluation for osteomyelitis.

Other issues include sacral decubitus, abdominal distension which has improved slightly, anemia with a Hct of 29.7, and renal failure with an improved creatinine level of 0.9. The patient's psychiatric history is noted, and his medications have been adjusted accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, and there is a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs, and"

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of C6 quadriplegia, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), pseudoseizures, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and sepsis. The patient was intubated due to acute hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure but has now been extubated without any issues. The patient's mental status has improved, and he is currently on 4 liters per minute nasal cannula oxygen with a mid-high 90s saturation.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. These include acute hypoxic hypercarbic respiratory failure, sepsis, COPD flare, sacral decubitus ulcer, abdominal distension, renal failure, anemia, psychiatric history, and potential osteomyelitis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute Hypoxic Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient is extubated and on 4 liters per minute nasal cannula oxygen with a mid-high 90s saturation. The etiology includes COPD flare vs pneumonia, and the patient's respiratory status is improving with resolution of constipation and abdominal distension.
   - Continue steroids for COPD flare with a fast taper.
