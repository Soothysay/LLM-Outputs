","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diabetes mellitus (DM), possible coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN). She presents with altered mental status and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been unable to tolerate additional peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines. There are concerns about potential medical complications such as infection or toxic processes, but currently, there is no evidence to support these concerns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to her compromised immune system and prolonged stay in the ICU. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in vital signs, should be performed.
2. Renal Failure: The patient already has acute renal failure on top of her chronic renal failure. It is crucial to continue monitoring renal function and provide appropriate renal support, including hemodialysis (HD) as planned.
3. Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis likely due to ARF. Close monitoring of acid-base balance and appropriate management with fluid hydration and HD are necessary.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobilization and other risk factors. Prophylactic measures, such as low molecular weight heparin, should be continued to prevent DVT.
5. Wound Infections"

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diabetes mellitus (DM), possible coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN) who presents with altered mental status and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 176/76 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with BiPAP and supplemental oxygen.

Physical examination reveals obesity, loud snoring, pinpoint pupils, and wide neck. The neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy or jugular venous distention. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rhythm, normal heart sounds, and good air movement bilaterally. The abdomen is soft with no tenderness or organomegaly. Extremities are warm and well perfused with full and symmetric pulses, but the patient's legs are bandaged. Neurological examination shows oriented to name only, downgoing toes bilaterally, and 2+ patellar reflexes.

Laboratory results indicate elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 280 K/uL, creatinine at 10.6 mg/dL, and potassium at 5.6 mEq/L. Other lab values include leukocyte count of 12.0 K/uL, hematocrit of 31.7%, platelet count of 299 K"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 y/o female w/ hx of CVA, DM, ? CAD, and HTN who presents w/ altered
   mental status and ARF.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Ddx includes uremia secondary to ARF versus
   toxin ingestion (i.e., narcotics). Currently no evidence to suggest
   infection, hypoglycemia.
   - MS appears to be improving; could consider Narcan PRN
   - hold all sedating meds
   - check CXR
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Wide differential, including
   pre-renal, renal and renal etiologies. Pt may be pre-renal if she was
   taking poor POs for some period of time. Appears to be making
   reasonable urine outpt, thus obstruction is less likely but still
   possible.
   - appreciate renal input
   - check FeNa; consider emperic volume repletion with NS in interim
   - consider PO bicarb
   - abd/pelvis CT scan in AM
   - renally dose all meds; avoid nephrotoxins; exchange atenolol for
   metoprolol and hold Topamax as these are renally cleared
   .
   # AG acidosis: [**Month (only) 60**] be seen in the setting of ARF. Delta/delta ratio is
   <1. No evidence to support other cause such as lactic acidosis,
   ketoacidosis or toxin ingestion.
   - fluid hydration as above; could consider bicarb administration if
   worsening acidosis
   - repeat labs in AM and trend change
   .
   # LE wounds/PG: Will touch base with pt
s [**Hospital1 183**] dermatologist. Wound care
   consult.
   .
   # DM: Continue pt's home insulin (decrease dose slightly) with ISS.
   .
   # CAD: Continue home ASA; transition atenolol to metoprolol.
   .
   # HTN: Metoprolol as above. Hold CCB until pt's clinical direction more
   clear.
   .
   # GERD: PPI

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diabetes mellitus (DM), possible coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN). She presents with altered mental status and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 176/76 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on BiPAP with a FiO2 of 40%. Her temperature is slightly below normal at 36.3 degrees Celsius.

The patient is obese and has pinpoint pupils, a wide neck, and snoring loudly. Her neck is supple without any lymphadenopathy or jugular venous distention. She has regular heart sounds with a normal S1-S2 interval, but there is a 4/6 systolic ejection murmur heard. Her lungs are clear with good air movement bilaterally. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no organomegaly or bruits appreciated. Her extremities are warm and well perfused with full and symmetric distal pulses, and there is no pedal edema. Neurological examination reveals that she is not cooperative, has pinpoint pupils, and downgoing toes bilaterally.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count"

   rounds. He felt strongly that since she had received more fluid
   overnight we should check stat repeat Cr now and if worse proceed with
   HD but if sig better hold off another 24 hrs. We discussed that she is
   quite acidotic with limited respiratory reserve and consistently high
   K.  Going to IR for line place,emt today

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of CVA, DM, possible CAD, and hypertension who presents with altered mental status and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's altered mental status is suspected to be secondary to uremia from ARF. There is no evidence of infection or toxic process. The patient's renal function is slowly improving, and it is planned to defer hemodialysis (HD) for now.

The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with worsening of underlying poor renal function likely due to pre-renal azotemia. Despite making adequate urine, the patient's renal failure is not improving. Renal input is appreciated, and HD is being deferred at the present time. Volume repletion as needed, an abdominal/pelvic scan without evidence of obstruction, and dosing all medications based on renal function while avoiding nephrotoxins are planned.

The patient has metabolic acidosis, which has much improved and is thought to be due to ARF. No other cause such as lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, or toxin ingestion is evident. Fluid hydration will be held at present, allowing the patient to drink to thirst. Trends will continue, and there are currently no plans for HD as described above.

The patient also has lower extremity wounds and peripheral neuropathy, for which a wound care consult is appreciated. Monitoring will continue. The patient's diabetes mellitus will be managed by continuing home insulin (decreasing the dose"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diabetes mellitus (DM), possible coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN). She presents with altered mental status and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including altered mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, metabolic acidosis (AG acidosis), lower extremity wounds/pressure ulcers (LE wounds/PG), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension (HTN).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to uremia from ARF. It is crucial to continue monitoring her mental status and provide appropriate care to prevent further deterioration.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's underlying poor renal function has worsened, likely due to pre-renal azotemia. Close monitoring of renal function and initiating appropriate renal support, such as hemodialysis (HD), is essential to prevent further complications.
3. Metabolic Acidosis (AG Acidosis): The patient has AG acidosis, which is thought to be due to ARF. It is important to manage fluid hydration and plan for HD to correct the acidosis.
4. Lower Extremity Wounds/Pressure Ulcers (LE wounds/PG): The patient has pressure ulcers, which require wound care management. Consulting with"

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of CVA (cerebrovascular accident), DM (diabetes mellitus), and CRI (chronic renal insufficiency) presenting with acute on chronic renal failure. She is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

From the progress note, it is summarized that the patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 180/89 to 200/124 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on BIPAP (bi-level positive airway pressure) support. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's renal function has shown some improvement, as indicated by decreasing creatinine and BUN levels. However, she still requires close monitoring and ongoing renal support.

The patient is also being managed for OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) with BIPAP at night, which helps with respiratory support. Her delirium is attributed to multiple factors, including uremia, acidosis, and medication effects. The plan is to closely follow the patient's mental status and examine her frequently.

Regarding other medical conditions, the patient has hypertension, for which she will start taking oral labetalol. Her diabetes mellitus will continue to be managed with insulin, and blood sugar levels will be trended. Cardiovascular care"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute renal failure and delirium. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions, including the placement of a dialysis catheter, initiation of BIPAP, and administration of hydralazine and heparin sodium.

Vital signs are as follows: Temperature is within normal range at 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate is stable at 63 beats per minute, blood pressure is elevated with a reading of 180/89 mmHg, respiratory rate is within normal limits at 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is at 95% on SpO2.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, and no signs of pallor or scleral edema. The cardiovascular examination shows a sinus rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. Respiratory examination reveals diminished breath sounds. The abdominal examination shows a soft and non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds and distention. Extremities show 2+ edema bilaterally. Skin examination is not assessed due to the patient being intubated. Neurologic examination is also not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels (10.6 on 07/26 to 9.4 on 07/27) and decreased blood glucose levels (134 on 07/25 to 71 on 07/27). Other"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of CVA (cerebrovascular accident), DM (diabetes mellitus), and CRI (chronic renal insufficiency) who presented with acute-on-chronic renal failure. She is currently in the ICU for ongoing management of her condition.

24-hour events include the placement of a dialysis catheter, tolerance of BIPAP (bi-level positive airway pressure) ventilation, and the administration of hydralazine and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 180/89 to 200/124 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an input of 3,042 mL and output of 3,065 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 23 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been dialyzed.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 12.0 K/uL, and platelet count within normal range at 298 K/uL. Renal function tests reveal elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal impairment. Electrolyte imbalances are present, including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia"
