","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after experiencing a v-fib arrest. She was intubated and put on mechanical ventilation. The initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation, which degenerated into asystole. There is uncertainty regarding the precipitant for the cardiac arrest. The patient has been diagnosed with an unclear aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis, with findings consistent with atelectasis on the CT chest. She received one dose of Vanc/Zosyn, then switched to Levo/Flagyl to cover for aspiration PNA. The patient's temperature could not be maintained at 34C without continual decrease of water temperature for Arctic Sun. She had seizure activity/burst suppression pattern on EEG, requiring propofol to suppress. The patient's cardiac enzymes (troponin and CK) are elevated, most likely from cardiac arrest and CPR. The patient had a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with RCA DES on [**2161-7-22**]. The patient's blood pressure is stable, with systolic blood pressure in the 120s-150s. The ejection fraction (EF) is greater than 55%, and she may need a possible transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) in the future. The patient's rhythm is currently in sinus, after being initially in ventricular fibrillation (vfib) and then asystole. The"

","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after experiencing a ventricular fibrillation (v-fib) arrest. The cause of the initial v-fib arrest is unclear, but it could be related to atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib or a pulmonary process such as aspiration. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology on the CT chest. The patient has been intubated and is currently in sinus rhythm. An EEG showed seizure activity/burst suppression pattern requiring propofol to suppress.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Temperature instability, requiring continual decrease of water temp for Arctic Sun.
- Respiratory support with mechanical ventilation.
- Hemodynamic instability, requiring minimal Levophed support.
- Neurological status of unresponsiveness with dilated fixed pupils.
- Possible aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis with left upper lobe and left basilar opacities on the CXR.
- Moderate cardiomegaly with enlarged pulmonary arteries on the CT chest.
- Chronic pulmonary hypertension.
- Elevated troponin and CK levels most likely from cardiac arrest and CPR.
- No evidence of ischemia on ECG.
- History of atrial fibrillation, now in sinus rhythm.
- Wet read negative for acute process on CT head.
- Seizure activity on EEG requiring propofol to suppress.

   Medical Decision Making.  Mrs. [**Known lastname 8754**] is 53 year old woman with a
   prior AFib with RVR (simulating ventricular tachycardia) in [**2161-7-22**]
   which was treated with a CYPHER DES.   She also had a large ASD with
   significant left to right shunt.   She underwent as is an atrial
   flutter ablation but was pending for a atrial fibrillation ablation
   after 3-6 months of dual antiplatelet therapy for her DES.    She had a
   witnessed cardiac arrest yesterday with ultimately responded to CPR
   although there was question of cerebral anoxia.   Her EKG showed stable
   changes without evidence of stent thrombosis.
   She was cooled for > 18 hours and has not been rewarmed without return
   of cerebral function to date.  She is off pressors and hemodynamically
   stable. We will continue supportive care for her cerebral injury.
   The total time for this visit was 40 minutes and over 50% of the time
   was spent coordinating care.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after experiencing ventricular fibrillation arrest. She was successfully resuscitated but remains unresponsive. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/52 mmHg to 152/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is currently receiving norepinephrine at a dose of 0.1 mcg/kg/min, cisatracurium at a dose of 0.06 mg/kg/hr, and propofol at a dose of 70 mcg/kg/min.

The patient has undergone several tests, including a CT chest that showed bilateral lung changes secondary to atelectasis/aspiration and moderate cardiomegaly with enlarged pulmonary arteries. The CT head was negative for any acute processes. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed seizure activity/burst suppression pattern.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.8 K/uL, elevated glucose levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and abnormal coagulation parameters (PT/PTT/INR).

The patient is being treated for presumed aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis, with antibiotics switched from Vancomycin/Zos"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after experiencing ventricular fibrillation arrest. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation, which degenerated into asystole. An EEG showed seizure activity/burst suppression pattern requiring propofol to suppress. The patient has been diagnosed with a possible aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis, with findings consistent with atelectasis on the CT chest. She received one dose of Vanc/Zosyn, then switched to Levo/Flagyl to cover for aspiration PNA. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, with no evidence of ischemia on ECG, and had a stent placement in 07/22/2161. She has a history of pump dysfunction, with stable blood pressure and an ejection fraction >55% in 07/22/2161. Her rhythm was initially in ventricular fibrillation, then asystole, with unclear precipitant. She is currently in sinus rhythm and will continue on warfarin. She also has a history of hypothyroidism, for which she will continue levothyroxine. The patient is NPO, with PIV access, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. She is currently in the ICU and will have a family meeting for further disposition.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after experiencing ventricular fibrillation (v-fib) arrest. The initial cause of the v-fib arrest is unclear, but it could be related to atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib or a pulmonary process (aspiration), as no evidence of pulmonary embolism was found. She is now intubated and her rhythm has returned to sinus. A CT head showed no acute process, but an EEG demonstrated seizure activity/burst suppression pattern, which required propofol to suppress. 

The patient has been diagnosed with?aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis, as indicated by CT chest findings consistent with atelectasis vs. PNA, along with leukocytosis. She was unable to maintain a body temperature of 34C without continual decrease of water temp for Arctic Sun. The patient received one dose of Vanc/Zosyn, then switched to Levo/Flagyl to cover for aspiration PNA. 

There are no evident coronary artery disease issues as no evidence of ischemia was seen on ECG, and elevated troponin and CK are most likely from cardiac arrest and CPR. The patient underwent a right coronary artery drug-eluting stent placement on [**2161-7-22**]. 

The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction is >55% as seen in [**2161-"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2161-11-6**] 06:37 PM
   CT final read: 1. No acute pulmonary embolism or acute thoracic aortic
   pathology detected.
   2. Scattered pulmonary opacities in the dependent portion of both
   lungs,
   probably related to aspiration or atelectasis.
   3. Bilateral multiple rib fractures, without evidence of pneumothorax,
   possibly related to recent resuscitation.
   4. Dilatation of the main,right and left pulmonary arteries suggests
   pulmonary arterial hypertension.
   ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. A large secundum atrial septal defect is present. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
   cavity is unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular
   systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The
   right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall
   function. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with
   right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
   aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is at least mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-8-13**], estimated
   pulmonary artery pressure is now lower but may be underestimated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after experiencing a ventricular fibrillation (v-fib) arrest. The initial v-fib arrest may have been precipitated by atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib or a pulmonary process (aspiration; no evidence of pulmonary embolism) leading to cardiac arrest. There is no evidence of ischemia. The patient is now intubated and her rhythm has returned to sinus. A CT head showed no acute process, and the patient underwent an arctic sun protocol.

The patient also experienced a seizure, which was confirmed by an EEG showing seizure activity/burst suppression pattern. Propofol and fosphenytoin were administered to suppress the seizure activity. Continuous EEG monitoring and follow-up with neurology recommendations were advised. Propofol dosage was reduced to 30 mcg/kg/min, and fosphenytoin loading followed by daily doses were initiated.

The patient's CT chest revealed findings consistent with atelectasis versus pneumonia (PNA), along with leukocytosis. The patient received one dose of Vancomycin/Zosyn, then switched to Levofloxacin/Flagyl to cover for aspiration PNA. Broadening coverage may be considered if there is no improvement, and sputum culture and blood cultures are pending.

The patient's PT/INR levels are elevated, believed to be a spurious"

   24 Hour Events:
 ARTERIAL LINE - START [**2161-11-6**] 06:37 PM
   Neuro adjusted anti-epileptic regimen.
   CT final read:
   1. No acute pulmonary embolism or acute thoracic aortic pathology
   detected.
   2. Scattered pulmonary opacities in the dependent portion of both
   lungs,
   probably related to aspiration or atelectasis.
   3. Bilateral multiple rib fractures, without evidence of pneumothorax,
   possibly related to recent resuscitation.
   4. Dilatation of the main,right and left pulmonary arteries suggests
   pulmonary arterial hypertension.
   ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. A large secundum atrial septal defect is present. There is
   mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
   cavity is unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular
   systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The
   right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall
   function. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with
   right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
   (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
   aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is at least mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-8-13**], estimated
   pulmonary artery pressure is now lower but may be underestimated.

   Assessment and Plan
   63-year-old woman with history of atrial fibrillation/flutter presented
   after v-fib arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: unclear precipitant for initial v-fib. Might have
   been atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib, or a pulmonary process
   (aspiration; no evidence of PE) leading to cardiac arrest. No evidence
   of ischemia. Now intubated. Rhythm now in sinus.  CT head negative for
   acute process.  s/p arctic sun protocol.
   - continue amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - continue ventilatory support
   - telemetry
   .
   # Seizure: EEG showed seizure activity/burst suppression pattern
   requiring propofol and fosphenytoin to suppress. Per neuro, in status
   epilepticus this morning.
   - Continuous EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - increase propofol until EEG pattern changes to less bursts
   - forphenytoin loaded, then daily doses
   .
   # ?Aspiration PNA vs. Pneumonitis:  CT chest showed LUL and LLL
   findings consistent with atelectasis vs. PNA, also with leukocytosis
   (although downtrending again today). Received one dose of Vanc/Zosyn,
   then switched to Levo/Flagyl to cover for aspiration PNA. Febrile to
   101.7 this morning during rounds.
   - Stat CXR
   - Tylenol
   - Re-cool with arctic sun, per neuro, because of fever
   - Restart vancomycin, to cover for MRSA (hospitalization and
   group/nursing home history)
   - Continue levofloxacin
   - Discontinue flagyl
   - Start clindamycin
   - Trend leukocytosis, fever curve
   - Send new sputum cultures and blood cultures; f/u all pending cultures
   .
   # Coagulopathy
 PT/INR/PTT repeated and elevation confirmed. Perhaps
   due to DIC, or because of coumadin (home med) interacting with the
   antiepileptics to become supratherapeutic. However, elevated PTT (not
   on heparin) might argue more towards a DIC picture moreso than just
   coumadin
s effect. Patient with gastroccult postitive, coffee-grounds
   colored, OG tube findings. Patient also with 8-point Hct drop (but only
   3 points down from admission Hct)
 reconfirmed with 2^nd set of AM
   labs.
   - Give 10mg IV vitamin K now to reverse coagulopathy
   - 1pm Hct, PT, PTT, INR
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV for GIbleed concern
   - Follow petechial rash on back, as concern for bleed site (marked in
   black marker the outline)
   - F/u haptoglobin, fibrin degredation products, fibrinogen, D-dimer
   .`
   # CORONARIES: no evidence of ischemia on ECG. Elevated trop and CK most
   likely from cardiac arrest and CPR. S/p RCA DES in [**2161-7-22**].  TTE this
   morning did not show inferior wall hypokinesis, unlikely ischemic event
   which triggered V fib arrest.
   - Continue ASA (if bleeds more and Hct drops, could change 325mg to
   81mg), clopidogrel
   .
   # PUMP: BP stable with SBP in 90s to 140s; no longer on Levophed (off
   since the 16^th). EF >55% in [**2161-7-22**].  Does not appear volume
   overloaded, though difficult to assess.
   .
   # RHYTHM: h/o afib, now in sinus. Was initially in V fib then asystole,
   unclear precipitant.  Has been intermittently in a fib/flutter based on
   telemetry overnight. Given the elevated PT/INR, hold coumadin today.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Rash: dependent rash on upper back, ?dependent hematoma [**2-23**] rib
   fracture ? petechial
   -recheck Hct @ 1pm, d/t 8 point Hct drop (but only 3 points down since
   admission Hct)
   -monitor clinically

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Pulmonary arterial hypertension: The CT scan shows dilatation of the main, right, and left pulmonary arteries, suggesting pulmonary arterial hypertension.

2. Atrial septal defect: The echocardiogram reveals a large secundum atrial septal defect.

3. Right ventricular dysfunction: The echocardiogram indicates borderline normal free wall function of the right ventricle, along with abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.

4. Mitral regurgitation: The echocardiogram detects mild (1+) mitral regurgitation.

5. Aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis: The CT chest findings are consistent with atelectasis versus pneumonia, and leukocytosis is present. The patient has received antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia coverage.

6. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated PT/INR/PTT, which may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), medication interactions, or both. The patient also has a positive gastrocult with coffee-grounds colored OG tube findings, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding.

7. Coronary artery disease: Although no evidence of ischemia is seen on the electrocardiogram, the patient has elevated cardiac enzymes (troponin and CK) likely due to cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The patient has a history"

   Assessment and Plan
   63-year-old woman with history of atrial fibrillation/flutter presented
   after v-fib arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: unclear precipitant for initial v-fib. Might have
   been atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib, or a pulmonary process
   (aspiration; no evidence of PE) leading to cardiac arrest. No evidence
   of ischemia. Now intubated. Rhythm now in sinus.  CT head negative for
   acute process.  s/p arctic sun protocol.
   - continue amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - continue ventilatory support
   - telemetry
   .
   # Seizure: EEG showed seizure activity/burst suppression pattern
   requiring propofol and fosphenytoin to suppress. Per neuro, in status
   epilepticus this morning.
   - Continuous EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - increase propofol until EEG pattern changes to less bursts
   - forphenytoin loaded, then daily doses
   .
   # ?Aspiration PNA vs. Pneumonitis:  CT chest showed LUL and LLL
   findings consistent with atelectasis vs. PNA, also with leukocytosis
   (although downtrending again today). Received one dose of Vanc/Zosyn,
   then switched to Levo/Flagyl to cover for aspiration PNA. Febrile to
   101.7 this morning during rounds.
   - Stat CXR
   - Tylenol
   - Re-cool with arctic sun, per neuro, because of fever
   - Restart vancomycin, to cover for MRSA (hospitalization and
   group/nursing home history)
   - Continue levofloxacin
   - Discontinue flagyl
   - Start clindamycin
   - Trend leukocytosis, fever curve
   - Send new sputum cultures and blood cultures; f/u all pending cultures
   .
   # Coagulopathy
 PT/INR/PTT repeated and elevation confirmed. Perhaps
   due to DIC, or because of coumadin (home med) interacting with the
   antiepileptics to become supratherapeutic. However, elevated PTT (not
   on heparin) might argue more towards a DIC picture moreso than just
   coumadin
s effect. Patient with gastroccult postitive, coffee-grounds
   colored, OG tube findings. Patient also with 8-point Hct drop (but only
   3 points down from admission Hct)
 reconfirmed with 2^nd set of AM
   labs.
   - Give 10mg IV vitamin K now to reverse coagulopathy
   - 1pm Hct, PT, PTT, INR
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV for GIbleed concern
   - Follow petechial rash on back, as concern for bleed site (marked in
   black marker the outline)
   - F/u haptoglobin, fibrin degredation products, fibrinogen, D-dimer
   .`
   # CORONARIES: no evidence of ischemia on ECG. Elevated trop and CK most
   likely from cardiac arrest and CPR. S/p RCA DES in [**2161-7-22**].  TTE this
   morning did not show inferior wall hypokinesis, unlikely ischemic event
   which triggered V fib arrest.
   - Continue ASA (if bleeds more and Hct drops, could change 325mg to
   81mg), clopidogrel
   .
   # PUMP: BP stable with SBP in 90s to 140s; no longer on Levophed (off
   since the 16^th). EF >55% in [**2161-7-22**].  Does not appear volume
   overloaded, though difficult to assess.
   .
   # RHYTHM: h/o afib, now in sinus. Was initially in V fib then asystole,
   unclear precipitant.  Has been intermittently in a fib/flutter based on
   telemetry overnight. Given the elevated PT/INR, hold coumadin today.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Rash: dependent rash on upper back, ?dependent hematoma [**2-23**] rib
   fracture ? petechial
   -recheck Hct @ 1pm, d/t 8 point Hct drop (but only 3 points down since
   admission Hct)
   -monitor clinically

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Pulmonary Complications:
- The patient has scattered pulmonary opacities in the dependent portion of both lungs, which are probably related to aspiration or atelectasis.
- The patient has been febrile and received antibiotics for possible pneumonia, which may indicate an aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis.

2. Cardiac Complications:
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter and experienced a ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) arrest, leading to cardiac arrest.
- The patient's ECG showed seizure activity/burst suppression pattern, indicating a possible seizure episode.
- The patient has elevated troponin and CK levels, which are commonly associated with myocardial infarction or cardiac injury.
- The patient underwent a coronary artery stenting procedure (RCA DES) in [**2161-7-22**].

3. Coagulopathy:
- The patient has an elevated PT/INR/PTT, indicating a coagulation disorder.
- The coagulopathy may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), drug interactions between antiepileptic medications and warfarin, or a gastrointestinal bleed.

4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding:
- The patient has a positive gastrocult with coffee-grounds colored OG tube findings, suggesting gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient was given IV vitamin K to reverse coagul"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after a ventricular fibrillation (Vfib) arrest. She was intubated and now has a junctional rhythm. The patient has undergone several interventions including arctic sun cooling protocol, seizure management with fosphenytoin and depakote, antibiotic therapy for possible aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, reversal of coagulopathy with vitamin K, and cardiac support with ASA and clopidogrel. The patient's condition remains unstable with concerns about aspiration pneumonia, hypothyroidism, and a petechial rash on her back. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's CT chest showed findings consistent with atelectasis vs. PNA, and she is febrile. She is receiving antibiotics, but the leukocytosis is downtrending. Close monitoring of the fever curve and pending cultures/micro is recommended.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient had elevated PT, PTT, and INR, which were reversed with vitamin K. DIC labs were negative, and the INR is now below therapeutic range. Heparin gtt is being given due to the history of atrial fibrillation. The patient's GI bleed concern persists due to positive OG tube secretions. Regular monitoring of Hct, PT, PTT, and INR is advised.

   Assessment and Plan
   63-year-old woman with history of atrial fibrillation/flutter presented
   after v-fib arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: unclear precipitant for initial v-fib. Might have
   been atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib, or a pulmonary process
   (aspiration; no evidence of PE) leading to cardiac arrest. No evidence
   of ischemia. Now intubated. Rhythm now in sinus.  CT head negative for
   acute process.  s/p arctic sun protocol.
   - continue amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - continue ventilatory support
   - telemetry
   .
   # Seizure: EEG showed seizure activity/burst suppression pattern
   requiring propofol and fosphenytoin to suppress. Per neuro, in status
   epilepticus this morning.
   - Continuous EEG
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - increase propofol until EEG pattern changes to less bursts
   - forphenytoin loaded, then daily doses
   .
   # ?Aspiration PNA vs. Pneumonitis:  CT chest showed LUL and LLL
   findings consistent with atelectasis vs. PNA, also with leukocytosis
   (although downtrending again today). Received one dose of Vanc/Zosyn,
   then switched to Levo/Flagyl to cover for aspiration PNA. Febrile to
   101.7 this morning during rounds.
   - Stat CXR
   - Tylenol
   - Re-cool with arctic sun, per neuro, because of fever
   - Restart vancomycin, to cover for MRSA (hospitalization and
   group/nursing home history)
   - Continue levofloxacin
   - Discontinue flagyl
   - Start clindamycin
   - Trend leukocytosis, fever curve
   - Send new sputum cultures and blood cultures; f/u all pending cultures
   .
   # Coagulopathy
 PT/INR/PTT repeated and elevation confirmed. Perhaps
   due to DIC, or because of coumadin (home med) interacting with the
   antiepileptics to become supratherapeutic. However, elevated PTT (not
   on heparin) might argue more towards a DIC picture moreso than just
   coumadin
s effect. Patient with gastroccult postitive, coffee-grounds
   colored, OG tube findings. Patient also with 8-point Hct drop (but only
   3 points down from admission Hct)
 reconfirmed with 2^nd set of AM
   labs.
   - Give 10mg IV vitamin K now to reverse coagulopathy
   - 1pm Hct, PT, PTT, INR
   - [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV for GIbleed concern
   - Follow petechial rash on back, as concern for bleed site (marked in
   black marker the outline)
   - F/u haptoglobin, fibrin degredation products, fibrinogen, D-dimer
   .`
   # CORONARIES: no evidence of ischemia on ECG. Elevated trop and CK most
   likely from cardiac arrest and CPR. S/p RCA DES in [**2161-7-22**].  TTE this
   morning did not show inferior wall hypokinesis, unlikely ischemic event
   which triggered V fib arrest.
   - Continue ASA (if bleeds more and Hct drops, could change 325mg to
   81mg), clopidogrel
   .
   # PUMP: BP stable with SBP in 90s to 140s; no longer on Levophed (off
   since the 16^th). EF >55% in [**2161-7-22**].  Does not appear volume
   overloaded, though difficult to assess.
   .
   # RHYTHM: h/o afib, now in sinus. Was initially in V fib then asystole,
   unclear precipitant.  Has been intermittently in a fib/flutter based on
   telemetry overnight. Given the elevated PT/INR, hold coumadin today.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Rash: dependent rash on upper back, ?dependent hematoma [**2-23**] rib
   fracture ? petechial
   -recheck Hct @ 1pm, d/t 8 point Hct drop (but only 3 points down since
   admission Hct)
   -monitor clinically
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - f/u TSH
   - continue levothyroxine
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after experiencing a ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) arrest. She was intubated and now has a rhythm in sinus. A CT head showed no acute process, and she underwent the Arctic Sun protocol. The patient has been diagnosed with status epilepticus and is being treated with propofol and fosphenytoin. Continuous EEG is being performed, and she is being closely monitored by neurology.

She also has leukocytosis, which suggests possible aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis. A CT chest showed findings consistent with atelectasis vs. pneumonia, and she received one dose of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam before switching to levofloxacin and metronidazole to cover for aspiration pneumonia. Her fever has been managed with Tylenol and the Arctic Sun.

The patient's PT/INR/PTT levels are elevated, indicating a coagulopathy. This could be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), coumadin interaction with antiepileptic medications, or both. The patient has a positive gastrocult with coffee-grounds colored OG tube findings, as well as an 8-point Hct drop. Vitamin K has been administered, and further labs are being ordered to assess the coagulopathy.

She has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent"

   Assessment and Plan
   53-year-old woman with history of atrial fibrillation/flutter presented
   after v-fib arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: unclear precipitant for initial v-fib. Might have
   been atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib, or a pulmonary process
   (aspiration; no evidence of PE) leading to cardiac arrest. No evidence
   of ischemia. Now intubated. Patient now in junctional rhythm.  s/p
   arctic sun protocol.
   - continue amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - continue ventilatory support
   - telemetry
   .
   # Seizure: Patient with seizure activity on EEG
 being monitored by
   neuro as part of cardiac arrest cooling protocol. CT head negative for
   acute process.  Guarded but unclear prognosis at this time.
   - MRI results pending
   - ask neuro about prognosis, and plan for Monday family meeting
   (confirm this with neuro)
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continuous EEG
   - continue fosphenytoin, depakote, propofol (will wean as tolerated),
   dilantin
   .
   # ?Aspiration PNA vs. Pneumonitis:  CT chest showed LUL and LLL
   findings consistent with atelectasis vs. PNA, also with leukocytosis
   (downtrending again today) and was febrile yesterday. On vancomycin,
   levaquin, clindamycin regimen.
   - Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin, clindamycin
   - Trend leukocytosis, fever curve
   -will reculture, add zosyn if spikes
   - F/u pending cultures/micro
   .
   # Coagulopathy
 PT, PTT, INR no longer elevated following vit K
   administration. DIC labs negative. Now INR below therapeutic range, so
   patient on heparin gtt (for afib history). Hct stable. Still with GI
   bleed concern d/t gastroccult positive OG tube secretions. Petechial
   rash stable.
   - follow crit, will call GI if crit unstable
   - Cont. [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV
   - Follow petechial rash on back, as concern for bleed site (marked in
   black marker the outline)
   .`
   # CORONARIES: no evidence of ischemia on ECG. Elevated trop and CK most
   likely from cardiac arrest and CPR. S/p RCA DES in [**2161-7-22**].  TTE this
   morning did not show inferior wall hypokinesis, unlikely ischemic event
   which triggered V fib arrest.
   - Continue ASA (if bleeds more and Hct drops, could change 325mg to
   81mg), clopidogrel.  Currently pt not absorbing meds, may need to
   switch to PR ASA today.
   .
   # PUMP: BP stable with SBP in 90s to 140s; no longer on Levophed (off
   since the [**11-6**]). EF >55% in [**2161-7-22**].  Does not appear volume
   overloaded, though difficult to assess. Now has central access in case
   patient needs pressors, especially since on propofol the patient
s BP
   has been running lower.
   .
   # RHYTHM: h/o afib, was initially in V fib then asystole, unclear
   precipitant. s/p arctic sun cooling protocol. Now in slow junctional
   rhythm in 40s/50s on telemetry this morning.
   - on heparin gtt for h/o afib as INR infratherapeutic today
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Rash: dependent rash on upper back, ?dependent hematoma [**2-23**] rib
   fracture ? petechial, d/t chest compressions trauma
   - 5pm Hct
   - monitor clinically
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose; do not change dose even with low
   lab TSH, given stressed state currently

   Disposition: CCU for now
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after experiencing a ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) arrest. The patient was successfully resuscitated and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's medical history includes a recent cardiac arrest with unclear precipitants, a possible pulmonary process leading to cardiac arrest, and a seizure during the cooling protocol following the cardiac arrest. The CT head was negative for any acute processes. The patient is being monitored by neurology for ongoing seizure activity.

The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis, as evidenced by findings on the CT chest showing atelectasis versus pneumonia, along with leukocytosis and a previous episode of fever. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics (vancomycin, levofloxacin, clindamycin) for this condition.

The patient also has a coagulopathy, with initially elevated PT, PTT, and INR that have normalized following vitamin K administration. The patient is now on heparin gtt due to her history of atrial fibrillation. There is concern for a gastrointestinal bleed due to the presence of bloody nasogastric tube drainage and a positive gastrocult test. The patient is currently on a proton pump inhibitor IV and will be closely monitored for any signs of bleeding.

The patient has undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention (RCA DES) in the past, and the TTE"

   below therapeutic range, so patient on heparin gtt (for afib history).
   Hct stable. Still with GIbleed concern d/t gastroccult positive OG tube
   secretions. Petechial rash stable.
   - 5pm Hct, PT, PTT, INR
   - Cont. [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV
   - Follow petechial rash on back, as concern for bleed site (marked in
   black marker the outline)

   # CORONARIES: no evidence of ischemia on ECG. Elevated trop and CK most
   likely from cardiac arrest and CPR. S/p RCA DES in [**2161-7-22**].  TTE this
   morning did not show inferior wall hypokinesis, unlikely ischemic event
   which triggered V fib arrest.
   - Continue ASA (if bleeds more and Hct drops, could change 325mg to
   81mg), clopidogrel.
   .
   # PUMP: BP stable with SBP in 90s to 140s; no longer on Levophed (off
   since the [**11-6**]). EF >55% in [**2161-7-22**].  Does not appear volume
   overloaded, though difficult to assess. Now has central access in case
   patient needs pressors, especially since on propofol the patient
s BP
   has been running lower.
   .
   # RHYTHM: h/o afib, was initially in V fib then asystole, unclear
   precipitant. s/p arctic sun cooling protocol. Now in junctional rhythm
   in 40s/50s on telemetry this morning.
   - on heparin gtt for h/o afib as INR infratherapeutic today
   - monitor on telemetry

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after experiencing a ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) arrest. The patient's current condition includes being intubated and in a junctional rhythm. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient had an initial V-fib arrest, which could be due to atrial arrhythmias degenerating into V-fib or a pulmonary process leading to cardiac arrest. There is no evidence of ischemia, but ongoing cardiac monitoring is necessary.

2. Seizure: The patient is being monitored by neurology for seizure activity on EEG as part of the cardiac arrest cooling protocol. Continuous EEG monitoring is recommended.

3. Aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis: The CT chest showed findings consistent with atelectasis vs. pneumonia. The patient has leukocytosis and was febrile yesterday. Antibiotics have been initiated, and cultures are pending.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient had elevated PT, PTT, and INR levels but received IV vitamin K to reverse coagulopathy. DIC labs were negative, and now the INR is below therapeutic range. Heparin has been started due to the patient's history of atrial fibrillation.

5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a positive OG tube secretion culture, indicating a potential GI bleed concern. Close monitoring of H"

   Assessment and Plan
   53-year-old woman with history of atrial fibrillation/flutter presented
   after v-fib arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: unclear precipitant for initial v-fib. Might have
   been atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib, or a pulmonary process
   (aspiration; no evidence of PE) leading to cardiac arrest. No evidence
   of ischemia. Now intubated. Patient now in junctional rhythm.  s/p
   arctic sun protocol.
   - continue amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - continue ventilatory support
   - telemetry
   .
   # Seizure: Patient with seizure activity on EEG
 being monitored by
   neuro as part of cardiac arrest cooling protocol. CT head negative for
   acute process.  Guarded but unclear prognosis at this time.  MRI -
   Diffuse cerebral anoxic injury.
   - ask neuro about prognosis
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continuous EEG
   - continue fosphenytoin, depakote, dilantin (propofol weaned off thus
   far; restart per neuron as needed)
   .
   # ?Aspiration PNA vs. Pneumonitis:  CT chest showed LUL and LLL
   findings consistent with atelectasis vs. PNA, also with leukocytosis
   (downtrending again today) and was febrile yesterday. On vancomycin,
   levaquin, clindamycin regimen.
   - Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin, clindamycin
   - Trend leukocytosis, fever curve
   - will reculture, add zosyn if spikes
   - f/u pending cultures/micro
   .
   # Coagulopathy
 PT, PTT, INR no longer elevated following vit K
   administration. DIC labs negative. Now INR below therapeutic range, so
   patient on heparin gtt (for afib history). Hct stable. Still with GI
   bleed concern d/t gastroccult positive NG tube secretions. Petechial
   rash stable.
   - follow crit, will call GI if crit unstable
   - Cont. [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV
   - Follow petechial rash on back, as concern for bleed site (marked in
   black marker the outline)
   .`
   # CORONARIES: no evidence of ischemia on ECG. Elevated trop and CK most
   likely from cardiac arrest and CPR. S/p RCA DES in [**2161-7-22**].  TTE this
   morning did not show inferior wall hypokinesis, unlikely ischemic event
   which triggered V fib arrest.
   - Continue ASA (if bleeds more and Hct drops, could change 325mg to
   81mg), clopidogrel.  Currently pt not absorbing meds, may need to
   switch to PR ASA today.
   .
   # PUMP: BP stable with SBP in 90s to 140s; no longer on Levophed (off
   since the [**11-6**]). EF >55% in [**2161-7-22**].  Does not appear volume
   overloaded, though difficult to assess. Now has central access in case
   patient needs pressors, especially since on propofol the patient
s BP
   has been running lower.
   .
   # RHYTHM: h/o afib, was initially in V fib then asystole, unclear
   precipitant. s/p arctic sun cooling protocol. Now in slow junctional
   rhythm in 40s/50s on telemetry this morning.
   - on heparin gtt for h/o afib as INR infratherapeutic today (1.7)
   coumadin being held, can restart
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Rash: dependent rash on upper back, ?dependent hematoma [**2-23**] rib
   fracture ? petechial, d/t chest compressions trauma
   - monitor clinically
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose; do not change dose even with low
   lab TSH, given stressed state currently

   Assessment and Plan
   53-year-old woman with history of atrial fibrillation/flutter presented
   after v-fib arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: unclear precipitant for initial v-fib. Might have
   been atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib, or a pulmonary process
   (aspiration; no evidence of PE) leading to cardiac arrest. No evidence
   of ischemia. Now intubated. Patient now in junctional rhythm.  s/p
   arctic sun protocol.
   - continue amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - continue ventilatory support
   - telemetry
   .
   # Seizure: Patient with seizure activity on EEG
 being monitored by
   neuro as part of cardiac arrest cooling protocol. CT head negative for
   acute process.  Guarded but unclear prognosis at this time.  MRI -
   Diffuse cerebral anoxic injury.
   - ask neuro about prognosis
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continuous EEG
   - continue fosphenytoin, depakote, dilantin (propofol weaned off thus
   far; restart per neuron as needed)
   .
   # ?Aspiration PNA vs. Pneumonitis:  CT chest showed LUL and LLL
   findings consistent with atelectasis vs. PNA, also with leukocytosis
   (downtrending again today) and was febrile yesterday. On vancomycin,
   levaquin, clindamycin regimen.
   - Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin, clindamycin
   - Trend leukocytosis, fever curve
   - will reculture, add zosyn if spikes
   - f/u pending cultures/micro
   .
   # Coagulopathy
 PT, PTT, INR no longer elevated following vit K
   administration. DIC labs negative. Now INR below therapeutic range, so
   patient on heparin gtt (for afib history). Hct stable. Still with GI
   bleed concern d/t gastroccult positive NG tube secretions. Petechial
   rash stable.
   - follow crit, will call GI if crit unstable
   - Cont. [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV
   - Follow petechial rash on back, as concern for bleed site (marked in
   black marker the outline)
   .`
   # CORONARIES: no evidence of ischemia on ECG. Elevated trop and CK most
   likely from cardiac arrest and CPR. S/p RCA DES in [**2161-7-22**].  TTE this
   morning did not show inferior wall hypokinesis, unlikely ischemic event
   which triggered V fib arrest.
   - Continue ASA (if bleeds more and Hct drops, could change 325mg to
   81mg), clopidogrel.  Currently pt not absorbing meds, may need to
   switch to PR ASA today.
   .
   # PUMP: BP stable with SBP in 90s to 140s; no longer on Levophed (off
   since the [**11-6**]). EF >55% in [**2161-7-22**].  Does not appear volume
   overloaded, though difficult to assess. Now has central access in case
   patient needs pressors, especially since on propofol the patient
s BP
   has been running lower.
   -40 IV lasix now.  Will continue to diurese with additional boluses as
   needed.
   .
   # RHYTHM: h/o afib, was initially in V fib then asystole, unclear
   precipitant. s/p arctic sun cooling protocol. Now in slow junctional
   rhythm in 40s/50s on telemetry this morning.
   - on heparin gtt for h/o afib as INR infratherapeutic today (1.7)
   coumadin being held, can restart
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Anemia: stable, concern for UGI bleed given coffee ground aspirate
   from G tube, however minimal output at this time.
   -follow crit
   -proton pump inhibitor
   .
   # Rash: dependent rash on upper back, ?dependent hematoma [**2-23**] rib
   fracture ? petechial, d/t chest compressions trauma
   - monitor clinically
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose; do not change dose even with low
   lab TSH, given stressed state currently

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after experiencing ventricular fibrillation (v-fib) arrest. The initial v-fib arrest may have been caused by either atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib or a pulmonary process leading to cardiac arrest. There is no evidence of ischemia. The patient is now intubated and in a junctional rhythm.

The patient also experienced a seizure, which was monitored by neurology as part of the cardiac arrest cooling protocol. A CT head showed no acute process, and an MRI revealed diffuse cerebral anoxic injury. The prognosis for the seizure is guarded, and continuous EEG monitoring is recommended. The patient is being treated with fosphenytoin, depakote, and dilantin.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with oxygen saturation at 99% on the ventilator. The ABG results show a pH of 7.45, indicating a slight respiratory alkalosis. The FiO2 is set at 40%, and the RSBI is 88. The PIP is 21 cmH2O, and the plateau pressure is 0 cmH2O. The compliance is -68.6 cmH2O/mL.

Regarding the patient's cardiac status, there are no evidence of ischemia on the ECG, and elevated troponin and CK levels are likely due to the cardiac arrest and CPR"

","The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after experiencing ventricular fibrillation (v-fib) arrest. The cause of the initial v-fib arrest is unclear, but it may have been due to atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib or a pulmonary process such as aspiration leading to cardiac arrest. There was no evidence of ischemia.

The patient is currently intubated and in a junctional rhythm with a heart rate of approximately 55 beats per minute. She has undergone the Arctic Sun cooling protocol for targeted temperature management following the cardiac arrest. The patient's seizure activity on EEG has been monitored by neurology as part of the cardiac arrest cooling protocol. A CT head showed no acute process, and an MRI revealed diffuse cerebral anoxic injury. The patient is no longer in status epilepticus.

The patient has been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis, with findings consistent with atelectasis on CT chest. She is febrile and leukocytosis is present. She is on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and clindamycin regimen.

There is concern for coagulopathy due to prolonged PT, PTT, and INR. However, these values have normalized following vitamin K administration, and there is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient is on heparin gtt for her history of atrial fibrillation, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   53-year-old woman with history of atrial fibrillation/flutter presented
   after v-fib arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: unclear precipitant for initial v-fib. Might have
   been atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib, or a pulmonary process
   (aspiration; no evidence of PE) leading to cardiac arrest. No evidence
   of ischemia. Now intubated. Patient now in junctional rhythm (telemetry
   [**Location (un) 103**] as 110, true rate is half of that, ~55).  s/p arctic sun
   protocol.
   - continue amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - continue ventilatory support
   - telemetry
   .
   # Seizure: Patient with seizure activity on EEG
 being monitored by
   neuro as part of cardiac arrest cooling protocol. CT head negative for
   acute process.  Guarded but unclear prognosis at this time.  MRI -
   Diffuse cerebral anoxic injury. No longer in status epilepticus.
   - ask neuro about prognosis
 family meeting today hopefully with
   prognostic information
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continuous EEG
   - continue fosphenytoin, depakote, dilantin (propofol weaned off thus
   far; restart per neuro as needed)
   .
   # ?Aspiration PNA vs. Pneumonitis:  CT chest showed LUL and LLL
   findings consistent with atelectasis vs. PNA, also with leukocytosis
   (downtrending again today) and was febrile yesterday. On vancomycin,
   levaquin, clindamycin regimen.
   - Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin, clindamycin
   - Trend leukocytosis, fever curve
   - CIS
   - f/u pending cultures/micro
   .
   # Coagulopathy
 PT, PTT, INR no longer elevated following vit K
   administration. DIC labs negative. Now INR below therapeutic range, so
   patient on heparin gtt (for afib history). Hct stable today. Still with
   GI bleed concern d/t gastroccult positive OG tube secretions.
   - Follow Hct, will call GI if Hct unstable
   - Cont. [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV
   - Follow skin bruising clinically
   .
   # CORONARIES: no evidence of ischemia on ECG. Elevated trop and CK most
   likely from cardiac arrest and CPR. S/p RCA DES in [**2161-7-22**].  TTE this
   morning did not show inferior wall hypokinesis, unlikely ischemic event
   which triggered V fib arrest.
   - Continue ASA, clopidogrel.
   .
   # PUMP: BP stable with SBP in 90s to 140s; no longer on Levophed (off
   since the [**11-6**]). EF >55% in [**2161-7-22**].  Does not appear volume
   overloaded, though difficult to assess. Now has central access in case
   patient needs pressors, especially since on propofol (now d/c
d) the
   patient
s BP has been running lower. Currently off of pressors. Was
   -850mL yesterday.
   -Goal -500cc negative today
   .
   # RHYTHM: h/o afib, was initially in V fib then asystole, unclear
   precipitant. s/p arctic sun cooling protocol. Now in slow junctional
   rhythm in 40s/50s on telemetry (but [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 6645**] [**Location (un) 103**] as 110
s) this
   morning. Had episodes of increasing PR interval overnight.
   - on heparin gtt for h/o afib as INR infratherapeutic today (1.7)
   coumadin being held for now given bleed/bruise concerns (and prior INR
   of 9 in the setting of antibiotics and antiepileptics), prefer the
   closer titration of the heparin gtt
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypertension: BP in 150s o/n
   - monitor
   .
   # Anemia: stable, concern for UGI bleed given coffee ground aspirate
   from OG tube, however minimal output at this time.
   -follow Hct daily
   -proton pump inhibitor [**Hospital1 **] IV
   .
   # Rash: dependent rash on upper back, ?dependent hematoma [**2-23**] rib
   fracture ? petechial, d/t chest compressions trauma
 stable today
   again
   - monitor clinically
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose; do not change dose even with low
   TSH, given stressed state currently

","The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after a ventricular fibrillation (Vfib) arrest. The patient was initially in Vfib, then asystole, and now is in a slow junctional rhythm in the 40s/50s on telemetry. The patient had an episode of hypotension overnight and required Levophed, but now the patient's blood pressure is stable with SBP in the 90s to 140s. The patient has central access due to concerns about potential pressor needs, especially since the patient was on propofol.

The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400-480 mL, respiratory rate of 10-30 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on 40% FiO2. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 225.

The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.4-12.4 K/uL, and their platelet count is within normal range. The patient's troponin and CK levels are elevated, but there is no evidence of ischemia on the electrocardiogram (ECG). The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on [**2161-7-22**].

The patient's renal function tests show a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 23-26 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests show an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 46-127 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 46-127 U/L. The patient's bilirubin levels are within normal range.

The patient has a diffuse cerebral anoxic injury on MRI, but the head CT is negative for acute processes. The patient had a seizure, but the EEG is negative for ongoing seizure activity.

The patient's coagulation profile shows a prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) that were initially elevated but have normalized following vitamin K administration. The patient's activated D-dimer level is elevated at 469 ng/mL, and the fibrinogen level is within normal range.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 225. The patient's arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) is 98% on 40"

   Disposition: CCU
","The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after experiencing ventricular fibrillation (v-fib) arrest. The cause of the initial v-fib is unclear, but it might have been due to atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib or a pulmonary process leading to cardiac arrest. The patient was successfully resuscitated and is now intubated.

The patient's current condition includes being in a junctional rhythm on telemetry, hypotension, and hypertension. There are concerns about potential medical complications such as aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis, coagulopathy, coronary artery disease, pump failure, rhythm disturbances, anemia, rash, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.4°C (99.3°F)
- Heart rate: 81 bpm (48-86 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 169/74 mmHg (100-150/70-90 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (13-27 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98%
- Height: 64 inches

","Summary:
- Patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest.
- The precipitant for the initial ventricular fibrillation is unclear, but it may have been due to atrial arrhythmias degenerating into ventricular fibrillation or a pulmonary process.
- The patient is currently intubated and in a junctional rhythm with a heart rate of approximately 55 beats per minute.
- She has undergone the Arctic Sun cooling protocol and is being monitored on telemetry.
- The patient also had a seizure, which was monitored by neurologists as part of the cardiac arrest cooling protocol. A CT scan of the head showed no acute process, but an MRI revealed diffuse cerebral anoxic injury.
- There are concerns about possible aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis, as the CT chest showed findings consistent with atelectasis versus pneumonia. The patient has leukocytosis and was febrile yesterday.
- The patient has a coagulopathy, but PT, PTT, and INR levels have normalized following vitamin K administration. There is a concern for gastrointestinal bleeding due to positive OG tube secretions.
- The patient has elevated troponin and CK levels, likely from the cardiac arrest and CPR. She had a recent stent placement in her right coronary artery.
- The patient's blood pressure is stable, and she does not appear to be volume overloaded.
- She has a history of atrial fibrillation and was"

   Assessment and Plan
   53-year-old woman with history of atrial fibrillation/flutter presented
   after v-fib arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: unclear precipitant for initial v-fib. Might have
   been atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib, or a pulmonary process
   (aspiration; no evidence of PE) leading to cardiac arrest. No evidence
   of ischemia. Now intubated. Patient now in junctional rhythm (telemetry
   [**Location (un) 103**] as 110, true rate is half of that, ~55).  s/p arctic sun
   protocol.
   - continue amiodarone 400mg po bid
   - continue ventilatory support
   - telemetry
   .
   # Seizure: Patient with seizure activity on EEG
 being monitored by
   neuro as part of cardiac arrest cooling protocol. CT head negative for
   acute process.  Guarded but unclear prognosis at this time.  MRI -
   Diffuse cerebral anoxic injury. No longer in status epilepticus; EEG
   leads removed this AM.
   - ask neuro about prognosis
 family meeting today hopefully with
   prognostic information
   - f/u neuro recs
   - continue fosphenytoin, depakote, dilantin (propofol weaned off thus
   far; restart per neuro as needed)
   .
   # ?Aspiration PNA vs. Pneumonitis:  CT chest showed LUL and LLL
   findings consistent with atelectasis vs. PNA, also with leukocytosis
   (downtrending again today) and was febrile yesterday. On vancomycin (at
   increased dose now), levaquin, clindamycin regimen.
   - Continue vancomycin, levofloxacin, clindamycin
   - Trend leukocytosis (still rising WBC), fever curve
   - CIS
   - f/u pending cultures/micro
   .
   # Coagulopathy
 PT, PTT, INR no longer elevated following vit K
   administration. DIC labs negative. Now INR below therapeutic range, so
   patient on heparin gtt (for afib history). Hct stable today. Still with
   GI bleed concern d/t gastroccult positive OG tube secretions.
   - Follow Hct, will call GI if Hct unstable
   - Cont. [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV
   - Follow skin bruising clinically
   .
   # CORONARIES: no evidence of ischemia on ECG. Elevated trop and CK most
   likely from cardiac arrest and CPR. S/p RCA DES in [**2161-7-22**].  TTE this
   morning did not show inferior wall hypokinesis, unlikely ischemic event
   which triggered V fib arrest.
   - Continue ASA, clopidogrel.
   .
   # PUMP: BP stable with SBP in 90s to 140s; no longer on Levophed (off
   since the [**11-6**]). EF >55% in [**2161-7-22**].  Does not appear volume
   overloaded, though difficult to assess. Now has central access in case
   patient needs pressors, especially since on propofol (now d/c
d) the
   patient
s BP has been running lower. Currently off of pressors. Was
   -850mL yesterday. Edema (ie: upper extremities).
   -Goal: -500cc negative today
   -40mg IV lasix now
   .
   # RHYTHM: h/o afib, was initially in V fib then asystole, unclear
   precipitant. s/p arctic sun cooling protocol. Now in slow junctional
   rhythm in 40s/50s on telemetry (but [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 6645**] [**Location (un) 103**] as 110
s) this
   morning. Had episodes of increasing PR interval overnight;
   hemodynamically stable during this.
   - on heparin gtt for h/o afib as INR infratherapeutic today (1.7)
   coumadin being held for now given bleed/bruise concerns (and prior INR
   of 9 in the setting of antibiotics and antiepileptics), prefer the
   closer titration of the heparin gtt
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hypertension: BP in 150s o/n
   - monitor
   - consider hydralizine (5mg IV) if BP elevates more
   .
   # Anemia: stable, concern for UGI bleed given coffee ground aspirate
   from OG tube, however minimal output at this time.
   -follow Hct daily
   -proton pump inhibitor [**Hospital1 **] IV
   .
   # Rash: dependent rash on upper back, ?dependent hematoma [**2-23**] rib
   fracture ? petechial, d/t chest compressions trauma
   - monitor clinically
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose; do not change dose even with low
   TSH, given stressed state currently

   Disposition:
","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after experiencing a ventricular fibrillation (v-fib) arrest.
- The cause of the initial v-fib arrest is unclear, but it might have been due to atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib or a pulmonary process leading to cardiac arrest.
- The patient is now intubated and in a junctional rhythm, which is a slower heart rate than normal.
- The patient has undergone an Arctic Sun cooling protocol for cardiac arrest.
- She had seizure activity on EEG and was being monitored by neurology as part of the cardiac arrest cooling protocol. A CT head showed no acute process, but an MRI revealed diffuse cerebral anoxic injury. The patient is no longer in status epilepticus, and EEG leads have been removed.
- The patient has findings consistent with atelectasis vs. pneumonia on CT chest, along with leukocytosis and fever. She is being treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and clindamycin.
- The patient's coagulopathy has improved with vitamin K administration, and she is no longer on warfarin due to concerns about bleeding. She is on heparin gtt for her history of atrial fibrillation.
- There is a concern for gastrointestinal bleeding due to positive OG tube secretions, and the patient is being monitored closely.
- The patient had a recent coronary artery disease (CAD) event, but there is no evidence of ischemia on ECG. She has elevated troponin and CK levels, which are likely from the cardiac arrest and CPR. She underwent a right coronary artery (RCA) drug-eluting stent (DES) placement on [**2161-7-22**]. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no inferior wall hypokinesis, making it unlikely that an ischemic event triggered the v-fib arrest.
- The patient's blood pressure is stable, and she does not appear to be volume overloaded. However, she has edema in her upper extremities. Her ejection fraction (EF) is >55% based on a TTE performed on [**2161-7-22**].
- The patient's rhythm has been variable, including ventricular fibrillation, asystole, and now a slow junctional rhythm. She is being monitored on telemetry.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being treated with heparin gtt to maintain an INR below therapeutic range due to concerns about bleeding. Coumadin is being held.
- The patient's hypertension is being monitored, and she may be considered for hydralizine if her blood pressure elevates further.
- There is a concern for anemia, possibly due to an upper gastrointestinal bleed, given the coffee ground aspirate from the OG"

   # Cardiac arrest: unclear precipitant for initial v-fib. Might have
   been atrial arrhythmias degenerating into v-fib, or a pulmonary process
   (aspiration; no evidence of PE) leading to cardiac arrest. No evidence
   of ischemia. Now intubated. Patient now in junctional rhythm (telemetry
   [**Location (un) 103**] as 110, true rate is half of that, ~55).  s/p arctic sun
   protocol.

   - telemetry
   .
   # Seizure: Patient with seizure activity on EEG
 being monitored by
   neuro as part of cardiac arrest cooling protocol. CT head negative for
   acute process.  Guarded but unclear prognosis at this time.  MRI -
   Diffuse cerebral anoxic injury. No longer in status epilepticus.

   # Coagulopathy
 PT, PTT, INR no longer elevated following vit K
   administration. DIC labs negative. Now on heparin gtt for afib history.
   Hct stable today. Still with GI bleed concern d/t gastroccult positive
   OG tube secretions.
   - Follow Hct, will call GI if Hct unstable
   - Cont. [**Hospital1 **] PPI IV
   .
   # CORONARIES: no evidence of ischemia on ECG. Elevated trop and CK most
   likely from cardiac arrest and CPR. S/p RCA DES in [**2161-7-22**].
   - Continue ASA, clopidogrel.
   .
   # PUMP: BP stable with SBP in 90s to 140s; no longer on Levophed (off
   since the [**11-6**]). EF >55% in [**2161-7-22**].  Does not appear volume
   overloaded, though difficult to assess.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter who presented after experiencing a cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. She was successfully resuscitated and intubated. The note mentions several potential medical complications that can arise in this case:

1. Seizure: The patient had seizure activity on EEG and is being monitored by neurology as part of the cardiac arrest cooling protocol. A CT head was negative for acute processes, but an MRI showed diffuse cerebral anoxic injury. She is no longer in status epilepticus, and neuro recommendations include follow-up and an EP study.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia vs. Pneumonitis: The CT chest showed findings consistent with atelectasis versus pneumonia, along with leukocytosis and fever. The patient is receiving antibiotics (vancomycin, levofloxacin, clindamycin) and will have leukocytosis and fever trends monitored.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's PT, PTT, and INR were initially elevated but have normalized following vitamin K administration. There is concern for a gastrointestinal bleed due to positive OG tube secretions. The patient will be monitored for hematologic stability, and the GI service will be notified if there are any changes.

4. Coronaries: There is no evidence of ischemia on ECG, and elevated troponin and CK levels are most likely from the cardiac arrest"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to an unknown chief complaint. Over the course of her stay, she experienced several medical events, including an EEG, fever, and changes in vital signs. The patient's condition has progressively worsened, leading to the decision to make her comfort measures only, meaning that no further aggressive treatment will be provided. She has been extubated, and all non-essential medications have been removed. The patient is now on morphine, hyoscyamine, and scopolamine for symptom management. Her oxygen saturation levels have been decreasing, indicating potential respiratory distress. She is resting comfortably in bed but appears to be experiencing some secretions at the mouth. No recent labs have been drawn, and her review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are decreasing, which may indicate respiratory distress. This could be due to underlying lung issues or difficulty clearing secretions from her airway.
2. Infection: The presence of a fever suggests that the patient may have an underlying infection. This could be contributing to her overall decline in health and respiratory distress.
3. Medication Side Effects: The patient is currently on several medications, including morphine, hyoscyamine, and scopolamine. These medications can have side effects such as respiratory depression, confusion, and decreased bowel motility, which may further"
