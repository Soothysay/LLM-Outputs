   Physical Examination
   General: Angry, agitated.  Eyes shut, does not open spontaneously to
   command.  Shouting nonsensically - often disinhibited and swearing at
   others.  Often shouting for ""[**Doctor First Name **]"" or ""[**Doctor First Name 6287**]"".  Repeats what is said
   to her in mocking tone.  Sometimes with word finding difficulties or
   replacement with similar sounding words.  At times when threatening
   speech.
   HEENT: Sclera anicteric, PERRL 4->3 though only can see eyes when lids
   forced open.  MMM, oropharynx clear.
   Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD.
   Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, rhonchi,
   though poor insiratory effort and will only permit anterolateral exam
   currently.
   CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, [**3-12**] SM at LUSB without
   radiation.  L sided ICD with overlying ecchymosis, area somewhat firm,
   no erythema or warmth or fluctuance.  Ecchymosis over left
   chest/breast.
   Abdomen:  soft, appears non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds
   present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
   Ext: slightly cool, well perfused, 2+ DP pulses, no clubbing,
   cyanosis.  Trace LUE edema of upper arm, minimal LE edema.  R heel with
   deep decubitus with eschar.
   Neuro: unable to participate in exam.  Mental status and speech as
   above.  Moves all extremities, but unable to formally test strength.
   States she knows where she is and date but refuses to tell me.  States
   she has been in the hospital for ten years.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), ischemic congestive heart failure (CHF), Type I diabetes mellitus (DM), anoxic brain injury, anxiety, and depression. The patient was admitted to the ICU for ventricular tachycardia and is currently experiencing delirium.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/36 (52) mmHg to 163/94 (110) mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is also on multiple medications including heparin sodium, lorazepam, metoprolol, and other ICU medications.

Physical examination findings reveal an angry and agitated patient who is not responsive to commands, shouting nonsensically, and displaying disinhibited behavior. The patient's eyes are shut, and she only opens them when forced. There is a mention of word finding difficulties or replacement with similar sounding words at times. The patient's neck is supple, and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular examination shows regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 + S2 sounds, and there is no evidence of radiation. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), ischemic congestive heart failure, type I diabetes mellitus, anoxic brain injury, anxiety, depression, and chronic systolic congestive heart failure. The patient is currently in the ICU due to delirium, hypernatremia, ventricular arrhythmias with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), depression/anxiety, pacer pocket hematoma, elevated liver function tests, chronic systolic congestive heart failure, type I diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism, coccyx/heel ulcerations, and poor oral intake.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, agitation, hallucinations, and disorientation. This could potentially lead to falls, injuries, or difficulty in performing activities of daily living.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level, which can cause symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and coma if not corrected promptly.
3. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient has a history of ventricular arrhythmias and an ICD placement. There is a risk of recurrent arrhythmias, which may require further intervention.
4. Depression/anxiety: The patient has a history of depression and anxiety, which may worsen due to the current situation and could affect her overall well-being and recovery."

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and anoxic brain injury. She presented with delirium and ventricular tachycardia, for which an ICD placement was performed. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including depression and anxiety, as well as skin integrity issues such as a coccyx and heel ulceration. She is currently being treated in the ICU and is receiving various medications and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing severe delirium, which can lead to confusion, disorientation, and agitation. It is important to manage her delirium by limiting the use of benzodiazepines during the day, restoring her sleep/wake cycle, and considering further investigations such as repeating a head CT to rule out any thalamic lesion.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, indicated by an elevated serum sodium level. This condition requires free water repletion to correct the sodium imbalance and prevent complications like dehydration.

3. Ventricular Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of ventricular arrhythmias, and an ICD placement has been done. It is important to continue managing her arrhythmias with appropriate antiarrhythmic medications and monitoring.

4. Depression/Anxiety: The patient has a history of depression and anxiety, and she is"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of chronic ischemic heart failure, type 1 diabetes mellitus, anoxic brain injury, anxiety, and depression. She presents with altered mental status and an ICD placement for ventricular tachycardia. The patient is currently in the ICU due to delirium, hypernatremia, ventricular arrhythmias, depression/anxiety, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and previous history of anoxic brain injury may contribute to her delirium. It is important to manage this condition by limiting benzodiazepines during the day, restoring sleep/wake cycles, and considering repeat head CT scans.

2. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's chronic ischemic heart failure may lead to further complications if not properly managed. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is crucial to prevent exacerbations.

3. Ventricular Arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular tachycardia increases the risk of future arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring and appropriate medication adjustments, such as beta-blockers, are necessary to prevent cardiac complications.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels indicate hypernatremia. This condition requires careful management through free water repletion to avoid dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has coccyx and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions, ischemic congestive heart failure, type 1 diabetes mellitus, anoxic brain injury, anxiety, and depression. She presented with worsening mental status after the placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for ventricular tachycardia. She has been experiencing delirium, paranoia, and agitation, and her fever has been fluctuating. She has a penicillin allergy and is on various medications including heparin, lorazepam, metoprolol, and insulin. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but she has hypernatremia and impaired skin integrity. She also has multiple comorbidities including chronic systolic congestive heart failure, type 1 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective coping: The patient's altered mental status may lead to ineffective coping, as she is disheveled, uncooperative, restless, and confused with inappropriate answers.
2. Heart failure (CHF), systolic, chronic: The patient's history of ischemic CHF may contribute to her current condition, and it needs to be managed with appropriate medication and fluid balance.
3. Delirium/confusion: The patient's delirium and confusion are likely multifactorial, considering her recent hospitalization, poor oral intake,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), ischemic congestive heart failure (CHF), Type I diabetes mellitus (DM), anoxic brain injury, anxiety, and depression. She was admitted to the ICU for worsening mental status following implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement for ventricular tachycardia. The patient has been experiencing fever, delirium, paranoia, and agitation. She has a penicillin allergy and has been receiving antibiotics empirically due to suspected infection. The patient also has hypernatremia, which is likely secondary to hypovolemia, and impaired skin integrity. She requires repeat CT head, normalization of sleep-wake cycle, minimization of sedating medications, and neuro consultation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever, delirium, and paranoia suggest a possible infection, especially since she has been receiving antibiotics empirically. It is important to monitor her vital signs and complete blood cultures to identify the source of infection and appropriate treatment.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of CAD, multiple PCIs, and ICD placement for ventricular tachycardia, there is a risk of recurrent cardiac arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring of her heart rhythm is necessary, and beta-blockers should be continued.
3. Wound complications:"

   CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, [**3-12**] SM at LUSB without
   radiation.  L sided ICD with overlying ecchymosis, area somewhat firm,
   no erythema or warmth or fluctuance.  Ecchymosis over left
   chest/breast.
   Abdomen:  soft, appears non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds
   present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
   Ext: slightly cool, well perfused, 2+ DP pulses, no clubbing,
   cyanosis.  Trace LUE edema of upper arm, minimal LE edema.  R heel with
   deep decubitus with eschar.
   Neurologic: Alert. Oriented to person and variably to place. The major
   feature is her disturbed mental state: She was better groomed today
   (disheveled yesterday), more cooperative, clam this a.m., but restless,
   negative affect and low mood later with confusion and delusions,
   hallucinations. Later - inappropriate and often non-sense anwers,
   thought content is grave, violent with clang and other unusual

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 59F with CAD s/p multiple PCIs, ischemic CHF, Type
   I DM, Hx of Anoxic Brain Injury, Anxiety, Depression who presents with
   altered mental status sp ICD placement for ventricular tachycradia.
   # Mental Status
   Likely severe delirium with agitated features including delusions,
   incoherent thought process/psychosis. Likely hypoxic injury with
   possible superimposed degenerative disorder and decreased reserve with
   worsened mental status in context of infection. Drastic reduction in
   psychiatric medication regimen at OSH and continued because of
   prolonged QTc, torsades and a desire to see how the mental state will
   evolve in their absence, so that everything can be
   rationalized/re-dosed. Some difficulty with PO medication compliance.
   Anxiety/depression prior to hypoxic injury but previously superior
   intelligence and high function per Neuropsychology note. Given
   excoriation of left arm and left facial pain, [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6249**] thalamique is
   possible, consistent with earlier report of thalamic lesion on CT from
   OSH. This lesion cannot be new, however, based on our re-imaging.
   - Measures to reduce delirium
   - Minimize IVF/Telemetry/Foley
   - Ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11445**] to visit or call Neurology
   - Follow up cultures and treat infections
   # Ventricular Arrhythmias / Torsades du pointes
   - Telemetery
   - Continue beta blocker, IV if not taking
   - Avoid QT prolonging medications (EP reinforced this today
 no such
   medications until resolution of QTc, including Haldol)
   - Agressive repletion of potassium/magnesium (4.0 and 2.0)
   # Depression/Anxiety
   - Hold Abilify/Remeron and redose medication when mental status stable
   and perhaps improved by treatment of underlyin cause.
   # Pacer Pocket Hematoma
   EP think not infected. No warmth, erythema, or tenderness on palpation.
   Unlikely infection. No leukocytosis or fever. Follow for now.
   # Elevated Liver Function
   Continues to resolve. Trending down since mexiletine dc'd.
   - Trend LFTs
   # CAD s/p multiple PCI.
   - Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 369**]

","Summary:
This is a 59-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, multiple percutaneous coronary interventions, ischemic congestive heart failure, type I diabetes mellitus, and anoxic brain injury. She presented yesterday with worsening mental status following the placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for ventricular tachycardia. She has a fever of 101.4°F, and blood and urine cultures were obtained. She was started on vancomycin and aztreonam due to her penicillin allergy. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of delirium, paranoia, and agitation. She has a history of anxiety and depression. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing a drastic reduction in psychiatric medication regimen due to prolonged QTc. There is a possibility of a thalamic stroke or lesion, as evidenced by the CT scan. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, while her sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium levels are within normal range. Her creatinine level is slightly elevated at 2.2 mg/dL. The patient has chronic wounds on her left arm and heel. She is currently receiving aggressive fluid repletion and has been placed on a cardiac/diabetic diet.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever and is on empiric antibiotic therapy. It"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), type I diabetes mellitus (DM), and anoxic brain injury. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and an inserted implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for ventricular tachycardia. The patient has several medical complications including delirium, fever, impaired skin integrity, heart failure (CHF), and hypernatremia. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), blood pressure ranging from 148/64-164/144 mmHg, heart rate between 65-89 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 95% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and fever could be contributing to his delirium. It is important to provide psychiatric input and minimize medications that may worsen the condition. Restoring sleep-wake cycles and maintaining calmness can also help manage delirium.
2. Fever: The patient has had persistent fevers despite antibiotic treatment. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection and determine if adjustments to the current antibiotic regimen are necessary.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a coccyx"

   # Mental Status
   Worsened in the evening yesterday. See yesterday's note for discussion.
   Behaviorally difficult to manage last night - needed near constant
   supervision. Restraints avoided. Likely exacerbated by present
   infection.
   - Treat underlying infection
   - Wash out meds as much as possible and re-dose with help of psychiatry
   - wait for QTc to normalize, per EP
   - Measures to reduce invasive/tethering and delirium
   - Did not start depacote yesterday because we were concerned that it
   would take a while to have an effect and would not be so clear how this
   was helping
 today we see the wisdom and will d/w psychiatry further
   # Chest Pain and CAD
   Fleeting and unable to elicit all symptoms. Followed by brief nausea.
   EKG unremarkable, but could not draw enzymes until nearly 04:00 (not
   cooperative). Still some suspicion given history. Trop T is 0.02 this
   a.m. (negative in view of renal function).
   - One more set and EKG - continue rule-out if suspicion or further pain
   - Continue plavix and ASA (not been getting all given NPO)
   # Ventricular Arrhythmias / Torsades du pointes
   - Telemetery
   - Continue beta blocker, IV if not taking (order for PO also 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   was on 100 TID)
   - Avoid QT prolonging medications (EP reinforced this today
 no such
   medications until resolution of QTc, including Haldol)
   - Agressive repletion of potassium/magnesium (4.0 and 2.0)
   # Coccyx/Heel Ulcerations
   Chronic. Husband provides wound care at home and notes stability of
   wounds. Right heel ulceration with some mild erythema. Patient afebrile
   without leukocytosis.  Given signs of infection, diabetes and previous
   anaphylaxis with penicillin, will given vanc/aztreonam. Waffles boots
   in place.
   - Continue Vanc./Aztreonam
   # Pacer Pocket Hematoma
   Unlikely infected. Follow.
   # Depression/Anxiety
   - Hold Abilify/Remeron and redose medication when mental status stable
   and perhaps improved by treatment of underlying cause.
   # Elevated Liver Function
   Continued to resolve. Trending down since mexiletine dc'd.
   - Add-on for this a.m.
   # Chronic systolic CHF, ischemic.
   - Hold furosemide for now given minimal PO intake
   - Continue Metoprolol IV as above.
   # Type 1 DM
   Followed by [**Last Name (un) 276**]. Husband to bring in [**Last Name (un) 276**] Sliding Scale in AM.
   Last A1c 8.3%. On Levemir.
   - RISS only glargine 10 HS given near NPO
 will need to be increased
   as diet increases.
   - Followed by [**Last Name (un) 276**], Notify practitioner that present.
   # CKD
   Baseline Creatinine has ranged 2.0 to 3.0 since [**2112**]. Secondary to
   Diabetes. Creatinine at baseline.
   # Hypothyroidism: On replacement. TSH elevated. T4 Elevated. Synthroid
   decreased yesterday to 88 mcg QD.
   # Medications
   - Attempt transition back to oral agents.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes K>4 and Mag>2 , Cardiac/Diabetic
   diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, Pneumoboots, PPI

- EKG from [**2118-2-24**] 10:15 PM shows that the EP recommends continuing to hold off on haloperidol due to QTc prolongation, but waiting to see the EKG from today. The EP has increased the backup pacing rate to 75 to prevent escape premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).
- The patient became more disorganized later in the day and complained of chest pain. The EKG was normal, and enzymes were sent. The patient has a history of CAD, but it was difficult to get much detail about symptoms. The patient remained hemodynamically stable.
- Allergies include penicillins, unknown, and sulfa (sulfonamides) with a rash.
- The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on [**2118-2-23**] at 09:00 PM and aztreonam on [**2118-2-25**] at 12:15 AM.
- Current infusions include pantoprazole"

","The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post multiple percutaneous coronary interventions, ischemic congestive heart failure, Type I diabetes mellitus, history of anoxic brain injury, anxiety, and depression. She presents with altered mental status and underwent ICD placement for ventricular tachycardia.

The patient's 24-hour events include worsening mental status in the evening, disorganized behavior, chest pain with unremarkable EKG, and enzyme levels sent. She has allergies to penicillins and sulfa medications. The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 02/23/2018 at 09:00 PM and aztreonam on 02/25/2018 at 12:15 AM.

The patient is currently on several medications including pantoprazole (Protonix), lorazepam (Ativan), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), metoprolol, and other ICU medications. She also has ongoing medical and family history updates, review of systems unchanged from admission, and recent lab results.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 130/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The fluid balance shows a total in of 1,684 mL,"

   Physical Examination
   General: Peaceful early today when home nurse (of 10 years) present.
   Later was delusion with behavioral outburst, but overall improved from
   admission (see neurologic below also).
   HEENT: Sclera anicteric, PERRL 4->3 though only can see eyes when lids
   forced open.  MMM, oropharynx clear.
   Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD.
   Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly, without adventitious sounds.
   CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, [**3-12**] SM at LUSB without
   radiation.  L sided ICD with overlying ecchymosis, area somewhat firm,
   no erythema or warmth or fluctuance.  Ecchymosis over left
   chest/breast.
   Abdomen:  soft, appears non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds
   present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
   Ext: slightly cool, well perfused, 2+ DP pulses, no clubbing,
   cyanosis.  Trace LUE edema of upper arm, minimal LE edema.  R heel with
   deep decubitus with eschar.
   Neurologic: Alert. Oriented to person and variably to place. The major
   feature is her disturbed mental state: She was better groomed today
   (disheveled yesterday), more cooperative, clam this a.m., but restless,
   negative affect and low mood later with confusion and delusions,
   hallucinations. Later - inappropriate and often non-sense anwers,
   thought content is grave, violent with clang and other unusual
   associations and without insight.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), ischemic congestive heart failure, type 1 diabetes mellitus, anoxic brain injury, anxiety, and depression. She presents with altered mental status and has been placed on an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for ventricular tachycardia. 

24-hour events:
- EKG at 10:15 PM shows recommendations to continue holding off on haloperidol due to QT prolongation, but waiting to see EKG from today.
- Increased backup pacing rate to 75 to prevent escape premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).
- Patient's behavior became more disorganized later in the day.
- Complained of chest pain, but EKG was normal. Enzymes were sent, and the patient has a history of coronary artery disease, making it difficult to get much detail about symptoms. The patient remained hemodynamically stable.
- Allergies include penicillins and sulfa medications.
- Infusions include pantoprazole, lorazepam, heparin sodium, and metoprolol.

Vital signs:
- Temperature: 38.2°C (100.8°F)
- Heart rate: 80 bpm (75-91 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 130/56 mmHg (75/90-184/144 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute (11-29 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 97%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

Physical examination:
- General: Peaceful early today but later became delusional with behavioral outbursts.
- HEENT: Sclera anicteric, PERRL 4->3, clear mouth and oropharynx.
- Neck: Supple, JVP not elevated, no jugular venous distention (LAD).
- Lungs: Clear to auscultation anteriorly, without adventitious sounds.
- CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, 3-12 small moves at left upper sternal border without radiation. Left-sided ICD with overlying ecchymosis, area somewhat firm, no erythema or warmth or fluctuance. Ecchymosis over left chest/breast.
- Abdomen: Soft, appears non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly.
- Extremities: Slightly cool, well perfused, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis. Trace left upper extremity edema, minimal lower extremity edema. Right heel with deep decubitus with eschar.
- Neurologic: Alert, oriented to person and variably to place. Disturbed mental state including dishe"
