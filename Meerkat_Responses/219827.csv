","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a recent admission for painless jaundice following an ERCP procedure with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock and is currently intubated due to hypoxia. The source of sepsis is unclear, but potential sources include pulmonary or gastrointestinal systems. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluids to maintain CVP within the target range. Other issues include pleural effusions, a possible biliary stricture, a history of myocardial infarction, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, which can lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Pleural effusions: The patient has pleural effusions that may be caused by various factors including heart failure, pneumonia, or malignancy. If left untreated, these effusions can lead to respiratory distress or infection.
3. Biliary stricture: The patient has a history of biliary stricture requiring stent placement. If not properly managed, this condition can lead to complications such as cholangitis or jaundice.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure. If not treated promptly, this condition can progress to chronic renal failure.
5. History of myocardial infarction: The patient has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of septic shock. They have been experiencing dyspnea and are currently on mechanical ventilation with an oxygen delivery device set to aerosol-cool. Their heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and they have a central venous pressure of 16 mmHg. They are receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/50 to 78/26 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is also on phenylephrine infusion at a rate of 3.5 mcg/kg/min.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (34.8 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (12.6 g/dL), elevated blood urea nitrogen (39.3 %), decreased platelet count (295), and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient has been receiving fluids and blood products, with a total input of 1,653 mL and total output of 280 mL. Their respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with an ABG showing pH 7.36, PaCO2 46, PaO2 91, and FiO2 184.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease who presented with shock, respiratory distress, and leukocytosis. He underwent an ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent due to a high-grade stricture of the common bile duct. The patient required pressors and intubation for 48 hours during the procedure. Blood cultures were positive, indicating a likely septic shock, possibly with a cardiogenic component. The patient also had diarrhea and was on broad-spectrum antibiotics recently, so Clostridium difficile infection was considered. Other potential sources of infection include pneumonia and biliary source.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: Septic picture with positive blood cultures from OSH. Concerned for Clostridium difficile infection given significant diarrhea and recent antibiotic use. Other possibilities include pneumonia and biliary source. CVP goal of 10, using neo for MAP at least 65. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (change IV Flagyl to PO Vancomycin for C. difficile). Follow-up cultures and C. difficile test.
2. Hypoxemia: Likely due to pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. Possible underlying pneumonia. Check sputum culture, doubt biliary sepsis.
3. Atrial fibrillation: Rate better controlled on neo. Rx underlying issues and will try to add on beta-blocker"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yr old man with recent shock from biliary sepsis, heart failure,
   been at nursing home with significant diarrhea, new cough, SOB, and
   worsening lower ext edema now transferred with shock
   1.       Shock: Suspect septic picture with C diff as most concerning
   source
   CVP [**Location (un) 308**] [**7-8**] now, will continue volume resusitation to CVP closer to
   10
                 Meanwhile use levophed to maintain MAPs at 60, UOP,
                ++ Diarhhea and was on broad spectrum ABX recently- check
   C diff. very reassuring ABd exam,
                ++ Cough, Pleural effussions: possible PNA, check sputum
   cx, doubt
                ++ recent biliary sepsis but lfts much improved and no
   right upper
                 Check blood and urine cultures as well
                 Also concern for a cardiogenic component  - high BNP
   check Scvo2 -
   2. Hypoxemia: new O2 requirement, getting volume resuscitation,
   3. Afib: poorly rate controlled but is in shock and on levophed, Rx
   underlying issues and will try to add on bblocker when stable.
   Restart heparin when no immenent procedures
   4. ARF: pre renal and may be an ATN component, assess with volume
   resuscitation, trend Cr UOP Renally dose all meds

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease who presented to the ICU with shock, respiratory distress, and recent symptoms of diarrhea. The patient underwent an ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent for a high-grade stricture of the common bile duct. 

The patient's current conditions include shock, likely due to septic shock, with a suspected source of infection being Clostridium difficile (C. diff), recent antibiotic use, possible pneumonia, or biliary source. The patient also has hypoxemia, possibly secondary to pleural effusions and pulmonary edema, as well as acute respiratory failure, pre-renal acute kidney injury (ARF) with a possible component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and atrial fibrillation that is not rate-controlled. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 111 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 93/67 mmHg to 119/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 34.8 K/uL, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, elevated liver enzymes,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old male with atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI). He recently underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement for a high-grade stricture of the common bile duct (CBD). The patient experienced shock, respiratory distress, and required pressors and intubation for 48 hours during the procedure. Brushings were ""atypical"" and CA [**65**]-9 levels were very elevated, raising suspicion for pancreatic cancer.
- The patient was transferred from another facility with shock, hypoxemia, leukocytosis (WBC 30K with 40% bands), and a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 10K. He is likely experiencing septic shock, although there may be a cardiogenic component as well.
- The patient's medical history includes significant diarrhea, a new cough, shortness of breath (SOB), and worsening lower extremity edema. His vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 111 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 93/67 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99% on supplemental oxygen.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease who presented with shock, respiratory distress, and leukocytosis. He underwent an ERCP procedure and was found to have elevated CA 9-65 levels, suspicious for pancreatic cancer. He required intubation and pressors for 48 hours. He is now in the ICU with presumed septic shock, likely due to a bacterial infection indicated by positive blood cultures from OSH. Other potential sources of infection include Clostridium difficile, pneumonia, and a possible biliary source. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and will have further cultures done. His pleural effusions and pulmonary edema are being evaluated. His atrial fibrillation rate is better controlled, and he will be restarted on heparin when not undergoing procedures. Renal function is impaired, and wound care consults have been ordered due to pressure ulcers. His cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating no ongoing myocardial infarction. The patient is on NPO status and requires significant supplemental oxygen. His central venous line needs to be repositioned, and attempts will be made to place an arterial line."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 82 M w/ recent admission for painless jaundice s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy and biliary stent c/b hypoxia requiring intubation,
   admitted with septic shock
   .
   Septic Shock: On admission was febrile, WBC > 30 with bandemia,
   tachycardic, increased RR.  Now with GPC in blood.  Unclear source, but
   must consider endocarditis, pulmonary, decubiti or GI source given
   recent diarrhea.  Patient without abdominal pain or jaundice to suggest
   acute cholangitis.
   f/u Sputum, Blood, Urine Cx, Cdiff x 3
   1.        Will treat broadly with Vanc/Zosyn/PO Vanco for C. Diff
   2.        Titrate CVP to 10, bolus as needed
   3.        Switched to phenylephrine to avoid beta adrtenergic effect of
   levophed and resulting tachycardia.  Added vasopressin this AM.  Check
   Mixed Venous O2 sat.  Adjust PRN.  Might need dobutamine for inotrpoic
   support.
   4.        Transfuse as needed for Hct>30 if MvO2 is < 70%
   5.        Basal cortisol level wnl, no [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   6.        Line re-positioned, f/u culture of tip although unlikely
   source as placed less than 36 hours ago at OSH.
   7.        TTE for endocarditis.  If negative would get CT Scan
   chest/abdomen looking for abdomen.  ?osteo underlying wounds.
   8.        Wound care consult.
   9.        CT Chest today for ? effusion/pneumonia.
   .
   Hypoxia: Patient comfortable on 6L.  He is willing to be intubated.
   Hypoxia likely a result of pleural effusions, sepsis, volume
   recuscitation.
   1.        ABG this AM 7.35/45/132
   2.        Continue nasal cannula at this point.
   3.        Daily CXR
   4.        Add nebulizer prn
   .
   Pleural effusions: may be malignant pleural effusions vs. chf vs. pna
   1.        ECHO, cycle enzymes, daily EKG
   2.        Empirically treat for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: likely pre-renal from sepsis/hypotension.  UOP has
   dropped off this morning, and now with rising Cr/lactate.  Added
   vasopressin for second pressor and goal of improved renal perfusion.
   Goal MAP of 70 for today.
   1.        Follow Cr.
   .
   Biliary stricture: Patient with recent admission for painless jaudince
   requiring biliary stent and sphincterotomy.  Patient due to stent
   change in [**2155-6-1**].  Patient does not appear to have clinical signs of
   cholangitis at this point.
   1.        NPO for now
   2.        Trend LFTs
   3.        empirically treat with Zosyn for biliary organisms
   .
   CAD: MI in [**2106**]'s.  Give high dose ASA.  Enzymes negative x1 - and with
   negative set at OSH more than 12 hours apart.  No need to cycle
   further.
   .
   PUMP: Hold antihypertensives, pressors as needed.  Will repeat ECHO.
   Patient grossly volume overloaded, and may require aggressive diuresis
   once he's off pressors.
   .
   RHYTHM: known afib on coumadin.  Hold coumadin. Rate much improved
   after switch to neosynephrine.
   .
   ARF: Cr up to 1.9 from basline.
   1.        urine lytes show FENA 0.2%, pre-renal vs ATN in setting
   hypotension

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU for painless jaundice following an ERCP procedure with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement. The patient is currently experiencing septic shock and has been intubated due to hypoxia.

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia (heart rate of 110 bpm), low blood pressure (93/62 mmHg), and decreased oxygen saturation (91%). The patient is also febrile and has an elevated white blood cell count with bandemia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels and rising creatinine, indicating possible acute renal failure. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is low, suggesting poor tissue perfusion.

Imaging shows a large right pleural effusion and a small left pleural effusion. The tip of the new right IJ line ends in the lower SVC, and the right subclavian line tip projects over the superior cavoatrial junction.

The patient's medical history includes a myocardial infarction in 2006 and recent admission for painless jaundice requiring biliary stent placement. The patient is also known to have atrial fibrillation on coumadin.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Endocarditis: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent biliary procedures, there is a concern for possible endocarditis. A trans"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), and recent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for a high-grade stricture of the common bile duct. The patient presented to the emergency room with shock, leukocytosis, and hypoxemia. 

The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, respiratory distress, and presumed sepsis with leukocytosis/bandemia. The possible sources of bacteremia include bowel and skin (decubitus ulcers). There is also a suspicion of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) given the significant diarrhea and recent antibiotic use, although the initial CDI test was negative. Additionally, there is a concern for possible pneumonia (pna).

The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn/IV vancomycin/po vancomycin) and vasopressors for hemodynamic support. The goal is to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) of at least 10, mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65, and oxygen consumption index (CvO2) recheck. The patient's chest X-ray shows worsening right-sided effusion.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening septic shock, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (AK"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), and recent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for a high-grade stricture of the common bile duct. The patient presented to the emergency room in shock, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 30,000 cells/microliter and 40% bands, and hypoxemia.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Shock: Presumed sepsis with leukocytosis/bandemia and initial central venous oxygen saturation (CvO2) of 75. Possible sources of infection include the bowel and skin. Concerned for Clostridium difficile infection given significant diarrhea and recent antibiotic use (although initial test was negative) and possible pneumonia. Goal central venous pressure (CVP) around 10, norepinephrine (neo) and vasopressin for mean arterial pressure (MAP) at least 65, recheck CvO2, continue broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn/IV vancomycin), change IV Flagyl to oral vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection, follow-up chest computed tomography (CT), check for c diff, and consider steroids empirically if increasing pressor requirements due to the risk of adrenal dysfunction.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous myocardial infarction (MI), and recent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for a high-grade stricture of the common bile duct. The patient presented to the emergency room in shock, leukocytosis, and hypoxemia. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: Presumed sepsis with leukocytosis/bandemia and cardiac output (CvO2) of 75. Possible infectious sources include positive blood cultures from outside hospital, concern for Clostridium difficile given significant diarrhea and recent antibiotic use. Other possibilities include pneumonia and biliary source, although liver function tests improved and abdominal examination is not concerning.
- Goal CVP around 10, neo for mean arterial pressure (MAP) at least 65.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn/IV vancomycin) and change IV Flagyl to oral vancomycin for C. difficile.
- Follow-up cultures (including from outside hospital), C. difficile.
- Consider steroids empirically if increasing pressor requirements. At risk of adrenal dysfunction.
- Checking transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE). Doubt tamponade given low CVP but need to consider in differential given effusion, malignancy, etc.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction, and recent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for a high-grade stricture of the common bile duct. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to shock, leukocytosis, and hypoxemia. The patient's condition has been critical, requiring pressors, intubation, and various interventions.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Shock: The patient is presumed to have septic shock, which is characterized by low blood pressure, decreased cardiac output, and poor tissue perfusion. It is important to continue aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient has hypoxemia, likely due to pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. This requires close monitoring and management of the patient's oxygenation status.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's oliguric acute renal failure (ARF) suggests the development of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). It is important to monitor the patient's urine output, electrolyte levels, and renal function tests.

4. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CAD and was on Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. His cardiac enzymes were negative,"

   with months to live from his gastroenterologist as he has pancreatic

   admitted with septic shock
   .
   Septic Shock: On admission was febrile, WBC > 30 with bandemia,
   tachycardic, increased RR.  Now with GPC in blood.  Unclear source, but
   must consider endocarditis, pulmonary, decubiti or GI source given
   recent instrumentation.  Patient without abdominal pain or jaundice to
   suggest acute cholangitis.

   f/u Sputum, Blood, Urine Cx, Cdiff x 3 - MRSA+ Bacteremia - unclear
   source, ? parapneumonic effusion, endocarditis, complication of biliary
   stent placement.
   1.        Will treat broadly with Vanc/Zosyn/PO Vanco for C. Diff -
   consider d/c zosyn today.
   2.        Titrate CVP to 10, bolus as needed
   3.        Switched to phenylephrine to avoid beta adrtenergic effect of
   levophed and resulting tachycardia.  Added vasopressin this AM.  Check
   Mixed Venous O2 sat.  Adjust PRN.  Might need dobutamine for inotrpoic
   support but would defer at this time.
   4.        Transfuse as needed for Hct>30 if MvO2 is < 70%.
   5.        Basal cortisol level wnl, no [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   6.        Line re-positioned, f/u culture of tip.
   7.        TTE for endocarditis.  If negative would get CT Scan
   chest/abdomen looking for abdomen.  ?osteo underlying wounds.
   8.        Wound care consult.
   9.        Consider thoracentesis of effusion
   .
   Hypoxia: Patient comfortable on 6L.  He is willing to be intubated.
   Hypoxia likely a result of pleural effusions, sepsis, volume
   recuscitation.
   1.        ABG this AM 7.35/45/132
   2.        Continue nasal cannula at this point.
   3.        Daily CXR
   4.        Add nebulizer prn
   .
   Pleural effusions: may be malignant pleural effusions vs. chf vs. pna
   1.        ECHO, cycle enzymes, daily EKG
   2.        Empirically treat for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn
 d/c zosyn once
   more stable.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: likely pre-renal from sepsis/hypotension.  UOP has
   dropped off this morning, and now with rising Cr/lactate.  Added
   vasopressin for second pressor and goal of improved renal perfusion.
   Goal MAP of 70 for today.
   1.        Follow Cr.

   Biliary stricture: Patient with recent admission for painless jaudince
   requiring biliary stent and sphincterotomy.  Patient due to stent
   change in [**2155-6-1**].  Patient does not appear to have clinical signs of
   cholangitis at this point.
   1.        NPO for now
   2.        Trend LFTs
   3.        empirically treat with Zosyn for biliary organisms
   .
   CAD: MI in [**2106**]'s.  Give high dose ASA.  Enzymes negative x1 - and with
   negative set at OSH more than 12 hours apart.  No need to cycle
   further.
   .
   PUMP: Hold antihypertensives, pressors as needed.  Will repeat ECHO.
   Patient grossly volume overloaded, and may require aggressive diuresis
   once he's off pressors.
   .
   RHYTHM: known afib on coumadin.  Hold coumadin. Rate much improved
   after switch to neosynephrine.
   .
   ARF: Cr up to 1.9 from basline.
   1.        urine lytes show FENA 0.2%, pre-renal vs ATN in setting
   hypotension
   .

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of pancreatic cancer, admitted to the ICU for painless jaundice after undergoing an ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement. He developed septic shock and was intubated. The patient has multiple comorbidities including atherosclerotic disease, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a face tent, receiving multiple pressors, and has a pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition suggests ongoing sepsis due to MRSA bacteremia. This requires aggressive management with appropriate antibiotics and source control measures.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory acidosis indicate respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and optimization of oxygen delivery, possibly through tracheostomy, may be necessary.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The rising serum creatinine levels and oliguria suggest pre-renal acute kidney injury due to hypotension and sepsis. Renal perfusion needs to be optimized with fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure increases the risk of cardiac complications, including myocardial ischemia or infarction. Echocardiogram and serial cardiac enzyme measurements are needed to monitor cardiac function.

   -Family  meeting held with daughters where the decision was made to
   make him DNR/DNI, with NO escalation of care (ie, no new invasive
   procedures/ or work-ups).  Basically he was given a very poor prognosis
   with months to live from his gastroenterologist as he has pancreatic
   cancer.  He does not know this diagnosis yet, only his daughters do, so
   they were very reasonable about goals of care.  They will get back to
   us on possibly making him CMO, and would like input from his GI doctor
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2655**], whom I emailed
   -Blood cultures came back 4/4 bottles with MRSA
   -We were unable to wean pressors due to low MAPs
   -We got a CT to better characterize his pleural effusion on CXR, and it
   showed a white out of the right lung with effusion, and a complete lung
   collapse with mucous plugging.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male admitted to the ICU with painless jaundice, hypoxia requiring intubation, and septic shock. He was treated for suspected cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement. The patient's condition has worsened, and he now presents with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock characterized by fever, high white blood cell count, tachycardia, and increased respiratory rate. Despite treatment, his condition remains critical.

2. MRSA Bacteremia: Blood cultures have confirmed MRSA bacteremia, indicating a severe systemic infection. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics is necessary to control the infection.

3. Pleural Effusions: Imaging studies show large pleural effusions causing complete collapse of the right lung and partial collapse of the left lung. These effusions may be malignant, due to congestive heart failure, or secondary to pneumonia.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is likely experiencing pre-renal acute renal failure due to sepsis and hypotension. His urine output has decreased, and his creatinine levels are rising. Vasopressin has been added to improve renal perfusion.

5. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and known atrial fibrillation. His heart rhythm is currently controlled with ant"

   -Family  meeting held with daughters where the decision was made to
   make him DNR/DNI, with NO escalation of care (ie, no new invasive
   procedures/ or work-ups).  Basically he was given a very poor prognosis
   with months to live from his gastroenterologist as he has pancreatic
   cancer.  He does not know this diagnosis yet, only his daughters do, so
   they were very reasonable about goals of care.  They will get back to
   us on possibly making him CMO, and would like input from his GI doctor

   -Blood cultures came back 4/4 bottles with MRSA
   -We were unable to wean pressors due to low MAPs

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, coronary artery disease post-myocardial infarction, and recent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement for a high-grade stricture of the common bile duct. The patient presented with shock, leukocytosis, and hypoxemia.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues. He has been diagnosed with presumed sepsis due to MRSA bacteremia and possible gastrointestinal or skin infection. The patient also has a high white blood cell count with bands, indicating a bacterial infection. There is concern for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection due to significant diarrhea and recent antibiotic use, although the initial C. diff test was negative. The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with large pleural effusions causing partial lung collapse and hypoxemia.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with persistent hypotension and the need for vasopressor support. He is also tachycardic with a heart rate of 113 beats per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is low at 77%. His blood glucose level is elevated at 167 mg/dL, and he has metabolic acidosis.

Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, abnormal renal function, and low albumin. Imaging studies reveal large pleural eff"

   Final Report
   HISTORY: Bilateral pleural effusions. Evaluate for underlying
   pneumonia.
   TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the chest
   without
   intravenous contrast. Contrast was withheld due to elevated BUN and
   creatinine levels. 5-mm, 1.25-mm, and coronal reformations were
   evaluated.
   CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST
   Comparison is made to multiple prior radiograph and prior CTA dated
   [**2155-4-15**].
   FINDINGS: The entire right lung is collapsed, and there is a large
   right
   simple pleural effusion occupying the entire right hemithorax, with
   fluid
   extension into the lateral chest wall. The left upper lobe, lingula,
   and
   superior segment of the left lower lobe remain aerated, with the
   basilar
   segments displaying atelectasis due to compression from an adjacent
   moderate
   simple left pleural effusion. The aerated lung appears clear, and
   without
   evidence of pneumonia. No pathologically enlarged central or axillary
   lymph
   nodes are identified. Secretions are noted within the central airway.
   There is
   a small pericardial effusion and atherosclerotic calcification noted
   within
   the right and left coronary circulation and aortic root and valve. The
   main
   pulmonary artery and right pulmonary artery are dilated, measuring
   greater
   than 3 cm, likely related to elevated pressures from the large
   effusions and
   atelectasis. Right IJ catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
   This examination was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation. The
   imaged
   portion of the upper abdomen displays placement of a biliary stent with
   significant improvement/resolution of intrahepatic biliary ductal
   dilatation,
   but persistent pancreatic ductal dilatation and stable appearance to
   duodenal
   diverticulum, large simple exophytic left upper pole renal cyst, and
   hyperdense right interpolar 2 cm renal cyst. The degree of ascites
   within the
   abdomen is slightly increased from [**2155-4-15**] exam.
   BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint are noted
   bilaterally. There are multilevel degenerative changes within the
   spine. No
   malignant-appearing osseous lesions are identified.
   CT Chest Impression:
   .
   1. No evidence of pneumonia. Large right pleural effusion causing
   complete
   collapse of the right lung, which was previously partially aerated.
   Component
   of mucus plugging may be superimposed and continued radiographic
   follow-up
   needed. Moderate left pleural effusion causing complete atelectasis of
   the
   basilar left lower lobe segments. Right chest wall edema.
   .
   2. Atherosclerotic calcifications within the aorta and coronary
   circulation.
   .
   3. Interval increase in intra-abdominal ascites, with resolution of
   previously identified intrahepatic biliary dilatation and stable
   appearance to
   simple and hyperdense renal lesions better described on previously
   performed
   dedicated CT abdomen. Pancreatic ductal dilatation persists.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 82 M w/ recent admission for painless jaundice s/p ERCP with
   sphincterotomy and biliary stent c/b hypoxia requiring intubation,
   admitted with septic shock
   .
   Septic Shock: On admission was febrile, WBC > 30 with bandemia,
   tachycardic, increased RR.  Now with GPC in blood.  Unclear source, but
   must consider endocarditis, pulmonary, decubiti or GI source given
   recent instrumentation.  Patient without abdominal pain or jaundice to
   suggest acute cholangitis.
   .
   Goals of Care: Will need to meet with family today to discuss goals of
   care
 currently no escalation of care.
   .
   f/u Sputum, Blood, Urine Cx, Cdiff x 3 - MRSA+ Bacteremia - unclear
   source, ? parapneumonic effusion, endocarditis, complication of biliary
   stent placement.
   1.        Will treat broadly with Vanc/Zosyn/PO Vanco for C. Diff -
   consider d/c zosyn today as empirirc.
   2.        Titrate CVP to 10, bolus as needed
   3.        Switched to phenylephrine to avoid beta adrtenergic effect of
   levophed and resulting tachycardia.  Added vasopressin this AM.  Check
   Mixed Venous O2 sat.  Adjust PRN.  Might need dobutamine for inotrpoic
   support but would defer at this time.
   4.        Transfuse as needed for Hct>30 if MvO2 is < 70%.
   5.        Basal cortisol level wnl, no [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   6.        Line re-positioned, f/u culture of tip.
   7.        TTE for endocarditis -> limited study.
   8.        Wound care consult.
   9.        Consider thoracentesis of effusion, imaging of abdomen.
   .
   Hypoxia: Patient comfortable on 6L.  He is willing to be intubated.
   Hypoxia likely a result of pleural effusions, sepsis, volume
   recuscitation.
   1.        ABG this AM 7.35/45/132
   2.        Continue nasal cannula at this point.
   3.        Daily CXR
   4.        Add nebulizer prn
   .
   Pleural effusions: may be malignant pleural effusions vs. chf vs. pna
   1.        ECHO, cycle enzymes, daily EKG
   2.        Empirically treat for HAP with Vanc/Zosyn
 d/c zosyn once
   more stable.
   .
   Acute Renal Failure: likely pre-renal from sepsis/hypotension.  UOP has
   dropped off this morning, and now with rising Cr/lactate.  Added
   vasopressin for second pressor and goal of improved renal perfusion.
   Goal MAP of 70 for today.
   1.        Follow Cr.
   .
   Biliary stricture: Patient with recent admission for painless jaudince
   requiring biliary stent and sphincterotomy.  Patient due to stent
   change in [**2155-6-1**].  Patient does not appear to have clinical signs of
   cholangitis at this point.
   1.        NPO for now
   2.        Trend LFTs
   3.        empirically treat with Zosyn for biliary organisms
   .
   CAD: MI in [**2106**]'s.  Give high dose ASA.  Enzymes negative x1 - and with
   negative set at OSH more than 12 hours apart.  No need to cycle

   Patient grossly volume overloaded, and may require aggressive diuresis
   once he's off pressors.
   .
   RHYTHM: known afib on coumadin.  Hold coumadin. Rate much improved
   after switch to neosynephrine.
   .
   ARF: Cr up to 1.9 from basline.
   1.        urine lytes show FENA 0.2%, pre-renal vs ATN in setting
   hypotension
   .
   Nutrition: Consult for low albumin.
   1.             Would restart regular diet if possible although with
   respiratory status.  Discuss goals of care with family.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male admitted with painless jaundice following an ERCP procedure. He was intubated due to hypoxia and diagnosed with septic shock. The patient's current condition includes MRSA bacteremia, large right pleural effusion causing complete collapse of the right lung, moderate left pleural effusion causing atelectasis of the basilar segments of the left lower lobe, and atherosclerotic calcifications within the aorta and coronary circulation. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with tachycardia and hypotension. He is receiving vasopressin and phenylephrine for hemodynamic support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of fever, elevated white blood cell count with bandemia, and tachycardia indicates sepsis. The presence of MRSA bacteremia further supports this diagnosis. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics are crucial in managing sepsis.

2. Respiratory Failure: The large right pleural effusion has resulted in complete collapse of the right lung, leading to significant respiratory compromise. Thoracentesis may be necessary to relieve the pleural effusion and improve oxygenation. The patient's hypoxia requires careful monitoring and potential intubation if necessary.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest acute renal failure"

   Final Report
   HISTORY: Bilateral pleural effusions. Evaluate for underlying
   pneumonia.
   TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the chest
   without
   intravenous contrast. Contrast was withheld due to elevated BUN and
   creatinine levels. 5-mm, 1.25-mm, and coronal reformations were
   evaluated.
   CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST
   Comparison is made to multiple prior radiograph and prior CTA dated
   [**2155-4-15**].
   FINDINGS: The entire right lung is collapsed, and there is a large
   right
   simple pleural effusion occupying the entire right hemithorax, with
   fluid
   extension into the lateral chest wall. The left upper lobe, lingula,
   and
   superior segment of the left lower lobe remain aerated, with the
   basilar
   segments displaying atelectasis due to compression from an adjacent
   moderate
   simple left pleural effusion. The aerated lung appears clear, and
   without
   evidence of pneumonia. No pathologically enlarged central or axillary
   lymph
   nodes are identified. Secretions are noted within the central airway.
   There is
   a small pericardial effusion and atherosclerotic calcification noted
   within
   the right and left coronary circulation and aortic root and valve. The
   main
   pulmonary artery and right pulmonary artery are dilated, measuring
   greater
   than 3 cm, likely related to elevated pressures from the large
   effusions and
   atelectasis. Right IJ catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
   This examination was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation. The
   imaged
   portion of the upper abdomen displays placement of a biliary stent with
   significant improvement/resolution of intrahepatic biliary ductal
   dilatation,
   but persistent pancreatic ductal dilatation and stable appearance to
   duodenal
   diverticulum, large simple exophytic left upper pole renal cyst, and
   hyperdense right interpolar 2 cm renal cyst. The degree of ascites
   within the
   abdomen is slightly increased from [**2155-4-15**] exam.
   BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint are noted
   bilaterally. There are multilevel degenerative changes within the
   spine. No
   malignant-appearing osseous lesions are identified.
   CT Chest Impression:
   .
   1. No evidence of pneumonia. Large right pleural effusion causing
   complete
   collapse of the right lung, which was previously partially aerated.
   Component
   of mucus plugging may be superimposed and continued radiographic
   follow-up
   needed. Moderate left pleural effusion causing complete atelectasis of
   the
   basilar left lower lobe segments. Right chest wall edema.
   .
   2. Atherosclerotic calcifications within the aorta and coronary
   circulation.
   .
   3. Interval increase in intra-abdominal ascites, with resolution of
   previously identified intrahepatic biliary dilatation and stable
   appearance to
   simple and hyperdense renal lesions better described on previously
   performed
   dedicated CT abdomen. Pancreatic ductal dilatation persists.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of recent admission for painless jaundice following ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement. He presented with hypoxia requiring intubation, septic shock, and now shows signs of delirium. The patient has multiple comorbidities including CAD, ARF, and possible biliary stricture. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia and GPC in the blood. The patient's vital signs are unstable with hypotension and tachycardia. He has a large right pleural effusion causing complete collapse of the right lung, moderate left pleural effusion causing atelectasis in the basilar segments of the left lower lobe, and a small pericardial effusion. The patient's renal function is worsening, and he has elevated liver enzymes. There is no evidence of pneumonia, but there is evidence of atherosclerotic calcifications in the aorta and coronary circulation. The patient's mental status is deteriorating, likely due to worsening renal failure, uremia, infection, and other toxic derangements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for MRSA bacteremia, indicating an ongoing infection. Given the presence of septic shock on admission, the patient is at risk of further complications related to sepsis.
2. ARDS (Ac"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old male with recent admission for painless jaundice following ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement. He is currently admitted with septic shock, hypoxia requiring intubation, and a positive blood culture for MRSA bacteremia. The patient's goals of care need to be discussed with the family, as there is no escalation of care planned at this time.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. MRSA bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for MRSA, indicating a systemic infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as Vanc/Zosyn/PO Vanco, should be initiated to cover for MRSA. The source of the bacteremia is unclear, but possible sources include endocarditis, pulmonary infection, decubitus ulcers, or gastrointestinal infection.

2. Pleural effusions: The patient has large right pleural effusion causing complete collapse of the right lung and moderate left pleural effusion causing atelectasis of the basilar left lower lobe segments. This could be due to malignant pleural effusions, congestive heart failure (CHF), or pneumonia. Further evaluation with an echocardiogram and daily chest X-rays is recommended.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has a rising creatinine level and oliguria, indicating pre-renal acute kidney injury likely secondary to sepsis and hypotension. Vasopressin was added"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, coronary artery disease post myocardial infarction, and a recent admission for ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement for a high-grade common bile duct stricture. The patient presented with shock and required pressors and intubation. He was transferred from OSH with septic shock due to MRSA bacteremia, large bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, leukocytosis, and progressive acute renal failure. The patient's overall prognosis is poor, and there are ongoing discussions regarding goals of care and transitioning from DNR/DNI without escalation to comfort care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient initially presented with shock, which required pressors and intubation. The source of the shock is suspected to be MRSA bacteremia with possible sources including the lungs, bowel, or skin. There is concern for ongoing infection and potential complications such as septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Hypoxemia/Respiratory Distress: The patient has hypoxemia and respiratory distress likely due to large bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and possible pneumonia (BNP 10K at OSH). Diuretic use is limited due to the need for pressors. The patient continues to require broad-spectrum antibiotics and may require morphine for"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, coronary artery disease, and recent admission for ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement. He presented with shock requiring pressors and intubation. The patient was transferred from OSH with shock, leukocytosis, and hypoxemia. He has been critically ill and has not tolerated weaning off the ventilator.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Shock - due to MRSA bacteremia, possible sources include the lungs/pulmonary effusions, bowel, and skin (decubitus). Continue pressor support, weaning as tolerated, and broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn/IV vancomycin/po vancomycin). Consider tapping effusion and re-imaging of the abdomen.

2. Hypoxemia/respiratory distress - due to pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and probable pneumonia. Abx as above. Continue BiPAP as tolerated. The patient's family understands the poor prognosis and the risks associated with potentially therapeutic interventions such as bronchoscopic intervention.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF) - likely acute tubular necrosis/intravascular depletion from sepsis. Trend urine output and creatinine.

4. Leukocytosis - trending down slowly but remains elevated with multiple potential sources including infected pleural fluid and Clostridium difficile"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.0 degrees Celsius (96.8 degrees Fahrenheit), a heart rate of 112 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 81/64 to 96/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and atrial fibrillation as the heart rhythm. The patient's weight is currently 92.5 kg, which is slightly higher than the admission weight of 91.5 kg. The patient's height is 67 inches.

Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 0 mmHg. The patient has received a total of 339 mL of fluids since midnight, with 26 mL coming from total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient's blood products output is 291 mL, and urine output is also 291 mL. The net fluid balance since midnight is 48 mL.

The patient is on respiratory support using a nasal cannula and the oxygen delivery device. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided in the note. Physical examination findings include unassessed peripheral vascular status, skin, neurologic response"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, coronary artery disease with a history of myocardial infarction, and recent admission for ERCP with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement for high-grade common bile duct stricture caused by shock. The patient was intubated and required pressors for 48 hours after the procedure. Brushings during the procedure were atypical and CA 65-9 levels were very elevated, suspicious for pancreatic cancer.
