   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   The pt is a 74-yo woman w/ hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   hypothyroidism, and a recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer vs. lymphoma,
   who presented to the ED for evaluation today for acute renal failure
   s/p contast CT. The pt notes that she has been feeling increasingly SOB
   and weak over the last couple days, with an episode of dizziness /
   lightheadedness on the day prior to admission. The pt has not been
   eating well over the last few days and had an episode of nausea /
   vomiting on the day prior to admission. She had an abdominal ultrasound
   done on the day prior to admission for evaluation for paracentesis, and
   labs drawn that day showed worsening renal function, so she was called
   to come in to the ED today for evaluation.
   .
   On arrival in the ED: VS - Temp 97.5F, HR 100, BP 111/70, R 20, O2-sat
   91% RA. Labs were significant for K 7.8, BUN 116 / Cr 7.2, WBC 14.3 w/
   92% PMNs, and lactate 2.0. CXR revealed a large left pleural effusion
   and ECG was low voltage. Pulsus was 10, so a bedside TTE was done to
   eval for tamponade, which revealed a mild pericardial effusion without
   tamponade physiology. She was treated with IVF, calcium gluconate,
   insulin w/ dextrose, Kayexelate, and albuterol nebs. She was also given
   levofloxacin x1 for ? pneumonia. She is being admitted to the MICU for
   evaluation and treatment of her hyperkalemia and acute renal failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate. The pt
   has had mild improvement in her potassium level.
   - cont Kayexelate
   - cont Lactulose + other bowel regimen, titrate to bowel movement
   - monitor K Q4hrs for now
   - serial ECGs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy from the Contrast CT she had approx 48 hours earlier, and
   post-obstructive renal failure from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor
   burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n. Seen by renal in ED, who feel no
   emergent need for HD tonight. Would aggressively volume resuscitate
   given her significant volume depletion.
   - HD team aware, considering HD in AM if not improved overnight
   - appreciate HD Renal team recs
   - IVF 1L NS bolus x1hr, followed by maintencance NS 1L @ 100cc/hr
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - cont to check chem 10 Q4hrs
   - f/[**Location 39**] read of bilateral renal U/S (moderate right
   hydronephrosis, no left hydronephrosis)
   .
   #. Hypertension - holding home ACE-I and Lasix
   - f/[**Location 39**] read on TTE
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home levothyroxine

She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient reported feeling increasingly short of breath and weak over the last few days, along with an episode of dizziness/lightheadedness prior to admission. She also experienced nausea/vomiting and had an abdominal ultrasound done for evaluation of paracentesis. Laboratory results showed worsening renal function, leading to her being called in for further evaluation.

On arrival in the emergency department, vital signs included a temperature of 97.5Â°F, heart rate of 100, blood pressure of 111/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20, and oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. Laboratory findings revealed elevated potassium levels (K 7.8), elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN 116), and elevated creatinine (Cr 7.2). A chest X-ray revealed a large left pleural effusion, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) showed low voltage. A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed to evaluate for tamponade, revealing a mild pericardial effusion without tamponade physiology.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory distress:  Large left effusion, could be malignant and
   likely causing her respiratory distress.  Will do large volume
   thoracentesis.  RV dysfunction is also worrisome
   for PE.  Will try gettinga  V/Q scan after thoracentesis.
   Cancer:  Ovarian versus lymphoma.  Will send ovarian tumour markers.
   Will need LN biopsy - surgical consult.
   ARF:  Contrast dye, obstructive.  Will consult urology re: hydro.  Good
   chance she may need dialysis await renal input.
   hyperk:  Continue kayexalate, continue HCO3.
   metabolic acidosis:  Push amps of bicarb.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory distress:  Large left effusion, could be malignant and
   likely causing her respiratory distress.  Will do large volume
   thoracentesis.  RV dysfunction is also worrisome
   for PE.  Will try gettinga  V/Q scan after thoracentesis.
   Cancer:  Ovarian versus lymphoma.  Will send ovarian tumour markers.
   Will need LN biopsy - surgical consult.
   ARF:  Contrast dye, obstructive.  Will consult urology re: hydro.  Good
   chance she may need dialysis await renal input.
   hyperk:  Continue kayexalate, continue HCO3.
   metabolic acidosis:  Push amps of bicarb.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with acute renal failure. She presented with evidence of ARF on routine lab tests and in the emergency department. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 98/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has been treated for hyperkalemia with fluids, calcium, Kayexalate, and bicarbonate. She also received levofloxacin for possible pneumonia on the left side. 

The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for fatigue, dry mouth, dyspnea, oliguria, anemia, and chest pain. The patient's physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds on the right side, soft and distended abdomen, bilateral edema in the extremities, and no skin abnormalities. 

Flowsheet data indicates that the patient has received a total of 2,375 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an output of 10 mL of urine. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, ranging from 79/33 mmHg to 110/56 mmHg. Oxygen delivery is through a nasal cannula, and the patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.26, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, PaO2 of 111 mmHg, HCO3 of 16 mEq/L, and base excess of -10. 

Laboratory results include a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, leukocyte count of 522 K/uL, platelet count of 538, creatinine level of 7.1 mg/dL, potassium level of 7.3 mg/dL, sodium level of 116 mg/dL, chloride level of 99 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 16 mEq/L, and glucose level of 112 mg/dL. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, Amylase/Lipase, and electrolytes are also provided. Imaging shows a large left-sided effusion on the chest X-ray. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to a large left effusion, which could be malignant and causing respiratory distress. A large volume thoracentesis will be performed. Right ventricular dysfunction is also a concern for possible pulmonary embolism, and a V/Q scan will be attempted after the thoracentesis. 

Regarding cancer, it is uncertain between ovarian versus lymphoma, and ovarian tumor markers will be sent. A lymph node biopsy is needed, and a surgical consult has been requested. Acute renal failure is likely due to contrast dye-induced obstructive uropathy, and a urology consult has been made. The patient may require dialysis, pending renal input. Hyperkalemia will continue to be managed with Kayexalate and bicarbonate. Metabolic acidosis will be addressed by pushing amps of bicarb. 

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and VAP prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is in the ICU."

   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   # CA- ovarian vs lymphoma
   - Gyn/onc feel clinical picture is more consistent with lymphoma
   - Elev CA-125 increases likelihood for ovarian CA, however, per gyn-onc
   the CA-125 is non-diagnostic
   - Consulted gen [**Doctor First Name 213**] for lymph node biopsy
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment and is now 4.3
   - Hold kayexalate and lactulose
   - monitor K Q6hrs for now
   - serial ECGs prn
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who feel no emergent need for HD. Would
   aggressively volume resuscitate given her significant volume depletion.
   - HD team aware, placed line for catheter yesterday.  Renal still
   recommends holding on dialysis.
   - appreciate HD Renal team recs
   - 1L bolus of D5 with 3 amps bicarb x 2 for hypotension
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - d/c phos-lo as phos is 9.  Change to aluminum hydroxide 30 ml TID.
   - renal recs a new echo to eval for change in pericardial effusion.
   CVP remains low.
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   # SOB and pleural effusion- much improved following thoracentesis
   - No obvious clearing of white on xray following removal of fluid.  pH
   of 6.79 is suggestive of an empyema.  Will consult Ct [**Doctor First Name 213**]  vs IP for
   chest tube placement.  Following procedure, will get a non-contrast
   chest/abd CT.  Empirically treat pneumonia with ceftriaxone.

","The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer vs. lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient's current conditions include acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, pleural effusion, hypotension, and potential complications such as pneumonia, empyema, and sepsis.

Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, pneumonia, empyema, sepsis, and hypotension. The patient's low central venous pressure (CVP) indicates possible hypovolemia, which could contribute to her hypotension and further complications. The presence of right-sided hydronephrosis and moderate amount of ascites on renal ultrasound suggests possible obstruction and underlying tumor burden.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), potassium (K+), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CA-125, indicating possible renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalance, and malignancy. The pleural fluid analysis reveals a high white blood cell count (WBC), suggesting infection or inflammation.

Considering the patient's clinical presentation, medical history, and laboratory findings, it is crucial to closely monitor her vital signs, fluid balance, and electrolyte levels. The healthcare team should continue aggressive volume resuscitation"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   # CA- ovarian vs lymphoma
   - Gyn/onc feel clinical picture is more consistent with lymphoma
   - Elev CA-125 increases likelihood for ovarian CA
   - Consulted gen [**Doctor First Name 213**] for lymph node biopsy
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment and is now 4.3
   - Hold kayexalate and lactulose
   - monitor K Q6hrs for now
   - serial ECGs prn
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who feel no emergent need for HD. Would
   aggressively volume resuscitate given her significant volume depletion.
   - HD team aware, placed line for catheter yesterday.  Most likely
   dialysis today
   - appreciate HD Renal team recs
   - 1L bolus of D5 with 3 amps bicarb x 2 for hypotension
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - cont to check chem 10 Q6hrs
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   # SOB and pleural effusion- much improved following thoracentesis
   .
   #. Hypotension- on Levophed, volume resuscitating with D5 with 3 amps
   bicarb, pt is mostly asymptomatic

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia.

The patient underwent thoracentesis, which resulted in the removal of 538 mL of bloody appearing pleural fluid. Following the procedure, her hemoglobin concentration (HCT) dropped to 22.9, and her central venous pressure (CVP) was 5 to 6 mmHg. The patient became hypotensive and required the use of norepinephrine (Levophed) for blood pressure support. She also experienced tachycardia.

The hypotension was initially thought to be due to hypovolemia, but it may also be related to an increased amount of stool. As a result, the administration of kayexalate and lactulose was withheld. The patient was initially given 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), increasing her HCT to 30.6%.

The patient has a dialysis catheter and arterial line placed. She is currently on sodium bicarbonate infusion, famotidine, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications include insulin/dextrose, albuterol nebs, and kayexalate, which have been held.

Vital signs include a temperature of"

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. 

Assessment and plan:
1. CA-ovarian vs lymphoma: The gynecologic oncologist feels the clinical picture is more consistent with lymphoma, but the elevated CA-125 increases the likelihood for ovarian cancer. A consultation with a general surgeon was made for a lymph node biopsy.
2. Hyperkalemia: Most likely worsening acute renal failure, especially considering the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I. The patient had a potassium level of 7.8 on arrival to the ED, without ECG changes. She received treatment with calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate. Potassium responded appropriately to treatment and is now 4.3. Hold kayexalate and lactulose. Monitor K every 6 hours for now. Serial ECGs as needed.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient presented with weakness and shortness of breath, found to have ARF with a creatinine level of 7.8. She was seen by the renal team in the ED, who felt no emergent need for hemodialysis. They suggested aggressively volume resuscitating given her significant volume depletion"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient underwent thoracentesis and removal of bloody appearing pleural fluid.
- The patient's HCT dropped to 22.9 and CVP was 5 to 6, resulting in hypotension and the need for levophed. Tachycardia was also present.
- Hypovolemia was suspected as the cause, but tamponade or pulmonary embolism (PE) are still possible etiologies.
- The patient's hypotension may be related to an increased amount of stool, so kayexalate and lactulose were held.
- The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to increase HCT to 30.6.
- Dialysis catheter and arterial line were placed.
- Allergies, last dose of antibiotics, infusions, and other ICU medications are documented.
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.
- Vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, are within normal range.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 5 mmHg.
- Fluid balance indicates an input of 7,270 mL and output of 4,158 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,112 mL.

   Acute renal failure:  BUN/Creatinine elevated.  Contrast nephropathy.
   HOTN: On Levophed.  Getting HCO3.
   SOB:  Effusion still present, although unclear how much is effusion
   versus atelectasis also.  Since pH is so low (6.9) this may be an
   empyema.  Would treat with CTX for PNA, and ask IP to place Chest tube.
   Chest CT after Chest tube placement.
   Coagulopathy:  Will need FFP for chest Tube.

","The patient is a 74-year-old woman with shortness of breath and acute renal failure. She underwent thoracentesis, dialysis catheter placement, and arterial line placement. The patient's hemoglobin concentration dropped from 27.3 to 22.9, and she required 30.6 units of packed red blood cells. Levophed was started due to hypotension, and the patient felt better after fluid removal. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C (99.2Â°F), a heart rate of 124 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/73 to 64/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. Her heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 7,270 mL and output of 4,158 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,112 mL. The patient has been receiving intravenous fluids, blood products, and dialysis. 

Respiratory support includes the use of a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery, with an SpO2 of 90%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.28, indicating acidosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   # CA- ovarian vs lymphoma
   - Gyn/onc feel clinical picture is more consistent with lymphoma
   - Elev CA-125 increases likelihood for ovarian CA, however, per gyn-onc
   the CA-125 is non-diagnostic
   - Consulted gen [**Doctor First Name 213**] for lymph node biopsy
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment and is now 4.3
   - Hold kayexalate and lactulose
   - monitor K Q6hrs for now
   - serial ECGs prn
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who feel no emergent need for HD. Would
   aggressively volume resuscitate given her significant volume depletion.
   - HD team aware, placed line for catheter yesterday.  Renal still
   recommends holding on dialysis.
   - appreciate HD Renal team recs
   - 1L bolus of D5 with 3 amps bicarb x 2 for hypotension
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - d/c phos-lo as phos is 9.  Change to aluminum hydroxide 30 ml TID.
   - renal recs a new echo to eval for change in pericardial effusion.
   CVP remains low.
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   # SOB and pleural effusion- much improved following thoracentesis
   - No obvious clearing of white on xray following removal of fluid.  pH
   of 6.79 is suggestive of an empyema.  Will consult Ct [**Doctor First Name 213**]  vs IP for
   chest tube placement.  Following procedure, will get a non-contrast
   chest/abd CT.  Empirically treat pneumonia with ceftriaxone.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient's potassium levels were initially high at 7.8, but responded appropriately to treatment and are now at 4.3.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, pleural effusion, and hypotension. The acute renal failure is likely worsening due to medications such as Lasix and ACE-I. The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function.

The patient's pleural effusion has improved following thoracentesis, but further evaluation is needed. There is a concern for empyema based on the low pH of the pleural fluid. A consultation has been made with a pulmonologist to discuss the possibility of chest tube placement.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for pneumonia with ceftriaxone. She is also on mechanical ventilation and receiving vasopressor support with norepinephrine. 

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range except for slightly low calcium and magnesium. 

Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause of the patient's acute renal failure and to guide further management."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient underwent placement of a chest tube due to hemothorax on the left side. They received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and desmopressin (DDAVP). A thoracic surgery consultation was requested but deferred until the patient is more medically stable. The patient's hematocrit levels decreased from 30.6 to 27.0 after a tap and fluid resuscitation. The patient also has a pericardial effusion, as indicated by an echocardiogram. The patient's pleural fluid analysis showed elevated protein, glucose, LDH, and white blood cell count, meeting Light's criteria for exudative effusion. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient has been receiving various medications, including norepinephrine, heparin sodium, famotidine, midazolam, and hydromorphone. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

   Assessment and Plan
   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   # CA- ovarian vs lymphoma
   - Gyn/onc feel clinical picture is more consistent with lymphoma
   - Elev CA-125 increases likelihood for ovarian CA, however, per gyn-onc
   the CA-125 is non-diagnostic
   - Consulted gen [**Doctor First Name 213**] for lymph node biopsy, but refused until Pt more
   stable
   - Will consult with H/O re workup
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who feel no emergent need for HD. Would
   aggressively volume resuscitate given her significant volume depletion.
   - HD team aware, placed line for catheter yesterday.  Renal still
   recommends holding on dialysis.
   - appreciate HD Renal team recs
   - 1L bolus of D5 with 3 amps bicarb x 2 for hypotension
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - d/c phos-lo as phos is 9.  Change to aluminum hydroxide 30 ml TID.
   - renal recs a new echo to eval for change in pericardial effusion.
   CVP remains low.
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   # SOB and pleural effusion- much improved following thoracentesis
   -          Chest tube in place draining about 30mL per hour
   -          Chemistry consistent with exudate
   -          Cytology pending

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient has been treated with calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate for hyperkalemia, and her potassium levels have responded appropriately.

She also has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 7.8 and is being managed by the renal team. The differential diagnosis for acute renal failure includes pre-renal physiology, poor PO intake, increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced nephropathy, and post-obstructive renal failure. The patient's renal function is being closely monitored, and she is receiving aggressive volume resuscitation.

The patient's chest tube was placed due to hemothorax on the left, and she underwent thoracentesis to relieve pleural effusion. Her symptoms of shortness of breath and pleural effusion have improved significantly following thoracentesis. The chemistry of the pleural fluid is consistent with an exudate, and cytology is pending.

The patient is also experiencing hypotension and is on Levophed. She is being volume resuscitated with D5 with 3 amps bicarb. Additionally, she has a history of hypothyroidism and hyperlipid"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   # CA- ovarian vs lymphoma
   - Gyn/onc feel clinical picture is more consistent with lymphoma
   - Elev CA-125 increases likelihood for ovarian CA, however, per gyn-onc
   the CA-125 is non-diagnostic
   - Consulted gen [**Doctor First Name 213**] for lymph node biopsy
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment and is now 4.3
   - Hold kayexalate and lactulose
   - monitor K Q6hrs for now
   - serial ECGs prn
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who feel no emergent need for HD. Would
   aggressively volume resuscitate given her significant volume depletion.
   - HD team aware, placed line for catheter yesterday.  Renal still
   recommends holding on dialysis.
   - appreciate HD Renal team recs
   - 1L bolus of D5 with 3 amps bicarb x 2 for hypotension
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - d/c phos-lo as phos is 9.  Change to aluminum hydroxide 30 ml TID.
   - renal recs a new echo to eval for change in pericardial effusion.
   CVP remains low.
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   # SOB and pleural effusion- much improved following thoracentesis
   - No obvious clearing of white on xray following removal of fluid.  pH
   of 6.79 is suggestive of an empyema.  Will consult Ct [**Doctor First Name 213**]  vs IP for
   chest tube placement.  Following procedure, will get a non-contrast
   chest/abd CT.  Empirically treat pneumonia with ceftriaxone.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. She has been treated with calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate. Her potassium levels have improved, but she remains on cardiac monitoring. She also has pleural effusion, which was tapped and showed signs of empyema. She underwent a thoracentesis and will have a chest/abdomen CT scan. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated for pneumonia with ceftriaxone. Her renal function is still impaired, and she is being aggressively volume-resuscitated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and her current condition suggests worsening of this condition. This could be due to pre-renal physiology, poor PO intake, increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced nephropathy, or post-obstructive renal failure from right hydronephrosis or tumor burden vs. ascites as seen on ultrasound overnight.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient initially presented with hyperkalemia, which responded to treatment with calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate. However, she"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   # CA- ovarian vs lymphoma
   - Gyn/onc feel clinical picture is more consistent with lymphoma
   - Elev CA-125 increases likelihood for ovarian CA, however, per gyn-onc
   the CA-125 is non-diagnostic
   - Consulted gen [**Doctor First Name 213**] for lymph node biopsy
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment and is now 4.3
   - Hold kayexalate and lactulose
   - monitor K Q6hrs for now
   - serial ECGs prn
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who feel no emergent need for HD. Would
   aggressively volume resuscitate given her significant volume depletion.
   - HD team aware, placed line for catheter yesterday.  Renal still
   recommends holding on dialysis.
   - appreciate HD Renal team recs
   - 1L bolus of D5 with 3 amps bicarb x 2 for hypotension
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - d/c phos-lo as phos is 9.  Change to aluminum hydroxide 30 ml TID.
   - renal recs a new echo to eval for change in pericardial effusion.
   CVP remains low.
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   # SOB and pleural effusion- much improved following thoracentesis
   - No obvious clearing of white on xray following removal of fluid.  pH
   of 6.79 is suggestive of an empyema.  Will consult Ct [**Doctor First Name 213**]  vs IP for
   chest tube placement.  Following procedure, will get a non-contrast
   chest/abd CT.  Empirically treat pneumonia with ceftriaxone.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia.

The patient's current condition includes acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, hyperkalemia that has responded to treatment, and hypotension requiring vasopressor support. She also has pleural effusion which improved following thoracentesis, and a possible empyema based on the pH of the pleural fluid.

The patient is being treated with multiple medications including antibiotics, vasopressors, and renal support therapies. She has undergone several interventions such as chest tube placement, dialysis catheter insertion, arterial line placement, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include worsening of acute renal failure, further electrolyte imbalances, infection (such as pneumonia or empyema), and cardiovascular instability. Close monitoring and appropriate management are crucial to prevent these complications and optimize the patient's outcomes."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old woman with acute renal failure and an ovarian mass. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments and interventions. The patient underwent chest tube placement yesterday due to suspected pleural effusion. She is also receiving medications such as norepinephrine, midazolam, and hydromorphone for her condition.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/70 to 140/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her temperature is slightly below normal. The patient's weight has increased from 98.9 kg at admission to 103.6 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows an input of 7,410 mL and output of 2,278 mL since midnight. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg. She is receiving intravenous fluids and has received a blood transfusion.

Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an ABG result of 7.29/41/91/19/-6 and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 228. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the left base and distended abdomen. The patient's extremities are warm and well-perfused.

Lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   # CA- ovarian vs lymphoma
   - Cytology consistent with an adenocarcinoma. Specific stains pending.
   - Consulted gen [**Doctor First Name 213**] for lymph node biopsy, but refused until Pt more
   stable
   - H/O believes this may be an adenoca of ovarian origin. Tumor markers
   ordered.
   .
   # SOB and pleural effusion- much improved following thoracentesis but
   rercurred O/N for unknown reasons. Concerned about tamponade v PE
   - Chest tube in place draining about 30mL per hour
   - Chemistry consistent with exudate
   - Cytology pending, but so far consistent with adenoca
   - LENIs WNL
   - Pt now on CPAP. [**Month (only) 51**] need intubation if cannot maintain pH and
   oxygenation. [**Month (only) 51**] also require intubation to allow fluid resus if
   tamponade
   - ECHO unconvincing for tamponade, just small effusion. Repeat ECHO
   today
   - Volume overload seems to be a critical issue here. Will consult renal
   re CVVH for her today
   .
   #. Hypotension- on Levophed 0.1, max o/n 0.15, but was on 0.03
   yesterday
   - Concern for tamponade physiology, as above
   - CT surgery following, will not advance chest tube or place
   pericardial window for now
   - Could be a component of uremic pericarditis
   - Given concern for uremic symptoms, CVVH may alleviate this. Pressors
   continue be on board and could allow CVVH to proceed.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who feel no emergent need for HD. Would
   aggressively volume resuscitate given her significant volume depletion.
   - HD team aware, catheter in place.  We are hoping for CVVA tonight
   given O/N hypotension
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - d/c phos-lo as phos is 9.  Changed to aluminum hydroxide 30 ml TID
   per renal.
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home levothyroxine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. 

The patient's current condition includes:
- Small pleural effusion with suggestion of tamponade physiology
- Tachycardia worsening rapidly to around 140 bpm with increasing shortness of breath and wheezes on examination
- Increasing acidosis
- Chest tube in place draining about 30mL per hour
- Cytology consistent with adenocarcinoma
- Hypotension requiring norepinephrine infusion
- Acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels
- Hyperkalemia that has responded to treatment
- Hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient has a small pleural effusion with suggestion of tamponade physiology, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's increased respiratory rate, shortness of breath, and wheezes indicate respiratory distress, which may require intubation if not adequately managed with CPAP.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, indicating impaired kidney function. This may necessitate dialysis or"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   # CA- ovarian vs lymphoma
   - Cytology consistent with an adenocarcinoma. Specific stains pending.
   - Gyn/onc feel clinical picture is more consistent with lymphoma
   - Elev CA-125 increases likelihood for ovarian CA, however, per gyn-onc
   the CA-125 is non-diagnostic
   - Consulted gen [**Doctor First Name 213**] for lymph node biopsy, but refused until Pt more
   stable
   - H/O believes this may be an adenoca of ovarian origin. Tumor markers
   ordered. Also concern for pancreatic primary.
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who feel no emergent need for HD. Would
   aggressively volume resuscitate given her significant volume depletion.
   - HD team aware, catheter in place.  Renal still recommends holding on
   dialysis.
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - d/c phos-lo as phos is 9.  Change to aluminum hydroxide 30 ml TID.
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   - Will discuss HD again with team given O/N hypoxia
   # SOB and pleural effusion- much improved following thoracentesis but
   rercurred O/N for unknown reasons. Concerned about tamponade
   -          Chest tube in place draining about 30mL per hour
   -          Chemistry consistent with exudate
   -          Cytology pending, but so far consistent with adenoca
   - Pt now on CPAP. [**Month (only) 51**] need intubation if cannot maintain pH and
   oxygenation. [**Month (only) 51**] also require intubation to allow fluid resus if
   tamponade
   .
   #. Hypotension- on Levophed, volume resuscitating with D5 with 3 amps
   bicarb
   - Concern for tamponade physiology, as above
   - CT surgery following, will advance chest tube this AM and consider
   pericardial window
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, pleural effusion, hypotension, and potential tamponade physiology. She is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments including non-invasive ventilation, CPAP, norepinephrine infusion, and prophylactic heparin. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing respiratory and cardiac issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and symptoms such as weakness and shortness of breath. This could lead to further deterioration of kidney function and the need for dialysis.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are high, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion that has recurred, potentially indicating worsening of her underlying condition or complications related to the chest tube placement.
4. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive and requires vasopressor support with norepinephrine. This could indicate poor perfusion and organ dysfunction.
5. Potential Tamponade Physiology: The patient has evidence of tamponade physiology"

","The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of adenocarcinoma of the ovary, presenting with a large left pleural effusion. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hypotension. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 87/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on non-invasive ventilation and receiving norepinephrine at a dose of 0.1 mcg/kg/min.

The patient's medical history includes a recent admission for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She has no known drug allergies. She is currently receiving prophylactic heparin and antibiotics.

On examination, the patient appears well-nourished but has diminished breath sounds at the bases, warm extremities, and no muscle wasting. Her neurologic assessment is incomplete.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.7 thousand/mmÂ³, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.7 g/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 2.0 mmol/L. Her renal function is impaired with a creatinine level of 6.1 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   # CA- ovarian vs lymphoma
   - Cytology consistent with an adenocarcinoma. Specific stains pending.
   - Consulted gen [**Doctor First Name 213**] for lymph node biopsy, but refused until Pt more
   stable
   - H/O believes this may be an adenoca of ovarian origin. Tumor markers
   are borderline high for CA-125 and elevated CA27,29 which is consistent
   with an ovarian mass but very non-specific
   .
   # SOB and pleural effusion- originally improved s/p thoracentesis but
   rercurred and has presented a challenge for this patient for several
   days now. Concerned for pulm edema v  tamponade v PE
   - Chest tube in place draining about 30mL per hour. Surgery considering
   adding pigtail or changing position to better access the L base.
   - Chemistry consistent with exudate, cytology pending, but so far
   consistent with adenoca
   - Pt now on CPAP
   - ECHO unconvincing for tamponade, just small effusion. Repeat ECHO
unchanged
   - Volume overload seems to be a critical issue here. Will continue with
   CVVH for now taking off as much as tolerated with her BP controlled
   with pressors
 50-100mL per hour
   .
   #. Hypotension- on Levophed 0.13, 0.15/hr yesterday. Was stable for a
   while on 0.1
   - Concern for tamponade physiology, as above
   - CT surgery following and may change or alter the chest tube today
   - Could be a component of uremic pericarditis
   - Given concern for uremic symptoms, CVVH may alleviate this. Pressors
   continue be on board to allow CVVH to proceed.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who feel no emergent need for HD. Would
   aggressively volume resuscitate given her significant volume depletion.
   - CVVH started on [**9-16**]
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - d/c phos-lo as phos is 9.  Changed to aluminum hydroxide 30 ml TID
   per renal.
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, heart failure, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. 

The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has had various medical complications. These include:

1. Ovarian cancer vs. lymphoma: The patient's cytology is consistent with an adenocarcinoma, but specific stains are pending. The patient has refused a lymph node biopsy until she is more stable. Tumor markers are borderline high for CA-125 and elevated CA27,29, which is consistent with an ovarian mass but very non-specific.

2. Shortness of breath (SOB) and pleural effusion: The patient initially improved after thoracentesis but the effusion recurred. She is now on CPAP and there is a chest tube in place draining about 30 mL per hour. Surgery is considering adding a pigtail or changing the patient's position to better access the left base. The chemistry is consistent with exudate, cytology pending, but so far consistent with adenoca.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is controlled with pressors, specifically levophed. There is concern for tamponade physiology, and CT surgery is following up and may change or alter the chest tube today. It could be a component of uremic per"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer vs. lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she is experiencing weakness and shortness of breath. Differential diagnoses include pre-renal physiology, contrast-induced nephropathy, and post-obstructive renal failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient is on Levophed 0.1, previously on 0.15, but was on 0.03 yesterday. Concern for tamponade physiology and uremic pericarditis.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient had a thoracentesis which improved her symptoms but recurred overnight. Concerned about tamponade versus pulmonary embolism. Chest tube in place draining about 30mL per hour.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient had potassium levels of 7.8 on arrival to the ED without ECG changes. Treatment with calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate successfully lowered the potassium levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, pleural effusion, hypotension, and hyperlipidemia. She is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, which could be caused by pre-renal physiology, poor PO intake, contrast-induced nephropathy, or post-obstructive renal failure. The patient is already on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and being aggressively volume resuscitated.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient presented with hyperkalemia, which is likely due to worsening acute renal failure and the use of medications such as Lasix and ACE-I. She has received treatment with calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate, which has appropriately responded to treatment.

3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion that has improved following thoracentesis but recurred overnight. There are concerns about cardiac tamponade versus pulmonary embolism. She is currently on CPAP and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. He is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and has been on CVVH with a goal of net negative 50/hr. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8Â°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 106/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 set at 70%. The patient has a history of being unresponsive to commands and has not been assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or other physical exam findings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low at 106/64 mmHg, indicating potential hypotension.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's current temperature is 35.8Â°C, which is below the normal range, indicating hypothermia.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient is on CPAP/PSV with a high FiO2 level of 70%, suggesting respiratory distress or difficulty maintaining adequate oxygenation.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The patient is undergoing CRRT and CVVH, indicating possible acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Coagulation disorder: The patient has an elevated PT/PTT/inr level, suggesting a coagulation disorder.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with metastatic ovarian cancer. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications. The key points from the note are as follows:

1. The patient's condition has improved in terms of respiratory distress, as she is no longer fully dependent on non-invasive ventilation but still requires occasional bipap support.
2. The patient has metastatic ovarian cancer and is not currently receiving chemotherapy.
3. The patient is suffering from acute renal failure and is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to fluid overload. This treatment will be continued.
4. The patient is also experiencing hypertensive urgency and is being treated with norepinephrine (levophed).
5. The patient has been on CVVH for fluid removal, which may be related to pressure overload of the right ventricle (RV).
6. The patient has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and central venous catheter.
7. The patient is receiving prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
8. The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose, and other parameters.
9. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia, hypotension"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   # CA- ovarian vs lymphoma
   - Cytology consistent with an adenocarcinoma. Specific stains pending.
   - Consulted gen [**Doctor First Name 213**] for lymph node biopsy, but refused until Pt more
   stable
   - H/O believes this may be an adenoca of ovarian origin. Tumor markers
   are borderline high for CA-125 and elevated CA27,29 which is consistent
   with an ovarian mass but very non-specific
   .
   # SOB and pleural effusion- originally improved s/p thoracentesis but
   rercurred and has presented a challenge for this patient for several
   days now. Concerned for pulm edema v  tamponade v PE
   - Chest tube in place draining about 30mL per hour. Surgery considering
   adding pigtail or changing position to better access the L base.
   - Chemistry consistent with exudate, cytology pending, but so far
   consistent with adenoca
   - Pt now on CPAP
   - ECHO unconvincing for tamponade, just small effusion. Repeat ECHO
unchanged
   - Volume overload seems to be a critical issue here. Will continue with
   CVVH for now taking off as much as tolerated with her BP controlled
   with pressors
 50-100mL per hour
   .
   #. Hypotension- on Levophed 0.13, 0.15/hr yesterday. Was stable for a
   while on 0.1
   - Concern for tamponade physiology, as above
   - CT surgery following and may change or alter the chest tube today
   - Could be a component of uremic pericarditis
   - Given concern for uremic symptoms, CVVH may alleviate this. Pressors
   continue be on board to allow CVVH to proceed.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who feel no emergent need for HD. Would
   aggressively volume resuscitate given her significant volume depletion.
   - CVVH started on [**9-16**]
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - d/c phos-lo as phos is 9.  Changed to aluminum hydroxide 30 ml TID
   per renal.
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient's current condition includes pleural effusion, hypotension, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pleural Effusion: The patient has been experiencing recurrent pleural effusion, which can cause shortness of breath and lead to pulmonary edema or tension pneumothorax if not properly managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient is on vasopressors to maintain blood pressure, indicating concern for potential cardiovascular issues such as cardiogenic shock or septic shock.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, likely secondary to pre-renal physiology, poor PO intake, increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced nephropathy, or post-obstructive renal failure due to right hydronephrosis. This condition requires close monitoring and management.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient had significant hyperkalemia upon arrival, which has responded to treatment. It is crucial to monitor and manage potassium levels to avoid cardiac complications.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and it should be monitored and managed accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   # CA- ovarian vs lymphoma
   - Cytology consistent with an adenocarcinoma. Specific stains pending.
   - Consulted gen [**Doctor First Name 213**] for lymph node biopsy, but refused until Pt more
   stable
   - H/O believes this may be an adenoca of ovarian origin. Tumor markers
   are borderline high for CA-125 and elevated CA27,29 which is consistent
   with an ovarian mass but very non-specific
   .
   # SOB and pleural effusion- originally improved s/p thoracentesis but
   recurred and this has presented a challenge for this patient for
   several days now. Concerned for pulm edema v  tamponade v PE
   - Pigtail catheter placed yesterday.  Drained 960mL over the last 24
   hrs and 75 mL since midnight.  Post placement CXR showed improved
   aeration of the left lung.  Pt also subjectively reports improvement.
   - Chest tube 1 is now extrathoracic.  Drained 20mL over the last 24
   hrs, and 55 mL since midnight last night.  CT [**Doctor First Name 213**] will most likely
   pull today.
   - Chemistry consistent with exudate, cytology pending, but so far
   consistent with adenoca
   - Pt now on CPAP
   - ECHO unconvincing for tamponade, just small effusion. Repeat ECHO
unchanged
   - Volume overload seems to be a critical issue here. Will continue with
   CVVH for now taking off as much as tolerated with her BP controlled
   with pressors
 50-100mL per hour
   .
   #. Hypotension- on Levophed 0.13, 0.15/hr yesterday. Was stable for a
   while on 0.1
   - Concern for tamponade physiology, as above
   - CT surgery following and may change or alter the chest tube today
   - Could be a component of uremic pericarditis
   - Given concern for uremic symptoms, CVVH may alleviate this. Pressors
   continue be on board to allow CVVH to proceed.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who feel no emergent need for HD. Would
   aggressively volume resuscitate given her significant volume depletion.
   - CVVH started on [**9-16**]
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - d/c phos-lo as phos is 9.  Changed to aluminum hydroxide 30 ml TID
   per renal.
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient's current condition includes chest tube placement, pigtail catheter placement, and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). She also has a pleural effusion, which was initially improved but recurred, and there are concerns about pulmonary edema, tamponade, or pulmonary embolism. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 81/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, lactate, and low hemoglobin levels. The patient's physical examination reveals alertness, improved breath sounds on the left upper lobe, edematous extremities, and soft abdomen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and her current condition indicates ongoing renal dysfunction. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and uremic symptoms.

2. Pleural Effusion: The patient's pleural effusion has recurred despite previous thoracentesis, and there are concerns about pulmonary edema, tamponade"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with acute renal failure (ARF), metastatic ovarian cancer, and malignant pleural effusion. She underwent the placement of a pigtail catheter yesterday, which drained almost 1 liter. Today, a chest tube was placed due to the presence of a pleural effusion. The patient is receiving multiple medications and infusions, including norepinephrine, calcium gluconate (CRRT), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and others. Her vital signs are within normal limits, except for low blood pressure. She is on respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula and has an ABG showing normal oxygenation. The patient has a history of obesity, ARF, ovarian adenocarcinoma, and other medical conditions. Her lab results indicate anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated creatinine, and altered electrolyte levels. The patient is critically ill and currently being treated in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's presence of malignant pleural effusion and recent catheter placements, there is a risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support indicates respiratory compromise, and if not managed properly, can result in respiratory failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient already has acute renal failure, and it may worsen if not appropriately managed."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with acute renal failure (ARF), metastatic ovarian cancer, and malignant pleural effusion. She underwent pigtail catheter placement yesterday, which drained almost 1 liter of fluid. Today, she had a chest tube placed due to her condition. Her allergies are unknown, and she received various medications including norepinephrine, calcium gluconate (CRRT), heparin sodium, synthroid, simvastatin, hep s/q, colace, allopurinol, pepcid, chlorhex, vitamin K, and others. Her vital signs are stable, but she requires respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula. Her blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, with slightly low sodium and potassium levels. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate normal oxygenation but slightly lower carbon dioxide levels. The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in her cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and her extremities are warm and well-perfused. Neurologic assessment is not complete.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Pleural effusion: The patient has a history of malignant pleural effusion, which can lead to respiratory distress and impaired gas exchange if not properly managed.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient is already experiencing"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   # CA- ovarian vs lymphoma
   - Cytology consistent with an adenocarcinoma. Specific stains pending.
   Additional tissue may be needed since cytology not ideal for stains
   - Consulted gen [**Doctor First Name 213**] for lymph node biopsy, but refused until Pt more
   stable
   - Will consider core biopsy of superficial LN
   - H/O believes this may be an adenoca of ovarian origin. Tumor markers
   are borderline high for CA-125 and elevated CA27,29 which is consistent
   with an ovarian mass but very non-specific
   # SOB and pleural effusion- originally improved s/p thoracentesis but
   recurred and this has presented a challenge for this patient for
   several days now. Concerned for pulm edema v  tamponade v PE
   - Pigtail catheter in L base draining wel and pt more comfortable and
   off BiPAP.
   - Chest tube 1 is now extrathoracic.
   - Chemistry consistent with exudate, cytology pending, but so far
   consistent with adenoca
   - ECHO unconvincing for tamponade, just small effusion. Repeat ECHO
unchanged
   - Volume overload seems to be a critical issue here. Will continue with
   CVVH for now taking off as much as tolerated with her BP controlled
   with pressors
 50-100mL per hour
   #. Hypotension- on Levophed 0.0.08/hr yesterday, which is an
   improvement
   - Concern for tamponade physiology, as above
   - Could be a component of uremic pericarditis
   - Given concern for uremic symptoms, CVVH may alleviate this. Pressors
   continue be on board to allow CVVH to proceed.
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who feel no emergent need for HD. Would
   aggressively volume resuscitate given her significant volume depletion.
   - CVVH started on [**9-16**]
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - on Renagel 1600mg TID
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home levothyroxine
   # Nutrition- low Na, heart healthy diet

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She was recently diagnosed with ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.2Â°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/55 mmHg to 72/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. 

The patient has been experiencing intense, diffuse itchiness and has been treated with norepinephrine and sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) due to hyperkalemia. She is currently receiving calcium gluconate, norepinephrine, and potassium chloride through continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, lactate, and lipase levels. Her potassium level was initially high but has responded to treatment. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, possibly due to pre-renal physiology, poor oral intake, increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced nephropathy, or post-obstructive renal failure from right hydronephrosis. CVVH (continuous veno"

   and hyperkalemia.
   # CA- ovarian vs lymphoma
   - Cytology consistent with an adenocarcinoma. Specific stains pending.
   Additional tissue may be needed since cytology not ideal for stains
   - Consulted gen [**Doctor First Name 213**] for lymph node biopsy, but refused until Pt more
   stable
   - Will consider core biopsy of superficial LN
   - H/O believes this may be an adenoca of ovarian origin. Tumor markers
   are borderline high for CA-125 and elevated CA27,29 which is consistent
   with an ovarian mass but very non-specific
   # SOB and pleural effusion- originally improved s/p thoracentesis but
   recurred and this has presented a challenge for this patient for
   several days now. Concerned for pulm edema v  tamponade v PE
   - Pigtail catheter in L base draining wel and pt more comfortable and
   off BiPAP.
   - Chest tube 1 is now extrathoracic.
   - Chemistry consistent with exudate, cytology pending, but so far
   consistent with adenoca
   - ECHO unconvincing for tamponade, just small effusion. Repeat ECHO
unchanged
   - Volume overload seems to be a critical issue here. Will continue with
   CVVH for now taking off as much as tolerated with her BP controlled
   with pressors
 50-100mL per hour
   #. Hypotension- on Levophed 0.0.08/hr yesterday, which is an
   improvement
   - Concern for tamponade physiology, as above
   - Could be a component of uremic pericarditis
   - Given concern for uremic symptoms, CVVH may alleviate this. Pressors
   continue be on board to allow CVVH to proceed.
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who feel no emergent need for HD. Would
   aggressively volume resuscitate given her significant volume depletion.
   - CVVH started on [**9-16**]
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - on Renagel 1600mg TID
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and a recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on various medications including calcium gluconate, norepinephrine, famotidine, heparin sodium, and statins. Her vital signs are stable, but she has been experiencing shortness of breath and pleural effusion. She also has hypotension and requires pressors for blood pressure control. She is undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pleural effusion: The patient has been experiencing recurrent pleural effusion, which could be due to her underlying malignancy or other causes. This can lead to respiratory distress and compromised oxygenation.
2. Hypotension: The patient requires pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure, indicating possible cardiovascular compromise. Hypotension can lead to organ hypoperfusion and dysfunction.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has a significantly elevated creatinine level and is undergoing CVVH. Acute renal failure can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and uremic symptoms.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient presented with hyperkalemia, which has responded to treatment. Elevated potassium levels can lead to cardiac"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer vs. lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. The differential diagnosis includes pre-renal physiology, contrast-induced nephropathy, and post-obstructive renal failure. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been initiated and will likely continue until the patient can transition to intermittent hemodialysis.

2. Hypotension: The patient is on Levophed 0.08/hr to maintain blood pressure. There is concern for tamponade physiology, uremic pericarditis, and volume overload. CVVH may help alleviate these symptoms.

3. Pleural effusion: The patient has recurrent pleural effusion despite thoracentesis. This may be due to malignancy-related pleural effusion or another underlying cause. Further evaluation and management are needed.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level was initially high, but has responded to treatment with calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with ovarian cancer who is currently in the ICU. She has been on mechanical ventilation and is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to acute kidney injury. The patient's condition has shown slow improvement, with resolution of fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusion. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains hemodynamically unstable with low blood pressure. The patient's lab results indicate anemia, leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating ongoing hemodynamic instability. This may increase the risk of organ hypoperfusion and ischemia.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient is currently undergoing CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) to manage her renal function. AKI can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and increased risk of infection.
3. Pulmonary Complications: Although the patient's respiratory distress has improved, she still has diminished breath sounds on the left base. This could indicate unresolved atelectasis or a new lung pathology.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid levels suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis or bacteremia is crucial.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   #. Hypotension- on Levophed required more overnight however A-line
   over-dampened and when has good [**Location (un) **] after flush matches cuff
   [**Location (un) **].
   -Concerned for sepsis as has tachy, leukocytosis and inc
ing pressor
   requirements.
   -Will start empiric vanc, zosyn, cipro to cover HAP as this most likely
   given poor pulmonary status. Also will cover line infections.
   -Will check [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim test to make sure no adrenal insufficiency since
   in the setting of CA could have mets to adrenals.
   - Has known pericardial effusion that has been stable but will check
   CVP through Vigileo if able to assess fluid status as now total body
   volume overloaded but likely intravascularly depleted.
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who felt no emergent need for HD.
   - CVVH started on [**9-16**] and had to be held as line is no longer
   working.  [**Month (only) 51**] be able to transition to HD.  Will check with renal.
   -Will likely need new HD line placed and this will likely require IR as
   this was needed for last line.
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - D/c renagel as phos is 2.4
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   # Adenocarcinoma, most likely ovarian
   - Cytology consistent with an adenocarcinoma. Staining revealed CK7
   positive only with rare B72.3 cells positive.  Equivocal for ovarian vs
   lung but morphology is consistent with ovarian.  Heme no longer feels
   it is necessary to obtain further tissue sample.  Will not require a
   lymph node biopsy
   # SOB and pleural effusion- improved s/p pigtail placement. Now on NC
   only.
   - Pigtail catheter in L base draining wel1 and pt more comfortable and
   off BiPAP.
   - Chemistry of pleural fluid consistent with exudate, cytology pending,
   but so far consistent with adenoca
   - ECHO unconvincing for tamponade, just small effusion. Repeat ECHO
unchanged
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, heart failure, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple pressors.

24-hour events include changing the pigtail catheter to water seal, oncological findings suggesting ovarian adenocarcinoma, difficulties with the CVVH line leading to its discontinuation, net negative fluid balance of 1.1 liters, adjustment of medications, and administration of Ativan for discomfort.

Vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and an increased respiratory rate. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 97%. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the left lower lobe, pitting edema in both upper and lower extremities, and a pericardial effusion.

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, leukocytosis, increased creatinine, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypomagnesemia. Other lab values are within normal limits. Imaging studies reveal a pericardial effusion and possible right hydronephrosis.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypotension - The patient requires more pressor support overnight. There is concern for sepsis due to tach"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an oncology patient with suspected ovarian cancer, who is currently in the ICU. They have undergone several interventions and treatments, including the placement of a pigtail catheter, CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), administration of Ativan for sleep, and treatment for a yeast infection with fluconazole. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 130 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 67/46 to 122/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight has increased from 98.9 kg at admission to 107.6 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a total input of 6,526 mL and output of 7,628 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,102 mL. The patient is receiving various medications, including norepinephrine, famotidine, and heparin. Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.5 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 224 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient's code status is full code and their disposition is pending stability for transfer to OMED (possibly Oncology Medical Education and Diagnosis).

   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   # Adenocarcinoma, most likely ovarian
   - Cytology consistent with an adenocarcinoma. Staining revealed CK7
   positive only with rare B72.3 cells positive.  Equivocal for ovarian vs
   lung but morphology is consistent with ovarian.  Heme no longer feels
   it is necessary to obtain further tissue sample.  Will no require a
   lymph node biopsy
   # SOB and pleural effusion- originally improved s/p thoracentesis but
   recurred and this has presented a challenge for this patient for
   several days now. Concerned for pulm edema v  tamponade v PE
   - Pigtail catheter in L base draining wel1 and pt more comfortable and
   off BiPAP.
   - Chest tube 1 is now extrathoracic and will be removed by CT surgery
   today
   - Chemistry consistent with exudate, cytology pending, but so far
   consistent with adenoca
   - ECHO unconvincing for tamponade, just small effusion. Repeat ECHO
unchanged
   - Volume overload seems to be a critical issue here. Will continue with
   CVVH for now taking off as much as tolerated with her BP controlled
   with pressors
 50-100mL per hour
   #. Hypotension- on Levophed 0.0.08/hr, which is an improvement,
   continuing to taper pressors
   - Concern for tamponade physiology, as above
   - Could be a component of uremic pericarditis
   - Given concern for uremic symptoms, CVVH may alleviate this. Pressors
   continue be on board to allow CVVH to proceed.
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who feel no emergent need for HD. Would
   aggressively volume resuscitate given her significant volume depletion.
   - CVVH started on [**9-16**].  [**Month (only) 51**] be able to transition to HD.  Will check
   with renal.
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - D/c renagel as phos is 2.4
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She was recently diagnosed with ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. SOB and pleural effusion: The patient initially improved after thoracentesis but the effusion recurred. There are concerns about pulmonary edema, tamponade, or pulmonary embolism. A pigtail catheter has been inserted in the left base and is draining well. The patient is more comfortable and no longer requires BiPAP. Chest tube 1 is extrathoracic and will be removed by CT surgery today.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is being controlled with pressors. There is concern for tamponade physiology or uremic pericarditis. CVVH may alleviate these symptoms, and pressors will continue to be administered.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient presents with weakness, shortness of breath, and an elevated creatinine level of 7.8. The differential diagnosis includes pre-renal physiology, poor oral intake with increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced nephropathy, and post-obstructive renal failure due to right hydronephrosis or tumor burden vs. ascites.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the ICU with acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and suspected sepsis. The patient has a recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer vs. lymphoma. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, famotidine, heparin sodium, and various antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient requires norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure, indicating possible hypotension.
2. Sepsis: The patient shows signs of infection, such as tachycardia, leukocytosis, and increasing pressor requirements.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and is experiencing weakness and shortness of breath. Differential diagnoses include pre-renal physiology, contrast-induced nephropathy, and post-obstructive renal failure.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient has a high potassium level, which may be due to acute renal failure or medications such as Lasix and ACE inhibitors.
5. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has a known pericardial effusion and is experiencing shortness of breath and pleural effusion.
6. Ovarian Cancer: The patient has a cytology consistent with adenocarcinoma, most likely ovarian in origin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia. He has been receiving aggressive treatment, including multiple antibiotics and renal replacement therapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/60 mmHg to 146/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on norepinephrine infusion at 0.1 mcg/kg/min for hemodynamic support.

Medical Complications:
1. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient experienced a run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) for 28 beats. This could be indicative of myocardial ischemia or injury.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's serum creatinine level is elevated at 1.9 mg/dL, indicating impaired renal function. This could be a result of sepsis or the use of nephrotoxic medications.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has low magnesium levels (1.5 mg/dL), which can contribute to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. His potassium level is also on the lower side at 3.9 mEq/L.
4. Infection: The patient has an active infection, as evidenced by the presence"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   #. Hypotension- on Levophed 0.1mg/min stable with SBPs around 110
   -Concerned for sepsis as has tachy, leukocytosis and on pressors
   - started empiric vanc, zosyn, cipro to cover HAP as this most likely
   given poor pulmonary status.
   - Antibiotics will also cover line infections. Renal to pull HD line
   today. Will culture tip.
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim wnl so likely not adrenally insufficient.
   - Has known pericardial effusion that has been stable but will check
   CVP through Vigileo if able to assess fluid status as now total body
   volume overloaded but likely intravascularly depleted.
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who felt no emergent need for HD.
   - CVVH started on [**9-16**] and had to be held as line is no longer
   working.  [**Month (only) 51**] be able to transition to HD.  Will check with renal.
   -Will likely need new HD line placed and this will likely require IR as
   this was needed for last line.
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - D/c renagel as phos is 2.4
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   # Adenocarcinoma, most likely ovarian
   - Cytology consistent with an adenocarcinoma. Staining revealed CK7
   positive only with rare B72.3 cells positive.  Equivocal for ovarian vs
   lung but morphology is consistent with ovarian.  Heme no longer feels
   it is necessary to obtain further tissue sample.  Will not require a
   lymph node biopsy
   # SOB and pleural effusion- improved s/p pigtail placement. Now on NC
   only.
   - Pigtail catheter in L base draining wel1 and pt more comfortable and
   off BiPAP.
   - Chemistry of pleural fluid consistent with exudate, cytology pending,
   but so far consistent with adenoca
   - ECHO unconvincing for tamponade, just small effusion. Repeat ECHO
unchanged
   - Added standing bronchodilators
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer vs. lymphoma. She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with sepsis. She has been receiving empiric antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia, as well as line infections. The patient also has acute renal failure, possibly caused by pre-renal physiology, poor PO intake, increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced nephropathy, or post-obstructive renal failure from right hydronephrosis. She is undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and will transition to hemodialysis (HD) once the line is working. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and if positive, the PICC line will be pulled. She has a known pericardial effusion and has been stable, but her fluid status is now overloaded, likely intravascularly depleted. Her electrolytes are imbalanced, and she has hyperkalemia. The patient has adenocarcinoma, most likely ovarian, based on cytology consistent with adenocarcinoma. She also has pleural effusion, which has improved after pigtail placement. Her ECHO does not show tamponade, just a small effusion. She has hyperlipidemia, hypothyroid"

   Assessment and Plan
   74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of ovarian ca vs.
   lymphoma, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute renal failure
   and hyperkalemia.
   #. Hypotension- on Levophed 0.1mg/min stable with SBPs around 110. Was
   0.08 for a while
   -Concerned for sepsis as has tachy, leukocytosis and on pressors
   - started empiric vanc, zosyn, cipro to cover HAP as this most likely
   given poor pulmonary status.
   - Antibiotics will also cover line infections. Renal to pull HD line
   today. Will culture tip.
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim wnl so likely not adrenally insufficient.
   - Has known pericardial effusion that has been stable but will check
   CVP through Vigileo if able to assess fluid status as now total body
   volume overloaded but likely intravascularly depleted.
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who felt no emergent need for HD.
   - CVVH started on [**9-16**] and had to be held as line is no longer
   working.  [**Month (only) 51**] be able to transition to HD.  Will check with renal.
   -Will likely need new HD line placed and this will likely require IR as
   this was needed for last line.
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - D/c renagel as phos is 2.4
   - Consulted uro for possible perc nephrostomy; will hold on any
   intervention at this time given tenuous cardiopulm status
   # Adenocarcinoma, most likely ovarian
   - Cytology consistent with an adenocarcinoma. Staining revealed CK7
   positive only with rare B72.3 cells positive.  Equivocal for ovarian vs
   lung but morphology is consistent with ovarian.  Heme no longer feels
   it is necessary to obtain further tissue sample.  Will not require a
   lymph node biopsy
   # SOB and pleural effusion- improved s/p pigtail placement. Now on NC
   only.
   - Pigtail catheter in L base draining wel1 and pt more comfortable and
   off BiPAP.
   - Chemistry of pleural fluid consistent with exudate, cytology pending,
   but so far consistent with adenoca
   - ECHO unconvincing for tamponade, just small effusion. Repeat ECHO
unchanged
   - Added standing bronchodilators
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home levothyroxine

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism, who presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. She has a recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer versus lymphoma. 

She was found to have acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 7.8, and she is currently on dialysis. Her potassium level was initially high at 7.8, but responded appropriately to treatment. She also has hypotension requiring norepinephrine infusion, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, raising concerns for sepsis. 

She has been started on empirical antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia as well as line infections. Both her hemodialysis catheter and arterial line need to be changed, but this was delayed. 

The patient is also experiencing shortness of breath and pleural effusion, which has improved after pigtail catheter placement. She is now off BiPAP and only on nasal cannula oxygen. 

Further evaluation is planned with a non-contrast chest CT to assess the pleural effusion. 

The patient has a known pericardial effusion, but it has been stable. 

She has a history of renal failure, likely due to pre-renal physiology, poor oral intake in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced nephropathy, or post-obstructive renal failure from right"

   Assessment and Plan
    74-F w/ HTN, HL, hypothyroidism, and recent dx of adenocarcinoma, most
   likely ovarian primary, who presented to the ED for evaluation of acute
   renal failure and hyperkalemia.  Noted to have pleural and pericardial
   effusions.
   #. Hypotension- Has required Levophed for much of admission.
   -Concerned for sepsis as has tachy, leukocytosis and on pressors
   - started empiric vanc, zosyn, cipro to cover HAP as this most likely
   given poor pulmonary status.
   - Antibiotics will also cover line infections. Need to change both HD
   cath and art line
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim wnl so likely not adrenally insufficient.
   - Has known pericardial effusion that has been stable but will check
   CVP through Vigileo if able to assess fluid status as now total body
   volume overloaded but likely intravascularly depleted.
   - Intravascular volume repletion with crystalloid and colloid as needed
   On my ultrasound exam, there is an entirely noncompressible portion of
   the right radial artery.  More proximally, the artery is compressible
   with very firm pressure and is pulsatile when compressed.  Suspect this
   represents a small radial thrombosis.  There is good distal perfusion.
   Given this, I think that risks of resiting art line outweigh benefits
   at present.
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who felt no emergent need for HD.
   - CVVH started on [**9-16**] and had to be held as line is no longer
   working.  [**Month (only) 51**] be able to transition to HD.
   - Will likely need new HD line placed and this will likely require IR
   as this was needed for last line.
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - D/c renagel as phos is 2.4
   - Will obtain new u/a and urine culture.  Consider repeart renal
   ultrasound to eval current level of hydronephrosis.
    - If it is decided that pt needs a perc nephrostomy will re-consult
   uro (they had been consulted when first admitted and it was decided to
   hold
   # Adenocarcinoma, most likely ovarian
   - Cytology consistent with an adenocarcinoma. Staining revealed CK7
   positive only with rare B72.3 cells positive.  Equivocal for ovarian vs
   lung but morphology is consistent with ovarian.  Heme no longer feels
   it is necessary to obtain further tissue sample.  Will not require a
   lymph node biopsy
   # SOB and pleural effusion- improved s/p pigtail placement. Now on NC
   only.
   - Pigtail catheter in L base draining wel1 and pt more comfortable and
   off BiPAP.
   - IP will see pt tomorrow  morning to help flush tube (although it is
   still draining freely) as well as determine need for wall suction vs
   water seal.  IP also requests non contrast chest CT for further eval.
   - Chemistry of pleural fluid consistent with exudate, cytology pending,
   but so far consistent with adenoca
   - ECHO unconvincing for tamponade, just small effusion. Repeat ECHO
   ""unchanged"".  If pt continues to require pressors, will repeat echo.
   Depending on what echo shows in terms of the RV, will eval need for a
   V/Q scan to r/o PE.
   - Added standing bronchodilators
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   #. Hypothyroidism - cont home levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and recently diagnosed adenocarcinoma, most likely ovarian primary.
- She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia.
- The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has required norepinephrine for hemodynamic support.
- She has known pleural and pericardial effusions.
- Laboratory results show acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, hyperkalemia, leukocytosis, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Imaging studies reveal findings consistent with adenocarcinoma, possibly ovarian in origin.
- The patient has been managed with multiple interventions, including antibiotic therapy, fluid repletion, CVVH, and pigtail catheter placement for pleural effusion drainage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has required norepinephrine for hemodynamic support, indicating persistent hypotension. This may be due to sepsis, fluid overload, or cardiac dysfunction.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and is at risk for further deterioration in renal function. The differential diagnosis includes pre-renal physiology, contrast-induced nephropathy, post-obstructive renal failure, and tumor-related renal failure.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient had a significant elevation in potassium levels, which"

   cath and art line
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim wnl so likely not adrenally insufficient.
   - Has known pericardial effusion that has been stable but will check
   CVP through Vigileo if able to assess fluid status as now total body
   volume overloaded but likely intravascularly depleted.
   - Intravascular volume repletion with crystalloid and colloid as needed
   On my ultrasound exam, there is an entirely noncompressible portion of
   the right radial artery.  More proximally, the artery is compressible
   with very firm pressure and is pulsatile when compressed.  Suspect this
   represents a small radial thrombosis.  There is good distal perfusion.
   Given this, I think that risks of resiting art line outweigh benefits
   at present.
   #. Acute renal failure - Pt p/w weakness and SOB, found to have ARF w/
   Cr 7.8. Seen by renal in [**Name (NI) 73**], unclear baseline Cr for comparison but
   impressively sick. DDx includes pre-renal physiology [**2-22**] poor PO intake
   in combination with an increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced
   nephropathy (however, significant time delay between CT scan-[**9-5**] and
   first lab results showing elev Cr), and post-obstructive renal failure
   from R hydronephrosis (?) [**2-22**] tumor burden vs. ascites as seen US o/n.
   Seen by renal in ED, who felt no emergent need for HD.
   - CVVH started on [**9-16**] and had to be held as line is no longer
   working.  [**Month (only) 51**] be able to transition to HD.
   - Will likely need new HD line placed and this will likely require IR
   as this was needed for last line.
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - D/c renagel as phos is 2.4
   - Will obtain new u/a and urine culture.  Consider repeart renal
   ultrasound to eval current level of hydronephrosis.
    - If it is decided that pt needs a perc nephrostomy will re-consult
   uro (they had been consulted when first admitted and it was decided to
   hold
   # Adenocarcinoma, most likely ovarian
   - Cytology consistent with an adenocarcinoma. Staining revealed CK7
   positive only with rare B72.3 cells positive.  Equivocal for ovarian vs
   lung but morphology is consistent with ovarian.  Heme no longer feels
   it is necessary to obtain further tissue sample.  Will not require a
   lymph node biopsy
   # SOB and pleural effusion- improved s/p pigtail placement. Now on NC
   only.
   - Pigtail catheter in L base draining wel1 and pt more comfortable and
   off BiPAP.
   - IP will see pt tomorrow  morning to help flush tube (although it is
   still draining freely) as well as determine need for wall suction vs
   water seal.  IP also requests non contrast chest CT for further eval.
   - Chemistry of pleural fluid consistent with exudate, cytology pending,
   but so far consistent with adenoca
   - ECHO unconvincing for tamponade, just small effusion. Repeat ECHO
   ""unchanged"".  If pt continues to require pressors, will repeat echo.
   Depending on what echo shows in terms of the RV, will eval need for a
   V/Q scan to r/o PE.
   - Added standing bronchodilators
   #. Hyperkalemia - Most likely [**2-22**] worsening acute renal failure, esp in
   setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I.
   Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Now s/p tx w/ Ca
   gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of adenocarcinoma (most likely ovarian primary). She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. Noted to have pleural and pericardial effusions.

The patient has required norepinephrine for much of her admission and is concerned for sepsis due to tachycardia, leukocytosis, and on pressors. Empiric antibiotics were started to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia, as this is most likely given poor pulmonary status. Antibiotics will also cover line infections. Both HD catheter and art line need to be changed.

The patient's renal function is impaired with a creatinine level of 7.8. She has been seen by the renal team, who felt no emergent need for hemodialysis. CVVH was started but had to be held as the line is no longer working. She will likely need a new HD line placed, which will require interventional radiology (IR) as this was needed for the last line.

The patient's adenocarcinoma is most likely ovarian in origin. Cytology consistent with an adenocarcinoma was found, staining revealed CK7 positive only with rare B72.3 cells positive. Equivocal for ovarian vs lung but morphology is consistent with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, most likely ovarian primary. She presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. She has required norepinephrine for hypotension and has been on multiple antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia and line infections. The patient's pleural effusion has been drained, and she is now on nasal cannula oxygen only. Her renal function has been evaluated, and she is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). Additional tests and consultations are planned to further evaluate her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's tachycardia, leukocytosis, and requirement for vasopressors indicate a possible sepsis, especially considering her recent hospitalization and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's initial creatinine level of 7.8 suggests severe AKI. Factors such as pre-renal physiology, poor oral intake, increased Lasix dose, contrast-induced nephropathy, and post-obstructive renal failure have been considered. CVVH has been initiated, but there have been issues with the dialysis line.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with shock of uncertain etiology. She has been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and is currently in the ICU. The note mentions that the patient's cortisol results exclude adrenal insufficiency, and an echo showed a small effusion but no signs of tamponade. The rising white count is concerning for possible infection, and cultures have been taken. The patient's shock preceded the increase in white blood cell count, so empirical treatment is being administered while awaiting culture results.

The patient also has respiratory distress, acute renal failure, and a history of pleural effusion (malignant). A dialysis line change is under discussion, and the patient is receiving intravenous replacement therapy for suspected hypothyroidism. Other issues, such as nutrition and glycemic control, are being addressed as per the ICU team's note.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:
1. Infection: The rising white count indicates a possible infection, which could worsen if not appropriately treated.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient has signs of acute renal failure, and further deterioration of renal function can occur if not managed appropriately.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, and there is a risk of progressing to respiratory failure if not adequately supported.
4. Hypothyroidism: The TSH/FT4 results suggest marked hypothyroidism, which can contribute to shock and other systemic complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with shock of uncertain etiology, recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer, and multiple medical complications. She is currently in the ICU and is critically ill. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/50 mmHg to 129/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She has a history of hypotension, requiring the use of norepinephrine and levophed. The patient has been on various antibiotics, including piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. She also has a history of renal issues, leading to discussions about dialysis and hydronephrosis. Other medical conditions include acute renal failure, respiratory distress, hypothyroidism, and pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient's rising white blood cell count suggests a possible infection, which is being treated empirically while awaiting cultures.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: Cortisol results have excluded adrenal insufficiency, but it is still important to monitor for any signs or symptoms.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH/FT4 results indicate a possible contribution of hypothyroidism to the shock. Intravenous replacement therapy will be used to manage this"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and metastatic ovarian cancer. She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient has been complicated by hypotension requiring pressors, bilateral pleural effusions with malignant cytology, and acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has tachycardia, leukocytosis, and is on pressors, which raises concerns for sepsis. Empiric antibiotics have been started to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) as well as line infections. The need to change both HD cath and art line suggests a concern for sepsis.

2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has diffuse lung nodules and pleural effusion, which increases the risk of PE. Depending on the results of the echo, a V/Q scan may be needed to rule out PE.

3. Cardiac tamponade: Although the initial echo was unconvincing for tamponade, the presence of a small effusion raises concern for cardiac tamponade. Repeat echos will be evaluated if the patient continues to require pressors.

4. Renal failure: The patient has significant volume overload and anasarca, indicating possible acute renal failure. CVVH has been started and restarted"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and recent diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, most likely ovarian primary. She presented to the emergency department for evaluation of acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. She was found to have pleural and pericardial effusions.

The patient has required norepinephrine for much of her admission due to hypotension. Sepsis is a concern given her tachycardia, leukocytosis, and need for vasopressors. Empiric antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin) were started to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia as well as line infections. Both the hemodialysis catheter and arterial line need to be changed.

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, likely secondary to pre-renal physiology, poor oral intake, increased dose of Lasix, contrast-induced nephropathy, or post-obstructive renal failure from right hydronephrosis. CVVH was started but had to be held due to a non-functioning line. A new hemodialysis line will be placed, and the patient may transition to hemodialysis or potentially have dialysis discontinued.

Other issues include hyperkalemia, which is most likely due to worsening acute renal failure and the medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with metastatic ovarian cancer, acute renal failure, and malignant pleural effusion. She presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient's medical history includes hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia. She has been experiencing hypotension requiring pressors, and her course has been complicated by sepsis, metabolic causes, cardiogenic shock, and hypovolemia. The patient is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration) and has received antibiotics to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension and shock: The patient has been experiencing hypotension requiring pressors. The differential diagnosis for shock includes sepsis, metabolic causes, cardiogenic, and hypovolemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause of her hypotension and shock.
2. Malignant pleural effusion: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions with cytology consistent with malignancy. The left-sided effusion improved after pigtail catheter placement, but the right-sided effusion increased. Thoracentesis was performed, and pleurodesis may be considered in the future.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has significant volume overload and anasarca. CVVH was started on September 16th and stopped on September 20th due to poor access."

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer, acute renal failure on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and malignant pleural effusion. She presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient's medical history includes hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia.

The patient has been experiencing hypotension requiring norepinephrine for much of the admission. She has been on empiric antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) for the past five days. The differential diagnosis for shock includes sepsis, metabolic causes, cardiogenic, and hypovolemia.

The patient's pleural effusion has improved with pigtail catheter placement, but the right-sided effusion has increased. Thoracentesis of the right-sided effusion will be performed. The patient is also scheduled for a percutaneous nephrostomy tube for drainage due to unchanged right hydronephrosis. Anesthesia evaluation is required prior to the procedure.

The patient is not stable for chemotherapy treatment at this time. However, palliative chemotherapy with carboplatinum may be considered when she is off pressors and transferred to the oncology department. Allopurinol will be administered to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient requires ongoing norepinephrine support, indicating persistent hypotension. Further evaluation"

","The patient is a 74-year-old woman with shock of uncertain etiology and a recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer. She is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications.

1. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock, but the exact cause is unknown. An echocardiogram showed a small effusion, but no signs of tamponade. Repeat echocardiogram will be done to see if the effusion has increased. Cortisol results have excluded adrenal insufficiency.

2. Leucocytosis: The patient has persistent leucocytosis, which indicates an increased white blood cell count. This may suggest an infection, and the patient is being treated empirically with antibiotics while awaiting culture results.

3. Thoracentesis: The patient will undergo a thoracentesis today as per IP (internal protocol).

4. Dialysis line change: The patient's dialysis line was changed by renal yesterday.

5. TSH/FT4 results: The patient's TSH/FT4 results are concerning, as hypothyroidism may be contributing to the shock. Endocrine consultation has been obtained, and intravenous replacement therapy is being used.

6. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, and chest tube management will be performed by the IP team. Bronchodilators may be used as well.

7. Acute renal failure: The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) due to acute renal"

   74
R w/ metastatic ovarian cancer, ARF on CVVH, and malignant pleural
   effusion.  Course has been complicated by hypotension requiring
   pressors.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and hyperkalemia.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   #. Hypotension
 shock.  Has required Levophed for much of admission.
   Last 2 days been able to tolerate long pressor free periods.
   Differential dx for shock includes sepsis, metabolic causes,
   cardiogenic, hypovolemia.
   - [**Name (NI) 1064**] pt has a leukocytosis but has been afebrile.  Started on
   empiric abx to cover for HAP.  Continue empiric coverage until cultures
   clear.  Thus far, received 5 days of zosyn, 8 days of cipro, and 3 days
   of vanc.  Abx also would have covered a line infection.  Changed HD
   cath over the wire on [**9-22**] and art line was d/c
ed.  Will monitor PICC
   line for signs of infection.
   - Metabolic- [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim was wnl so likely not adrenal insufficiency.
   Consulted ID for evaluation of whether hypothyroidism could cause
   shock.  Increased dose of Synthroid and transitioned to IV but
   endocrinology felt that this was unlikely.
   - Cardiogenic-  ECHO unconvincing for tamponade, just small effusion.
   Repeat ECHO reported that it was ""unchanged"".  Will repeat TTE today to
   again eval for tamponade.  Depending on what echo shows in terms of the
   RV, will eval need for a V/Q scan to r/o PE as a cause of shock.
   - On [**9-22**], SVV suggested intravascular depletion, and repleted pt with
   crystalloid and colloid.  However, she did not require pressors for
   much of the day.  Will run CVVH at a 0 balance.
   # Bilat pleural effusions, cytology c/w malignancy.  Left sided
   effusion improved s/p pigtail placement but CT on [**9-22**] showed increased
   right sided effusion.  Only requiring NC at this time.
   - Pigtail cath draining well.  270cc serosang fluid in prev 24 hours.
   - IP following pigtail.
   - IP will also perform thoracentesis of right sided effusion.
   - ? of Pleurodesis when stable
   - Added standing bronchodilators for wheezing
   #. Acute renal failure
 Significant vol overload and anasarca.  CVVH
   started on [**9-16**] and stopped on [**9-20**] [**2-22**] poor access.
   - Line replaced by renal on [**9-23**] and restarted CVVH.
   - Repeat imaging of kidneys showed unchanged right hydronephrosis.
   Will re-consult urology for percutaneous nephrostomy tube for
   drainage.  [**Month (only) 51**] need anesthesia eval prior to procedure.
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - Follow electrolytes and replete as needed
   # Metastatic ovarian cancer: at this time, not stable for treatment

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer, acute renal failure on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and malignant pleural effusion. The patient presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. She has a history of hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia. The patient's course has been complicated by hypotension requiring vasopressors, sepsis, metabolic causes, cardiogenic shock, and hypovolemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be due to sepsis, metabolic causes, cardiogenic shock, or hypovolemia. The differential diagnosis for shock includes sepsis, metabolic causes, cardiogenic, and hypovolemia. Pressors have been used to maintain blood pressure.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure and is currently on CRRT. She also has significant volume overload and anasarca. CVVH was started on 9/16 but stopped on 9/20 due to poor access. A line replacement was done on 9/23, and CVVH was restarted. The repeat imaging of kidneys showed unchanged right hydronephrosis, and a percutaneous nephrostomy tube for drainage is planned. Holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF, and following electrolytes and repleting as needed.

3. Malignant Pleural Effusion: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, and cytology is consistent with malignancy. The left-sided effusion improved after pigtail placement, but the right-sided effusion increased. Thoracentesis of the right-sided effusion is planned, and pleurodesis will be considered when stable. Bronchodilators have been added for wheezing.

4. Metastatic Ovarian Cancer: The patient has metastatic ovarian cancer, which is currently not stable for treatment. Inpatient palliative chemotherapy, most likely carboplatinum, is required. The patient needs to be off pressors before transfer to oncology, and a chest tube needs to be removed prior to chemotherapy. Allopurinol will be used to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.

5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, and endocrinology consultation was obtained to evaluate if hypothyroidism could be the cause of persistent hypotension. An increased dose of Synthroid was given, and anti-TPO antibodies were obtained. A free T4 will be rechecked in several days.

6. Hyperkalemia: The patient had hyperkalemia, which has resolved. It was most likely due to worsening renal function, especially in the setting of medications she was taking, including Lasix and ACE-I. The patient received calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kay"

   - Normal LA size. Normal RA size.
   - Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function

   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.
   - Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
   - Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
   - Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
   - Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR. Moderate PA systolic
   hypertension.
   - Small pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   - Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows. Suboptimal image
   quality - body habitus. Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).
   Conclusions
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
   posterior pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-9-16**], the
   posterior effusion appears smaller.
   Assessment and Plan
   74
R w/ metastatic ovarian cancer, ARF on CVVH, and malignant pleural
   effusion.  Course has been complicated by hypotension requiring
   pressors.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and hyperkalemia.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   #. Hypotension
 shock.  Has required Levophed for much of admission.
   Last 2 days been able to tolerate long pressor free periods.
   Differential dx for shock includes sepsis, metabolic causes,
   cardiogenic, hypovolemia.
   - [**Name (NI) 1064**] pt has a leukocytosis but has been afebrile.  Started on
   empiric abx to cover for HAP.  D/c abx today ([**9-25**]); pt received 6 days
   of zosyn, 9 days of cipro, and 4 days of vanc.  Line infections:
   changed HD cath over the wire on [**9-23**] and art line was d/c
ed.  Will
   monitor PICC line for signs of infection.
   - Metabolic- [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim was wnl so likely not adrenal insufficiency.
   Consulted ID for evaluation of whether hypothyroidism could cause
   shock.  Increased dose of Synthroid and transitioned to IV but
   endocrinology that it is unlikely for hypothyroidism to be the cause.
   Endo also concerned because pt had one episode of paroxysmal a. fib on
   [**9-20**] and increased dose of synthroid may precipitate further episodes.
   Will continue to monitor, however, this episodes appears to be
   isolated.
   - Cardiogenic-  Repeat echo on [**9-24**] did not show evidence of tamponade,
   just small effusion.  RV size and motion was wnl; can consider V/Q scan
   to r/o PE as cause of hypotension however, given the echo findings
   there is a lower pretest probability
   - On [**9-22**], SVV suggested intravascular depletion, and repleted pt with
   crystalloid and colloid.  However, she did not require pressors for
   much of the day.  Will run CVVH at a 0 balance.  Will give albumin
   challenge today and if no improvement, can consider midodrine.  She
   continues to require levophed.  Will attempt to decrease levophed as
   tolerated
   # Bilat pleural effusions, cytology from left c/w malignancy.  Left
   sided effusion improved s/p pigtail placement but CT on [**9-22**] showed
   increased right sided effusion.  Only requiring NC at this time.
   - Pigtail cath draining well.  225 serosang fluid in prev 24 hours.
   - IP following pigtail.
   - IP performed thoracentesis of right sided effusion on [**9-24**]
   - ? of Pleurodesis vs pleurex when stable
   - Added standing bronchodilators for wheezing
   #. Acute renal failure
 Significant vol overload and anasarca.  CVVH
   started on [**9-16**] and stopped on [**9-20**] [**2-22**] poor access.
   - Line replaced by renal on [**9-23**] and restarted CVVH.
   - Repeat imaging of kidneys showed unchanged right hydronephrosis.
   - To OR tomorrow with urology for stenting of right ureter.  Will be
   performed on [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**], cysto-suite.  Needs to be NPO after
   midnight.  Also, will discuss case with anesthesia so that they are
   aware of her status.  [**Month (only) 51**] be able to transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]?
   - Has been hyponatremic and hyperglycemia.  Unclear etiology but
   hyponatremia may be related to the ultrafiltrate bath having a Na
   concentration of 130.  Na corrected slightly following initiation of
   insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia.  Also, hyperglycemia seems to
   have occurred acutely.  No prior episodes of hyperglycemia during this
   admission.  Also, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, finger sticks are consistently lower than
   serum glucose.  Could be related to diffuse extravascular volume.
   Continue to monitor and use ISS as needed.
   - Replete phos today; can use Na-Phos for added sodium benefit
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   # Metastatic ovarian cancer: at this time, not stable for treatment
   - Will require inpt palliative chemotherapy, most likely carboplatinum
   - When off pressors, can be transferred to OMED
   - Onc would prefer chest tube to be out prior to chemotherapy
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   - Updated gyn onc resident re pt
s current condition on [**9-25**].
   #. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.  Preliminary
   thought is no, but increased dose to 100 mcg.  Need to re-check a free

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer, acute renal failure, and malignant pleural effusion. She has been experiencing hypotension requiring pressors, and her condition has been complicated by hyperkalemia, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's labs show hyponatremia and hyperglycemia. She has a small posterior pericardial effusion but no signs of tamponade.

   Conclusions
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
   posterior pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-9-16**], the
   posterior effusion appears smaller.

 shock.  Has required Levophed for much of admission.
   Last 2 days been able to tolerate long pressor free periods.
   Differential dx for shock includes sepsis, metabolic causes,
   cardiogenic, hypovolemia.
   - [**Name (NI) 1064**] pt has a leukocytosis but has been afebrile.  Started on
   empiric abx to cover for HAP.  Continue empiric coverage until cultures
   clear.  Thus far, received 6 days of zosyn, 9 days of cipro, and 4 days
   of vanc.  Abx also would have covered a line infection.  Changed HD
   cath over the wire on [**9-23**] and art line was d/c
ed.  Will monitor PICC
   line for signs of infection.
   - Metabolic- [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim was wnl so likely not adrenal insufficiency.
   Consulted ID for evaluation of whether hypothyroidism could cause
   shock.  Increased dose of Synthroid and transitioned to IV but
   endocrinology felt that this was unlikely.
   - Cardiogenic-  ECHO on [**9-23**] did not show evidence of tamponade, just
   small effusion.  RV size and motion was wnl; can consider V/Q scan to
   r/o PE as cause of hypotension however, given the echo findings there
   is a lower pretest probability
   - On [**9-22**], SVV suggested intravascular depletion, and repleted pt with
   crystalloid and colloid.  However, she did not require pressors for
   much of the day.  Will run CVVH at a 0 balance.
   # Bilat pleural effusions, cytology from left c/w malignancy.  Left
   sided effusion improved s/p pigtail placement but CT on [**9-22**] showed
   increased right sided effusion.  Only requiring NC at this time.
   - Pigtail cath draining well.  225 serosang fluid in prev 24 hours.
   - IP following pigtail.
   - IP performed thoracentesis of right sided effusion on [**9-24**]
   - ? of Pleurodesis vs pleurex when stable
   - Added standing bronchodilators for wheezing
   #. Acute renal failure
 Significant vol overload and anasarca.  CVVH
   started on [**9-16**] and stopped on [**9-20**] [**2-22**] poor access.
   - Line replaced by renal on [**9-23**] and restarted CVVH.
   - Repeat imaging of kidneys showed unchanged right hydronephrosis.
   Will re-consult urology for percutaneous nephrostomy tube for
   drainage.  [**Month (only) 51**] need anesthesia eval prior to procedure.
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   - Follow electrolytes and replete as needed
   # Metastatic ovarian cancer: at this time, not stable for treatment
   - Will require inpt palliative chemotherapy, most likely carboplatinum
   - When off pressors, can be transferred to OMED
   - Onc would prefer chest tube to be out prior to chemotherapy
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   #. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.  Preliminary
   thought is no, but increased dose to 125 mcg.  Also, obtained anti-TPO
   antibodies.  Need to re-check a free T4 in several days.
   - Changed from oral to IV to ensure proper absorption
   #. Hyperkalemia, resolved: Most likely due to worsening renal function,
   esp in setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and
   ACE-I. Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Treated w/
   Ca gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer, acute renal failure (ARF), and malignant pleural effusion. She has been admitted to the ICU due to hypotension requiring pressors and has required CVVH for ARF. Her course has been complicated by hypotension, hypokalemia, and hyperlipidemia. She has been treated for hyperkalemia and hyperglycemia. The patient's medical history includes hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia. She is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing persistent hypotension requiring pressors. The differential diagnosis for her shock includes sepsis, metabolic causes, cardiogenic, and hypovolemia. She has been evaluated for possible causes such as adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and cardiogenic shock, but these have been ruled out. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of her hypotension.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient initially presented with ARF and hyperkalemia. She underwent CVVH but experienced complications such as line infections and poor access. CVVH was restarted after replacing the line. The patient's right hydronephrosis has not improved, and a percutaneous nephrostomy tube for drainage is being considered."

   Consulted ID for evaluation of whether hypothyroidism could cause
   shock.  Increased dose of Synthroid and transitioned to IV but
   endocrinology felt that this was unlikely.
   - Cardiogenic-  ECHO unconvincing for tamponade, just small effusion.
   Repeat ECHO reported that it was ""unchanged"".  Will repeat TTE today to
   again eval for tamponade.  Depending on what echo shows in terms of the
   RV, will eval need for a V/Q scan to r/o PE as a cause of shock.
   - On [**9-22**], SVV suggested intravascular depletion, and repleted pt with
   crystalloid and colloid.  However, she did not require pressors for
   much of the day.  Will run CVVH at a 0 balance.
   # Bilat pleural effusions, cytology c/w malignancy.  Left sided
   effusion improved s/p pigtail placement but CT on [**9-22**] showed increased
   right sided effusion.  Only requiring NC at this time.
   - Pigtail cath draining well.  270cc serosang fluid in prev 24 hours.
   - IP following pigtail.
   - IP will also perform thoracentesis of right sided effusion.

   # Metastatic ovarian cancer: at this time, not stable for treatment
   - Will require inpt palliative chemotherapy, most likely carboplatinum
   - When off pressors, can be transferred to OMED
   - Onc would prefer chest tube to be out prior to chemotherapy
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   #. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.  Preliminary
   thought is no, but increased dose to 125 mcg.  Also, obtained anti-TPO
   antibodies.  Need to re-check a free T4 in several days.
   - Changed from oral to IV to ensure proper absorption
   #. Hyperkalemia, resolved: Most likely due to worsening renal function,
   esp in setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and
   ACE-I. Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Treated w/
   Ca gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer, acute renal failure (ARF), and malignant pleural effusion. She has been in the ICU for several days, experiencing hypotension requiring vasopressor support, leukocytosis, and fever. She has received multiple antibiotics and has been treated for hyperkalemia. Her condition is complicated by bilateral pleural effusions, right-sided effusion improvement after pigtail catheter placement, ongoing drainage, and consideration for pleurodesis. She also has acute renal failure with significant volume overload and anasarca, CVVH initiated and restarted due to poor access, unchanged right hydronephrosis, and planned percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. Other issues include hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and metastatic ovarian cancer requiring palliative chemotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requires ongoing vasopressor support. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of shock, which could include sepsis, metabolic causes, cardiogenic factors, or hypovolemia.
2. Malignant Pleural Effusion: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions with cytology confirming malignancy. The left-sided effusion has improved with pigtail catheter placement, but the right-sided effusion remains significant. Thoracentesis and pleurodesis may be considered to manage the effusions.

- The patient has been treated with empiric antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and line infections.
- Metabolic causes of shock have been ruled out, and there is no evidence of cardiogenic shock.
- Cardiogenic causes were initially evaluated, but subsequent echocardiograms did not show tamponade or significant effusion.
- Intravascular depletion was suggested by the systolic vascular variation (SVV), and the patient was repleted with crystalloid and colloid.
- Bilateral pleural effusions with cytology consistent with malignancy were noted, with improvement on the left side after pigtail catheter placement.
- The right-sided effusion increased, and an IP thoracentesis was performed.
- Acute renal failure is present, and the patient has been experiencing significant volume overload and anasarca.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o woman with shock of uncertain etiology in the setting of recent
   diagnosis of ovarian cancer.
   Shock
     * No evidence of tamponade by repeat echo [**2138-9-24**]
     * Adrenal insufficiency is adequately excluded
     * No clinical evidence for sepsis
     * TSH/FT4 results concerning that hypothyroidism may be contributing
       a bit to hypotension.  However, it seems extremely unusual for this
       to be the primary etiology when her mental status is so preserved.
       Appreciate endocrine
s help.
     * A CVP of [**5-31**] be too low for her.  We will try a colloid
       challenge today until CVP ~15 (or up to 25 mg albumin x 3).
     * If she remains on pressors after albumin challenge, then will try
       midodrine.  Circulating factors from tumor may play a role.
   Leucocytosis
   Leucocytosis persists but cultures have remained negative and she has
   other reasons for leucocytosis.  We will discontinue antibiotics today;
   she has received 6 days of zosyn, 9 days of cipro, and 4 days of
   vancomycin.
   Respiratory Distress
   Seems to have improved
   Chest tube management per IP team
   Bronchodilate
   Acute renal failure
   On CVVHD.
   As discussed with renal, believe she might get enough benefit from
   relieving post-renal obstruction to pursue stent or percutaneous
   nephrostomy.  Urology recommended stenting over nephrostomy, and we are
   pursuing this plan.
   Ovarian cancer
   To OMED once acute issues complete
   Pleural effusion (malignant)
   Leave pigtail in. Eventual pleurodesis vs Pleurx.
   Other issues as per ICU team note.

   Critical Care Staff Addendum
   7:30pm
   Hypotension: appears to have responded to albumin challenge.  After
   250cc Plasmanate, she came off the norepinephrine.  This suggests that
   optimal CVP is probably ~14+ in this patient.  I suspect that she has
   ongoing losses into her peritoneum, pleura, and subcutaneous tissue and
   will require additional volume expansion.  We have pursued colloid
   rather than crystalloid because of her anasarca.
   Hydronephrosis: I have discussed the issue of whether or not to pursue
   stenting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1458**] (from renal). We agree that her
   hydronephrosis probably only contributes a small amount to her renal
   failure. However, we were able to keep her off dialysis for almost
   three days with only mild-moderate increases in her creatinine. I
   therefore think that a very minimal increase in renal function might
   result in her being able to be off of dialysis. I in no way believe
   that this a guaranteed result, and in fact think that it only somewhere
   in the 10, 20, or 30 percent range, which is how I discussed it with
   her and her family today.
   I spent 45 minutes today talking about this decision with the patient,
   her son, and her daughter. We talked about the fact that we don't have
   certainty about the results of treatment for her (either the planned
   stent or any potential cytotoxic therapy), and went through several
   potential ways forward, including stenting, an attempt at chemotherapy
   without stenting, etc. We also talked explicitly about potential
   adverse outcomes from the stent/anesthesia, even including respiratory
   failure and inability to get her off the vent (which I think is
   extremely unlikely but in many ways is one of the worst possible
   outcomes).
   They are able to verbalize understanding of all this and wanted to
   proceed with the plan of care we've described (attempt at stenting,
   assessment of renal response, and subsequent consideration of
   chemotherapeutic rx).
   I think that this is a reasonable way to balance the risks and benefits
   in this challenging situation.  All questions answered.
   CC time: 80 min
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with shock of uncertain etiology, recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer, and multiple medical complications. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on multiple medications including norepinephrine, heparin, famotidine, and others. Her vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing hypotension, leucocytosis, respiratory distress, acute renal failure, and pleural effusion. The medical team is considering a stent placement to relieve post-renal obstruction and potentially improve her renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is still experiencing shock, although the exact cause is uncertain. Continuous monitoring and management of her hemodynamic status are crucial to prevent further deterioration.
2. Leucocytosis: The patient has persistent leucocytosis, but her cultures have remained negative. Antibiotic therapy has been discontinued due to the lack of evidence for infection. Close monitoring of her white blood cell count and clinical signs for any indication of infection is necessary.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress seems to have improved. However, ongoing assessment of her respiratory status and continued use of bronchodilators may be required.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) due to acute renal failure. Stent placement is being considered to relieve post-renal obstruction and improve renal function."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing shock and has undergone several medical interventions. The patient's condition is critical, and they are currently in the ICU. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and interventions include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated heart rate may indicate septic shock, which can be a life-threatening complication of an infection.

2. Renal failure: The patient has a history of hydronephrosis and requires dialysis, indicating possible renal failure. Complications such as further deterioration of kidney function or fluid overload can occur.

3. Pulmonary complications: The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula, and their ABG results show hypoxemia. They may be at risk for pneumonia or other lung infections due to their weakened respiratory status.

4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's diminished peripheral pulses suggest potential cardiovascular issues, which could lead to complications like cardiac arrest or ischemia.

5. Surgical risks: The patient is scheduled for a stenting procedure, and there are risks associated with anesthesia and surgery, including bleeding, infection, or adverse reactions to medication.

6. Respiratory failure: The patient's dependence on respiratory support indicates a risk for respiratory failure, particularly if they undergo a procedure that may compromise their respiratory function.

7. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism ("

   Changes to medical and family history:
   Transfer Note:
   Patient initially admitted to MICU [**Location (un) **] on [**9-13**] for acute renal
   failure and hyperkalemia.  Now transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for ureteral
   stenting tomorrow and possible palliative chemo on OMED.
   MICU course as below:
   74 yo F w/ Stage IV metastatic ovarian cancer, ARF on CVVH, and
   malignant pleural effusion.  Course has been complicated by
   hypotension requiring pressors (levophed).  Originally presented
   to ED [**2-22**] ARF and hyperkalemia.  PMH includes hypothyroidism and
   HLD.
   .
   #. Hypotension/shock.  Has required Levophed for much of
   admission.  Last 2-3 days prior to leaving the MICU for the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**]
   she tolerated several hours without pressors; however, she
   received albumin or blood during these periods.   Differential
   dx for shock includes sepsis, metabolic causes, cardiogenic,
   hypovolemia.
   - [**Name (NI) 1064**] pt has a leukocytosis but has been afebrile.  Started
   on empiric abx to cover for HAP.  D/c abx on [**9-25**]: pt received 6
   days of zosyn, 9 days of cipro, and 4 days of vanc.  Line
   infections: changed HD cath over the wire on [**9-23**] and art line
   was d/c
ed.  Monitored PICC line for signs of infection.
   - Metabolic- [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim was wnl so likely not adrenal
   insufficiency.  Consulted ID for evaluation of whether
   hypothyroidism could cause shock.  Increased dose of Synthroid
   and transitioned to IV but endocrinology that it is unlikely for
   hypothyroidism to be the cause. Endo also concerned because pt
   had one episode of paroxysmal a. fib on [**9-20**] and increased dose
   of synthroid may precipitate further episodes.  Will continue to
   monitor, however, this episodes appears to be isolated.
   - Cardiogenic-  Originally, was concerned for tamponade.
   Although they have been suboptimal studies, multiple echoes have
   only showed effusions without echocardiographic evidence of
   tamponade with one exception.  Her echo from [**9-15**] showed
   impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.  Most recent echo on [**9-24**]
   again did not show evidence of tamponade, just small effusion.
   also, echo on [**9-24**] revealed normal RV size and motion which made
   PE less likely.  Throughout her course in the MICU, have
   considered V/Q scan to r/o PE as a possible cause of hypotension
   however, given her echo findings, the pretest possibility
   remains equivocal.
   - On [**9-22**], SVV (from Vigileo) suggested intravascular depletion,
   and repleted pt with crystalloid and colloid.  However, she did
   not require pressors for much of that day.  For last few days
   prior to transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**], have been running CVVH at a 0
   balance.  Gave albumin challenge again on [**9-25**] and her CVP bumped
   to 12 and was thus able to be off of leveophed for several
   hours. It appeared that she needs her CVP to be [**1-4**] to
   maintain her BP.  Goal has been to wean levophed and have
   considered transitioning to midodrine as an oral pressor.
   - At time of transfer, the etiology of her hypotension remains
   elusive.  Without an adequate explanation, team has hypothesized
   that this may be a possible paraneoplastic syndrome.
   .
   # Bilat pleural effusions, cytology from left c/w malignancy.
   Final cytology from right effusion still pending at time of
   transfer but pH, cell counts, gluc, prot consistent with left
   effusion and anticipate that it will also be malignant. Prior to
   first thoracentesis, pt required BiPap but upon transfer, pt has
   been satting well on only 1.5L NC for several days.
   Underwent both chest tube and pigtail placement for left sided
   effusion.  Chest tube was removed early in course of stay
   because it was extrathoracic and not draining but pigtail
   (placed by IP) continues to drain serosang fluid.  Was placed to
   water seal by IP on [**9-25**].  A repeat CT on [**9-22**] showed increased
   right sided effusion which was tapped on [**9-24**].  IP is considering
   either Pleurodesis vs pleurex when stable.  Has also used
   bronchodilators for wheezing.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure
 Persistent volume overload and
   anasarca.  Originally admitted with K of 7.8 and Cr of 7.2.
   Hyperkalemia resolved quickly (see below).  Held on dialysis for
   a few days but CVVH was started on [**9-16**] but had to be stopped
   temporarily on [**9-20**] [**2-22**] poor access.  Line changed over the wire
   by renal on [**9-23**] and restarted CVVH. Initial and repeat imaging
   of kidneys has showed continued right hydronephrosis.  Plan is
   to transfer from MICU ([**Hospital Ward Name **]) to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] in order to go to
   the OR with urology on [**9-26**].  Urology will place a stent in the
   right ureter.  Goal of stenting is to relieve the obstruction
   with the hope of regaining some kidney function.  Acutely on
   [**9-24**], she developed hyponatremia and hyperglycemia. Unclear
   etiology but hyponatremia may be related to the ultrafiltrate
   bath having a Na concentration of 130.  Na corrected slightly
   following initiation of insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia.
   Also, hyperglycemia seems to have occurred acutely.  No prior
   episodes of hyperglycemia during this admission.  Also, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN,
   finger sticks are consistently lower than serum glucose.  Could
   be related to diffuse extravascular volume.  Pt was placed on
   insulin sliding scale for the elev glucose.  Initially, pt was
   hyperphosphatemic but on the day of transfer pt required
   repletion of phos.  Used Na-Phos for added sodium benefit.  Have
   held home Lasix and ACE-I in setting of ARF.
   .
   # Metastatic ovarian cancer: cardiopulmonary status has been too
   tenuous for treatment during this admission.  Obtained tumor
   markers which revealed borderline high CA-125 and elevated
   CA27,29, but were overall non-specific.  Heme onc is following
   closely and feel that pt will require inpt palliative
   chemotherapy, most likely carboplatinum.  Family has been
   supportive of continuing more aggressive means of treatment.
   Have discussed transfer to OMED when stable and off pressors.
   Gyn onc originally saw the pt but have not been following daily.
   Also, on allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism
 Was diagnosed with hypothyroidism approx 2
   weeks prior to admission and had been started on a low dose of
   Synthroid. Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   Preliminary thought is no, but increased dose to 100 mcg on [**9-25**].
   Per endo, should re-check a Free T4 level in 3 to 4 days.
   Anti-TPO ab < 10.  Also, changed from oral to IV Synthroid to
   ensure proper absorption despite this one episode of
   questionable a. fib.
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia, resolved: Was most likely due to worsening
   renal function, esp in setting of the medications she was
   taking, including Lasix and ACE-I. Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to
   ED, without ECG changes. Treated w/ Ca gluconate, insulin /
   dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.  Potassium has
   appropriately responded to treatment and has remained wnl.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia - Taking home statin dose.
   .
   #. Code - Pt remains full code at time of transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**].

   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia.  PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   .
   #. Hypotension and shock.  Has required Levophed for much of
   admission.  Last 2 days been able to tolerate long pressor free
   periods.   Differential dx for shock includes sepsis, metabolic causes,
   cardiogenic, hypovolemia.
   .
   - [**Name (NI) 1064**] pt has a leukocytosis but has been afebrile.  Started on
   empiric abx to cover for HAP.  D/c abx today ([**9-25**]); pt received 6 days
   of zosyn, 9 days of cipro, and 4 days of vanc.  Line infections:
   changed HD cath over the wire on [**9-23**] and art line was d/c
ed.  Will
   monitor PICC line for signs of infection.
   - Metabolic- [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim was wnl so likely not adrenal insufficiency.
   Consulted ID for evaluation of whether hypothyroidism could cause
   shock.  Increased dose of Synthroid and transitioned to IV but
   endocrinology that it is unlikely for hypothyroidism to be the cause.
   Endo also concerned because pt had one episode of paroxysmal a. fib on
   [**9-20**] and increased dose of synthroid may precipitate further episodes.
   Will continue to monitor, however, this episodes appears to be
   isolated.
   - Cardiogenic-  Repeat echo on [**9-24**] did not show evidence of tamponade,
   just small effusion.  RV size and motion was wnl; can consider V/Q scan
   to r/o PE as cause of hypotension however, given the echo findings
   there is a lower pretest probability
   - On [**9-22**], SVV suggested intravascular depletion, and repleted pt with
   crystalloid and colloid.  However, she did not require pressors for
   much of the day.  Will run CVVH at a 0 balance.  She continues to
   require levophed, can consider midodrine v more albumin.  Will attempt
   to decrease levophed as tolerated.
   - goal CVP 12-14
   .
   # Bilat pleural effusions, cytology from left c/w malignancy.  Left
   sided effusion improved s/p pigtail placement but CT on [**9-22**] showed
   increased right sided effusion.  Only requiring NC at this time.
   - Pigtail cath draining well.  IP following pigtail.
   - IP performed thoracentesis of right sided effusion on [**9-24**]
   - ? of Pleurodesis vs pleurex when stable
   - Added standing bronchodilators for wheezing
   - f/u cytology for r-sided studies

   #. Acute renal failure
 Significant vol overload and anasarca.  CVVH
   started on [**9-16**] and stopped on [**9-20**] [**2-22**] poor access.  Line replaced by
   renal on [**9-23**] and restarted CVVH.
   - Repeat imaging of kidneys showed unchanged right hydronephrosis.
   - To OR tomorrow with urology for stenting of right ureter.  Will be
   performed on [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**], cysto-suite.  Needs to be NPO after
   midnight.
   - Has been hyponatremic and hyperglycemia.  Unclear etiology but
   hyponatremia may be related to the ultrafiltrate bath having a Na
   concentration of 130.  Na corrected slightly following initiation of
   insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia.  Also, hyperglycemia seems to
   have occurred acutely.  No prior episodes of hyperglycemia during this
   admission.  Also, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, finger sticks are consistently lower than
   serum glucose.  Could be related to diffuse extravascular volume.
   Continue to monitor and use ISS as needed.
   - Replete phos today; can use Na-Phos for added sodium benefit
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   .
   # Metastatic ovarian cancer: at this time, not stable for treatment
   - Will require inpt palliative chemotherapy, most likely carboplatinum
   - When off pressors, can be transferred to OMED
   - Onc would prefer chest tube to be out prior to chemotherapy
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   - Updated gyn onc resident re pt
s current condition on [**9-25**].

   #. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.  Preliminary
   thought is no, but increased dose to 100 mcg.  Need to re-check a free
   T4 in several days.
   - Anti-TPO ab < 10
   - Changed from oral to IV to ensure proper absorption
   - Monitor for a. fib
   - appreciate endocrine recs
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia, resolved: Most likely due to worsening renal function,
   esp in setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and
   ACE-I. Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Treated w/
   Ca gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer, acute renal failure, and malignant pleural effusion. She has a history of hypothyroidism and hypodermic lipomatous. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for hypotension and shock, requiring continuous infusion of norepinephrine and intermittent levophed. She also has a history of hyperkalemia, which has resolved with treatment. The patient's renal function is significantly impaired, leading to volume overload and anasarca. She is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) at a 0 balance.

The patient's pleural effusion has improved after pigtail catheter placement, but there is an increased right-sided effusion. She is scheduled for ureteral stenting tomorrow and possible palliative chemotherapy. The patient's glycemic control is being managed with regular insulin sliding scale.

There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case. These include:

1. Hypotension and shock: The patient has been experiencing hypotension and shock, requiring continuous infusion of norepinephrine and intermittent levophed. The differential diagnosis for shock includes sepsis, metabolic causes, cardiogenic, and hypovolemia. The team is considering V/Q scan to rule out pulmonary embolism as a cause of hypotension. Further monitoring and management are needed to stabilize the patient's blood pressure"

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has been afebrile, so there is no fever to indicate an infection. However, she has received empiric antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
3. Metabolic causes: The patient's cortisol level was within normal limits, suggesting that adrenal insufficiency is unlikely. Hypothyroidism may not be the cause of shock as well.
4. Cardiogenic causes: An echocardiogram did not show evidence of tamponade, just a small effusion. Right ventricular size and motion were normal, making a pulmonary embolism (PE) less likely.

   sepsis.  This may improve post-procedure.  Will also re-check cortisol.
   Plan:
   -Ureteral stent to relieve obstruction and might relieve possible
   infection
   -continue antibiotics
   - re-check cortisol
   - thiamine
   2) Acute Renal Failure:
   Plan: continue CVVH for now
   3) Hypothyroidism
   Plan: synthryoid
   4) FEN: NPO for procedure

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with ovarian cancer who has been transferred from another hospital for plans of ureteral stent placement and chemotherapy. She has been vasopressor-dependent for unclear reasons and is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for renal failure. The patient has allergies to oxycodone and nausea/vomiting. She received antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin, within the last 24 hours. She is currently receiving norepinephrine, calcium gluconate (CRRT), potassium chloride (CRRT), heparin sodium, and lorazepam. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the addition of hypotension. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9 C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/62 to 127/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination shows clear lung sounds bilaterally, regular heart sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm and dry extremities. Her laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, low sodium, high potassium, low calcium, low magnesium, high phosphorus, high blood urea nitrogen, high creatinine, low albumin, high lactate, and abnormal liver enzymes. Imaging studies are also noted, but not described in detail. The patient's assessment includes hypotension (possibly due to sepsis from a trapped bacterial infection), acute renal failure, hypothyroidism, and fasting for a procedure. The plan includes placing a ureteral stent, continuing antibiotics, rechecking cortisol levels, starting thiamine, continuing CVVH, initiating levothyroxine, and providing ICU care. The patient's code status is full code, and she is to remain in the ICU."

   cancer on pressorts and [**Hospital 1460**] transferred from west to east for ureteral
   stenting and possible palliative chemo
   24 Hour Events:
   doing well, on CVVH this AM. concern for sepsis of unknown etiology.
   hypotension, on pressor. new onset hyperglycemia 1 week ago, now on
   ISS.
   -f/u endocrine recs - order free T3, T4, TSH, ftbh for tomorrow AM as
   per their recs, no mention of cortisol level being on the low end of
   normal
   -repeat cortisol (added on to [**9-26**] am labs)
   - renal fellow notes, continue on CVVH, still requiring pressors and
   hence unable to CIF. Hydronephrosis due to obstruction and plan for
   stenting, concerned that the stent will block soon after placment
   - as per urology patient is not a candidate for percutanous nephrostomy
   tube because cannot lay flat for positive.
   - went to OR today for stent placement. as per urology there is
   evidence of hydronephrosis and significant stricture close to UPJ -
   urine removed was cloudy but no definitive perinephric abscess was
   identified- sent as per urology resident for culture
   - patient post procedure came back intubated, d/c propofol drip but
   patient still requiring [**Last Name (LF) 494**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] likely be able to d/c
   - oncology notes, metastatic cancer likely ovarian, kidney failure due
   to ATN plus AIN plus/minus effects of ureteral obstruction, hypotension
   due to fluid shifts related to ca effusions vs. adreanl insufficiency -
   chemo LOW probability of cure, also risky in context of poor kidney
   failure, do not think that ureteral stent would reverse her renal
   failure. family willingness to try chemo even if results in permananent
   kidney failure and death. - if renal function improves and hypotension
   resolves will offer single [**Doctor Last Name **] chemo.
   - as per attending would consider starting steroids if patient remains
   hypotensive as patient with low-normal cortisol in the setting of what
   should be a high stress situation.

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia.  PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   #. Hypotension and shock.  Has required Levophed for much of
   admission.  Transiently able to be able to get off of pressors,
   intermittently requiring levofed.   Differential diagnsosis is likely
   mixed picture of  malignant leak, thyroid leak, septic leak.
   - [**Name (NI) 1064**] pt has a leukocytosis but has been afebrile.  Started on
   empiric abx to cover for HAP.  D/c abx today ([**9-25**]); pt received 6 days
   of zosyn, 9 days of cipro, and 4 days of vanc.  Line infections:
   changed HD cath over the wire on [**9-23**] and art line was d/c
ed.  Will
   monitor PICC line for signs of infection.
   - Metabolic- [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim was wnl so likely not adrenal insufficiency.
   Random cortisol was on the lower side. Consulted endocrinology for
   evaluation of whether hypothyroidism could cause shock.  Increased dose
   of Synthroid and transitioned to IV but endocrinology that it is
   unlikely for hypothyroidism to be the cause. Endo also concerned
   because pt had one episode of paroxysmal a. fib on [**9-20**] and increased
   dose of synthroid may precipitate further episodes.  Will continue to
   monitor, however, this episodes appears to be isolated.
   - Cardiogenic-  Repeat echo on [**9-24**] did not show evidence of tamponade,
   just small effusion.  RV size and motion was wnl; can consider V/Q scan
   to r/o PE as cause of hypotension however, given the echo findings
   there is a lower pretest probability
   - On [**9-22**], SVV suggested intravascular depletion, and repleted pt with
   crystalloid and colloid.  She continues to require levophed, can
   consider midodrine v more albumin.  Will attempt to decrease levophed
   as tolerated.
   - goal CVP 12-14
   - new thing we started steroids yesterday, as well as IV albumin
   - would re-start vanco for gram + coverage as well
   - transfuse goals to keep Hct > 30
   .
   #) Intubation for procedure
   -          not off sedation, on 5 and 5, RSBi on higher side but
   patient is large, probably at base line
   -          blood pressure stable
   -          plan to try to extubate today
   -          chest x-ray over 24 hours
   # Bilat pleural effusions, cytology from left c/w malignancy.  Left
   sided effusion improved s/p pigtail placement but CT on [**9-22**] showed
   increased right sided effusion.  Only requiring NC at this time.
   - pH on pleural fluid 6.9, chest tube in place
   - Pigtail cath draining well.  IP following pigtail
   - IP performed thoracentesis of right sided effusion on [**9-24**]
   - Pleurodesis vs pleurex when stable as per thoraric surgery, CT
   surgery also wants CT chest
   - Added standing bronchodilators for wheezing
   - f/u cytology for r-sided studies
   .
   #. Acute renal failure
 Significant vol overload and anasarca.  CVVH
   started on [**9-16**] and stopped on [**9-20**] [**2-22**] poor access.  Line replaced by
   renal on [**9-23**] and restarted CVVH.
   - Repeat imaging of kidneys showed unchanged right hydronephrosis.
   - right ureteral procedure yesterday to open stricture.  Will be
   performed on [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**], cysto-suite.  Needs to be NPO after midnight.
   Patient is not candidate for percutaneous nephrostomy tube, due to
   anasarca; it will still need MAC.
   - Has been hyponatremic and hyperglycemia.  Unclear etiology but
   hyponatremia may be related to the ultrafiltrate bath having a Na
   concentration of 130.  Na corrected slightly following initiation of
   insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia.  Also, hyperglycemia seems to
   have occurred acutely.  No prior episodes of hyperglycemia during this
   admission.  Also, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, finger sticks are consistently lower than
   serum glucose.  Could be related to diffuse extravascular volume.
   Continue to monitor and use ISS as needed.
   - Replete phos today; can use Na-Phos for added sodium benefit
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   .
   # Metastatic ovarian cancer: at this time, not stable for treatment
   - Will require inpt palliative chemotherapy, most likely carboplatinum
   - When off pressors, can be transferred to OMED
   - Onc would prefer chest tube to be out prior to chemotherapy
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   - Updated gyn onc resident re pt
s current condition on [**9-25**].
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.  Preliminary
   thought is no, but increased dose to 100 mcg.  Need to re-check a free
   T4 in several days.
   - Anti-TPO ab < 10
   - Changed from oral to IV to ensure proper absorption
   - Monitor for a. fib
   - appreciate endocrine recs
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia, resolved: Most likely due to worsening renal function,
   esp in setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and
   ACE-I. Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Treated w/
   Ca gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment  and has remained
   wnl.

The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She has been admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. The patient has a complex medical history including hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and a history of acute renal failure. She is currently experiencing hypotension and shock, requiring pressor support. The differential diagnosis for her hypotension includes sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, and cardiogenic shock. She also has evidence of acute kidney injury with oliguria and an elevated creatinine level. The patient has been treated with CVVH, insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia, and IV albumin. She is currently intubated and will undergo a procedure for ureteral stenting. The oncology team would like to consider palliative chemotherapy once she is stable, but this may be risky given her poor renal function. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. Close monitoring for signs of septic shock is crucial.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's cortisol levels are on the lower end of normal, and there is concern for adrenal insufficiency. Monitoring for symptoms such as fatigue, hypotension, and hyperpigmentation is important.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and evidence"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia.  PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   #. Hypotension and shock.  Has required Levophed for much of
   admission.  Transiently able to be able to get off of pressors,
   intermittently requiring levofed.   Differential diagnsosis is likely
   mixed picture of  malignant fluid leak, thyroid leak, septic leak.
   - [**Name (NI) 1064**] pt has a leukocytosis but has been afebrile.  Started on
   empiric abx to cover for HAP.  D/c abx ([**9-25**]); pt received 6 days of
   zosyn, 9 days of cipro, and 4 days of vanc.  With concern for possible
   line infections: changed HD cath over the wire on [**9-23**] and art line was
   d/c
ed.  PICC line without signs of active infection.
   - Metabolic- [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim was wnl so likely not overt adrenal
   insufficiency, however random cortisol was on the lower side of normal
   especially in the context of what should be normal stress response. On
   [**9-26**] PM started IV steroids for concerns for relative adrenal
   insufficiency. Consulted endocrinology for evaluation of whether
   hypothyroidism could cause shock.  Increased dose of Synthroid and
   transitioned to IV but endocrinology that it is unlikely for
   hypothyroidism to be the cause. Endo also concerned because pt had one
   episode of paroxysmal a. fib on [**9-20**] and increased dose of synthroid
   may precipitate further episodes.  Will continue to monitor, however,
   this episodes appears to be isolated.
   - Cardiogenic-  Repeat echo on [**9-24**] did not show evidence of tamponade,
   just small effusion.  RV size and motion was wnl; can consider V/Q scan
   to r/o PE as cause of hypotension however, given the echo findings
   there is a lower pretest probability
   - On [**9-22**], SVV suggested intravascular depletion, and repleted pt with
   crystalloid and colloid.  She continues to require levophed, can
   consider midodrine v more albumin.  Will attempt to decrease levophed
   as tolerated.
   - goal CVP 12-14
   - new thing we started steroids yesterday, as well as IV albumin
   - would re-start vanco for gram + coverage as well
   - transfuse goals to keep Hct > 30
   #) Intubation for procedure
   -          not off sedation, on 5 and 5, RSBi on higher side but
   patient is large, probably at base line
   -          blood pressure stable
   -          plan to try to extubate today
   -          chest x-ray over 24 hours
   # Bilat pleural effusions, cytology from left c/w malignancy.  Left
   sided effusion improved s/p pigtail placement but CT on [**9-22**] showed
   increased right sided effusion.  Only requiring NC at this time.
   - pH on pleural fluid 6.9, chest tube in place
   - Pigtail cath draining well.  IP following pigtail
   - IP performed thoracentesis of right sided effusion on [**9-24**]
   - Pleurodesis vs pleurex when stable as per thoraric surgery, CT
   surgery also wants CT chest
   - Added standing bronchodilators for wheezing
   - f/u cytology for r-sided studies
   #. Acute renal failure
 Significant vol overload and anasarca.  CVVH
   started on [**9-16**] and stopped on [**9-20**] [**2-22**] poor access.  Line replaced by
   renal on [**9-23**] and restarted CVVH.
   - Repeat imaging of kidneys showed unchanged right hydronephrosis.
   - right ureteral procedure yesterday to open stricture.  Cutulre data
   pending.  Needs to be NPO after midnight. Patient is not candidate for
   percutaneous nephrostomy tube, due to anasarca; it will still need
   MAC.
   - Has been hyponatremic and hyperglycemia.  Unclear etiology but
   hyponatremia may be related to the ultrafiltrate bath having a Na
   concentration of 130.  Na corrected slightly following initiation of
   insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia.  Also, hyperglycemia seems to
   have occurred acutely.  No prior episodes of hyperglycemia during this
   admission.  Also, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, finger sticks are consistently lower than
   serum glucose.  Could be related to diffuse extravascular volume.
   Continue to monitor and use ISS as needed.
   - Replete phos today; can use Na-Phos for added sodium benefit
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   .
   # Metastatic ovarian cancer: at this time, not stable for treatment
   - Will require inpt palliative chemotherapy, most likely carboplatinum
   - When off pressors, can be transferred to OMED
   - Onc would prefer chest tube to be out prior to chemotherapy
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   - Updated gyn onc resident re pt
s current condition on [**9-25**].
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.  Preliminary
   thought is no, but increased dose to 100 mcg.  Need to re-check a free
   T4 in several days.
   - Anti-TPO ab < 10
   - Changed from oral to IV to ensure proper absorption
   - Monitor for a. fib
   - appreciate endocrine recs
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia, resolved: Most likely due to worsening renal function,
   esp in setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and
   ACE-I. Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Treated w/
   Ca gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment  and has remained
   wnl.

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia.  PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   #. Hypotension and shock.  Has required Levophed for much of
   admission.  Transiently able to be able to get off of pressors,
   intermittently requiring levofed.   Differential diagnsosis is likely
   mixed picture of  malignant fluid leak, thyroid leak, septic leak.
   - [**Name (NI) 1064**] pt has a leukocytosis but has been afebrile.  Started on
   empiric abx to cover for HAP.  D/c abx ([**9-25**]); pt received 6 days of
   zosyn, 9 days of cipro, and 4 days of vanc.  With concern for possible
   line infections: changed HD cath over the wire on [**9-23**] and art line was
   d/c
ed.  PICC line without signs of active infection.
   - Metabolic- [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim was wnl so likely not overt adrenal
   insufficiency, however random cortisol was on the lower side of normal
   especially in the context of what should be normal stress response. On
   [**9-26**] PM started IV steroids for concerns for relative adrenal
   insufficiency. Consulted endocrinology for evaluation of whether
   hypothyroidism could cause shock.  Increased dose of Synthroid and
   transitioned to IV but endocrinology that it is unlikely for
   hypothyroidism to be the cause. Endo also concerned because pt had one
   episode of paroxysmal a. fib on [**9-20**] and increased dose of synthroid
   may precipitate further episodes.  Will continue to monitor, however,
   this episodes appears to be isolated.
   - Cardiogenic-  Repeat echo on [**9-24**] did not show evidence of tamponade,
   just small effusion.  RV size and motion was wnl; can consider V/Q scan
   to r/o PE as cause of hypotension however, given the echo findings
   there is a lower pretest probability
   - On [**9-22**], SVV suggested intravascular depletion, and repleted pt with
   crystalloid and colloid.  She continues to require levophed, can
   consider midodrine v more albumin.  Will attempt to decrease levophed
   as tolerated.
   - goal CVP 12-14
   - new thing we started steroids yesterday, as well as IV albumin
   - would re-start vanco for gram + coverage as well
   - transfuse goals to keep Hct > 30
   #) Intubation for procedure
   -          not off sedation, on 5 and 5, RSBi on higher side but
   patient is large, probably at base line
   -          blood pressure stable
   -          plan to try to extubate today
   -          chest x-ray over 24 hours
   # Bilat pleural effusions, cytology from left c/w malignancy.  Left
   sided effusion improved s/p pigtail placement but CT on [**9-22**] showed
   increased right sided effusion.  Only requiring NC at this time.
   - pH on pleural fluid 6.9, chest tube in place
   - Pigtail cath draining well.  IP following pigtail
   - IP performed thoracentesis of right sided effusion on [**9-24**]
   - Pleurodesis vs pleurex when stable as per thoraric surgery, CT
   surgery also wants CT chest
   - Added standing bronchodilators for wheezing
   - f/u cytology for r-sided studies
   #. Acute renal failure
 Significant vol overload and anasarca.  CVVH
   started on [**9-16**] and stopped on [**9-20**] [**2-22**] poor access.  Line replaced by
   renal on [**9-23**] and restarted CVVH.
   - Repeat imaging of kidneys showed unchanged right hydronephrosis.
   - right ureteral procedure yesterday to open stricture with stent.
   Culture data pending.  Needs Patient is not candidate for percutaneous
   nephrostomy tube, due to anasarca
   - Has been hyponatremic and hyperglycemia.  Unclear etiology but
   hyponatremia may be related to the ultrafiltrate bath having a Na
   concentration of 130.  Na corrected slightly following initiation of
   insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia.  Also, hyperglycemia seems to
   have occurred acutely.  No prior episodes of hyperglycemia during this
   admission.  Also, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, finger sticks are consistently lower than
   serum glucose.  Could be related to diffuse extravascular volume.
   Continue to monitor and use ISS as needed.
   - Replete phos today; can use Na-Phos for added sodium benefit
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   # Metastatic ovarian cancer: at this time, not stable for treatment
   - consider inpatient palliative chemo
   - When off pressors, consider transfer to OMED
   - Onc would prefer chest tube to be out prior to chemotherapy
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   - Updated gyn onc resident re pt
s current condition on [**9-25**].
   .#. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.  Preliminary
   thought is no, but increased dose to 100 mcg.  Need to re-check a free
   T4 in several days.
   - Anti-TPO ab < 10
   - Changed from oral to IV to ensure proper absorption
   - Monitor for a. fib
   - follow up endocrine rec
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia, resolved: Most likely due to worsening renal function,
   esp in setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and
   ACE-I. Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Treated w/
   Ca gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment  and has remained
   wnl.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. The patient's medical history includes hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia. On admission, she presented with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. Since then, she has experienced hypotension and shock, requiring the use of pressors. The patient also has significant fluid overload and anasarca. She has been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and has had a right ureteral procedure to open a stricture with stenting. Her pleural effusions have been drained, and cytology showed malignancy. The patient is not a candidate for percutaneous nephrostomy due to anasarca. Her current medications include simvastatin, allopurinol, Synthroid, insulin sliding scale (ISS), famotidine, lorazepam, heparin sodium, and calcium gluconate. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension and shock: The patient's persistent hypotension and requirement for pressors indicate a potential ongoing issue with blood pressure regulation. This could be due to various factors, including sepsis, adrenal insufficiency, or fluid shifts related to cancer effusions.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by her elevated creatinine and"

   #. Hypotension and shock.  Patient is currently off pressors. Had an
   episode last night where she had hypotension and received albumin and 1
   unit of blood improving her symptoms. The etiology is multifactorial:
   hypothyroidism, plus cortisol insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, sepses,
   etc. However, there is normal echocardiogram
   -If hypotensive give her fluid bolus; albumin and/or bolus
   -Check BPs
   # Bilat pleural effusions, cytology from left c/w malignancy.  Left
   sided effusion improved s/p pigtail placement but CT on [**9-22**] showed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, hypotension, and anasarca. The patient had an episode of hypotension last night, which improved with albumin and blood transfusion. She is currently off pressors.

The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia. She also has bilateral pleural effusions, with cytology from the left effusion confirming malignancy. A chest tube was placed, and pigtail catheter drainage is ongoing. The patient's renal failure is significant due to volume overload and anasarca. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) was started on 9/16 and stopped on 9/20 due to poor access. The patient's renal function is being closely monitored, and she may tolerate hemodialysis tomorrow.

The patient is not currently stable for cancer treatment, and palliative chemotherapy is being considered. She will be transferred to the oncology department when she is stable enough to receive chemotherapy. Allopurinol has been prescribed to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension and shock: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension and received treatment with albumin and blood transfusion. Multifactorial causes such as hypothyroidism, cortisol insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, and seps"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia.  PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   #. Hypotension and shock.  Patient is currently off pressors. Had an
   episode last night where she had hypotension and received albumin and 1
   unit of blood improving her symptoms. The etiology is multifactorial:
   hypothyroidism, plus cortisol insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, sepses,
   etc. However, there is normal echocardiogram
   -If hypotensive give her fluid bolus; albumin and/or bolus
   -Check BPs
   # Bilat pleural effusions, cytology from left c/w malignancy.  Left
   sided effusion improved s/p pigtail placement but CT on [**9-22**] showed
   increased right sided effusion.  Only requiring NC at this time.
   - chest tube in place
   - Pigtail cath draining well.  IP following pigtail
   - Continue standing bronchodilators for wheezing
   #. Acute renal failure
 Significant vol overload and anasarca.  CVVH
   started on [**9-16**] and stopped on [**9-20**] [**2-22**] poor access.  Line replaced by
   renal on [**9-23**] and restarted CVVH. Patient doing better and may tolerate
   HD tomorrow. Stent placed 2 days ago and doing fine.
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   # Metastatic ovarian cancer: at this time, not stable for treatment
   - consider inpatient palliative chemo
   - When off pressors, consider transfer to OMED
   - Onc would prefer chest tube to be out prior to chemotherapy
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   - Updated gyn onc resident re pt
s current condition on [**9-25**].
   .#. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   -  Anti-TPO ab < 10
   - Changed from oral to IV to ensure proper absorption
   - Monitor for a. fib
   - follow up endocrine rec

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. She was initially on pressors but is now off them. The patient has undergone ureteral stenting and is a candidate for palliative chemotherapy.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension and shock, bilateral pleural effusions with cytology confirming malignancy, acute renal failure with significant volume overload and anasarca. She has been treated with CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and has had a stent placed. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension and shock: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension and received albumin and blood transfusion to improve her symptoms. The etiology is multifactorial, including hypothyroidism, cortisol insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, sepsis, etc. If hypotensive, the patient should be given fluid bolus; albumin and/or bolus, and her blood pressures should be monitored.

2. Bilateral pleural effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, with cytology from the left side confirming malignancy. The left-sided effusion improved after pigtail catheter placement, but the right-sided effusion remains increased. The patient is currently on NC (nasal cannula)"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia.  PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   #. Hypotension and shock.  Has required Levophed for much of
   admission.  Transiently able to be able to get off of pressors,
   intermittently requiring levofed.   Differential diagnsosis is likely
   mixed picture of  malignant fluid leak, thyroid leak, septic leak.
   - [**Name (NI) 1064**] pt has a leukocytosis but has been afebrile.  Started on
   empiric abx to cover for HAP.  D/c abx ([**9-25**]); pt received 6 days of
   zosyn, 9 days of cipro, and 4 days of vanc.  With concern for possible
   line infections: changed HD cath over the wire on [**9-23**] and art line was
   d/c
ed.  PICC line without signs of active infection.
   - Metabolic- [**Last Name (un) 402**] stim was wnl so likely not overt adrenal
   insufficiency, however random cortisol was on the lower side of normal
   especially in the context of what should be normal stress response. On
   [**9-26**] PM started IV steroids for concerns for relative adrenal
   insufficiency. Consulted endocrinology for evaluation of whether
   hypothyroidism could cause shock.  Increased dose of Synthroid and
   transitioned to IV but endocrinology that it is unlikely for
   hypothyroidism to be the cause. Endo also concerned because pt had one
   episode of paroxysmal a. fib on [**9-20**] and increased dose of synthroid
   may precipitate further episodes.  Will continue to monitor, however,
   this episodes appears to be isolated.
   - Cardiogenic-  Repeat echo on [**9-24**] did not show evidence of tamponade,
   just small effusion.  RV size and motion was wnl; can consider V/Q scan
   to r/o PE as cause of hypotension however, given the echo findings
   there is a lower pretest probability
   - On [**9-22**], SVV suggested intravascular depletion, and repleted pt with
   crystalloid and colloid.  She continues to require levophed, can
   consider midodrine v more albumin.  Will attempt to decrease levophed
   as tolerated.
   - goal CVP 12-14
   - new thing we started steroids yesterday, as well as IV albumin
   - would re-start vanco for gram + coverage as well
   - transfuse goals to keep Hct > 30
   #) Intubation for procedure
   -          not off sedation, on 5 and 5, RSBi on higher side but
   patient is large, probably at base line
   -          blood pressure stable
   -          plan to try to extubate today
   -          chest x-ray over 24 hours
   # Bilat pleural effusions, cytology from left c/w malignancy.  Left
   sided effusion improved s/p pigtail placement but CT on [**9-22**] showed
   increased right sided effusion.  Only requiring NC at this time.
   - pH on pleural fluid 6.9, chest tube in place
   - Pigtail cath draining well.  IP following pigtail
   - IP performed thoracentesis of right sided effusion on [**9-24**]
   - Pleurodesis vs pleurex when stable as per thoraric surgery, CT
   surgery also wants CT chest
   - Added standing bronchodilators for wheezing
   - f/u cytology for r-sided studies
   #. Acute renal failure
 Significant vol overload and anasarca.  CVVH
   started on [**9-16**] and stopped on [**9-20**] [**2-22**] poor access.  Line replaced by
   renal on [**9-23**] and restarted CVVH.
   - Repeat imaging of kidneys showed unchanged right hydronephrosis.
   - right ureteral procedure yesterday to open stricture with stent.
   Culture data pending.  Needs Patient is not candidate for percutaneous
   nephrostomy tube, due to anasarca
   - Has been hyponatremic and hyperglycemia.  Unclear etiology but
   hyponatremia may be related to the ultrafiltrate bath having a Na
   concentration of 130.  Na corrected slightly following initiation of
   insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia.  Also, hyperglycemia seems to
   have occurred acutely.  No prior episodes of hyperglycemia during this
   admission.  Also, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, finger sticks are consistently lower than
   serum glucose.  Could be related to diffuse extravascular volume.
   Continue to monitor and use ISS as needed.
   - Replete phos today; can use Na-Phos for added sodium benefit
   - holding home Lasix and ACE-I in ARF
   # Metastatic ovarian cancer: at this time, not stable for treatment
   - consider inpatient palliative chemo
   - When off pressors, consider transfer to OMED
   - Onc would prefer chest tube to be out prior to chemotherapy
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   - Updated gyn onc resident re pt
s current condition on [**9-25**].
   .#. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.  Preliminary
   thought is no, but increased dose to 100 mcg.  Need to re-check a free
   T4 in several days.
   - Anti-TPO ab < 10
   - Changed from oral to IV to ensure proper absorption
   - Monitor for a. fib
   - follow up endocrine rec
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia, resolved: Most likely due to worsening renal function,
   esp in setting of the medications she was taking, including Lasix and
   ACE-I. Pt had K 7.8 on arrival to ED, without ECG changes. Treated w/
   Ca gluconate, insulin / dextrose, albuterol nebs, and Kayexelate.
   Potassium has appropriately responded to treatment  and has remained
   wnl.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure, hypotension, and anasarca. She was transferred to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. The patient has been on pressors for most of her admission and has required intermittent use of levofed. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 113/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is still intubated but the plan is to extubate her today. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension and shock: The patient has been hypotensive and required pressors for most of her admission. There is a differential diagnosis of mixed pictures of malignant fluid leak, thyroid leak, and septic leak.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, with cytology from the left effusion c/w malignancy. The right-sided effusion has increased despite pigtail catheter placement. Pleurodesis or pleurex may be considered when stable.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has significant volume overload and anasarca. She underwent continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltr"

   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia.  PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   #. Hypotension and shock.  Patient is currently off pressors. Had an
   episode last night where she had hypotension and received albumin and 1
   unit of blood improving her symptoms. The etiology is multifactorial:
   hypothyroidism, plus cortisol insufficiency, cardiogenic shock, sepses,
   etc. However, there is normal echocardiogram
   -If hypotensive give her fluid bolus; albumin and/or bolus
   -Check BPs
   # Bilat pleural effusions, cytology from left c/w malignancy.  Left
   sided effusion improved s/p pigtail placement but CT on [**9-22**] showed
   increased right sided effusion.  Only requiring NC at this time.
   - chest tube in place
   - Pigtail cath draining well.  IP following pigtail
   - Continue standing bronchodilators for wheezing
   #. Acute renal failure
 Significant vol overload and anasarca.  CVVH
   started on [**9-16**] and stopped on [**9-20**] [**2-22**] poor access.  Line replaced by
   renal on [**9-23**] and restarted CVVH. Patient doing better and may tolerate

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. The patient initially presented with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. Her past medical history includes hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is still improving slowly since the stent placement. However, her urine output has not yet recovered. It is important to monitor her fluid balance and continue with CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) if necessary.
2. Pleural effusions: The patient has high-output pleural effusion (approximately 200cc/day) through the left chest tube. Since the etiology is malignant, it may not resolve promptly. Consultation with interventional pulmonology and cardiothoracic surgery will be required.
3. Aspiration: The patient had an episode of aspiration on Saturday and is currently NPO (nothing by mouth). Speech and swallow evaluation is planned for today.
4. Hypotension and shock: The patient was previously on pressors but has been off them since the stent placement. She has been tolerating CVVH without any problems. Hypotension and shock have resolved, but close monitoring is needed.
5. Metastatic ovarian cancer: The patient's condition is not stable enough for treatment at the moment."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8Â°C (96.4Â°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 113/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula.

The patient has received multiple infusions, including levothyroxine switched from IV to PO, famotidine (Pepcid), and various other medications. The patient has a history of allergies to oxycodone and experiences nausea/vomiting. The patient's allergies, medical history, and family history remain unchanged.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a weight of 109.2 kg, central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg, and fluid balance with total in and out amounts. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and the arterial blood gas (ABG) results are within normal limits.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, neurologic assessment, and other assessments not conducted due to the patient's unstable condition. Laboratory results indicate abnormal values for white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), blood glucose levels, and several other lab parameters.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old obese male with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to sepsis. His current condition is stable, with normotensive blood pressure and no new problems overnight. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated on assist-control mode with a low tidal volume strategy. The patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 97% using a nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions, hypotension, and renal failure. His recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's renal function has not improved since the initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and there is ongoing fluid overload with a positive fluid balance of 217 mL. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.42, indicating normal acid-base balance. However, his partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) is 38 mmHg, which is on the higher end of the normal range, suggesting hypoventilation. His bicarbonate (HCO3-) level is 24 mEq/L, which is within the normal range.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, famotidine, and other ICU medications. He has a central venous pressure (C"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note. The HPI section mentions that the attending physician was physically present with the ICU Resident for key portions of the services provided and agrees with their note, including the assessment and plan.

Under 24-hour events, blood cultures were obtained at 11:50 AM and 12:15 PM. The patient has allergies to oxycodone, which causes nausea/vomiting. The last dose of antibiotics was administered.

In terms of infusions, potassium chloride (KCl) at a rate of 2 mEq./hour and calcium gluconate at 1.4 grams/hour are being given via CRRT. Other ICU medications include famotidine (Pepcid), which was given at 03:45 PM. The patient's medication list is reviewed, as seen in [**Month (only)**].

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the below. Flow sheet data as of 10:44 AM on [**2138-9-29**] shows vital signs with a maximum temperature (Tmax) of 36.3 C (97.4 F) and current temperature (Tcurrent) of 35.7 C (96.3 F).

   - restarted her for marginal pressures on albumin 25 mg IV and also 50
   IV q 6 of hydrocortisone
   - put patient in for EKG in AM for persistent tachycardia
   - overnight consulted cardiology as patient was persistently
   tachycardic to 130-150s, cardiology felt that this most likely looked
   like NSVT, patient lytes were repleted aggressively, started on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a chief complaint of metastatic cancer leading to acute renal failure. The patient underwent ureteral stent placement and has been on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for most of the day yesterday. Today, the patient started receiving hemodialysis (HD) instead of CVVH. Concerns were raised about potential hypotension due to fluid removal, and the patient's blood pressure remained around 100 today. The patient received HD overnight and had 800 cc of fluid removed. The goal was to consider calling out today pending okay blood pressure post dialysis. The patient is not a good candidate for pleuradesis at this time. Speech and swallow recommendations include a regular diet with thin liquids. Initially, the patient was off pressors, but after dialysis, they had to restart Levofed to maintain pressures. The patient received albumin 25 mg IV and 50 mg IV q6h of hydrocortisone. An EKG was performed in the morning due to persistent tachycardia. Cardiology consulted and felt that the most likely diagnosis was nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT).

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia.  PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Renal failure: seems Urine output has not improved significantly
   since stent placement. Cr normal. Patient with episode of hypotension
   that seems to limit ability to do HD. Also seems to have tenous volume
   status.
   - d/c CVVH
   - will try HD only as tolerated
   - IV albumin to help maintain oncotic pressure
   #Pleural effusions: Patient still with high output through left tube.
   Since etiology is malignang may not resolved promptly.
   - likely not candidate for pleuradesis
   - effusions may be contributing to underlying heart physiology
   # Aspiration: on regular diet with thin liquids.
   #. Hypotension and shock.
   - patient had been off and on pressorts, now needing pressors again s/p
   dialysis yesterday afternoon, pressures look good this morning so will
   attemp to wean off
   - cont IV albumin
   - cont IV steroids for relative adrenal insufficiency
   - difficult fluid status
   # Metastatic ovarian cancer: at this time, not stable for treatment
   - consider inpatient palliative chemo
   - When off pressors and on HD, consider transfer to OMED
   - Onc would prefer chest tube to be out prior to chemotherapy
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   - Updated gyn onc resident re pt
s current condition on [**9-25**].
   .#. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - Monitor for a. fib, on thyroid replacement
   - steroids as above
   .#. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. The patient presented initially with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. Her medical history includes hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's urine output has not improved significantly since the ureteral stent placement, and her creatinine levels are within normal range. She experienced an episode of hypotension that limited her ability to undergo hemodialysis (HD). Her fluid status is also a concern.
2. Pleural effusions: The patient continues to have high-output pleural effusions, likely due to malignancy. She may not be a candidate for pleuradesis, and the effusions may contribute to her underlying heart physiology.
3. Aspiration: The patient has been advised to follow a regular diet with thin liquids, indicating a risk of aspiration.
4. Hypotension and shock: The patient has required pressors intermittently, including after dialysis yesterday. She currently needs IV albumin and steroids for relative adrenal insufficiency. Her fluid status is difficult to manage.
5. Metastatic ovarian cancer: The patient is currently unstable for treatment, including inpatient palliative chemotherapy. Oncology prefers the removal of the chest tube prior to chemotherapy. Allopurinol has been initiated to prevent tumor l"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia.  PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Renal failure: seems Urine output has not improved significantly
   since stent placement. Cr normal. Patient with episode of hypotension
   that seems to limit ability to do HD. Also seems to have tenous volume
   status.
   - d/c CVVH
   - will try HD only as tolerated
   - IV albumin to help maintain oncotic pressure
   #Pleural effusions: Patient still with high output through left tube.
   Since etiology is malignang may not resolved promptly.
   - likely not candidate for pleuradesis
   - effusions may be contributing to underlying heart physiology
   # Aspiration: on regular diet with thin liquids.
   #. Hypotension and shock.
   - patient had been off and on pressorts, now needing pressors again s/p
   dialysis yesterday afternoon
   - cont IV albumin
   - cont IV steroids for relative adrenal insufficiency
   - difficult fluid status
   # Metastatic ovarian cancer: at this time, not stable for treatment
   - consider inpatient palliative chemo
   - When off pressors and on HD, consider transfer to OMED
   - Onc would prefer chest tube to be out prior to chemotherapy
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   - Updated gyn onc resident re pt
s current condition on [**9-25**].
   .#. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - Monitor for a. fib, on thyroid replacement
   - steroids as above
   .#. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer who was admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. She has a history of acute renal failure, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has been on pressors due to hypotension and required dialysis. She is also experiencing high-output pleural effusions and has been on a regular diet with thin liquids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's urine output has not improved significantly since the ureteral stent placement, indicating ongoing renal failure.
2. Hypotension and Shock: The patient has been on and off pressors, suggesting difficulty in maintaining stable blood pressure. She also experienced hypotension after dialysis.
3. Pleural Effusions: The patient continues to have high-output pleural effusions, which may contribute to underlying heart physiology.
4. Aspiration: The patient has been advised to be on a regular diet with thin liquids, putting her at risk for aspiration.
5. Metastatic Ovarian Cancer: The patient's condition is not stable enough for treatment, including inpatient palliative chemotherapy.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's persistent hypotension may be related to hypothyroidism, and thyroid replacement therapy has been initiated.

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia.  PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Renal failure: seems Urine output has not improved significantly
   since stent placement. Cr normal. Patient with episode of hypotension
   that seems to limit ability to do HD. Also seems to have tenous volume
   status.
   - CVVH stopped yesterday, first trial of HD yesterday with drop in
   blood pressure
   - will give patient one day off of HD , consider HD again tomorrow
   - would consider transfer out of the unit pending HD tomorrow
   - consider albumin for hypotension
   - s/p stent to ureter to relieve obstruction which did not result in
   increased urinary flow
   - urine cx sent intraoperative only growing yeast, urine apparently was
   cloudy, however no evidence of frank pus or abscess
   # Tachycardia
   -          took multiple EKGs last night during episode of tachycardia
   to 130-140s. Initial arrythmia looked sinus vs. atrial tachycardia
   which appeared to transition to NSVT
   -          faxed EKGs to cardiology fellow overnight, thought was
   consistent with NSVT, started patient on amiodarone IV with excellent
   reponse
   -          also rebolused patient with 2x 250 cc fluid for hypotension
   and tachycardia
   #Pleural effusions: Patient still with high output through left tube.
   Since etiology is malignancy may not resolved promptly.
   - likely not candidate for pleuradesis
   - effusions may be contributing to underlying heart physiology
   # Aspiration: on regular diet with thin liquids seen by speech and
   swallow yesterday
   #. Hypotension and shock.
   - infectious work-up has been negative thus far, blood cultures no
   growth to date, pleural fluid with negative culture, urine cx grew only
   yeast
   - will re-send UA and Uculture
   - patient had been off and on pressors, overnight required again, now
   again weaned off
   With continued hypotension yesterday got IV albumin and also IV
   steroids has has been steroid responsive  previously, again patient
   with good response
   -          will continue steroids at current dose for now
   -          consider steroid taper starting tomorrow
   -          elevated white blood cell count in the setting of IV
   steroids as per above do not suspect new infection
   # Metastatic ovarian cancer: at this time, not stable for treatment
   - consider inpatient palliative chemo
   - When off pressors and on HD, consider transfer to OMED
   - Onc would prefer chest tube to be out prior to chemotherapy
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   - Updated gyn onc resident re pt
s current condition on [**9-25**].
   .#. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - Monitor for a. fib, on thyroid replacement
   - steroids as above
   .#. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She has been admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. The patient originally presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. Her medical history includes hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's current assessment and plan include several medical complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's urine output has not improved significantly since the ureteral stent placement. Her creatinine levels are normal, but she experienced an episode of hypotension during the first trial of hemodialysis (HD) that limited its ability to proceed. It is planned to give the patient one day off of HD and consider it again tomorrow. The patient may be considered for transfer out of the unit pending HD tomorrow.

2. Tachycardia: The patient had episodes of tachycardia ranging from 130-140 beats per minute. Initial arrhythmia looked like sinus tachycardia, which appeared to transition to non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). The patient was started on amiodarone IV, which showed an excellent response. The patient also received fluid boluses for hypotension and tachycardia.

3. Pleural effusions: The patient still has high output through the left tube. Since the etiology is malignancy,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The note indicates that the patient has been receiving treatment for hypotension, tachyarrhythmia, renal failure, and other ICU care. The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate but a slightly elevated respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation is within normal range. The patient's weight has increased since admission.

The patient's fluid balance shows an overall negative balance, indicating a potential fluid deficit. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates normal central venous pressure (CVP). The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly decreased hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count within normal range. Renal function tests reveal acute kidney injury (AKI) with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal limits, but there are abnormalities in electrolytes such as low potassium and magnesium levels.

The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating, with some readings being high and others within normal range. Other lab values including cardiac enzymes, liver enzymes, and metabolic markers are within normal limits or show no significant abnormalities.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, and potential infections due to prolonged ICU stay. Close monitoring of fluid balance, renal function, and electrolyte levels is essential. Additionally, the patient's response to steroid treatment for"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia.  PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Renal failure: seems Urine output has not improved significantly
   since stent placement. Cr normal. Patient with episode of hypotension
   that seems to limit ability to do HD. Also seems to have tenous volume
   status.
   - CVVH stopped had first trial of HD with drop in blood pressure, plan
   for HD today 1 hour after initiation of chemotherapy at noon
   - consider IV albumin for hypotension as patient with low oncotic
   pressure
   - s/p stent to ureter to relieve obstruction which did not result in
   increased urinary output
   - urine cx sent intraoperative only growing yeast, urine apparently was
   cloudy, however no evidence of frank pus or abscess, not currently on
   any antibiotics - ordered repeat UA and uculture yesterday, not yet
   sent, will follow-up with results
   # Likely Metastatic ovarian cancer
   - will start chemo today with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66.
   first dose today, consider second dose in 21 days
   - premedication with anti-emeteics including ondansetron, dexamethasone
   today and for 3 days following chemo, dexamethasone OK even in addition
   to IV hydrocortisone as per oncology
   - seen by onc yesterday, feel that renal failure and hypotension are
   all related to fluid shifts secondary to malignancy and that the only
   way that she will be able to come off of pressors and HD is to treat
   the cancer
   - still with chest tube in (malignant effusion)
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   - onc to write orders for chemo today, written for zofran for nausea as
   well as dexamethasone pretreatment for chemotherapy
   # Tachycardia
   -  took multiple EKGs during episode of tachycardia to 130-140s (two
   nights ago). Initial arrythmia looked sinus vs. atrial tachycardia
   which appeared to transition to NSVT, faxed EKGs to cardiology fellow
   overnight, thought was consistent with NSVT, started patient on
   amiodarone IV with adequate reponse, -  during this episode rebolused
   patient with 2x 250 cc fluid for hypotension and tachycardia
   - patient was on IV amiodarone, has not been started on PO amiodarone,
   may hold off for now, and see how patient does (NSVT may have been
   secondary to dialysis in particular rapid electrolyte shifts and fluid
   loss)
   - hold off on cards consults b/c suspect that mostly due to rapid fluid
   shifts, definitely was admiodarone responsive
   - would consider official consult if patient goes back into this rhythm
   again
   #Pleural effusions: Patient still with  output through left tube. Since
   etiology is malignancy may not resolve promptly.
   - likely not candidate for pleuradesis at this time, can follow up with
   thoracics at a later date regarding plan for tube
   - effusions may be contributing to underlying heart physiology
    #. Hypotension and shock.
   - infectious work-up has been negative thus far, blood cultures no
   growth to date, pleural fluid with negative culture, urine cx grew only
   yeast
   - sent repeat UA and culture -
   - patient had been off and on pressors, overnight required again, now
   again weaned off
   With continued hypotension two days ago, got IV albumin and also IV
   steroids has has been steroid responsive  previously, again patient
   with good response
   - given that patient to start chemo today , will not taper steroids
   right away, will begin taper tomorrow (tomorrow go to 25 mg IV q
   6hours)
   - elevated white blood cell count in the setting of IV steroids as per
   above do not suspect new infection
    #. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - Monitor for a. fib, on thyroid replacement
   - steroids as above
    #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   # Aspiration: on regular diet with thin liquids seen by speech and
   swallow

   since stent placement. Cr normal. Patient with episode of hypotension
   that seems to limit ability to do HD. Also seems to have tenous volume
   status.
   - CVVH stopped had first trial of HD with drop in blood pressure, plan
   for HD today, ? following chemo
   - consider IV albumin for hypotension as patient with low oncotic
   pressure
   - s/p stent to ureter to relieve obstruction which did not result in
   increased urinary output
   - urine cx sent intraoperative only growing yeast, urine apparently was
   cloudy, however no evidence of frank pus or abscess, not currently on
   any antibiotics - sent repeat UA and uculture yesterday, will follow-up
   with results
   # Tachycardia
   -          took multiple EKGs during episode of tachycardia to 130-140s
   (two nights ago). Initial arrythmia looked sinus vs. atrial tachycardia
   which appeared to transition to NSVT, faxed EKGs to cardiology fellow
   overnight, thought was consistent with NSVT, started patient on
   amiodarone IV with adequate reponse
   - patient was on IV amiodarone, has not been started on PO amiodarone,
   may hold off for now, and see how patient does (NSVT may have been
   secondary to dialysis in particular rapid electrolyte shifts and fluid
   loss)
   -  during this episode rebolused patient with 2x 250 cc fluid for
   hypotension and tachycardia
   #Pleural effusions: Patient still with  output through left tube. Since
   etiology is malignancy may not resolve promptly.
   - likely not candidate for pleuradesis at this time, can follow up with
   thoracics at a later date regarding plan for tube
   - effusions may be contributing to underlying heart physiology
    #. Hypotension and shock.
   - infectious work-up has been negative thus far, blood cultures no
   growth to date, pleural fluid with negative culture, urine cx grew only
   yeast
   - sent repeat UA and culture -
   - patient had been off and on pressors, overnight required again, now
   again weaned off
   With continued hypotension two days ago, got IV albumin and also IV
   steroids has has been steroid responsive  previously, again patient
   with good response
   - start steroid taper todoay
   - elevated white blood cell count in the setting of IV steroids as per
   above do not suspect new infection
   # Metastatic ovarian cancer: at this time, today plan is start chemo
   - seen by onc yesterday, plan is to go ahead with chemotherapy, now
   that off pressors and on HD rather than CVVH
   - still with chest tube in (malignant effusion)
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   - onc to write orders for chemo today, written for zofran for nausea as
   well as dexamethasone pretreatment for chemotherapy
   .#. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. The patient has a medical history of hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. 

The patient's current condition includes renal failure, tachycardia, pleural effusions, hypotension, and shock. She underwent CVVH and is now on hemodialysis (HD). The patient's urine output has not improved significantly since the ureteral stent placement, and her creatinine levels are within normal range. She experienced an episode of hypotension that limited the ability to perform HD, and she also has tense volume status.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and normal creatinine levels. Electrolyte imbalances include low sodium, potassium, and chloride levels. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Renal failure: The patient's urine output has not improved significantly since the ureteral stent placement. Her creatinine levels are within normal range. It is important to continue monitoring her renal function and adjusting the treatment accordingly.
2. Tachycardia: The patient experienced episodes of tachycardia with heart rates reaching up to 130"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with presumptive metastatic ovarian cancer and persistent hypotension of unclear etiology. She has been treated with various medications, including Carbiplatin, hydrocortisone, anti-emetics, allopurinol, fluconazole, and Levoxyl. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 113/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. Her CVP is -8 mmHg, and she has 2+ edema bilaterally. The patient's laboratory results show normal WBC count, Hct, and Plt, but elevated Cr, TCO2, glucose, and LDH levels. Imaging and microbiology reports are unremarkable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metastatic ovarian cancer: The patient's cancer may progress and cause further complications, such as pain, organ dysfunction, and systemic effects.
2. Persistent hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ hypoxia. This may result in organ damage or failure if not properly managed.
3. Steroid-responsive component: The patient's hypotension appears to have a steroid-responsive component, which could indicate adrenal insufficiency or another underlying condition requiring ongoing monitoring and management.

","The patient is a 74-year-old woman with presumptive metastatic ovarian cancer and persistent hypotension of unclear etiology. She is currently being treated with chemotherapy and hemodialysis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 113/78 mmHg, heart rate of 101 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. Her current medications include famotidine, heparin subQ TID, Zocor 20, and hydrocortisone 50mg IV q6.

The patient has a history of allergies to oxycodone, nausea/vomiting, and previous antibiotic use. She also has a history of ovarian cancer, for which she is currently undergoing treatment with carboplatin.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for decreased bowel sounds on the right side. Physical examination reveals pale conjunctiva, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds with crackles bibasilar, and no wheezes. The patient's neurologic examination is not assessed due to sedation.

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 14.8, Hct of 29.1, platelet count of 263 K/uL, BUN of 16 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.0, sodium of 105 mEq/L, potassium of 4.6 mEq/L, chloride of 27.9%, glucose of 118 mg/dL, and magnesium of 2.1 mg/dL. Imaging and microbiology results are unremarkable.

The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for metastatic cancer with carboplatin today followed by hemodialysis. Anti-emetics and allopurinol will be given per protocol. The patient's persistent hypotension will continue to be managed with hydrocortisone 50mg IV q6hr, and the dose will be decreased to 25mg IV q6 if tolerated. If the patient needs pressors for hemodialysis today, they will follow accordingly. Other impressions include no evidence of systemic infection, yeast in recent urinalysis, and no recurrent episodes of NSVT or tachyarrhythmias.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may continue to be a concern, and the cause remains unclear. Steroid-responsive component is being treated with hydrocortisone, but further evaluation and management may be necessary.
2. Infection: The presence of yeast in the recent urinalysis could indicate a urinary tract infection. Repeating the urinalysis and considering treatment with fluconazole if persistent yeasturia is present.
3. Renal function: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, especially during hemodialysis. Renal assistance and appropriate fluid management are necessary.
4. Cardiovascular issues: Although the patient has had no recurrent episodes"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
    # Renal failure: seems Urine output has not improved significantly
   since stent placement. Cr normal. Patient with episode of hypotension
   that seems to limit ability to do HD. Also seems to have tenous volume
   status.
    - CVVH stopped had first trial of HD with drop in blood pressure, plan
   for HD today 1 hour after initiation of chemotherapy at noon
   - consider IV albumin for hypotension as patient with low oncotic
   pressure
   - s/p stent to ureter to relieve obstruction which did not result in
   increased urinary output
   - urine cx sent intraoperative only growing yeast, urine apparently was
   cloudy, however no evidence of frank pus or abscess, not currently on
   any antibiotics - ordered repeat UA and uculture yesterday, not yet
   sent, will follow-up with results
   # Likely Metastatic ovarian cancer
   - started chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of
   1.66. consider second dose 21 days after the first
   - premedication with anti-emeteics including ondansetron, dexamethasone
   on day 1 and 3 days following chemotherapy, dexamethasone OK even in
   addition to IV hydrocortisone as per oncology
   - oncology feels that renal failure and hypotension all related to
   fluid shifts secondary to malignancy and that the only way that she
   will be able to come off of pressors and HD is to treat the cancer
   - still with chest tube in (malignant effusion)
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   # Tachycardia
   -  took multiple EKGs during episode of tachycardia to 130-140s (two
   nights ago). Initial arrythmia looked sinus vs. atrial tachycardia
   which appeared to transition to NSVT, faxed EKGs to cardiology fellow
   overnight, thought was consistent with NSVT, started patient on
   amiodarone IV with adequate reponse, -  during this episode rebolused
   patient with 2x 250 cc fluid for hypotension and tachycardia
   - patient was on IV amiodarone, has not been started on PO amiodarone,
   may hold off for now, and see how patient does (NSVT may have been
   secondary to dialysis in particular rapid electrolyte shifts and fluid
   loss)
   - hold off on cards consults b/c suspect that mostly due to rapid fluid
   shifts, definitely was admiodarone responsive
   - would consider official consult if patient goes back into this rhythm
   again
   # Anemia
   - patient is anemic, ordered anemia work-up labs - iron 27 (low), TIBC
   173 (low), ferritin 222 (high), TRF 133 (low), b12 normal, folate
   normal
   - low iron, low TIBC and elevated ferritin consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease
   #Pleural effusions: Patient still with  output through left tube. Since
   etiology is malignancy may not resolve promptly.
   - likely not candidate for pleuradesis at this time, can follow up with
   thoracics at a later date regarding plan for tube
   - effusions may be contributing to underlying heart physiology
     #. Hypotension and shock.
   - infectious work-up has been negative thus far, blood cultures no
   growth to date, pleural fluid with negative culture, urine cx grew only
   yeast
   - sent repeat UA and culture - repeat UA from [**10-1**] cloudy, large LE,
   large blood, 300 protein, trace ketones, 300 RBCs, 29 WBCs, many
   bacteria, many yeast urine culture pending
   - patient had been off and on pressors now off > 48 hours
   - With continued hypotension two days ago, got IV albumin and also IV
   steroids has has been steroid responsive  previously, again patient
   with good response
   - given that patient to start chemo today , will not taper steroids
   right away, will begin taper tomorrow (tomorrow go to 25 mg IV q
   6hours)
   - elevated white blood cell count in the setting of IV steroids which
   is decreasing as per above do not suspect new infection
    #. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - Monitor for a. fib, on thyroid replacement
   - steroids as above
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   # Aspiration: on regular diet with thin liquids seen by speech and
   swallow
    Dispo: consider floor transfer today

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She has been admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and palliative chemotherapy. The patient's medical history includes hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia, which have since improved. The patient underwent ureteral stent placement and received her first dose of chemotherapy yesterday.

24-hour events:
- The patient received chemotherapy yesterday and then started hemodialysis (HD) one hour after.
- She is currently off amiodarone.
- The oncology team attempted to order carboplatin levels but found that it is not a lab test available here.
- A urinalysis was collected, and the urine culture is pending.
- The dose of dexamethasone was decreased to 4 mg for days 2 and 3 of chemotherapy. The patient tolerated HD yesterday without a significant drop in pressures.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Renal failure: The patient's urine output has not improved significantly since the stent placement. Creatinine levels are normal. The patient experienced an episode of hypotension that limited her ability to undergo HD. She also appears to have tense volume status.
   - CVVH was stopped due to the hypotension during the first trial of HD. A second attempt at HD was planned for today, one hour after the initiation of chemotherapy at noon.

   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
    # Renal failure: seems Urine output has not improved significantly
   since stent placement. Cr normal. Patient with episode of hypotension
   that seems to limit ability to do HD. Also seems to have tenous volume
   status.
    - CVVH stopped had first trial of HD with drop in blood pressure, got
   HD yesterday without large swings in her blood pressure, plan is to
   likely get HD today
   - s/p stent to ureter to relieve obstruction which did not result in
   increased urinary output
   - urine cx sent intraoperative only growing [**Month/Day (2) 1564**], urine apparently was
   cloudy, however no evidence of frank pus or abscess, not currently on
   any antibiotics - ordered repeat culture yesterday
   - given two positive urines with [**Last Name (LF) 1564**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] go ahead at this time and
   treat at this time with fluconazole for 7 day course
   # Likely Metastatic ovarian cancer
   - started chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of
   1.66. consider second dose 21 days after the first
   - premedication with anti-emeteics including ondansetron, dexamethasone
   on day 1 and 3 days following chemotherapy, dexamethasone OK even in
   addition to IV hydrocortisone as per oncology
   - oncology feels that renal failure and hypotension all related to
   fluid shifts secondary to malignancy and that the only way that she
   will be able to come off of pressors and HD is to treat the cancer
   - still with chest tube in (malignant effusion) with decent output
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   # Tachycardia
   - patient again tachycardic this morning possible etiologies include
   sinus tachycardia secondary to volume loss from HD, or new infection
   - will check a chest x-ray, start on fluconazole for [**Month/Year (2) 1564**] in the urine
   x 7 days
   - continue to follow
   -  previous episode of tachycardia s/p first HD - took multiple EKGs
   during episode of tachycardia to 130-140s (two nights ago). Initial
   arrythmia looked sinus vs. atrial tachycardia which appeared to
   transition to NSVT, faxed EKGs to cardiology fellow, thought was
   consistent with NSVT, started patient on amiodarone IV with adequate
   reponse, -  during this episode rebolused patient with 2x 250 cc fluid
   for hypotension and tachycardia
   - patient was on IV amiodarone, has not been started on PO amiodarone,
   will hold off for now, and see how patient does (NSVT may have been
   secondary to dialysis in particular rapid electrolyte shifts and fluid
   loss)
   - hold off on cards consults b/c suspect that mostly due to rapid fluid
   shifts, definitely was admiodarone responsive\
   # Anemia
   - patient is anemic, ordered anemia work-up labs - iron 27 (low), TIBC
   173 (low), ferritin 222 (high), TRF 133 (low), b12 normal, folate
   normal
   - low iron, low TIBC and elevated ferritin consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease
   #Pleural effusions: Patient still with  significant output through left
   tube. Since etiology is malignancy may not resolve promptly.
   - likely not candidate for pleuradesis at this time, can follow up with
   thoracics at a later date regarding plan for tube
   - wiill need to address plans for chest tube on discharge
   - effusions may be contributing to underlying heart physiology
     #. Hypotension and shock.
   - infectious work-up has been negative thus far, blood cultures no
   growth to date, pleural fluid with negative culture, urine cx grew only
   [**Month/Year (2) 1564**], given lack of other source  will start treatment [**10-2**]
   - sent repeat UA and culture - repeat UA from [**10-1**] cloudy, large LE,
   large blood, 300 protein, trace ketones, 300 RBCs, 29 WBCs, many
   bacteria, many [**Month/Year (2) 1564**] urine culture pending
   - patient currently off pressors with good blood pressure, still on IV
   steroids
   - previously  got IV albumin and also IV steroids for hypotension with
   good response
   - will start steroid taper today  (tomorrow go to 25 mg IV q 6hours)
    #. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - Monitor for a. fib, on thyroid replacement
   - steroids as above

She has a cough and chest tube output of 50-75 cc over 12 hours. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.3Â°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 113/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is 105.4 kg, and her height is 58 inches. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is -8 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 334 mL and output of 1,760 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,426 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes an oxygen delivery device and a nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 97%. ABG results show pH of 7.29, PaCO2 of 32 mmHg, and HCO3- of 25 mEq/L. The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds on the right side and diminished breath sounds on the left side. Her abdomen is soft"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Tachycardia
   - patient continues to have episodes of tachycardia overnight, despite
   not having any fluid taken off yesterday (no HD). This could be sinus
   tachycardia secondary to 3^rd spacing, causing patient to be IV dry
   (although not hypotensive), new infection (?PNA on CXR or yeast in
   urine), or paraneoplastic event given her malignancy.
   -started on fluconazole for yeast infection (day 2 today)
   -  previous episode of tachycardia s/p first HD - took multiple EKGs
   during episode of tachycardia to 130-140s (two nights ago). Initial
   arrythmia looked sinus vs. atrial tachycardia which appeared to
   transition to NSVT, faxed EKGs to cardiology fellow, thought was
   consistent with NSVT, started patient on amiodarone IV with adequate
   reponse, -  during this episode rebolused patient with 2x 250 cc fluid
   for hypotension and tachycardia
   - patient was on IV amiodarone, has not been started on PO amiodarone,
   will hold off for now, and see how patient does (NSVT may have been
   secondary to dialysis in particular rapid electrolyte shifts and fluid
   loss)
   - hold off on cards consults b/c suspect that mostly due to rapid fluid
   shifts, amiodarone responsive
    # Renal failure: seems Urine output has not improved significantly
   since stent placement. Cr normal. Patient with episode of hypotension
   that seems to limit ability to do HD. Also seems to have tenous volume
   status.
    - CVVH stopped had first trial of HD with drop in blood pressure,
   possible HD today
   - s/p stent to ureter to relieve obstruction which did not result in
   increased urinary output
   - urine cx sent intraoperative only growing yeast, urine apparently was
   cloudy, however no evidence of frank pus or abscess, not currently on
   any antibiotics
 currently on fluconazole for 7 days
   # Malignancy-? Metastatic ovarian cancer
   - started chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of
   1.66. consider second dose 21 days after the first
   - premedication with anti-emeteics including ondansetron, dexamethasone
   on day 1 and 3 days following chemotherapy, dexamethasone OK even in
   addition to IV hydrocortisone as per oncology
   - oncology feels that renal failure and hypotension all related to
   fluid shifts secondary to malignancy and that the only way that she
   will be able to come off of pressors and HD is to treat the cancer
   - still with chest tube in (malignant effusion) with decent output
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome- follow tumor lysis labs
   # Anemia of chronic disease
   - patient is anemic, ordered anemia work-up labs - iron 27 (low), TIBC
   173 (low), ferritin 222 (high), TRF 133 (low), b12 normal, folate
   normal
   - low iron, low TIBC and elevated ferritin consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease
   #Pleural effusions: patient
s chest tube fell out yesterday during
   transport. IP and thoracic surgery aware, and will replace today. CXR
   showed no PTX. Currently sterile dressing in place.Patient still with
   significant output through left tube.
   -contact thoracic surgery for Chest tube replacement today
   - likely not candidate for pleuradesis at this time
   -also given tachycardia, tachypnea and hazy CXR started vanco, zosyn
   yesterday for concern of HAP.
     #. Hypotension and shock.
   - infectious work-up has been negative thus far, blood cultures no
   growth to date, pleural fluid with negative culture, urine cx grew
   yeast, given lack of other source  started fluconazole treatment [**10-2**]
   -CXR with ?PNA started vanco, zosyn for suspected HAP
   - patient currently off pressors with good blood pressure, still on IV
   steroids
   - previously  got IV albumin and also IV steroids for hypotension with
   good response
   - will start steroid taper today  at 25 mg IV q 6hours
    #. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - Monitor for a. fib, on thyroid replacement
   - steroids as above
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   # Aspiration: on regular diet with thin liquids seen by speech and
   swallow

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer, on pressors, and transferred to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. She initially presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia, now post ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy. Her medical history includes hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia. The patient continues to have episodes of tachycardia, despite not having any fluid taken off yesterday. She is also experiencing hypotension, which seems to limit her ability to undergo hemodialysis (HD). Her urine output has not improved significantly since stent placement, and her creatinine level is normal. The patient has a history of chest tube placement due to malignant effusion and is currently on fluconazole for a yeast infection in her urine. She was started on chemotherapy with carboplatin, but experienced an episode of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) during dialysis, for which she was given amiodarone. She is also being treated for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's anemia work-up shows low iron, low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), elevated ferritin, and low transferrin receptor (TRF) levels, consistent with anemia of chronic disease. She has pleural eff"

   I have seen and examined the patient and agree with the above
   assessment and plan with the following additions:
   Patient was slightly tachycardiac overnight and the chest tube fell
   out.  Yesterday, started Vanc and Zosyn for pneumonia as was becoming
   significantly tachyapneic and worsening cough with chest infiltrate.
   On exam, patient is obese, no acute distress.  Tachyapnea slightly
   improved from yesterday.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. The patient's medical history includes hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Tachycardia: The patient continues to have episodes of tachycardia, which could be secondary to 3rd spacing, causing the patient to be IV dry, a new infection (possible pneumonia on CXR or yeast in urine), or a paraneoplastic event given her malignancy.

2. Renal failure: The patient is currently on dialysis and has been diagnosed with acute renal failure. Monitoring electrolytes and repletion is necessary.

3. Malignancy - Metastatic ovarian cancer: The patient started chemotherapy with carboplatin. Oncology believes that renal failure and hypotension are related to fluid shifts secondary to malignancy, and the only way to come off of pressors and HD is to treat the cancer. Allopurinol was ordered to prevent tumor lysis syndrome.

4. Anemia of chronic disease: The patient is anemic, and anemia work-up labs have been ordered. Low iron, low TIBC, and elevated ferritin levels are consistent with anemia of chronic disease.

5. Pleural effusions: The patient's chest tube fell out"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
    # Renal failure: seems Urine output has not improved significantly
   since stent placement. Cr normal. Patient with episode of hypotension
   that seems to limit ability to do HD. Also seems to have tenous volume
   status.
    - CVVH stopped had first trial of HD with drop in blood pressure, got
   HD yesterday without large swings in her blood pressure, plan is to
   likely get HD today
   - s/p stent to ureter to relieve obstruction which did not result in
   increased urinary output
   - urine cx sent intraoperative only growing [**Month/Day (2) 1564**], urine apparently was
   cloudy, however no evidence of frank pus or abscess, not currently on
   any antibiotics - ordered repeat culture yesterday
   - given two positive urines with [**Last Name (LF) 1564**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] go ahead at this time and
   treat at this time with fluconazole for 7 day course
   # Likely Metastatic ovarian cancer
   - started chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of
   1.66. consider second dose 21 days after the first
   - premedication with anti-emeteics including ondansetron, dexamethasone
   on day 1 and 3 days following chemotherapy, dexamethasone OK even in
   addition to IV hydrocortisone as per oncology
   - oncology feels that renal failure and hypotension all related to
   fluid shifts secondary to malignancy and that the only way that she
   will be able to come off of pressors and HD is to treat the cancer
   - still with chest tube in (malignant effusion) with decent output
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
   # Tachycardia
   - patient again tachycardic this morning possible etiologies include
   sinus tachycardia secondary to volume loss from HD, or new infection
   - will check a chest x-ray, start on fluconazole for [**Month/Year (2) 1564**] in the urine
   x 7 days
   - continue to follow
   -  previous episode of tachycardia s/p first HD - took multiple EKGs
   during episode of tachycardia to 130-140s (two nights ago). Initial
   arrythmia looked sinus vs. atrial tachycardia which appeared to
   transition to NSVT, faxed EKGs to cardiology fellow, thought was
   consistent with NSVT, started patient on amiodarone IV with adequate
   reponse, -  during this episode rebolused patient with 2x 250 cc fluid
   for hypotension and tachycardia
   - patient was on IV amiodarone, has not been started on PO amiodarone,
   will hold off for now, and see how patient does (NSVT may have been
   secondary to dialysis in particular rapid electrolyte shifts and fluid
   loss)
   - hold off on cards consults b/c suspect that mostly due to rapid fluid
   shifts, definitely was admiodarone responsive\
   # Anemia
   - patient is anemic, ordered anemia work-up labs - iron 27 (low), TIBC
   173 (low), ferritin 222 (high), TRF 133 (low), b12 normal, folate
   normal
   - low iron, low TIBC and elevated ferritin consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease
   #Pleural effusions: Patient still with  significant output through left
   tube. Since etiology is malignancy may not resolve promptly.
   - likely not candidate for pleuradesis at this time, can follow up with
   thoracics at a later date regarding plan for tube
   - wiill need to address plans for chest tube on discharge
   - effusions may be contributing to underlying heart physiology
     #. Hypotension and shock.
   - infectious work-up has been negative thus far, blood cultures no
   growth to date, pleural fluid with negative culture, urine cx grew only
   [**Month/Year (2) 1564**], given lack of other source  will start treatment [**10-2**]
   - sent repeat UA and culture - repeat UA from [**10-1**] cloudy, large LE,
   large blood, 300 protein, trace ketones, 300 RBCs, 29 WBCs, many
   bacteria, many [**Month/Year (2) 1564**] urine culture pending
   - patient currently off pressors with good blood pressure, still on IV
   steroids
   - previously  got IV albumin and also IV steroids for hypotension with
   good response
   - will start steroid taper today  (tomorrow go to 25 mg IV q 6hours)
    #. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - Monitor for a. fib, on thyroid replacement
   - steroids as above
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   # Aspiration: on regular diet with thin liquids seen by speech and
   swallow
    Dispo: consider transfer to floor tomorrow or later this afternoon if
   stabilizes

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for renal failure, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The patient underwent ureteral stenting and received one day of chemotherapy. She also has a chest tube in place due to a malignant effusion. The patient's current conditions include tachycardia, anemia, pleural effusions, hypotension and shock, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's urine output has not improved significantly since the ureteral stent placement, and her creatinine levels are increasing. This indicates a possible complication of ongoing renal failure.
2. Infection: The patient's urine culture grew [**Month/Year (2) 1564**], indicating a urinary tract infection. Additionally, the patient is at risk for other infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to being intubated.
3. Anemia: The patient is anemic with low iron, low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and elevated ferritin levels. This suggests anemia of chronic disease related to her underlying malignancy.
4. Pleural Effusions: The patient still has significant output through her left chest tube, and the etiology is malignancy. This may not resolve promptly and may contribute to underlying heart physiology."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. On admission, the patient was in acute respiratory distress and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with multiple episodes of hypotension and hypoxia. Despite aggressive resuscitation efforts, the patient's condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and presence of fever suggest the possibility of an infection. The patient's tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension could be signs of septic shock, which is a life-threatening complication of sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2) and the presence of infiltrates on the chest X-ray suggest the possibility of ARDS. ARDS is a severe lung condition that can occur in response to an infection or injury, leading to difficulty breathing and decreased oxygen levels in the blood.
3. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient's elevated heart rhythm (Sinus Tachycardia) and low blood pressure (95/58 mmHg) could indicate cardiac tamponade. This occurs when fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac around the heart, compressing the"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Tachycardia
   - patient continues to have episodes of tachycardia overnight, despite
   not having any fluid taken off yesterday (no HD). This could be sinus
   tachycardia secondary to 3^rd spacing, causing patient to be IV dry
   (although not hypotensive), new infection (?PNA on CXR or yeast in
   urine), or paraneoplastic event given her malignancy.
   -started on fluconazole for yeast infection (day 2 today)
   - patient was on IV amiodarone, has not been started on PO amiodarone,
   will hold off for now, and monitor telemetry
   - if persists or becomes HD unstable will consult cardiology and
   consider starting low dose beta blocker
   - repeat EKG post HD
    # Renal failure: HD today
   -d/c foley as colonized
   - monitor electrolytes and replete prn
   -f/u renal recs
   # Malignancy-? Metastatic ovarian cancer- started chemo [**10-1**] day #1
   with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66. consider second dose 21
   days after the first. oncology feels that renal failure and hypotension
   all related to fluid shifts secondary to malignancy and that the only
   way that she will be able to come off of pressors and HD is to treat
   the cancer
   - will need to replace chest tube today, IP to come see patient
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome- follow tumor lysis labs
   # Anemia of chronic disease
   - patient is anemic, ordered anemia work-up labs - iron 27 (low), TIBC
   173 (low), ferritin 222 (high), TRF 133 (low), b12 normal, folate
   normal
   - low iron, low TIBC and elevated ferritin consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease
   #Pleural effusions: patient
s chest tube fell out yesterday during
   transport. IP and thoracic surgery aware, and will replace today. CXR
   showed no PTX. Currently sterile dressing in place.Patient still with
   significant output through left tube.
   -contact thoracic surgery for Chest tube replacement today
   -also given tachycardia, tachypnea and hazy CXR started vanco, zosyn
   yesterday for concern of HAP
   -consider sending sputum culture
     #. Hypotension and shock.
   -CXR with ?PNA started vanco, zosyn for suspected HAP
   - patient currently off pressors with good blood pressure, still on IV
   steroids
   - previously  got IV albumin and also IV steroids for hypotension with
   good response
   - will start steroid taper post dialysis  at 25 mg IV q 6hours
    #. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - Monitor for a. fib, on thyroid replacement
   - steroids as above
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   # Aspiration: on regular diet with thin liquids seen by speech and
   swallow
    Dispo: consider transfer to floor later this afternoon post HD and IP

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She has been admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. The patient's medical history includes hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia.

The patient presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia and was started on pressors. She underwent ureteral stenting and received one day of chemotherapy before being transferred to the ICU.

The patient's current vital signs show tachycardia (heart rate of 107 bpm), hypotension (blood pressure of 95/58 mmHg), and tachypnea (respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute). The patient is on a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery and has an SpO2 of 99%. The arterial blood gas reveals a pH of 7.32, indicating acidosis.

Physical examination findings include crackles at the bases of the lungs, productive cough, distended abdomen, and stable peripheral edema. Neurological examination is unremarkable.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.7 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolyte imbalances include hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. Other lab values indicate possible infection and inflammation"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Tachycardia
   - patient continues to have episodes of tachycardia overnight, despite
   not having any fluid taken off yesterday (no HD). This could be sinus
   tachycardia secondary to 3^rd spacing, causing patient to be IV dry
   (although not hypotensive), new infection (?PNA on CXR or yeast in
   urine), or paraneoplastic event given her malignancy.
   -started on fluconazole for yeast infection (day 2 today)
   - patient was on IV amiodarone, has not been started on PO amiodarone,
   will hold off for now, and monitor telemetry
   - if persists or becomes HD unstable will consult cardiology and
   consider starting low dose beta blocker
   - repeat EKG post HD
    # Renal failure: HD today
   -d/c foley as colonized
   - monitor electrolytes and replete prn
   -f/u renal recs
   # Malignancy-? Metastatic ovarian cancer- started chemo [**10-1**] day #1
   with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66. consider second dose 21
   days after the first. oncology feels that renal failure and hypotension
   all related to fluid shifts secondary to malignancy and that the only
   way that she will be able to come off of pressors and HD is to treat
   the cancer
   - will need to replace chest tube today, IP to come see patient
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome- follow tumor lysis labs
   # Anemia of chronic disease
   - patient is anemic, ordered anemia work-up labs - iron 27 (low), TIBC
   173 (low), ferritin 222 (high), TRF 133 (low), b12 normal, folate
   normal
   - low iron, low TIBC and elevated ferritin consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease
   #Pleural effusions: patient
s chest tube fell out yesterday during
   transport. IP and thoracic surgery aware, and will replace today. CXR
   showed no PTX. Currently sterile dressing in place.Patient still with
   significant output through left tube.
   -contact thoracic surgery for Chest tube replacement today
   -also given tachycardia, tachypnea and hazy CXR started vanco, zosyn
   yesterday for concern of HAP
   -consider sending sputum culture
     #. Hypotension and shock.
   -CXR with ?PNA started vanco, zosyn for suspected HAP
   - patient currently off pressors with good blood pressure, still on IV
   steroids
   - previously  got IV albumin and also IV steroids for hypotension with
   good response
   - will start steroid taper post dialysis  at 25 mg IV q 6hours
    #. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - Monitor for a. fib, on thyroid replacement
   - steroids as above
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   # Aspiration: on regular diet with thin liquids seen by speech and
   swallow
    Dispo: consider transfer to floor later this afternoon post HD and IP

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia.

The patient presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. She underwent ureteral stenting and received one day of chemotherapy.

In the ICU, the patient continues to experience tachycardia, with heart rates ranging from 100-130 beats per minute. She also had an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). The attending physician consulted cardiology for further evaluation and treatment of NSVT. The patient is currently on diltiazem for rate control and is being monitored for any changes in her heart rhythm.

The patient's renal function remains unstable, and she requires hemodialysis (HD) to manage her renal failure. Her electrolytes are being closely monitored, and she is receiving replacement fluids as needed. The attending physician plans to repeat an electrocardiogram (EKG) to assess her cardiac status.

The patient has been diagnosed with anemia of chronic disease, and anemia work-up labs have been ordered. She also has pleural effusions, and serial chest X-rays will be performed to monitor the effusion. The patient is currently off pressors and has a stable blood pressure.

The attending physician suspects pneumonia and has"

","Summary:
The patient is an obese woman admitted to the ICU with hypotension. She underwent hemodialysis and has been on diltiazem for tachycardia. Her blood pressure has been stable, but she experienced several episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia overnight. She is receiving multiple medications including heparin sodium, lorazepam, famotidine, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 96%, and temperature slightly below normal. The patient's weight has increased from admission, and she has a fluid balance deficit. She has a history of allergies to oxycodone, nausea/vomiting, and is currently on prophylactic antibiotics. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged except for the noted tachycardia. Her labs show elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, elevated creatinine, and other abnormal values indicating potential complications. Imaging studies are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation of hypotension indicates a potential cardiovascular complication. It is crucial to monitor her blood pressure and ensure adequate perfusion.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent tachycardia, both before and during admission, may be a"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Tachycardia
   - patient continues to have episodes of tachycardia overnight, despite
   not having any fluid taken off yesterday (no HD). This could be sinus
   tachycardia secondary to 3^rd spacing, causing patient to be IV dry
   (although not hypotensive), new infection (?PNA on CXR or yeast in
   urine), or paraneoplastic event given her malignancy.
   -started on fluconazole for yeast infection (day 2 today)
   - patient was on IV amiodarone, has not been started on PO amiodarone,
   will hold off for now, and monitor telemetry
   - if persists or becomes HD unstable will consult cardiology and
   consider starting low dose beta blocker
   - repeat EKG post HD
    # Renal failure: HD today
   -d/c foley as colonized
   - monitor electrolytes and replete prn
   -f/u renal recs
   # Malignancy-? Metastatic ovarian cancer- started chemo [**10-1**] day #1
   with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66. consider second dose 21
   days after the first. oncology feels that renal failure and hypotension
   all related to fluid shifts secondary to malignancy and that the only
   way that she will be able to come off of pressors and HD is to treat
   the cancer
   - will need to replace chest tube today, IP to come see patient
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome- follow tumor lysis labs
   # Anemia of chronic disease
   - patient is anemic, ordered anemia work-up labs - iron 27 (low), TIBC
   173 (low), ferritin 222 (high), TRF 133 (low), b12 normal, folate
   normal
   - low iron, low TIBC and elevated ferritin consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease
   #Pleural effusions: patient
s chest tube fell out yesterday during
   transport. IP and thoracic surgery aware, and will replace today. CXR
   showed no PTX. Currently sterile dressing in place.Patient still with
   significant output through left tube.
   -contact thoracic surgery for Chest tube replacement today
   -also given tachycardia, tachypnea and hazy CXR started vanco, zosyn
   yesterday for concern of HAP
   -consider sending sputum culture
     #. Hypotension and shock.
   -CXR with ?PNA started vanco, zosyn for suspected HAP
   - patient currently off pressors with good blood pressure, still on IV
   steroids
   - previously  got IV albumin and also IV steroids for hypotension with
   good response
   - will start steroid taper post dialysis  at 25 mg IV q 6hours
    #. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - Monitor for a. fib, on thyroid replacement
   - steroids as above
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   # Aspiration: on regular diet with thin liquids seen by speech and
   swallow
    Dispo: consider transfer to floor later this afternoon post HD and IP

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. The patient presented initially with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia, which has been treated with ureteral stent placement and one day of chemotherapy. Her medical history includes hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia.

24-hour events:
- The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) and was planned to undergo cardiac catheterization (C/O) but no available bed. She was also started on 30mg PO diltiazem for consistent tachycardia over the last two days. Her blood pressure has been stable.
- The patient experienced several runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) overnight while being moved and bathed. Her blood pressure remained stable, and she did not receive any treatment. The episodes resolved on their own.
- The patient is allergic to oxycodone and experiences nausea/vomiting.
- The patient received antibiotics including vancomycin, fluconazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).
- The patient is receiving various medications such as famotidine (Pepcid), heparin sodium (Prophylaxis), lorazepam (Ativan), diltiazem, and others.

   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Tachycardia/NSVT: Pt continues to be tachycardic 100-130 range. Her
   HCT has been stable, pt has been afebrile and has not had HD or
   hypotension to explain tachycardia. SpO2 looks ok. Pt on
   Vanc/Zosyn/Fluc for PNA and UTI respectively. Patient also had NSVT
   episode last night.
   -cardiology consult per attending for NSVT

   days after the first. oncology feels that renal failure and hypotension
   all related to fluid shifts secondary to malignancy and that the only
   way that she will be able to come off of pressors and HD is to treat
   the cancer

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. She has a history of hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and atherosclerotic heart disease. The patient is on pressors and has undergone hemodialysis (HD) previously. She is also being treated for pneumonia (PNA) and urinary tract infection (UTI) with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, respectively. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachycardia/NSVT: The patient continues to experience tachycardia with a heart rate ranging from 100-130 beats per minute. She has also had episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). The cause of tachycardia is unclear, and it is important to monitor the patient's heart rhythm and consider a cardiology consult.
2. Renal failure: The patient has renal failure, which is evident from her elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. She requires ongoing hemodialysis to manage her renal function.
3. Malignancy: The patient has metastatic ovarian cancer, and her condition is being treated with palliative chemotherapy. There is a concern about tumor lysis syndrome, and allopurinol has been prescribed to prevent it.
4. Anemia of chronic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing shortness of breath (SOB) and agitation with fluid on examination. They were given nebs (nebulizers), repositioned, and improved. The aspiration revealed pills, mucus, and apple puree, so the patient was made NPO (nothing by mouth). The IV drip was changed, and a chest X-ray showed no significant changes.

The patient has allergies to oxycodone, nausea/vomiting, and previous antibiotics. They were given multiple infusions of diltiazem, lorazepam, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 99/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 580 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with 176 mL going into the TF (total fluid) and 540 mL into the IVF (intravenous fluids). The patient has lost a total of 19 mL of blood products and 8 mL of urine.

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # SOB: Patient with witnessed aspiration espisode last night. Now with
   worsening SOB, and pills and thickened pure on aspiration. Increasing
   O2 requirements. Worsening CXR concerning for aspiration pneumonia.
   -Continue Vanc/ZOsyn for now
   -Family meeting today to define goals of care and clarify code status
   -Pateient may need large-volume parasentesis to relieve pressure in
   lungs
   -Restrict her fluids to max today
   -HD tomorrow
   -Talk to thoraxics about pleural effusion
   -Repeat ABG; may need ET tube later today depending on profression
   # Tachycardia/NSVT: Pt continues to be tachycardic 100-130 range. Her
   HCT has been stable, pt has been afebrile and has not had HD or
   hypotension to explain tachycardia. SpO2 looks ok. Pt on
   Vanc/Zosyn/Fluc for PNA and UTI respectively. Patient also had NSVT
   episode last night.
   -cardiology consult per attending for NSVT
   -Continue dilt for now
   -monitor I/O, fluid status, and JVP
   -repeat EKG
    # Renal failure: HD Monday
   - monitor electrolytes and replete prn
   -f/u renal recs
   # Malignancy-? Metastatic ovarian cancer- started chemo [**10-1**] day #1
   with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66. consider second dose 21
   days after the first. oncology feels that renal failure and hypotension
   all related to fluid shifts secondary to malignancy and that the only
   way that she will be able to come off of pressors and HD is to treat
   the cancer
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome- follow tumor lysis labs
   -f/u Onc recs
   # Anemia of chronic disease
   - patient is anemic, ordered anemia work-up labs - iron 27 (low), TIBC
   173 (low), ferritin 222 (high), TRF 133 (low), b12 normal, folate
   normal
   - low iron, low TIBC and elevated ferritin consistent with anemia of
   chronic disease
   #Pleural effusions: patient
s chest tube fell out 2 days ago during
   transport. IP and thoracic surgery aware
   -Serial CXR to monitor pleural effusion
   -On PNA treatment
   -consider sending sputum culture
    #. Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - Monitor for a. fib, on thyroid replacement
   - steroids as above
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   # Aspiration: on regular diet with thin liquids seen by speech and
   swallow
    Dispo: consider transfer to floor later this afternoon post HD and IP

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I examined the patient today and reviewed her history and relevant
   labs.  I was also present with the MICU team for the key portions of
   the services provided, and I agree with the note above, including its
   assessment and plans.  I would add and emphasize the following:
   The patient has had a worsening of resp status, with a productive
   sounding cough and pills and juice aspirated from her lower airways.
   Hence she was made NPO.  CXR now shows increase in bibasilar opacities
   most consistent with aspiration than pleural fluid, though small bilat
   effusions remain.  Has needed higher Fi02. and PC02 increased now:
   78.28/59/89
   On exam: afeb,  90  99/62  22  100% on prongs and face tent  I/O =
   +560cc
   Lungs: rhonchi.  Abdomen:  Lg and tense ascites with anasarca of abd
   wall.  Ext:  4+ edema  Neuro: a&o, not uncomfortable
   Problems:
   1.       [**Name2 (NI) 1641**] adenoca, likely ovarian, with recent initiation of chemo
   2.       Bilateral malignant pleural effusions, drained, and not
   severely increased again
   3.       Ascites, likely malignant
   4.       Aspiration
   5.       Respiratory insufficiency with hypoxemia and hypercarbia, the
   latter likely due to increased work of breathing due to her effusions
   and chiefly due to her large belly, now exacerbated by last night
   aspiration
   6.       Renal failure
   7.       Anasarca due to #1 and #5
   8.       NSVT
   9.       Code Status
   Plan:
   1.       Trial of NPPV
   2.       Mark for paracentesis in ultrasound.  We should then attempt
   to tap.  If unsuccessful, may need attempt in I.R.
   3.       NPO for now
   4.       Concentrate IV
   5.       Encourage cough and if necessary deep suction
   6.       Family meeting today with pt
   Addendum -  I had a family mtg with the patient today, attended by MICU
   house [**Name6 (MD) 1665**] and RN.  We discussed the current decline in resp status
   and the possibility that  physiologically she might need intubation and
   mech ventilation.  We expressed the rather dire set of obstacles
   against us: [**Name6 (MD) **] ca, renal failure, aspiration, malignant effusions and
   likely malignant ascites, and the questionable success that chemo may
   have.  We asked the pt what her wishes were should all our efforts fail
   to keep her out of frank resp failure.  She expressed the desire to
   keep fighting, though clearly hates the ET Tube.  She and the family
   realize that if she is indeed intubated and there is nothing that can
   be reversed, then there may need to be another discussion about
   realistic goals of care.  Right now she and the family are holding out
   hope that chemo will reduce the tumor burden, and with it improve
   ascites, pl effusions, etc.
   Patient Critically ill.    Time spent on rounds 45 min and in family
   mtg 45 min  = 90 min total

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. She has a history of hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia. The patient's current presentation includes shortness of breath (SOB), agitation, and fluid in the lungs. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxemia. 

The patient's medical history includes acute kidney injury (ARF) and hyperkalemia, for which she underwent ureteral stenting. She has also been diagnosed with anemia of chronic disease and is receiving chemotherapy for her ovarian cancer. Additionally, she has pleural effusions, likely due to malignant causes, and has had a chest tube placed, which fell out during transport.

The patient's lab results indicate renal failure with elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels. Her electrolytes show hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypercalcemia. Her complete blood count (CBC) reveals leukocytosis with a left shift. Liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal limits, but there is evidence of an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, suggesting tissue breakdown.

The patient's physical examination reveals anasarca, or generalized edema, particularly in the abdomen. Her respiratory examination shows bib"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She has been admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. The patient presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia, which have since improved. She has a history of hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia.

The patient is currently on pressors and has been diagnosed with pneumonia and a urinary tract infection, for which she is receiving appropriate antibiotics. She is also being treated for anemia of chronic disease and is scheduled for chemotherapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Tachycardia/NSVT: The patient continues to be tachycardic and has experienced episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). Cardiology consult has been requested for further evaluation and management.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function has not fully recovered, and dialysis is planned for Monday.
3. Malignancy: The patient has metastatic ovarian cancer, and chemotherapy has been initiated. There is a concern about tumor lysis syndrome, and allopurinol has been ordered to prevent it.
4. Anemia of chronic disease: The patient is anemic, and anemia work-up labs have been ordered. Treatment options may include iron supplementation or other interventions.
5. Pleural effusions: The patient had a chest tube that fell out during transport."

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Respiratory distress: Patient has primary respiratory acidosis with
   evidence of both primary hypercapneia and hypoxia.  Primary respiratory
   failure is likely from hypercapneia which is presumed to be secondary
   to restrictive lung physiology, likely from complex issues including
   obesity, tissues edema, ascites, and functional dead space.  This
   restrictive physiology appears to improve with BPAP somewhat which
   makes argument that increasing pressure improves ventilation.  Patient
   also with component of hypoxia which may be secondary to areas of lung
   collapse and aspiration.  Chest x-ray does not show large
   reaccumulation of fluid in area where chest tube has previously been
   removed. Patient clinically has been requiring increased oxygen
   requirement and intermittent BPAP for this respiratory acidosis.
   - in terms of improving restrictive pattern of lung failure, will try
   to get IR to do drainage of ascites if possible, do not think that
   chest tube placement will improve restrictive physiology too much,
   however would be worth a try if IP is willing to do it
   - will page IP fellow to figure out time to come this morning
   - cont BPAP to open airways
   - in terms of patient
s hypoxic respiratory distress will treat
   underlying aspiration pneumonia with vanc/zosyn
   -have now had family meeting that has confirmed goal to
fight.
   Patient to be intubated if needed for respiratory status, would
   consider if BPAP if fails this
   -continue fluid restriction to prevent increased restriction on lung
   tissue
   -consider intubation if respiratory status worsens
   # Renal failure: Patient essentially oliguric likely from ATN from
   fluid shifts from malignancy.   Also had functional ureteral
   obstruction, however stenting did not lead to improvement in urine
   outflow.
   - on HD currently, previously on CVVH
   - will talk to renal today about switching patient back to CVVH as will
   be unlikely to be able to manage fluid status without this and as now
   likely not leaving the unit
   - if needs TPN will require CVVH as would not be able to tolerate
   fluids
   #) Hypotension
 again patient is hypotensive with a line that is no
   longer functional
   -          replace a-line this morning
   -          get Svo2 and CVP to assess intravascular volume status
   -          consider either fluid bolus vs. re-starting pressors
   depending on CVP and fluid status
   - patient has previously been steroid responsive, so will re-start
   steroids at stress dose, consider IV albumin as needed to help
   # Malignancy-? Metastatic ovarian cancer- started chemo [**10-1**] day #1
   with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66. consider second dose 21
   days after the first. oncology feels that renal failure and hypotension
   may be related to fluid shifts secondary to malignancy and that the
   only way that she will be able to come off of pressors and HD is to
   treat the cancer
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome, unlikely to be a problem
   in this patient with kidneys already knocked out
   -oncology plan to transfer to OMED once medically stable, however given
   that patient will likely require CVVH, do not suspect that patient will
   be able to be trasnferred to the floor
   #) ascites/total body anarsarca
   -          decreased bowel sounds this morning in abdomen, worrisome
   for abdominal compartment syndrome
   -          will check a bladder pressure this morning
   -          plan for IR guided drainage of ascites this morning to help
   # Tachycardia/NSVT: Pt previously tachycardic to 100-130 range. Her HCT
   has been stable, pt has been afebrile and has not had HD or hypotension
   to explain tachycardia. SpO2 looks ok. Pt on Vanc/Zosyn/Fluc for PNA
   and UTI respectively. Patient also had NSVT two nights ago.
   -cardiology consult reccomendations to d/c diltiazem drip and give
   b-blocker IV PRN for NSVT as well as checking electrolytes as runs of
   NSVT have been short
   -continue to monitor I/Os
   -serial ekgs
    # Anemia of chronic disease
   - patient is anemic- iron 27 (low), TIBC 173 (low), ferritin 222
   (high), TRF 133 (low), b12 normal, folate normal, consistent with
   anemia of chronic disease
    #. Hypothyroidism/previous hypotension
 Consulted endocrinology to
   help elucidate if hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent
   hypotension.
   - Monitor for a. fib, on thyroid replacement
   - previously on stress dose steroids for hypotension, now on steroid
   taper, cut dose to 25 IV BID today, would consider cutting to 25 IV
   daily in the next few days as tolerated
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   FEN
 currently NPO as on CPAP, previous aspiration events, will
   require either TPN vs. tube feeds, however worry about placing NG tube
   at this time given total body anasarca. Will consult nutrition
   regarding tpn request, however will likely need CVVH if going to get
   TPN otherwise patient should get tube feeds if gets intubated

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for ureteral stent placement due to acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. The patient has a complex medical history, including hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, anemia of chronic disease, and possible aspiration events.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress with primary respiratory acidosis and evidence of both primary hypercapnia and hypoxia. There are multiple potential causes for her respiratory failure, including obesity, tissue edema, ascites, and functional dead space. The use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has been helpful in improving her ventilation.

The patient also has renal failure, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from fluid shifts due to malignancy. She is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and has had a functional ureteral obstruction that did not improve with stenting.

Additionally, the patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be related to her malignancy and fluid shifts. She requires pressors to maintain blood pressure. The oncology team believes that treating the underlying malignancy is crucial for her overall management.

Furthermore, the patient has ascites/total body anasarca, which is causing decreased bowel sounds and concerns about abdominal compartment syndrome. An attempt at paracentesis was unsuccessful, and an interventional radiology ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer who was admitted to the ICU for ureteral stent placement due to acute renal failure. The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) for oliguria and has difficult-to-manage fluid status, worsening ascites, and recently received chemotherapy.

24-hour events include an ultrasound, paracentesis, and arterial line placement. The patient has allergies to oxycodone and nausea/vomiting. Medications include vancomycin, fluconazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.2Â°C (97.1Â°F) with a current temperature of 35.8Â°C (96.5Â°F), heart rate of 91 bpm with a range of 81-95 bpm, blood pressure of 104/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute with a range of 4-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is 106.3 kg, and height is 58 inches.

Fluid balance shows total intake of 619 mL and output of 8 mL, with a weight gain since admission of 7.4 kg. Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with FiO2 of 40%. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.31, PaCO2 of 52 mmHg, and HCO3- of 85 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals anasarca on CPAP, diminished pulses in extremities, diminished breath sounds over the left lung field and right base, non-tender abdomen with distention, warm skin, and purposeful movement. Neurologic examination is normal.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal range or show no significant changes.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, line management, dialysis catheter, PICC line, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code."

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # SOB: Patient with witnessed aspiration espisode last night. Now with
   worsening SOB, and pills and thickened pure on aspiration. Increasing
   O2 requirements. Worsening CXR concerning for aspiration pneumonia.
   -Continue Vanc/ZOsyn for now as patient with worsening respiratory
   status, aspiration
   -have now had family meeting that has confirmed goal to
fight.
   Patient to be intubated if needed for respiratory status.
   -goal to get IR guided drainage of abdomen today to relieve shortness
   of breath
   -continue fluid restriction
   -HD today
   -IP to reassess patient today, consider repeat pigtail cath insertion
   if medically appropriate
   -consider intubation if respiratory status worsens
   # Tachycardia/NSVT: Pt previously tachycardic to 100-130 range. Her HCT
   has been stable, pt has been afebrile and has not had HD or hypotension
   to explain tachycardia. SpO2 looks ok. Pt on Vanc/Zosyn/Fluc for PNA
   and UTI respectively. Patient also had NSVT two nights ago.
   -cardiology consult reccomendations to d/c diltiazem drip and give
   b-blocker IV PRN for NSVT as well as checking electrolytes as runs of
   NSVT have been short
   -continue to monitor I/Os
   -serial ekgs
    # Renal failure: HD today
   - monitor electrolytes and replete prn
   -f/u renal recs
   # Malignancy-? Metastatic ovarian cancer- started chemo [**10-1**] day #1
   with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66. consider second dose 21
   days after the first. oncology feels that renal failure and hypotension
   may be related to fluid shifts secondary to malignancy and that the
   only way that she will be able to come off of pressors and HD is to
   treat the cancer
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome- follow tumor lysis labs
   -oncology plan to transfer to OMED once medically stable
   # Anemia of chronic disease
   - patient is anemic- iron 27 (low), TIBC 173 (low), ferritin 222
   (high), TRF 133 (low), b12 normal, folate normal, consistent with
   anemia of chronic disease
   #Pleural effusions: patient
s chest tube fell out 3 days ago during
   transport. IP and thoracic surgery aware
   - IP to come by today, consider repeat pigtail catheter
   -Serial CXRs to monitor pleural effusion
   -On PNA treatment to cover for HAP vs. aspiration pneumonia, will
   continue at this time given tenous respiratory status even though
   culture negative to date
   -sputum culture largely unrevealing
    #. Hypothyroidism/previous hypotension
 Consulted endocrinology to
   help elucidate if hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent
   hypotension.
   - Monitor for a. fib, on thyroid replacement
   - previously on stress dose steroids for hypotension, now on steroid
   taper, cut dose to 25 IV BID today, would consider cutting to 25 IV
   daily in the next few days as tolerated
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
   # Aspiration: with recent large aspiration of [**Company 1681**] and pills,
   made patient NPO for now. Put in nutrition request for TPN as suspect
   that patient will require this given inability to take po. Meds are now
   all IV for now.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She was transferred to the ICU for ureteral stent placement due to acute renal failure. The patient's current condition includes oliguria, difficult-to-manage fluid status, worsening ascites, and recent chemotherapy treatment.

24-hour events:
Yesterday, a large family meeting was held to discuss the patient's goals of care. The patient expressed her desire for intubation if necessary and wants to fight against her illness. However, an attempt at paracentesis was unsuccessful, and an interventional radiology (IR) guided paracentesis is planned for today. The patient's chest tube came out, and thoracics recommended involvement of the intensivist physician (IP) for further management.

Medical history:
The patient has hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia. She also has a history of hypotension, which may be related to her malignancy.

Current vital signs:
The patient's temperature is 36.2 C (97.1 F), heart rate is 91 bpm, blood pressure is 104/58 mmHg, respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The patient's peripheral pulses are diminished bilaterally, and breath sounds are diminished over the left lung field and right base.

Lab results:
The patient's white blood cell count is"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with likely diagnosis of metastatic malignancy leading to
   ureteral obstruction and need for ureteral stenting.  She now has moved
   to need for renal replacement therapy and has hospital course
   complicated by intermittent worsening of respiratory status and has
   initiated palliative chemotherapy.  Issues of managment of ascites and
   effusions have been important in allowing palliation to be completed.
   Her renal function continues to remain one of dialysis dependent
   anuria.  Current chemotherapy has been directed at what may likely be
   ovarian source but this remains to be proven definatively.
   Acute Respiratory Failure-
   Hypercapnic
   -this appears to be overall initially hypercarbic and is acute
   respiratory acidosis.  The sources of this are most likely related to
   significant restriction of chest wall with obesity, effusion, ascites
   which are related to her underlying obesity and evolution of her
   underlying malignancy.  This may have a reasonable capacity to be
   improved with additional support via [**Hospital1 **]-level support.
   -There is likely an issue with the pattern of rapid shallow breaths
   with overall increase physiologic dead space.
   -To improve her overall ventilation we will need to
   -Tap Ascites if significant
   -Drain pleural effusion if significant and both of these things need
   further definition on repeat imaging.
   -Maintain negative fluid balance
   -BIPAP as needed
   -Will need intubation given worsening over time unless rapid fluid
   removal is undertaken.  She may need intubation for procedures if
   travel is required
   Hypoxemic
   -This may well be related to volume overload and pulmonary edema as
   well as areas of collapse and shunt with concern for aspiration and
   infection contributing.  This will require continued supplemental
   oxygen and PEEP to allow time for resolution of acute insults.
   -Continue with SBX for possible HAP-Vanco/Zosyn/Fluc
   -Attempt to move to negative fluid balance
   -Maintain reasonable PEEP with NIV and ETT if needed.  Likely move to
   intubation as need for
   Hypotension
This has evolved over past hours/days and concern is for
   depleted intravascular volume and possible evolution of new infectious
   insult but the differential diagnosis is broad
   -Arterial catheter needed
   -CVL needed to allow adequate support of hemodynamics in the setting of
   persistent hypotension if that is documented
   -return to full dose steroids
   -Culture sent
   -ECG repeated
   -Will need to consider return to pressors to allow some fluid removal
   and will need access for this.
   Acute Renal Failure-This is in part due to obstruction of drainage
   system and complicated by hypotension transiently of late.  There is no
   return of significant urine output or renal function even in the
   setting of stenting.  This may be ATN and component of abdominal
   compartment syndrome and hypotension requiring pressors.  No evidence
   of return of function.
   -Check bladder pressure
   -Move to CVVH given transient drops in blood pressure and need for
   tight control of volume.
   -Will need to continue with colloid support as possible for
   hypotension.
   Metastatic Malignancy-This is being managed in consultation with
   oncology and current dosing of all interventions is aimed at
   palliation.  Does need continued consideration of need for support of
   tumor lysis in setting of limited capacity to provide po medications.
   Next dose in 3 weeks.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a likely diagnosis of metastatic malignancy, resulting in ureteral obstruction and the need for ureteral stenting. She is now requiring renal replacement therapy and has been experiencing intermittent worsening of respiratory status. The patient has initiated palliative chemotherapy and is being managed for issues related to ascites, effusions, and anuria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure - The patient is experiencing hypercapnic respiratory acidosis due to significant restriction of the chest wall caused by obesity, effusion, and ascites. This can be improved with additional support via [Hospital1]-level support, including draining pleural effusion if significant, tapping ascites if significant, maintaining a negative fluid balance, using bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) as needed, and intubation if necessary.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure - This may be related to volume overload and pulmonary edema, as well as areas of collapse and shunt with concern for aspiration and infection. Continued supplemental oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) will be required.
3. Hypotension - The patient's hypotension may be due to depleted intravascular volume and a possible infectious insult. An arterial catheter, central venous line (CVL), and pressors may be needed to support hemodynamics.
4. Acute Renal Failure - The patient's renal function is compromised"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Respiratory distress: Patient has primary respiratory acidosis with
   evidence of both primary hypercapneia and hypoxia.  Primary respiratory
   failure is likely from hypercapneia which is presumed to be secondary
   to restrictive lung physiology, likely from complex issues including
   obesity, tissues edema, ascites, and functional dead space.  This
   restrictive physiology appears to have improved somewhat with BPAP
   somewhat which makes argument that increasing pressure improves
   ventilation.  However, with worsening academia and hypercarbia patient
   required emergent intubation overnight. Patient also with component of
   hypoxia which may be secondary to areas of lung collapse and
   aspiration.  Chest x-ray does not show large reaccumulation of fluid in
   area where chest tube has previously been removed. Patient clinically
   has been requiring increased oxygen requirement and intermittent BPAP
   for this respiratory acidosis.
   - 3L paracenetesis yesterday to aid with chest wall compliance
   - will page IP fellow again this morning to discuss plan regarding
   possible chest tube replacement, however at this point, suspect that
   may not be worthwhile unless larger fluid reaccumuliaton
   - now intubated and mechanically ventilated with vent settings as
   above, no attempts to wean off ventilation at this time
   - in terms of patient
s hypoxic respiratory distress will treat
   underlying aspiration pneumonia with vanc/zosyn
   - continue full aggressive care as per family
   -continue fluid restriction to prevent increased restriction on lung
   tissue
    # Renal failure: Patient essentially oliguric likely from ATN from
   fluid shifts from malignancy.   Also had functional ureteral
   obstruction, however stenting did not lead to improvement in urine
   outflow.
   - on HD currently, yesterday removed 3L at dialysis, previously on CVVH
   -discussed with renal fellow need to start CVVH today in the setting of
   TPN and being on pressors, will follow up with plan for CVVH
    #) Hypotension
 again patient is hypotensive with a line that is no
   longer functional
   - a line replaced yesterday
   - SVO2 was measured yesterday, was normal
   -  6L off total yesterday, started on levofed again
   - patient has previously been steroid responsive, so re-started
   steroids at stress dose, consider IV albumin as needed to help
   # Malignancy-? Metastatic ovarian cancer- started chemo [**10-1**] day #1
   with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66. consider second dose 21
   days after the first. oncology feels that renal failure and hypotension
   may be related to fluid shifts secondary to malignancy and that the
   only way that she will be able to come off of pressors and HD is to
   treat the cancer
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome, however suspect that
   unnecessary at this point given lack of kidney function
   -appreciate onc recs, would continue to appreciate onc
s input to
   family on hopes of chemotherapy as clearly there is a lack of
   understanding about longterm prognosis despite multiple attempts to
   explain
   #) ascites/total body anarsarca
   - decreased bowel sounds this morning in abdomen, worrisome for
   abdominal compartment syndrome
   -  bladder pressure yesterday measure
   -   now s/p 3L removal of fluid from ascites
     # Anemia of chronic disease
   - patient is anemic- iron 27 (low), TIBC 173 (low), ferritin 222
   (high), TRF 133 (low), b12 normal, folate normal, consistent with
   anemia of chronic disease
    #. Hypothyroidism/previous hypotension
 Consulted endocrinology to
   help elucidate if hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent
   hypotension.
   - Monitor for a. fib, on thyroid replacement

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing primary respiratory acidosis with evidence of both primary hypercapnia and hypoxia. This suggests a restrictive lung physiology due to obesity, tissue edema, ascites, and functional dead space. The patient has already required emergent intubation overnight and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

2. Renal failure: The patient is essentially oliguric likely from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from fluid shifts from malignancy. The patient also had functional ureteral obstruction, but stenting did not lead to improvement in urine outflow. The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and will require continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) in the setting of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and being on pressors.

3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive with a line that is no longer functional. A new line has been replaced, and the patient is receiving levofed again. The patient has previously been steroid-responsive, so steroids at stress dose have been re-started, and IV albumin may be used as needed to help.

4. Malignancy: The patient has metastatic ovarian cancer and has started chemotherapy with carboplatin on day #1. It is important to consider the potential side effects and complications associated with chemotherapy, such as"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Respiratory distress: Patient has primary respiratory acidosis with
   evidence of both primary hypercapneia and hypoxia.  Primary respiratory
   failure is likely from hypercapneia which is presumed to be secondary
   to restrictive lung physiology, likely from complex issues including
   obesity, tissues edema, ascites, and functional dead space.  This
   restrictive physiology appears to have improved somewhat with BPAP
   somewhat which makes argument that increasing pressure improves
   ventilation.  However, with worsening academia and hypercarbia patient
   required emergent intubation overnight. Patient also with component of
   hypoxia which may be secondary to areas of lung collapse and
   aspiration.  Chest x-ray does not show large reaccumulation of fluid in
   area where chest tube has previously been removed. Patient clinically
   has been requiring increased oxygen requirement and intermittent BPAP
   for this respiratory acidosis.
   - 3L paracenetesis yesterday to aid with chest wall compliance without
   impressive result
   - IP to put drain today
   - now intubated and mechanically ventilated with vent settings as
   above, no attempts to wean off ventilation at this time
   - will check esophageal pressure as patient with elevated peak
   pressures
   - increase PEEP to see in increase compliance of lungs while measuring
   esophageal pressure
   - consider CT torso to look at whole torso
 likely not today as
   patient is very tenous
   - in terms of patient
s hypoxic respiratory distress will treat
   underlying aspiration pneumonia with vanc/zosyn
   - continue full aggressive care as per family
   -continue fluid restriction to prevent increased restriction on lung
   tissue
    # Renal failure: Patient essentially oliguric likely from ATN from
   fluid shifts from malignancy.   Also had functional ureteral
   obstruction, however stenting did not lead to improvement in urine
   outflow.
   - on HD currently, yesterday removed 3L at dialysis, previously on CVVH
   -discussed with renal fellow need to start CVVH today in the setting of
   TPN and being on pressors, will follow up with plan for CVVH
    #) Hypotension
 again patient is hypotensive with a line that is no
   longer functional
   - a line replaced yesterday
   -  6L off total yesterday, started on levofed again for marginal
   pressures
   - patient has previously been steroid responsive, so re-started
   steroids at stress dose, consider IV albumin as needed to help
   # Malignancy-? Metastatic ovarian cancer- started chemo [**10-1**] day #1
   with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66. consider second dose 21
   days after the first. oncology feels that renal failure and hypotension
   may be related to fluid shifts secondary to malignancy and that the
   only way that she will be able to come off of pressors and HD is to
   treat the cancer
   - Allopurinol to prevent tumor lysis syndrome, however suspect that
   unnecessary at this point given lack of kidney function
   -appreciate onc recs, would continue to appreciate onc
s input to
   family on hopes of chemotherapy as clearly there is a lack of
   understanding about longterm prognosis despite multiple attempts to
   explain
    #) ascites/total body anarsarca
   - decreased bowel sounds this morning in abdomen, worrisome for
   abdominal compartment syndrome
   -  bladder pressure yesterday measure
   -   now s/p 3L removal of fluid from ascites
     # Anemia of chronic disease
   - patient is anemic- iron 27 (low), TIBC 173 (low), ferritin 222
   (high), TRF 133 (low), b12 normal, folate normal, consistent with
   anemia of chronic disease
    #. Hypothyroidism/previous hypotension
 Consulted endocrinology to
   help elucidate if hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent
   hypotension.
   - Monitor for a. fib, on thyroid replacement
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose
    # FEN
 started TPN yesterday, will require likely CVVH to pull off
   fluid continuously, replete lytes PRN
   Consider starting insulin drip as glucose has been more out of control

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer who is currently in the ICU. She has a history of hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and anemia of chronic disease. The patient underwent palliative chemotherapy but experienced multiorgan system failure. She required several interventions, including paracentesis, arterial line placement, intubation, and dialysis. The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress with primary respiratory acidosis and hypoxia, renal failure, hypotension, malignancy with metastatic ovarian cancer undergoing chemotherapy, ascites/total body anasarca, anemia of chronic disease, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is characterized by primary respiratory acidosis with evidence of both primary hypercapnia and hypoxia. This could be due to restrictive lung physiology caused by obesity, tissue edema, ascites, and functional dead space. The patient has already required emergent intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if not properly managed.

2. Renal Failure: The patient is oliguric likely from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to fluid shifts from malignancy. Despite ureteral stenting, there has been no improvement in urine outflow. The patient is currently on hemodialysis and may require continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to the need for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and being on pressors.

3. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive with a non-functional arterial line. A replacement line has been started, and levofed has been re-initiated for marginal pressures. The patient has previously been steroid responsive, so stress-dose steroids have been restarted. IV albumin may be considered to help maintain blood pressure.

4. Malignancy: The patient has metastatic ovarian cancer and has started chemotherapy with carboplatin. The oncology team believes that renal failure and hypotension may be related to fluid shifts secondary to malignancy, and the only way for the patient to come off pressors and dialysis is to treat the cancer.

5. Ascites/Total Body Anasarca: The patient has decreased bowel sounds in the abdomen, which is worrisome for abdominal compartment syndrome. Bladder pressure measurements have been taken, and 3L of fluid was removed from the ascites.

6. Anemia of Chronic Disease: The patient has anemia with low iron, low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), high ferritin, low transferrin receptor (TRF) levels, and normal B12 and folate levels. This suggests anemia of chronic disease.

7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which may contribute to persistent hypotension. Thyroid replacement therapy is being monitored.

8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, which is being managed with home statin therapy.

9. Glycemic Control: The patient requires tight glycemic control with a sliding scale insulin regimen due to stress-dose steroids and TPN.

10. Lines and Prophylaxis: The patient has multiple lines, including a dialysis catheter, PICC line, and arterial line. Prophylaxis measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention."

   hypoxemia and hypercarbia now with respiratory failure despite optimal
   efforts to allow patient to maintain ventilation while extubated.
   Despite 6 liters of negative fluid balance and intermittent BIPAP
   support she now has had progressive respiratory failure.  She remains
   in renal failure requiring dialysis.  In addition, hypotension which
   may well be a combination of impaired venous return and vasodilated
   state is now persistent and requiring vasopressor support.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Acute
   -This is related to chest wall restriction which failed to respond to
   optimal efforts at volume removal.  Weakness certainly may be playing a
   role as well but does not appear to be the primary insult with such
   significant chest wall restriction.  We do have an absence of data to
   determine the optimal PEEP for her support although with capacity to
   wean down FIO2 rapidly certainly some meaningful support has been
   achieved.
   -On rounds (with some cuff leak) there is a suggestion of increased
   PIP
Pplat difference and autoPEEP of 2 which suggestes some possible
   small airways obstruction.
   -Her hypoxemia is likely related to areas of collapse and there is
   significant concern for intermittent aspiration as well.
   -Will need to titrate support as needed over time.
   -Continue with steroid Rx and bronchodilators given suggestion of
   airways obstruction.
   -Some of this may be related to ventilation at decreased lung volumes
   rather than bronchospasm so will have to move to optimize PEEP
   -Trial increase PEEP to 12 and evaluate compliance in an attempt to
   determine the patient
s P/V curve to allow PEEP optimization
   -Ve is elevated but Vd/Vt is likely excessive given RR-25/Vt=400 and
   PCO2=54
this will require continued optimization of pressures at which
   we are ventilating
   -Effusion is under evaluation but do not see clear evidence of effusion
   being a primary driver of failure but will have IP evaluation.
   -Vanco/Zosyn/Fluconazole for possible pulmonary infection.
   -Will evaluate Peos for optimal PEEP
   2)Hypotension
   -Hydrocortisone 50mg q 6 hours
   -Levophed in place and with reasonable support achieved
   -Source remains to be defined definatively
we know there is background
   preserved cardiac function
   -Will need to evaluate CvO2 to aid in definition of support but suspect
   vasodilated state
   -CVL placement today
   3)Renal Failure-_Acute
   -CVVH today given hypotension

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic malignancy and suspected ovarian primary. She has been experiencing respiratory failure due to chest wall restriction, hypoxemia, and hypercarbia despite optimal efforts to maintain ventilation while extubated. The patient also has renal failure requiring dialysis, and hypotension that may be caused by impaired venous return and vasodilation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is primarily related to chest wall restriction, which has not responded to efforts at volume removal. Weakness may also be a contributing factor, although it does not appear to be the primary insult. There is an absence of data to determine the optimal PEEP for her support. The patient's hypoxemia is likely related to areas of collapse, and there is significant concern for intermittent aspiration as well. Continuous optimization of ventilation support will be necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is persistent and requires vasopressor support. The source of hypotension remains undefined, but there is suspicion of a vasodilated state. Further evaluation, including the use of CvO2, is needed to aid in defining the support required.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is in acute renal failure and requires dialysis. CVVH has been initiated due to hypotension.

The patient presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia, which have since been treated with ureteral stent placement and one day of chemotherapy.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient developed a metabolic acidosis upon starting CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) and increased respiratory rate on ventilator settings.

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Respiratory failure: Restrictive physiology given significant
   ascites, pleural effusions likely [**2-22**] underlying malignancy and
   multiple aspiration events. Day 2 of intubation. On starting CVVH
   patient developed a metabolic acidosis, RR increased on vent settings.
   Patient continues to have high plateu pressures, on PEEP 12, RR27 and
   TV 400. Will likely come down on TV today to adjust for increased
   pressures however may need to go up on FIO2 later if patient is not
   oxygenating as well. Pig tail catheter was placed yesterday by IP which
   drained upwards of 4L since placement.  CXR showing placement to be ?
   in the abdomen as the pleural effusions have not improved significantly
   (although it is possible the fluid is reaccumulating as quickly). IP is
   also debating putting in chest tube on opposite side, however it is
   debatable how much difference this will make.
   -no attempt to wean at this time; adjust TV to 350 and monitor. If
   pressures not improved consider decreasing PEEP (currently 12)
   -adjust FIO2 as needed if pt hypoxic on vent
   -CT torso to evaluate placement of L chest tube
   -IP to place R sided chest tube
   -monitor pigtail output
   -continue on vanco, zosyn for 2 week course for HAP
    # Renal failure: Initially ARF now patient on CVVH; adjusted yesterday
   by renal for metabolic acidosis and hypotension.
   -monitor renal recs
   -monitor electrolytes closely
   -fluid restrict given fluid overload state
   -on levophed for hypotension
   -continue fluconazole for urine yeast infection
    #) Hypotension
 Her HD instability is likely related to underlying
   malignancy causing large fluid shifts including pleural effusions and
   ascites. However at this point need to consider other etiologies such
   as tamponade. Patient on levophed, hydrocortisone, new L subclavian
   line for CVP monitoring.
   - CVP, mixed venous sat, PaCO2-PvCO2 to work-up hypotension
   - TTE to r/o tamponade
   - continue hydrocortisone IV 50mg q6h
   -continue levophed and wean as tolerated
   -consider albumin to increase IV volume
   # Malignancy-Patient with presumed metastatic ovarian cancer. 1 dose of
   chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66.
   Tentative plan of second dose 21 days after the first if patient
   responds to first dose after several days. According to oncology,
   patients WBC may not drop for another 10-14days which will indicate
   whether first dose was adequate and/or if treatment is working. At this
   point there is no utility in following further cytology- thus far her
   pleural fluid was consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly
   primary ovarian ca. Onc attending has spoken to family at length and
   they are aware that this is not a curative intervention, rather it may
   help to get her home and prolong life for some number of months. On CT
   being done today will be able to evaluate if mass has changed in size
   since last imaging study earlier on admission.
   -f/u onc recommendations
   -CT scan today
    # Anemia of chronic disease
   - patient is anemic- iron 27 (low), TIBC 173 (low), ferritin 222
   (high), TRF 133 (low), b12 normal, folate normal, consistent with
   anemia of chronic disease
   -continue folic acid IV
    # Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - continue levothyroxine
   # Tachycardia, NSVT- Cardiology consulted and will now sign off as
   patient has been HD stable without recurrence of these episodes.
   Episodes may be correlated to patient being moved, suctioned while on
   vent, or while receiving albuterol nebs.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia.

The patient presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia, and subsequently underwent ureteral stenting. She is currently on pressors and has been intubated for respiratory failure. Her respiratory failure is attributed to restrictive physiology due to significant ascites and pleural effusions, likely secondary to the underlying malignancy.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia of chronic disease, with low iron, TIBC, ferritin, TRF, but normal B12 and folate levels. She also has hypothyroidism, which is being managed with levothyroxine. The patient's hyperlipidemia is being treated with a home statin dose.

The patient's current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and various antibiotics. She is also receiving TPN and IV fluids.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6Â°C (97.8Â°F)
- Heart rate: 90 bpm
- Blood pressure: 99/62 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient experienced an esophageal balloon with high intrathoracic pressure and plateau pressure of 34. A chest tube was placed, and a pigtail catheter was inserted. The patient also has an increased respiratory rate due to low pH, improved blood pressure, and increased bicarbonate on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's allergies include oxycodone, nausea/vomiting, and antibiotics such as fluconazole, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is receiving infusions of fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), and norepinephrine. Other medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and TPN without lipids.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6Â°C (97.8Â°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/62 to 139/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 27, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an ABG indicating pH 7.38, PaCO2 39 mmHg, HCO3- 22 mEq/L, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 290.

The patient's physical examination findings are incomplete, with assessments not performed on peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 30.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 31.4%, platelet count (Plt) at 105 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 2.9 mg/dL, blood glucose at 97 mg/dL, and several other abnormal values indicating possible organ dysfunction.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition via TPN without lipids, glycemic control, lines (including arterial, dialysis, and multi-lumen catheters), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is not mentioned.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic, likely ovarian cancer now with evolution
   of significant respiratory failure and hypotension.  She has had
   drainage of ascitic fluid and drainage of left chest fluid via catheter
   and although there has been significant drainage of fluid from the left
   chest there has been minimal change in the compliance of the
   respiratory system or oxygenation.  In addition she has had persistent
   and signficant hypotension which is likely related to systemic
   inflammatory response and a picture of sepsis.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Have attempted multiple approaches to optimize
   ventilation.  This is likely attributalbe to significant chest wall
   restriction and what was in large part hypercapnic respiratory failure
   and now with associated hypoxemia.  We have been able to provide
   reasonable support with PEEP titration and maintained adequate
   ventilatory support.  Of major concern is the persistent and
   significant elevation in plateau pressures of >40.  This raises some
   significant concern.
   -Will need to decrease Vt to get to Pplat <40 at a minimum
   -Will increase respiratory rate to allow maintenance of adequate
   ventilation with goal 10 lpm
   -Will decrease PEEP only if this maneuver is not effective at achieving
   reduction
   -Will reposition/replace the esophageal balloon to allow adequate
   assessment of trans-pulmonar pressure
   -Keep FIO2
   -Will consider tap or right sided effusion to allow optimization of
   pulmonary mechanics given inability to maintain safe levels of support.
   2)Pleural Effusion-
   -We have catheter in left side of chest with brisk drainage but minimal
   change in pleural effusion size.  This may represent drainage of
   briskly accumulating effusion, it would be important to maintain a
   clear documentation of the tube placement
   -Maintain on water seal
   -Chest/Abd CT to evaluate nature of restriction and placement of the
   left sided chest tube
   -Disucssion with IP of placement of right sided chest tube
   2)Hypotension-We have persistent hypotension and CVP and Cvo2 will be
   essential to follow for consideration of source and treatment.
   Hydrocortisone and Levophed in place for support.
   -Will need to determine CvO2 and CVP to evaluate contribution from all
   possible sources of sepsis
   -Intervention based upon findings will hopefully allow wean of
   levophed.
   3)Renal Failure-
   -CVVH to continue
   -Appreciate renal support
   -Goal is to maintain negative fluid balance as possible
   3)Ovarian Cancer-
   -Appreciate oncology support
   -Will consider timing of further chemotherapy but will have to await
   nadir of counts to consider if aequate dosing has been completed for
   chemotherapy Rx to consider therapeutic response.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer who is currently experiencing significant respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has undergone drainage of ascitic fluid and left chest fluid via catheter, but there has been minimal change in the compliance of the respiratory system or oxygenation.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure:
- The patient is experiencing significant respiratory failure due to chest wall restriction and hypercapnic respiratory failure.
- Ventilatory support has been maintained, but there is a concern about the persistent and significant elevation in plateau pressures (>40).
- Decreasing the tidal volume (Vt) is recommended to reduce plateau pressures below 40.
- Increasing the respiratory rate to maintain adequate ventilation is advised, with a goal of 10 L/min.
- Decreasing PEEP should only be done if the above maneuvers do not effectively reduce plateau pressures.
- Repositioning or replacing the esophageal balloon is necessary to allow adequate assessment of trans-pulmonary pressures.
- Maintaining FiO2 is essential for oxygenation support.

2. Pleural Effusion:
- The patient has a left-sided pleural effusion, which is being drained via catheter.
- Minimal change in pleural effusion size has been observed despite brisk drainage.
- Maintaining water seal and chest/abdomen CT to evaluate the nature of restriction and placement of the left-sided chest tube are"

The patient also has persistent and significant hypotension, likely related to systemic inflammatory response and sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation. This can be due to various factors such as infection, pulmonary embolism, or worsening of underlying lung disease.

2. Sepsis: The patient's signs of systemic inflammatory response and hypotension suggest ongoing sepsis. If not promptly and effectively managed, sepsis can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock, which can have life-threatening consequences.

3. Ovarian Cancer: The patient's metastatic ovarian cancer may continue to progress, leading to further complications and deterioration in her overall condition. This can result in increased pain, organ dysfunction, and reduced quality of life.

4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has an imbalance in fluid intake and output, as indicated by the negative fluid balance. This can lead to dehydration or fluid overload, affecting her cardiovascular stability and organ function.

5. Pressure Ulcers: Prolonged immobility and sedation can increase the"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Respiratory failure: Restrictive physiology given significant
   ascites, pleural effusions likely [**2-22**] underlying malignancy and
   multiple aspiration events. Day 2 of intubation. On starting CVVH
   patient developed a metabolic acidosis, RR increased on vent settings.
   Patient continues to have high plateu pressures, on PEEP 12, RR27 and
   TV 400. Will likely come down on TV today to adjust for increased
   pressures however may need to go up on FIO2 later if patient is not
   oxygenating as well. Pig tail catheter was placed yesterday by IP which
   drained upwards of 4L since placement.  CXR showing placement to be ?
   in the abdomen as the pleural effusions have not improved significantly
   (although it is possible the fluid is reaccumulating as quickly). IP is
   also debating putting in chest tube on opposite side, however it is
   debatable how much difference this will make.
   -no attempt to wean at this time; adjust TV to 350 and monitor. If
   pressures not improved consider decreasing PEEP (currently 12)
   -adjust FIO2 as needed if pt hypoxic on vent
   -CT torso to evaluate placement of L chest tube
   -IP to place R sided chest tube
   -monitor pigtail output
   -continue on vanco, zosyn for 2 week course for HAP
    # Renal failure: Initially ARF now patient on CVVH; adjusted yesterday
   by renal for metabolic acidosis and hypotension.
   -monitor renal recs
   -monitor electrolytes closely
   -fluid restrict given fluid overload state
   -on levophed for hypotension
   -continue fluconazole for urine yeast infection
    #) Hypotension
 Her HD instability is likely related to underlying
   malignancy causing large fluid shifts including pleural effusions and
   ascites. However at this point need to consider other etiologies such
   as tamponade. Patient on levophed, hydrocortisone, new L subclavian
   line for CVP monitoring.
   - CVP, mixed venous sat, PaCO2-PvCO2 to work-up hypotension
   - TTE to r/o tamponade
   - continue hydrocortisone IV 50mg q6h
   -continue levophed and wean as tolerated
   -consider albumin to increase IV volume
   # Malignancy-Patient with presumed metastatic ovarian cancer. 1 dose of
   chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66.
   Tentative plan of second dose 21 days after the first if patient
   responds to first dose after several days. According to oncology,
   patients WBC may not drop for another 10-14days which will indicate
   whether first dose was adequate and/or if treatment is working. At this
   point there is no utility in following further cytology- thus far her
   pleural fluid was consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly
   primary ovarian ca. Onc attending has spoken to family at length and
   they are aware that this is not a curative intervention, rather it may
   help to get her home and prolong life for some number of months. On CT
   being done today will be able to evaluate if mass has changed in size
   since last imaging study earlier on admission.
   -f/u onc recommendations
   -CT scan today
    # Anemia of chronic disease
   - patient is anemic- iron 27 (low), TIBC 173 (low), ferritin 222
   (high), TRF 133 (low), b12 normal, folate normal, consistent with
   anemia of chronic disease
   -continue folic acid IV
    # Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - continue levothyroxine
   # Tachycardia, NSVT- Cardiology consulted and will now sign off as
   patient has been HD stable without recurrence of these episodes.
   Episodes may be correlated to patient being moved, suctioned while on
   vent, or while receiving albuterol nebs.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, renal failure, hypotension, and anasarca. 

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to restrictive physiology caused by significant ascites, pleural effusions likely related to underlying malignancy, and multiple aspiration events. She has been intubated for two days and is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient's renal failure initially presented as acute renal failure (ARF) and has now progressed to chronic renal failure. She is being treated with CVVH to manage her renal function and electrolyte imbalances.

Hypotension is a concern for the patient, and her hemodynamic instability is likely related to underlying malignancy causing large fluid shifts including pleural effusions and ascites. However, other potential etiologies such as tamponade need to be considered. She is currently on levophed and hydrocortisone.

The patient has metastatic ovarian cancer and has received one dose of chemotherapy with carboplatin. The plan is to administer the second dose in 21 days if the patient responds well to the first dose.

The patient also has anemia of chronic disease, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and tachycardia with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT)."

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Respiratory failure: Restrictive physiology given effusions, ascities
   and massive anasarca. Patient respiratory status slowly improving, now
   with lower PEEP and Plateau pressures. CXR looks much improved after
   draining both sides of chests, but now looks similar to yesterday. Lung
   parenchyma looks clear. Balance yesterday was positive since patient
   received fluid for increase CVP.
   -Decrease sedation
   -Monitor secretions
   -Wean from ventilatior to pressure support if possible
   -Clamp chest tube (right)
   -Start meropenem for ESBL enterobacter
   #) Hypotension
 Patient has been ruled out multiple times for
   myocardial ischemia and has an echocargriogram with good EF showing
   hyperdynamic heart. Patient with negative cultures and the only
   bacteria we have is ESBL enterobacter in sputum to explain sepsis. No
   signs of PE to explain obstructive physiology (or PTX, pericardial
   effusion). CVP increased to 14 with lower PEEP. Patient requiring less
   levophed than yesterday.
   -Try to wean down levophed
   -RBCs today
   - continue hydrocortisone IV 50mg q6h
   -Blood cultures
   -Start meropenem
   -Stop Zosyn
    # Renal failure: Initially ARF now patient on CVVH; adjusted yesterday
   by renal for metabolic acidosis and hypotension. Unclear etiology of
   hematuria/erythrocyturia.
   -monitor renal recs
   -monitor electrolytes closely
   -fluid restrict given fluid overload state
   -on levophed for hypotension
   -continue fluconazole for urine yeast infection
   # Malignancy- Patient with presumed metastatic ovarian cancer. 1 dose
   of chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66.
   Tentative plan of second dose 21 days after the first if patient
   responds to first dose after several days. According to oncology,
   patients WBC may not drop for another 10-14days which will indicate
   whether first dose was adequate and/or if treatment is working. At this
   point there is no utility in following further cytology- thus far her
   pleural fluid was consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly
   primary ovarian ca. Onc attending has spoken to family at length and
   they are aware that this is not a curative intervention, rather it may
   help to get her home and prolong life for some number of months. On CT
   being done today will be able to evaluate if mass has changed in size
   since last imaging study earlier on admission.
   -f/u onc recommendations
   -F/u CT scan report
    # Anemia of chronic disease; renal failure and blood loss in urine.
   -continue folic acid IV
   -Transfuse 1 RBC today and follw HCT
    # Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - continue levothyroxine
   #. Hyperlipidemia - cont home statin dose

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint includes hypotension, renal failure, ascites, and anasarca. 

The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments. A chest tube was placed due to air in the diaphragm, leading to the removal of air from the peritoneal cavity. The patient also has a right chest tube inserted. 

The patient is on various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and prophylactic antibiotics. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/62 to 147/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure due to restrictive physiology caused by effusions, ascites, and massive anasarca. The patient's respiratory status has slowly improved, and the chest X-ray shows improvement after draining both sides of the chest. 

The patient is also diagnosed with hypotension, which has been ruled out for myocardial ischemia, and no signs of pulmonary embolism or pericardial effusion have been found.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with ovarian cancer and acute renal failure who is currently in the ICU. She has been intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure and is on CVVH. The patient has undergone several procedures including the placement of a chest tube, pigtail catheter, and ureteral stent. She is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors. Her vital signs show hypotension, elevated CVP, and decreased urine output. She has a history of nausea and vomiting, and her blood cultures are positive for ESBL-producing organisms. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated WBC count, creatinine, and lactate levels. She is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and various prophylactic treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to prolonged intubation and the presence of fluid overload, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and cultures is necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin should be continued.
3. Infection: The positive blood cultures for ESBL-producing organisms indicate a possible infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on culture sensitivity results.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with ovarian cancer and acute renal failure who has been receiving chemotherapy. She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes an incorrectly placed chest tube in the abdomen, which was later repositioned into the thorax, as well as the placement of a pigtail catheter on the right side for drainage. She is also on levophed for hypertensive urgency.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 69 beats per minute, a blood pressure range of 94/56-147/86 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute (due to intubation), and an oxygen saturation of 100%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) is 7.2 L/min, and mixed venous oxygen saturation is 74%. Fluid balance indicates an input of 8,612 mL and an output of 8,087 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 525 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 350 mL, respiratory rate set at 25 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) values show pH 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide"

   # Respiratory failure: Restrictive physiology given effusions, ascities
   and massive anasarca. Patient respiratory status slowly improving, now
   with lower PEEP and Plateau pressures. CXR looks much improved after
   draining both sides of chests, but now looks similar to yesterday. Lung
   parenchyma looks clear. Balance yesterday was positive since patient
   received fluid for increase CVP.
   -Decrease sedation
   -Monitor secretions
   -Wean from ventilatior to pressure support if possible
   -Clamp chest tube (right)
   -Start meropenem for ESBL enterobacter
   #) Hypotension
 Patient has been ruled out multiple times for
   myocardial ischemia and has an echocargriogram with good EF showing
   hyperdynamic heart. Patient with negative cultures and the only
   bacteria we have is ESBL enterobacter in sputum to explain sepsis. No
   signs of PE to explain obstructive physiology (or PTX, pericardial
   effusion). CVP increased to 14 with lower PEEP. Patient requiring less
   levophed than yesterday.
   -Try to wean down levophed
   -RBCs today
   - continue hydrocortisone IV 50mg q6h
   -Blood cultures
   -Start meropenem
   -Stop Zosyn
    # Renal failure: Initially ARF now patient on CVVH; adjusted yesterday
   by renal for metabolic acidosis and hypotension. Unclear etiology of
   hematuria/erythrocyturia.
   -monitor renal recs
   -monitor electrolytes closely
   -fluid restrict given fluid overload state
   -on levophed for hypotension
   -continue fluconazole for urine yeast infection
   # Malignancy- Patient with presumed metastatic ovarian cancer. 1 dose
   of chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66.
   Tentative plan of second dose 21 days after the first if patient
   responds to first dose after several days. According to oncology,
   patients WBC may not drop for another 10-14days which will indicate
   whether first dose was adequate and/or if treatment is working. At this
   point there is no utility in following further cytology- thus far her
   pleural fluid was consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly
   primary ovarian ca. Onc attending has spoken to family at length and
   they are aware that this is not a curative intervention, rather it may
   help to get her home and prolong life for some number of months. On CT
   being done today will be able to evaluate if mass has changed in size
   since last imaging study earlier on admission.
   -f/u onc recommendations
   -F/u CT scan report
    # Anemia of chronic disease; renal failure and blood loss in urine.
   -continue folic acid IV

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. She has a history of hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia. The patient presented with acute renal failure (ARF) and hyperkalemia. She has been on pressors and has undergone ureteral stenting. Her respiratory status is slowly improving, with lower PEEP and plateau pressures. The CXR shows improvement after draining both sides of the chest, with clear lung parenchyma. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's restrictive physiology is due to effusions, ascites, and massive anasarca. There is a need to monitor secretions, wean from ventilation to pressure support if possible, clamp chest tube (right), and start meropenem for ESBL enterobacter.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been ruled out for myocardial ischemia and has an echocardiogram with good EF showing hyperdynamic heart. She requires less levophed than yesterday. The plan is to try to wean down levophed, give RBCs today, continue hydrocortisone IV 50mg q6h, get blood cultures, start meropenem, and stop Zosyn.

3. Renal failure: Initially ARF, the patient is now on CVVH. It was adjusted"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese male with acute renal failure (ARF). Oxygenation has improved, and the patient is now on pressure support ventilation with a set tidal volume of 350 mL and spontaneous tidal volume of 370 mL. The patient's heart rate is within normal limits, but blood pressure is slightly low. The respiratory rate is within normal range, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal limits, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 10,634 mL and total output of 10,419 mL over the past 24 hours. Urine output is only 45 mL, which is concerning for possible acute kidney injury. The patient's weight has increased from 98.9 kg at admission to 107.3 kg currently.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including midazolam (versed), norepinephrine, insulin, and heparin. The patient has a history of allergies to oxycodone and nausea/vomiting.

The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, and fluid balance are stable. However, the low urine output and elevated creatinine levels indicate ongoing kidney dysfunction. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range except for a slightly low calcium level.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output and elevated"

   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Respiratory failure: Restrictive physiology due to effusions,
   ascities and anasarca, that have improved after parasentesis, pleural
   fluid drained with chest tube, as well as ascities drainage. Patient
   O2 requirements much more imprioved.

   Tentative plan of second dose 21 days after the first if patient
   responds to first dose after several days. According to oncology,
   patients WBC may not drop for another 10-14days which will indicate
   whether first dose was adequate and/or if treatment is working. At this
   point there is no utility in following further cytology- thus far her
   pleural fluid was consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly
   primary ovarian ca. Onc attending has spoken to family at length and
   they are aware that this is not a curative intervention, rather it may
   help to get her home and prolong life for some number of months. On CT

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer who was admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. She presented initially with acute renal failure (ARF) and hyperkalemia, which improved after ureteral stent placement. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support, off pressors, and receiving chemotherapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's restrictive physiology due to effusions, ascites, and anasarca has improved after pleural fluid drainage with a chest tube and ascites drainage. However, she may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying conditions.
2. Hypotension: The patient was previously hypotensive but is now off pressors with borderline blood pressure. Monitoring her blood pressure and checking for any signs of infection or other causes of hypotension is essential.
3. Renal Failure: The patient initially presented with ARF, which has been managed with continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). She also has anemia of chronic disease, renal failure, and blood loss in urine.
4. Malignancy: The patient has presumed metastatic ovarian cancer and received one dose of chemotherapy. Further doses will depend on her response and WBC count. Monitoring her oncology recommendations and CT scan report is important.
5. Hypothyroid"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic malignancy and likely ovarian primary who
   has had evolution of significant sepsis and respiratory failure.  With
   support of ventilation, removal of fluid via catheter drainage and
   paracentesis and support of blood pressure she has shown some clinical
   improvement in capacity to support her respiratory failure and sepsis.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Will check RSBI
   -Will minimize sedation to allow trial
   -PSV wean  has been successful
   -SBT if RSBI favorable
   -Will need to maintain adequate control of pleural fluid volumes to
   maintain chance of extubation optimally.  In addition, patient will
   need to maintain improve mental status to allow adequate stability for
   extubation
   2)Sepsis-Levophed requirements continue and has persistent sepsis.
   -CVP=12
   -Cultures negative
   -Levophed to continue as needed to maintain MAP
   -Meropenem to continue
   -[**Month (only) 51**] be need for continued volume support and will keep overall fluid
   balance even.
   -Hydrocortisone continuing
will wean down
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   CVVH given hemodynamic instability
   4)Malignant Neoplasm-
   -Will have to consider further chemotherapy in discussion with oncology
   -Do not have evidence of nadir from chemo at this time.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic malignancy and likely ovarian primary who has had an evolution of significant sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.5 C (97.7 F) with a maximum recorded temperature of 35.9 C (96.6 F)
- Heart rate: 90 bpm with a range of 72-99 bpm
- Blood pressure: 116/65 mmHg with a range of 86/52-122/77 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute with a range of 2-26 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on supplemental oxygen

The patient's laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: 21.8 K/uL
- Hemoglobin: 10.1 g/dL
- Sodium: 154 mg/dL
- Potassium: 4.0 mEq/L
- Creatinine: 1.5 mg/dL

- Lactic acid: 2.2 mmol/L
- Albumin: 1.5 g/dL
- Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 1.5 mg/dL
- Phosphate: 2.1 mg/dL

The patient has multiple lines and tubes in place, including an arterial line, central venous catheter, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen catheter. She is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (meropenem), vasopressors (norepinephrine), insulin, and hydrocortisone.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and efforts are being made to minimize sedation to allow for a trial of spontaneous breathing. The patient's readiness for extubation will depend on her ability to maintain adequate respiratory function without mechanical support.
2. Sepsis: The patient continues to show signs of sepsis despite receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy. Her Levophed requirements indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability, and she will require continued volume support and hemodynamic monitoring.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to acute renal failure.
4. Malignant Neoplasm: The patient's underlying malignancy requires further discussion regarding chemotherapy treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic malignancy and likely ovarian primary who
   has had evolution of significant sepsis and respiratory failure.  With
   support of ventilation, removal of fluid via catheter drainage and
   paracentesis and support of blood pressure she has shown some clinical
   improvement in capacity to support her respiratory failure and sepsis.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Will check RSBI
   -Will minimize sedation to allow trial
   -PSV wean  has been successful
   -SBT if RSBI favorable
   -Will need to maintain adequate control of pleural fluid volumes to
   maintain chance of extubation optimally.  In addition, patient will
   need to maintain improve mental status to allow adequate stability for
   extubation
   2)Sepsis-Levophed requirements continue and has persistent sepsis.
   -CVP=12
   -Cultures negative
   -Levophed to continue as needed to maintain MAP
   -Meropenem to continue
   -[**Month (only) 51**] be need for continued volume support and will keep overall fluid
   balance even.
   -Hydrocortisone continuing
will wean down
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   CVVH given hemodynamic instability
   4)Malignant Neoplasm-
   -Will have to consider further chemotherapy in discussion with oncology
   -Do not have evidence of nadir from chemo at this time.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic malignancy and likely ovarian primary who has had significant sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory support has been transitioned to pressure support ventilation (PSV), and she is tolerating it well. The plan is to continue monitoring the respiratory system and minimize sedation to allow for a trial of spontaneous breathing. If the respiratory system is stable, a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) may be performed. It is important to maintain adequate control of pleural fluid volumes to maintain the chance of extubation optimally.
2. Sepsis: The patient continues to require norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP). Cultures have been negative, and meropenem will be continued. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is at 12, indicating fluid balance needs to be maintained.
3. Acute Renal Failure: Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been initiated due to hemodynamic instability.
4. Malignant Neoplasm: Further chemotherapy will need to be considered in discussion with oncology. There is currently no evidence of nadir from chemotherapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
    # Respiratory failure: Likely secondary initially to restrictive
   physiology due to effusions, ascities and anasarca, that have improved
   after parasentesis, pleural fluid drained with chest tube, as well as
   ascities drainage. Patient
s now s/p intubation with improved
   oxygenation.
   -Monitor secretions
   - chest tube (right) is not putting out much, left chest tube continues
   to put out large volumes of fluid
   - f/u with IR recs regarding plans for continued drainage
   -Continue meropenem for [**Month/Day (2) 1899**] enterobacter
   - nebs PRN
   #) Hypotension
 Patient off pressors now, with good blood pressures.
   Negative cultures so far and only culture data is from sputum growing
   [**Month/Day (2) 1899**] enterobacter and urine in the yeast. No signs of PE explaining
   obstructive physiology. Concern for aspiration pneumonia now has
   completed 7+ day course of vancomycin, switched to meropenem with new
   data for [**Last Name (LF) 1899**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] continue for now
   - Monitor BP
   - d/c fluconazole as has completed course for fungiuria
   - weaning stress dose steroids, now on day 2 of 25 IV q 6, would plan
   to keep for 4 days total before wean furthur
    # Renal failure: Initially ARF now patient on CVVH has been running
   even likely secondary to ATN, does not appear to be reversible..
   Unclear etiology of hematuria/erythrocyturia.
   -discussed with renal this AM plan to transition care to HD so that
   patient can leave ICU, as currently only thing keeping patient here is
   CVVH. As previously had hypotension in the setting of HD, and just came
   off of pressors yesterday, suspect that makes sense to wait to
   reinitiate HD.
   - plan for HD Monday 6 am then monitor BP and if stable would transfer
   to OMED for furthur care, cont CVVH until Monday
   -monitor electrolytes closely
   -fluid restrict given fluid overload state
    # Malignancy- Patient with presumed metastatic ovarian cancer. 1 dose
   of chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66.
   Unclear when second dose would be. At this point there is no utility in
   following further cytology- thus far her pleural fluid was consistent
   with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly primary ovarian ca. Onc
   attending has spoken to family at length and they are aware that this
   is not a curative intervention, rather it may help to get her home and
   prolong life for some number of months.
   - plan for repeat CT chest [**10-15**]
   - appreciate onc meeting yesterday with family and primary care to
   emphasize that prognosis is grave and that do not suspect that
   repeating chemo will make a difference
   - family continues to hope that chemo is the answer
   - discussed with renal this morning, that if patient cannot be
   transitioned to HD effectively than would like to consider that
   continued CVVH may be medically futile
   - would consider ethics consult as family is somewhat unreceptive to
   primary team, and does not appear to understand long term prognosis of
   patient
   # Anemia of chronic disease; renal failure and blood loss in urine.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and required intubation, but was successfully extubated yesterday. The patient is alert and awake now. She experienced an episode of chest pain, anxiety, and hypertension yesterday, which led to subjective shortness of breath. An EKG showed no changes, and the patient was given morphine for pain relief. The dose of steroids was decreased from 50 q6 to 25 q6. The patient is currently running on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) with the goal of getting her off CVVH.

 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2138-10-10**] 02:45 PM
   s/p extubation successful yesterday. patient is alert, awake now.
   episode of chest pain, anxiety and hypertension yesterday with SBP in
   160s that led to subjective shortness of breath. EKG looked unchanaged.
   given morphine 2 mg for pain with good effect. Decreased steroid dose
   yesterday to 25 q6 (from 50 q 6). Meeting yesterday with oncology and
   family explained that if doesn't improve within 1 week that likely very

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
   # Respiratory failure: Restrictive physiology due to effusions,
   ascities and anasarca, that have improved after parasentesis, pleural
   fluid drained with chest tube, as well as ascities drainage. Patient
   O2 requirements much more imprioved now s/p extubation
   -Monitor secretions
   -Clamp chest tube (right), left chest tube continues to put out large
   volumes of fluid
   - f/u with IR recs regarding plans for continued drainage
   -Continue meropenem for ESBL enterobacter
   - nebs PRN
   #) Hypotension
 Patient off pressors now, with borderline blood
   pressure. Negative cultures so far and only culture data is from sputum
   growing ESBL enterobacter. No signs of PE explaining obstructive
   physiology.
   - Monitor BP
   -F/u Blood cultures
   -Continue meropenem, on fluconazole for fungiuria
   # Renal failure: Initially ARF now patient on CVVH; adjusted yesterday
   by renal for metabolic acidosis and hypotension. Unclear etiology of
   hematuria/erythrocyturia.
   -monitor renal recs
   -monitor electrolytes closely
   -fluid restrict given fluid overload state
   -no longer on levofed
   - consider switching patient back to HD now that off pressors and no
   longer intubated
   # Malignancy- Patient with presumed metastatic ovarian cancer. 1 dose
   of chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66.
   Tentative plan of second dose 21 days after the first if patient
   responds to first dose after several days. According to oncology,
   patients WBC may not drop for another 10-14days which will indicate
   whether first dose was adequate and/or if treatment is working. At this
   point there is no utility in following further cytology- thus far her
   pleural fluid was consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly
   primary ovarian ca. Onc attending has spoken to family at length and
   they are aware that this is not a curative intervention, rather it may
   help to get her home and prolong life for some number of months. On CT
   being done today will be able to evaluate if mass has changed in size
   since last imaging study earlier on admission.
   -f/u onc recommendations
   -most recent CT scan: IMPRESSION: 1. ET tube in right main stem
   bronchus as discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1478**] on the day
   of the study. 2. Left PICC tip is in the right ventricle. 3. Multiple
   areas of patchy opacity in the right upper and lower lobes as
   well as some new nodules, most likely infection or aspiration. Suggest
   close attention on follow-up.
   4. Left-sided pigtail catheter tip is in the peritoneal space;
   previously it appeared to be pleural.
   5. Right greater than left pleural effusion. 6. Multiple bulky
   mesenteric nodes in the abdomen which are not significantly changed
   from prior study.
   7. Diffuse anasarca.
   # Anemia of chronic disease; renal failure and blood loss in urine.
   -continue folic acid IV
    # Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer who is currently in the ICU. She was admitted for respiratory distress and intubated but has since been extubated. The patient's medical history includes hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia. She presented with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia, for which she underwent ureteral stenting. The patient received one dose of chemotherapy and is expected to receive another dose in 21 days if she responds well to the first dose. Her current condition includes respiratory failure due to effusions, hypotension, renal failure, malignancy, anemia of chronic disease, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's restrictive physiology is caused by effusions, ascites, and anasarca. These conditions have improved after paracentesis, pleural fluid drainage with a chest tube, and ascites drainage. However, the patient still has ongoing fluid drainage from the left chest tube, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.

2. Hypotension: The patient was previously on pressors but is now off them. Her blood pressure is borderline. Negative cultures have been obtained so far, and there are no signs of pulmonary embolism explaining the obstructive physiology. Monitoring the patient's blood pressure and continuing meropenem for ESBL enterobacter are recommended.

3. Renal failure: Initially, the patient had acute renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
    # Respiratory failure: Patient with baseline restrictive physiology
   due to effusions, ascities, anasarca, with resolving aspiration
   pneumonia s/p bilateral chest tube placement and successful extubation
   on [**10-10**] now reintubated secondary to hypercarbia, acidemia and
   respiratory distress. Most likely etiology is that patient has been
   tiring out since extubation. During rounds, nursing reported patient
   L chest tube was putting out 150-300cc/hr. There is still question if
   tube is in peritoneum
   -Suction and nebs prn
   - R chest tube with minimal output, could be d/c
   - f/u with IR recs regarding plans for continued drainage
   -Continue meropenem for ESBL enterobacter
   -At this point if patient fails extubation or is kept intubated for
   several days she may need a trach. This should be discussed with family
   at next meeting.
   #) Hypotension
 Patient is currently on pressors since intubation and
   attempted to be weaned off. Negative cultures so far and only culture
   data is from sputum growing ESBL enterobacter and urine in the yeast.
   Concern for aspiration pneumonia now has completed 7+ day course of
   vancomycin, switched to meropenem with new data for ESBL(day
   1=[**2138-10-9**]), will continue for now. It is likely her hypotension is
   secondary to malignancy and rapid fluid shifts out of the IV space.
   Other etiologies such as sepsis are also possible.
   - Monitor BP, fluid bolus if needed but w/caution given fluid overload
   -On CVVH, with attempt to keep even or slightly + for now.
   - stress dose steroids, now on day 3 of 25 IV q 6, one more day then
   titrate down
    # Renal failure: Initially ARF now patient on CVVH has been running
   even likely secondary to ATN, does not appear to be reversible. Given
   patient
s long-standing dependence on CVVH and HD, will need to assess
   what our end-point is. Given her reintubation today, will continue CVVH
   for now and touch base with renal to see if HD is still possible, which
   seems unlikely given hypotension/pressor dependence.
   -discussed with renal this AM plan to transition care to HD tomorrow
   however given re-intubation will need to reassess goals
   -monitor electrolytes closely
   -monitor fluids,
    # Malignancy- Patient with presumed metastatic ovarian cancer. 1 dose
   of chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66.
   Unclear when second dose would be. At this point there is no utility in
   following further cytology- thus far her pleural fluid was consistent
   with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly primary ovarian ca. Onc
   attending has spoken to family at length and they are aware that this
   is not a curative intervention, rather it may help to get her home and
   prolong life for some number of months.
   - plan for repeat CT chest 9/24 per onc
   - family continues to hope that chemo is the answer
   - would consider ethics consult as family is somewhat unreceptive to
   primary team, and does not appear to understand long term prognosis of
   patient
   # Anemia of chronic disease; renal failure and blood loss in urine.
   -continue folic acid IV
    # Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - continue levothyroxine
   - recheck TFTs on [**10-13**] per endo recs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer. She has been admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension, renal failure, anemia of chronic disease, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and febrile neutropenia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is reintubated due to hypercarbia, acidemia, and respiratory distress. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia, and it is recommended to suction and nebulize the patient as needed. The possibility of a tracheostomy may be considered if the patient fails extubation or needs prolonged intubation.

2. Hypotension: The patient is on pressors since intubation and has negative cultures so far. She has completed a 7-day course of vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia and has switched to meropenem for ESBL enterobacter. The hypotension may be secondary to malignancy and rapid fluid shifts out of the IV space. Other etiologies such as sepsis are also possible. Close monitoring of blood pressure and cautious fluid administration are advised.

3. Renal failure: The patient initially presented with acute renal failure (ARF) and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH)."

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**]
   transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral stenting and
   possible palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**] ARF and
   hyperkalemia now s/p ureteral stent and one day of chemotherapy.  PMH
   includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
    # Respiratory failure: Patient with baseline restrictive physiology
   due to effusions, ascities, anasarca, with resolving aspiration
   pneumonia s/p bilateral chest tube placement and successful extubation
   on [**10-10**] now reintubated secondary to hypercarbia, acidemia and
   respiratory distress.
   -Suction and nebs prn
   - R chest tube with minimal output, could be d/c
   - f/u with IR recs regarding plans for continued drainage
   -Continue meropenem for [**Month/Year (2) 1899**] enterobacter
   #) Hypotension
 Patient off pressors now, with good blood pressures.
   Negative cultures so far and only culture data is from sputum growing
   [**Month/Year (2) 1899**] enterobacter and urine in the yeast. No signs of PE explaining
   obstructive physiology. Concern for aspiration pneumonia now has
   completed 7+ day course of vancomycin, switched to meropenem with new
   data for [**Last Name (LF) 1899**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] continue for now
   - Monitor BP, fluid bolus if needed but w/caution given fluid overload
   - d/c fluconazole as has completed course for fungiuria
   - weaning stress dose steroids, now on day 3 of 25 IV q 6, one more day
   then titrate down
    # Renal failure: Initially ARF now patient on CVVH has been running
   even likely secondary to ATN, does not appear to be reversible. Unclear
   etiology of hematuria/erythrocyturia. Likely d/c CVVH and start HD
   tomorrow.
   -discussed with renal this AM plan to transition care to HD so that
   patient can leave ICU, as currently only thing keeping patient here is
   CVVH. As previously had hypotension in the setting of HD, and just came
   off of pressors yesterday, suspect that makes sense to wait to
   reinitiate HD.
   - plan for HD Monday 6 am then monitor BP and if stable would transfer
   to OMED for furthur care, cont CVVH until Monday
   -monitor electrolytes closely
   -fluid restrict given fluid overload state
    # Malignancy- Patient with presumed metastatic ovarian cancer. 1 dose
   of chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66.
   Unclear when second dose would be. At this point there is no utility in
   following further cytology- thus far her pleural fluid was consistent
   with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly primary ovarian ca. Onc
   attending has spoken to family at length and they are aware that this
   is not a curative intervention, rather it may help to get her home and
   prolong life for some number of months.
   - plan for repeat CT chest 9/24 per onc
   - appreciate onc meeting yesterday with family and primary care to
   emphasize that prognosis is grave and that do not suspect that
   repeating chemo will make a difference
   - family continues to hope that chemo is the answer
   - discussed with renal this morning, that if patient cannot be
   transitioned to HD effectively than would like to consider that
   continued CVVH may be medically futile
   - would consider ethics consult as family is somewhat unreceptive to
   primary team, and does not appear to understand long term prognosis of
   patient
   # Anemia of chronic disease; renal failure and blood loss in urine.
   -continue folic acid IV
    # Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - continue levothyroxine
   - recheck TFTs on [**10-13**] per endo recs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She has been admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and possible palliative chemotherapy. The patient's medical history includes hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, hypotension, renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and anemia of chronic disease. The patient also has a history of hyperkalemia, but it seems to be under control.

The patient is currently on multiple medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, acyclovir, fluconazole, vancomycin, meropenem, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, lorazepam, and folic acid.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, and complications related to her malignancy. The patient's overall prognosis is grave, and there may be discussions regarding the futility of certain treatments and end-of-life care."

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with thought metastatic ovarian cancer (no biopsy yet) on pressors
   and [**Hospital 1460**] transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral
   stenting. She got palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**].
   PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
    # Respiratory failure: Patient with baseline restrictive physiology
   due to effusions, ascities, anasarca, with resolving aspiration
   pneumonia s/p bilateral chest tube placement and successful extubation
   on [**10-10**] now reintubated secondary to hypercarbia, acidemia and
   respiratory distress. Most likely etiology is that patient has been
   tiring out since extubation. Patient at baseline has very low tidal
   volume (~300cc), which may cause baseline hypercarbia.
   -Suction and nebs prn
   - R chest tube with minimal output, could be d/c
d today.
   - f/u with IR recs regarding plans for continued drainage
   -Continue meropenem for ESBL enterobacter (Day [**4-29**])
   # Hypotension
 Patient is currently on pressors since intubation and
   attempted to be weaned off. Negative cultures so far and only culture
   data is from sputum growing ESBL enterobacter and urine in the yeast.
   Concern for aspiration pneumonia now has completed 7+ day course of
   vancomycin, switched to meropenem with new data for ESBL(day
   1=[**2138-10-9**]), will continue for now. It is likely her hypotension is
   secondary to malignancy and rapid fluid shifts out of the IV space.
   Other etiologies such as sepsis are also possible.
   -Try to wean from pressors; however if patient switched to HD may
   require further pressor support (patient on CVVH for 3 weeks)
   - Monitor BP, fluid bolus if needed but w/caution given fluid overload
   - stress dose steroids, now on day 3 of 25 IV q 6, titrate down today
    # Renal failure: Initially ARF now patient on CVVH has been running
   even likely secondary to ATN, does not appear to be reversible. Given
   patient
s long-standing dependence on CVVH and HD, will need to assess
   what our end-point is. Given her reintubation today, will continue CVVH
   for now and touch base with renal to see if HD is still possible, which
   seems unlikely given hypotension/pressor dependence.
   -discussed with renal this AM plan to transition care to HD tomorrow
   however given re-intubation will need to reassess goals
   -monitor electrolytes closely
   -monitor fluids,
    # Malignancy- Patient with presumed metastatic ovarian cancer. 1 dose
   of chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66.
   Unclear when second dose would be. At this point there is no utility in
   following further cytology- thus far her pleural fluid was consistent
   with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly primary ovarian ca. Onc
   attending has spoken to family at length and they are aware that this
   is not a curative intervention, rather it may help to get her home and
   prolong life for some number of months.
   - plan for repeat CT chest 9/24 per onc
   - family continues to hope that chemo is the answer
   - [**Hospital3 1956**] oncology team consult
   - Family meeting must be planned with all teams together, since
   patients getting different information from different teams. This also
   may help with goals of care.
   # Anemia of chronic disease; renal failure and blood loss in urine.
   -continue folic acid in TPN
    # Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - continue levothyroxine
   - TSH slightly high, may need increase in levothyroxine. Will check
   with endocrine.

 Not on statin, since patient not getting anything

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypothyroidism, and atherosclerotic heart disease. She was admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and received palliative chemotherapy. The patient presented to the emergency department on [**2-22**] with respiratory failure, hypotension, and renal failure. She was initially intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been on pressors since intubation and attempted to be weaned off. Negative cultures have been obtained so far, with only one positive culture growing ESBL enterobacter from the sputum and yeast from the urine. The patient has completed a 7-day course of vancomycin and switched to meropenem due to new data indicating ESBL production. Hypotension is likely secondary to malignancy and rapid fluid shifts out of the IV space, but other etiologies such as sepsis are also possible.

The patient's renal function initially presented as acute renal failure (ARF) but has now progressed to chronic renal failure, with the patient being on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for the past three weeks. The renal team is planning to transition care to hemodialysis (HD) tomorrow, but this may be reassessed given the recent reintubation.

The patient has been diagnosed with metastatic ovarian cancer, and one dose of chemotherapy with"

","The patient is a 58-year-old overweight/obese female who presented with increasing work of breathing, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and acidosis. She was initially intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. A chest tube was inserted due to pleural effusion and continuous drainage of pleural fluid. The patient has a history of renal impairment and is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics for suspected sepsis. She is also receiving TPN (total parenteral nutrition) and has multiple IV lines in place.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension with a blood pressure of 78/42 mmHg, tachycardia with a heart rate of 89 bpm, and tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's CVP (central venous pressure) is low at 3 mmHg, indicating poor cardiac function or volume depletion. Bladder pressure is elevated at 26 mmHg, suggesting increased intra-abdominal pressure possibly due to obesity or ascites. Fluid balance shows an intake of 8,769 mL and output of 4,211 mL, indicating ongoing fluid losses.

Respiratory support includes endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL and respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute. PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) is set at 5 cmH2"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with thought metastatic ovarian cancer (no biopsy yet) on pressors
   and [**Hospital 1460**] transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral
   stenting. She got palliative chemo.  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**].
   PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
    # Respiratory failure: Patient with baseline restrictive physiology
   due to effusions, ascities, anasarca, with resolving aspiration
   pneumonia s/p bilateral chest tube placement and successful extubation
   on [**10-10**] now reintubated secondary to hypercarbia, acidemia and
   respiratory distress. Most likely etiology is that patient has been
   tiring out since extubation. Patient at baseline has very low tidal
   volume (~300cc), which may cause baseline hypercarbia.
   -Suction and nebs prn
   - R chest tube with minimal output, could be d/c
d today.
   - f/u with IR recs regarding plans for continued drainage
   -Continue meropenem for ESBL enterobacter (Day [**4-29**])
   # Hypotension
 Patient is currently on pressors since intubation and
   attempted to be weaned off. Negative cultures so far and only culture
   data is from sputum growing ESBL enterobacter and urine in the yeast.
   Concern for aspiration pneumonia now has completed 7+ day course of
   vancomycin, switched to meropenem with new data for ESBL(day
   1=[**2138-10-9**]), will continue for now. It is likely her hypotension is
   secondary to malignancy and rapid fluid shifts out of the IV space.
   Other etiologies such as sepsis are also possible.
   -Try to wean from pressors; however if patient switched to HD may
   require further pressor support (patient on CVVH for 3 weeks)
   - Monitor BP, fluid bolus if needed but w/caution given fluid overload
   - stress dose steroids, now on day 3 of 25 IV q 6, titrate down today
    # Renal failure: Initially ARF now patient on CVVH has been running
   even likely secondary to ATN, does not appear to be reversible. Given
   patient
s long-standing dependence on CVVH and HD, will need to assess
   what our end-point is. Given her reintubation today, will continue CVVH
   for now and touch base with renal to see if HD is still possible, which
   seems unlikely given hypotension/pressor dependence.
   -discussed with renal this AM plan to transition care to HD tomorrow
   however given re-intubation will need to reassess goals
   -monitor electrolytes closely
   -monitor fluids,
    # Malignancy- Patient with presumed metastatic ovarian cancer. 1 dose
   of chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66.
   Unclear when second dose would be. At this point there is no utility in
   following further cytology- thus far her pleural fluid was consistent
   with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly primary ovarian ca. Onc
   attending has spoken to family at length and they are aware that this
   is not a curative intervention, rather it may help to get her home and
   prolong life for some number of months.
   - plan for repeat CT chest 9/24 per onc
   - family continues to hope that chemo is the answer
   - [**Hospital3 1956**] oncology team consult
   - Family meeting must be planned with all teams together, since
   patients getting different information from different teams. This also
   may help with goals of care.
   # Anemia of chronic disease; renal failure and blood loss in urine.
   -continue folic acid in TPN
    # Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - continue levothyroxine
   - TSH slightly high, may need increase in levothyroxine. Will check
   with endocrine.
    #. Hyperlipidemia
 Not on statin, since patient not getting anything
   NPO. Not likely to absorb due to bowel edema.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and palliative chemotherapy. The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, hypotension, renal failure, anemia of chronic disease, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient initially presented with increasing work of breathing, hypercarbia, and acidemia, leading to reintubation. She has been on invasive ventilation since October 12th. The patient has a history of restrictive physiology due to effusions, ascites, anasarca, and resolving aspiration pneumonia. She was successfully extubated on October 10th but became tired and required reintubation.

The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to malignancy and rapid fluid shifts. She has negative cultures so far, but there is concern for aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been on pressors since intubation and has completed a 7-day course of vancomycin. She has been switched to meropenem due to ESBL enterobacter.

The patient also has renal failure initially presenting as acute renal failure (ARF), now on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for three weeks. It does not appear to be reversible. Given the patient's long-standing dependence on CVVH and hemodialysis"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metatatic malignancy of unknown primary but with
   suspected ovarian CA now with persistent renal compromise but
   reasonable stability following extubation with optimization of fluid
   management with tap of effusions and paracentesis now with recurrent
   respiratory failure [**2138-10-12**].
   1)Acute Renal Failure-
   -This is likely related to toxic insult from medications, possible
   abdominal compartment syndrome, possible ureteral obstruction (which
   was unilateral making it less likely) and now with persistent renal
   replacement required. Important to note is that patient does have some
   significant return of renal function suggested by increased urine flow.
   -Continue with CVVH
   -Goal fluid balance is event
   2)Acute Respiratory Failure-This represents a slow progressive decline
   over time with hypercarbic respiratory failure
   Patient with reasonable compliance and substantial respiratory effort
   with CMV likely providing somewhat restricted inspiratory flow
   -PSV with 15-20/5 expected to provide complete support
   -Repeat ABG on PSV
   -Barriers to extubation are not entirely clear
secretions minimal,
   mental status excellent, pulmonary compliance likely reasonable and
   extubation will have to depend upon response.
   -Will need nocturnal BIPAP support should extubation be achieved
   2.5)Pleural Effusions-
   Favor D/C of left chest tube if no change with tube clamped as concern
   for location remains
   Right chest tube with minimal drainage
   Risk of infection will mount as counts nadir on chemotherapy so will
   have to consider drainage
   3)Hypotension-
   -Levophed in place and may be component of intravascular volume
   depletion and ongoing fluid leak from intravascular space may be
   contributing
   -Not clear overwhelming insult
   -No evidence of pericardia effusion or impaired ejection fraction noted
   -Hydrocortisone to be weaned and will add midodrine and florinef to
   faciliate wean.
   -Source remains multifactorial and difficult to control
   4)Metastatic Malignancy-
   Unknown primary tumor
   Counts have failed to show substantial decline
   Will need to consider further Rx with oncology team based upon response

","The patient's chief complaints are respiratory failure and acute renal failure. The patient was intubated due to worsening respiratory distress, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. The patient has a history of metastatic malignancy with an unknown primary but suspected ovarian cancer. The patient also has ongoing renal compromise.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9Â°C (98.5Â°F) and 35.6Â°C (96.1Â°F) at different times, heart rate between 77-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 69-97 mmHg, respiratory rate between 19-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's flow sheet data indicates that they have received a significant amount of fluids, with a total in of 8,769 mL and a total out of 4,211 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's blood products show a total out of 4,558 mL and 727 mL. The patient's urine output is 377 mL and 180 mL over the respective time periods.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, sodium of 139 mEq/L, chloride of 103 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 27.8 %, BUN of 52 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, glucose of 120 mg/dL, and platelet count of 52 K/uL.

The patient's imaging shows an endotracheal tube at the carina and bilateral CTs in place. The patient also has a SCL in place with a PICC line overlying.

The assessment and plan include acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, pleural effusions, hypotension, and metastatic malignancy. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for renal failure and will continue with this treatment. The patient is also on mechanical ventilation (CMV) with plans to switch to pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a goal of providing complete support. The patient may require nocturnal bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) support if extubation is achieved.

The patient has pleural effusions, with plans to consider drainage of the right effusion due to risk of infection. The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, and the plan is to wean hydrocortisone and add midodrine and florinef to facilitate wean.

The patient has metastatic malignancy with an unknown primary tumor, and further treatment will be discussed with the oncology team based on response.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on nutrition via a nasogastric tube (NGT), with a goal of advancing"

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with thought metastatic ovarian cancer (no biopsy yet) on pressors
   and [**Hospital 1460**] transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**] ICU for ureteral
   stenting. She got palliative [**Hospital Ward Name 2007**].  Originally presented to ED [**2-22**].
   PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
    # Respiratory failure: Patient with baseline restrictive physiology
   due to effusions, ascities, anasarca, with resolving aspiration
   pneumonia s/p bilateral chest tube placement and successful extubation
   on [**10-10**] now reintubated secondary to hypercarbia, acidemia and
   respiratory distress. Most likely etiology is that patient has been
   tiring out since extubation. Patient at baseline has very low tidal
   volume (~300cc), which may cause baseline hypercarbia.
   -Suction and nebs prn
   - R chest tube with minimal output now clamped
   - IP says tubes aren
t draining, not going to leave them the way they
   are, will have to get back to us about plan
   - clamped left chest tube yesterday, no change in chest x-ray
   -Continue meropenem for ESBL enterobacter (Day [**5-29**])
   # Hypotension
 Patient is currently on pressors since intubation and
   attempted to be weaned off. Negative cultures so far and only culture
   data is from sputum growing ESBL enterobacter and urine in the yeast.
   Concern for aspiration pneumonia now has completed 7+ day course of
   vancomycin, switched to meropenem with new data for ESBL(day
   1=[**2138-10-9**]), will continue for now. It is likely her hypotension is
   secondary to malignancy and rapid fluid shifts out of the IV space.
   Other etiologies such as sepsis are also possible. Currently growing
   yeast in the blood.
   - consider restarting fluconazole
   -Try to wean from pressors as tolerated
   - Monitor BP, fluid bolus if needed but w/caution given fluid overload
   - previously on stress dose steroids, now on 20 mg po prednisone daily
    # Renal failure: Initially ARF now patient on CVVH has been running
   even likely secondary to ATN, does not appear to be reversible. Given
   patient
s long-standing dependence on CVVH and HD, will need to assess
   what our end-point is. Given her reintubation today, will continue CVVH
   for now and touch base with renal to see if HD is still possible, which
   seems unlikely given hypotension/pressor dependence.
   - cont CVVH for now
   - f/u renal recs
   -monitor electrolytes, fluid closely
    # Malignancy- Patient with presumed metastatic ovarian cancer. 1 dose
   of [**Month/Day/Year 2007**] [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66.
   Unclear when second dose would be. At this point there is no utility in
   following further cytology- thus far her pleural fluid was consistent
   with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly primary ovarian ca. Onc
   attending has spoken to family at length and they are aware that this
   is not a curative intervention, rather it may help to get her home and
   prolong life for some number of months.
   - repeat ct without any change
   - oncology says no more [**Month/Year (2) 2007**] at this time, however family to get
   second opinion from [**Hospital3 **]
   - Fhad family meeting today with onc/icu team
   # Anemia of chronic disease; renal failure and blood loss in urine.
   -continue folic acid in TPN
    # Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - continue levothyroxine
   - TSH slightly high, may need increase in levothyroxine
   - f/u endocrine recs
    #. Hyperlipidemia
 Not on statin, since patient not getting anything

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer who has been admitted to the ICU. She is currently on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) and pressors for hypotension. The patient had an unsuccessful attempt at extubation due to hypercarbia and respiratory distress, leading to reintubation. She also has a history of hypothyroidism, anemia of chronic disease, renal failure, and blood loss in urine. The patient's chest tubes are producing minimal output, and there is no change in the chest x-ray. The family is considering a second opinion regarding the patient's cancer treatment. The oncology team has expressed that further chemotherapy may not be beneficial at this time. The patient is also growing yeast in the blood.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's reintubation indicates ongoing respiratory failure. Factors such as baseline restrictive physiology due to effusions, ascites, anasarca, and resolving aspiration pneumonia may contribute to her respiratory distress. Continuous monitoring and suctioning with nebulizers as needed should be implemented. The patient's low tidal volume and hypercarbia suggest the need for careful management of her ventilation settings.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requires ongoing support with pressors. Negative cultures suggest that sepsis is less likely, but rapid fluid shifts due to malignancy could be a contributing factor. Monitoring"

   CVVH and pressors, now s/p intubation x2 and now s/p chemotherapy
   without any improvement clinically.
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient went for CT scan yesterday to evaluate for progression of
   disease which demonstrated no change. Have not been able to wean
   patient off of pressors yet. Still  on CVVH. yesterday right chest tube
   pu t out 1 liter in 2 hours, was clamped and repeat chest x-ray showed
   no change in effusions.  L chest tube was putting out a fair amount.
   Also was clamped without change in chest x-ray. Family apparently
   considering ?second opinion regarding patient's cancer possibly from
   [**Hospital3 **]. plan for family meeting today at 1 pm with onc/icu team.
   also would like to involve renal and would like to emphasize that CVVH
   cannot be used indefinitely.  Patient started on midodrine and
   florinef. Blood now growing yeast.

    # Respiratory failure: Patient with baseline restrictive physiology
   due to effusions, ascities, anasarca, with resolving aspiration
   pneumonia s/p bilateral chest tube placement and successful extubation
   on [**10-10**] now reintubated secondary to hypercarbia, acidemia and
   respiratory distress. Most likely etiology is that patient has been
   tiring out since extubation. Patient at baseline has very low tidal
   volume (~300cc), which may cause baseline hypercarbia.
   -Suction and nebs prn
   - R chest tube with minimal output now clamped.
   - clamped left chest tube yesterday, no change in chest x-ray
   -Continue meropenem for ESBL enterobacter (Day [**5-29**])
   # Hypotension
 Patient is currently on pressors since intubation and
   attempted to be weaned off. Negative cultures so far and only culture
   data is from sputum growing ESBL enterobacter and urine in the yeast.
   Concern for aspiration pneumonia now has completed 7+ day course of
   vancomycin, switched to meropenem with new data for ESBL(day
   1=[**2138-10-9**]), will continue for now. It is likely her hypotension is
   secondary to malignancy and rapid fluid shifts out of the IV space.
   Other etiologies such as sepsis are also possible. Currently growing
   yeast in the blood.
   - consider restarting fluconazole
   -Try to wean from pressors as tolerated
   - Monitor BP, fluid bolus if needed but w/caution given fluid overload
   - stress dose steroids, now on day 4 of 25 IV q 6, will titrate down
   steroids today
    # Renal failure: Initially ARF now patient on CVVH has been running
   even likely secondary to ATN, does not appear to be reversible. Given
   patient
s long-standing dependence on CVVH and HD, will need to assess
   what our end-point is. Given her reintubation today, will continue CVVH
   for now and touch base with renal to see if HD is still possible, which
   seems unlikely given hypotension/pressor dependence.
   -discussed with renal this AM plan to transition care to HD tomorrow
   however given re-intubation will need to reassess goals, think that
   CVVH continued is inappropriate at this time, would like to have renal
   team present for family meeting today to disucss that CVVH is not a
   long term option
   -monitor electrolytes closely
   -monitor fluids
    # Malignancy- Patient with presumed metastatic ovarian cancer. 1 dose
   of chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66.
   Unclear when second dose would be. At this point there is no utility in
   following further cytology- thus far her pleural fluid was consistent
   with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly primary ovarian ca. Onc
   attending has spoken to family at length and they are aware that this
   is not a curative intervention, rather it may help to get her home and
   prolong life for some number of months.
   - repeat ct without any change
   - likely not candidate for furthur chemo => will touch base with
   oncology this morning
   - [**Hospital3 1956**] oncology team consult as per family?
   - Family meeting must be planned with all teams together, since
   patients getting different information from different teams. This also
   may help with goals of care.
   # Anemia of chronic disease; renal failure and blood loss in urine.
   -continue folic acid in TPN
    # Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - continue levothyroxine
   - TSH slightly high, may need increase in levothyroxine
   - f/u endocrine recs

 Not on statin, since patient not getting anything

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old female with presumed metastatic ovarian cancer. She is currently in the ICU on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) and pressors, indicating severe renal failure and hypotension. She has been intubated twice and has not shown improvement clinically. The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and hypolipidemia. Her recent medical history includes aspiration pneumonia, for which she received bilateral chest tube placement and antibiotics.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory failure: She has a baseline restrictive physiology due to effusions, ascites, anasarca, and resolving aspiration pneumonia. She was successfully extubated on 10/10 but was reintubated due to hypercarbia, acidemia, and respiratory distress. It is likely that she is tiring out since extubation.
- Hypotension: She is on pressors since intubation and attempted to be weaned off. Negative cultures so far, but there is a concern for aspiration pneumonia. She has completed a 7+ day course of vancomycin and switched to meropenem for ESBL enterobacter, with new data indicating ESBL production (day 1=10/9). She also has yeast growing in the blood, and consideration should be given to restarting fluconazole. It is important to monitor her blood pressure and fluid balance closely.
- Renal failure: Initially acute renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with initial concern for ureteral obstruction in the
   setting of widely metastatic malignancy and suspected ovarian carcinoma
   primary.  She now has had a hospital course notable for persistent and
   significant respiratory failure, hypotension, renal failure and
   oncology undertaking evaluation for possible response to chemotherapy
   given.  Her status remains one of continued full support and an absence
   of obvious change in response to chemotherapy based on initial CT scan
   [**Location (un) **].
   1)Respiratory Failure Acute-
   PSV to continue to wean
   Patient with favorable predictors for extubation of improved mental
   status, minimal secretions and reasonable fluid balance maintained
   Will continue with PSV wean and move to RSBI today
   Given recurrent intubations will have to consider tracheostomy given
   recurrent respiratory failure and risk of ongoing volume overload and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Reasonable alternative would be
   [**Hospital1 **]-level mask ventilation support
   Meropenem to continue
   2)Pleural Effusions-Malignant effusions with recurrent respiratory
   failure perhaps contributing to the respiratory failure
   -Will recheck film following clamp of chest tubes x 24 hours
   3)Hypotension-
   Does appear to be a combination of limited effective circulating volume
   and decreased SVR leaving levophed requirement in place.  [**Month (only) 51**] have a
   contribution of ineffective venous return with tumor burden but not
   clearly documented.  Patient with concerning suggestion of yeast in
   blood culture
   -Continue with steroid taper
   -Trial po Midodrine
   -Continue with current antibiotics
   -Will treat Fungemia as concern is real given persistent presssor
   requirement, this is despite Rx for yeast in urine
   3)Acute Renal Failure-Patient with continued oliguria but with some
   return of urine flow.  She had Cr=0.6 and has reasonable optimization
   of fluid balance.  Would consider trial off or CVVH given hope for
   return of flow.
   -Continue witih CVVH for now and hope to transition to HD if
   hemodynamic stability is achieved
   - goal I/O even
   4)Metastatic Malignancy-
   -Will need to discuss with oncology expectation for treatment response
   and further treatment.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of widely metastatic malignancy and suspected ovarian carcinoma primary. She is currently in the ICU for persistent and significant respiratory failure, hypotension, renal failure, and oncology evaluation for possible response to chemotherapy. The patient's status remains one of continued full support and an absence of obvious change in response to chemotherapy based on initial CT scan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure Acute: The patient has persistent and significant respiratory failure. The plan is to continue with pressure support ventilation (PSV) wean and move to respiratory system burden index (RSBI) today. Recurrent intubations may necessitate tracheostomy due to recurrent respiratory failure and risk of ongoing volume overload and hypercarbic respiratory failure. An alternative would be [Hospital1]-level mask ventilation support.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has malignant effusions with recurrent respiratory failure, which may contribute to the respiratory failure. It is planned to recheck the film following clamp of chest tubes x 24 hours.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension appears to be a combination of limited effective circulating volume and decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR), requiring the use of norepinephrine. There is a concern about yeast in the blood culture, and treatment for fungemia will be initiated.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has continued oliguria but with some return of urine"

   74F with thought metastatic ovarian cancer s/p one cycle of palliative
   chemotherapy, on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**] transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**]
   ICU for ureteral stenting. PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
    # Respiratory failure: Patient with baseline restrictive physiology
   due to effusions, ascities, anasarca, with resolving aspiration
   pneumonia s/p bilateral chest tube placement and successful extubation
   on [**10-10**] now reintubated secondary to hypercarbia, acidemia and
   respiratory distress. On PS 10/5 FIO2 40%, may be able to be
   successfully extubated however given multiple extubations may have to
   consider tracheostomy instead. This may or may not be consistent with
   goals of care discussed at yesterday
s meeting. IP consult noted chest
   tubes will have to be moved eventually but will hold off until second
   opinion by DF this week.
   -Suction and nebs prn
   - R and L chest tubes with some drainage, clamped with no change on
   xray
   -Continue meropenem for ESBL enterobacter (Day [**6-29**])
   -Continue caspofungin for yeast in blood, sputum and urine (Day [**5-23**]
   change when speciated)
   # Hypotension
 Patient off pressors as of 6am today. Has been on/off
   since admission for hypotension of unclear etiology. As far as
   infectious etiologies-  enterobacter in sputum and yeast in urine,
   sputum and blood; also witnessed aspiration at beginning of admission,
   for which she completed 7+ day course of vancomycin, switched to
   meropenem for ESBL(day 1=[**2138-10-9**]). She has also been on steroids
   (stress dose) for concern of adrenal insufficiency and has been quite
   responsive. However, most likely etiology is underlying malignancy and
   rapid fluid shifts.
   - convering infections with meropenem and caspofungin (given failure on
   fluconazole)
   - off pressors, will continue monitoring BP and CVP
   - continue PO prednisone taper
   - fluid bolus prn for hypotension
    # Renal failure: Initially ARF now patient on CVVH for prolonged
   course, and renal insult appears unlikely to resolve at this point.
   Given her hypotension we are unable to switch to HD. Will continue CVVH
   for now.
   - cont CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
   -monitor electrolytes, fluid closely
    # Malignancy- Patient with presumed metastatic ovarian cancer. 1 dose
   of chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66.
   Cytology consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly primary
   ovarian cancer. Per family meeting yesterday will get second opinion
   from [**Hospital3 1956**] and plan accordingly at that point. A repeat CT showed
   no change in abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy consistant with her
   malignancy.
   - awaiting [**Hospital3 1956**] evaluation

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and has been experiencing multiple medical complications.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had resolving aspiration pneumonia but has now developed respiratory distress due to hypercarbia and acidemia. She is on mechanical ventilation with PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. There is a discussion about the possibility of tracheostomy if extubation fails again.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension of unclear etiology. She has been on and off pressors since admission. Possible causes include underlying malignancy, rapid fluid shifts, and infections (enterobacter in sputum and yeast in blood, sputum, and urine).
3. Renal failure: Initially acute renal failure (ARF), the patient is now on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to a prolonged course of renal insult. Switching to hemodialysis (HD) is not possible due to hypotension.
4. Malignancy: The patient has presumed metastatic ovarian cancer. She received one dose of chemotherapy with carboplatin but requires further evaluation and treatment by an oncology consultant.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of persistent hypotension. The patient has a history of allergies to oxycodone and nausea/vomiting. Recent interventions include starting caspofungin for yeast in blood, sputum, and urine, as well as initiating multiple infusions and medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9Â°C (96.6Â°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/65 to 85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and sedated, but appears comfortable. Physical examination findings include decreased breath sounds at bases, expiratory wheeze, and no new skin lesions. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin and platelet levels, and normal glucose levels. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition and has multiple lines in place for various procedures.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and catheter-related bloodstream infections. The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of VAP, while the presence of central venous catheters raises the risk of DVT and catheter-related bloodstream infections. Additionally, the patient's"

   pneumonia s/p bilateral chest tube placement and successful extubation
   on [**10-10**] now reintubated secondary to hypercarbia, acidemia and
   respiratory distress. On PS 10/5 FIO2 40%, may be able to be
   successfully extubated however given multiple extubations would be
   cautious. IP consult noted chest tubes will have to be moved eventually
   but will hold off until second opinion by DF this week.

   # Hypotension
 Patient off pressors as of 6am today. Has been on/off
   since admission for hypotension of unclear etiology. As far as
   infectious etiologies-  enterobacter in sputum and yeast in urine,
   sputum and blood; also witnessed aspiration at beginning of admission,
   for which she completed 7+ day course of vancomycin, switched to
   meropenem for ESBL(day 1=[**2138-10-9**]). She has also been on steroids
   (stress dose) for concern of adrenal insufficiency and has been quite
   responsive. However, most likely etiology is underlying malignancy and
   rapid fluid shifts.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia, hypotension of unclear etiology, and renal failure.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a baseline restrictive physiology due to effusions, ascites, anasarca, and resolving aspiration pneumonia. She was successfully extubated on 10/10 but had to be reintubated due to hypercarbia, acidemia, and respiratory distress. She is currently on pressure support ventilation with FiO2 of 40%. The plan is to continue monitoring her respiratory status and consider extubation if stable.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been on/off pressors since admission for hypotension of unclear etiology. Infectious etiologies include enterobacter in sputum and yeast in blood, sputum, and urine. She completed a 7-day course of vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia and switched to meropenem for ESBL. She also received steroids for concern of adrenal insufficiency. The most likely cause of hypotension is underlying malignancy and rapid fluid shifts.

3. Renal Failure: Initially acute renal failure, the patient is now on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for a prolonged"

   consider tracheostomy instead. This may or may not be consistent with
   goals of care discussed at yesterday
s meeting. IP consult noted chest
   tubes will have to be moved eventually but will hold off until second
   opinion by DF this week.
   -Suction and nebs prn
   - R and L chest tubes with some drainage, clamped with no change on

   # Hypotension
 Patient is currently on pressors since intubation and
   attempted to be weaned off. Negative cultures so far and only culture
   data is from sputum growing ESBL enterobacter and urine in the yeast.
   Concern for aspiration pneumonia now has completed 7+ day course of
   vancomycin, switched to meropenem with new data for ESBL(day
   1=[**2138-10-9**]), will continue for now. It is likely her hypotension is
   secondary to malignancy and rapid fluid shifts out of the IV space.
   Other etiologies such as sepsis are also possible. Currently growing
   yeast in the blood.
   - consider restarting fluconazole
   -Try to wean from pressors as tolerated
   - Monitor BP, fluid bolus if needed but w/caution given fluid overload
   - previously on stress dose steroids, now on 20 mg po prednisone daily
    # Renal failure: Initially ARF now patient on CVVH has been running
   even likely secondary to ATN, does not appear to be reversible. Given
   patient
s long-standing dependence on CVVH and HD, will need to assess
   what our end-point is. Given her reintubation today, will continue CVVH
   for now and touch base with renal to see if HD is still possible, which
   seems unlikely given hypotension/pressor dependence.

   following further cytology- thus far her pleural fluid was consistent
   with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly primary ovarian ca. Onc
   attending has spoken to family at length and they are aware that this
   is not a curative intervention, rather it may help to get her home and
   prolong life for some number of months.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer, hypothyroidism, and history of hyperlipidemia.
- She has been admitted to the ICU for ureteral stenting and has been on pressors since intubation.
- The patient is currently reintubated due to hypercarbia, acidemia, and respiratory distress.
- She has a history of aspiration pneumonia, which was treated with bilateral chest tube placement and successful extubation on 10/10, but she was reintubated due to respiratory failure.
- The patient has ongoing hypotension, likely secondary to malignancy and rapid fluid shifts.
- She is also experiencing renal failure, initially acute renal failure (ARF) that progressed to chronic renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).
- Malignancy is presumed metastatic ovarian cancer, with one cycle of palliative chemotherapy given on 10/1.
- The patient's pleural fluid was consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly primary ovarian cancer.
- Onc attending has spoken to the family about the limited utility of further cytology and the potential for palliative chemotherapy to prolong life for a few months.
- The patient's goals of care were reconfirmed with the family on 10/5, with a desire for intubation and full resuscitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic adenocarcinoma of likely ovarian origin
   now with prolonged course of ventilatory failure and sepsis.  Of
   concern is that there has been no change in the tumor burden following
   chemotherapy treatment.  Chest tube output has been 100cc/hr on right
   and 10cc/hr on left.  In this setting she has been able to maintain an
   even fluid balance with support of blood pressure with po medications.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Acute
   -Patient still with significant need for PSV of [**10-26**] with Vt=280-330
   and RR 35-40 suggesting inability to provide safe extubation for her in
   this current state of restriction
   -We have an opportunity to move to negative fluid balance and will
   today
   -Goal to trial extubation in next day if able to achieve a favorable
   negative fluid balance and effective ventilation increases.
   -If unable to safely extubate with confidence will have to consider
   goals of care and reasonableness of re-intubation
   -Meropenem-to continue
   2)Acute Renal Failure
   -CVVH to continue with goal of negative fluid balance today
   3)Sepsis
   -Fungemia being treated, other cultures are negative at this time
   -Midodrine in place
   -Will have to D/C CVL
s and recite with fungemia noted in blood
   -Will have to retain goal of stabilization of blood pressure
   -Steroids to wean to off
   4)Metastatic Malignancy-
   -No further treatment offered
   -Family considering second opinion from [**Company 2021**]

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic adenocarcinoma of likely ovarian origin. She has been experiencing prolonged ventilatory failure and sepsis. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, sepsis, and metastatic malignancy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient still requires positive airway pressure support (PSV) with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 280-330 mL and respiratory rate (RR) of 35-40 breaths per minute. This suggests an inability to provide safe extubation. The goal is to maintain effective ventilation and achieve a negative fluid balance to potentially trial extubation in the next day. If extubation is not successful, re-intubation may be considered.
2. Acute Renal Failure: Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is ongoing to manage the acute renal failure. The main goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance today.
3. Sepsis: The patient has fungemia being treated with caspofungin, and other cultures are negative at this time. Midodrine is in place to support blood pressure, and the central venous line (CVL) may need to be discontinued due to the presence of fungemia. Steroids are being weaned off, and the focus remains on stabilizing blood pressure.

   Assessment and Plan
   74F with thought metastatic ovarian cancer s/p one cycle of palliative
   chemotherapy, on pressors and [**Hospital 1460**] transferred from west to [**Hospital Ward Name 1437**]
   ICU for ureteral stenting. PMH includes hypothyroidism and HLD.
    # Respiratory failure: Patient with restrictive pneumopathy due to
   anasarca of the chest wall, tumor burden in the abdomen, ascities. Her
   baseline Vt are ~300 and most of it goes into death space. Has required
   re-intubation multiple times for getting tired and CO2 slowly rises.
   Patient unable to blow high amount of CO2 due to low tidal volumes.
   Patient on AC overnight and switched back to PS during the day. Left
   chest tube with ~700 cc/hr yesterday at some point, so it was clamped.
   Right one with ~2L /24 hrs.
   -          Continue PS for now
   -          Maintain even balance
   -          Re-start CVVH tomorrow when line placed and try to remove
   fluid and improve chest compliance
   -          F/u IP recs for chest tubes; will keep them in to improve
   respiratory failure
   -          Minimize fluids through IVs
   -          Continue meropenem (Day [**7-29**]) and caspofungin (Day 3)
   -          F/u cultures
   # Hypotension
 Patient back on pressors. Behaving as septic
   physiology, but etiology unclear. The only source of bacteria is sputum
   ESBL enterobacter in the setting of witnessed aspiration. Patient
   tomorrow finished the course of meropenem. Patient growing fungi in
   blood and urine, now on casponfungin after failing fluconazole. Also,
   adrenal insufficiency may be contributing to the hypotension. Patient
   on steroid replacement therapy.
   -Continue meropenen ([**7-29**])
   -Continue caspogungin (Day 3)
   -Taper prednisone (10mg/day today)
   -Wean Levophed slowly
   -Maintain negative balance: goal 500cc
   -CVP goal 8mm H2O
   -Continue midodrine at 5mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   # Renal failure: Patient on renal failure; acute setting requiring HD
   and now prolonged course of CVVH (3 weeks). Post renal component s/p
   stent placed, pre-renal component with hypotension and persistent
   pressor support and there may be a renal component as well. Patient now
   with increasing urine output (Slowly). If it picks up, may be of good
   prognosis.
   -CVVH tomorrow
   -f/u renal recs
   -f/u PM lytes (potassium)
   -monitor electrolytes, fluid closely
    # Malignancy- Patient with presumed metastatic ovarian cancer. 1 dose
   of chemo [**10-1**] day #1 with carboplatin 200 mg/m2 with BSA of 1.66.
   Cytology consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma, possibly primary
   ovarian cancer. Per family meeting yesterday will get second opinion
   from [**Hospital3 1956**] and plan accordingly at that point. A repeat CT showed
   no change in abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy consistant with her
   malignancy.
   - awaiting [**Hospital3 1956**] evaluation
   - f/u any oncology recommendations
   - appreciate social work input and involvement
   # Anemia of chronic disease; renal failure and blood loss in urine.
   -continue folic acid
   # Hypothyroidism
 Consulted endocrinology to help elucidate if
   hypothyroidism could be cause of persistent hypotension.
   - continue levothyroxine
   - f/u endocrine recs
   #. Hyperlipidemia
 Not on statin, since patient not getting anything
   NPO. Not likely to absorb due to bowel edema.
   # FEN
 TF started yesterday, may need to switch to TPN when extubated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of metastatic ovarian cancer, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. She is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, hypotension, renal failure, and anemia of chronic disease. The patient has been receiving palliative chemotherapy and is on pressors for hypotension. She also has anasarca, ascites, and chest wall restriction due to her malignancy. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 78/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with CPAP. Her temperature is slightly elevated at 36.6 degrees Celsius.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's restrictive pneumopathy due to anasarca and tumor burden in the abdomen, along with ascites, increases her risk of respiratory failure. She has required reintubation multiple times and is on positive pressure ventilation support.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension despite pressor support. The etiology is unclear, but it may be due to septic physiology, adrenal insufficiency, or other factors. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure requiring dialysis and has been on a prolonged course of continuous veno-"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is ARF (acute renal failure), SOB (shortness of breath), anasarca (generalized swelling), and oliguria (low urine output). 

The patient underwent several procedures and interventions including the placement of a multi-lumen catheter, dialysis catheter, and PICC line. The patient also had a change in their vascular access from the left subclavian to the right internal jugular vein.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST mode, receiving 400 mL tidal volume, set respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and is maintaining an oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6Â°C (97.9Â°F), heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 78/68 to 75/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 100%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 6 mmHg.

The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 6,437 mL and output of 5,988 mL with a net fluid gain of 449 mL. The patient's urine output is reported as 456 mL in the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results show an elevated serum creatinine level"

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient's chief complaint is ARF (acute renal failure), SOB (shortness of breath), anasarca (generalized edema), and oliguria (decreased urine output). 

The patient has a history of metastatic ovarian cancer and has undergone one cycle of palliative chemotherapy. They also have hypothyroidism and HLD (history of heart disease).

The patient's current medical condition includes respiratory failure due to restrictive pneumopathy caused by anasarca of the chest wall, tumor burden in the abdomen, and ascites. They have required reintubation multiple times for fatigue and CO2 slowly rises. The patient is unable to blow off high amounts of CO2 due to low tidal volumes. They are on AC (assisted control) overnight and switched back to PS (pressure support) during the day. 

The patient's hypotension is behaving like septic physiology, but the etiology is unclear. The only source of bacteria is sputum ESBL enterobacter in the setting of witnessed aspiration. The patient has finished the course of meropenem and is growing fungi in blood and urine, now on caspofungin after failing fluconazole. Adrenal insufficiency may also be contributing to the hypotension, and the patient is on steroid replacement therapy.

The patient has renal failure, requiring HD (hemodialysis) and CVVH (continuous veno-venous"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic adenocarcinoma now with persistent
   ventilatory failure, renal failure and sepsis with most recent pathogen
   identified as fungus present within blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   Her sepsis did appear to transiently improve with antibacterial therapy
   and we were able to D/C IV pressors, however, we now have had recurrent
   decline in the setting of positive fungal cultures.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Continued high output from chest tubes due to
   malignant effusions.  Have no capacity to maintain favorable
   ventilatory mechanics despite drainage of fluids which would suggest
   that abdominal malignancy process is primary driver of persistent
   ventilatory failure.
   -Patient with likely persistent restriction of chest wall mechanics
   with abdominal malignancy and has been minimally improved with chest
   tube drainage.
   -Alb/Atrovent
   -Based upon patient wishes will have to decide on course of extubation
   and mask ventilation support
   -Currently not expected to be able to tolerate extubation given current
   ventilatory mechanics
   2)Sepsis-Possible fungal source of infection
   -Meropenem-for enterobacter treatment
   -Caspofungin-for initial treatment of fungal cultures
   -Levophed
   -Pred 20mg/d
   -IVF bolus as needed to look to wean pressors
   -A-line in for prolonged period of time--favor D/C at this time.
   3)Acute Renal Failure--Had evidence of persistent limited urine flow
   but right now no evidence of need for return to dialysis
   -Re-evaluate each day for indication
   -No evidence of return of renal function
   4)Metastatic Malignancy-
   -No further chemotherapy recommended
   -Favor clamp of chest tube with intermittent drainage
   -No other role for intervention based upon oncology team here.
   -Will need to evalaute patient's goals for care in the setting of
   absence of reversible progression of malignancy

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic adenocarcinoma, now experiencing persistent ventilatory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has high output from chest tubes due to malignant effusions, resulting in persistent ventilatory failure. Despite drainage of fluids, there has been minimal improvement, suggesting that the abdominal malignancy process is the primary driver of the persistent ventilatory failure. The patient's chest wall mechanics are restricted, making extubation not currently expected to be tolerated.

2. Sepsis: The possible fungal source of infection is being treated with caspofungin for initial treatment of fungal cultures. Additionally, meropenem is being administered for enterobacter treatment. Pressors are being used to maintain blood pressure, and efforts are being made to wean them off over time.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has evidence of persistent limited urine flow but currently shows no indication for return to dialysis. Renal function will be re-evaluated daily for any signs of improvement.

4. Metastatic Malignancy: Due to the patient's condition, further chemotherapy is not recommended. It is suggested to clamp the chest tube with intermittent drainage. No other interventions based on the oncology team's evaluation are planned. The patient's goals for care will need to be evaluated in the absence of reversible progression of malignancy.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic adenocarcinoma now with persistent
   ventilatory failure, renal failure and sepsis with most recent pathogen
   identified as fungus present within blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   Her sepsis did appear to transiently improve with antibacterial therapy
   and we were able to D/C IV pressors, however, we now have had recurrent
   decline in the setting of positive fungal cultures.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Continued high output from chest tubes due to
   malignant effusions.  Have no capacity to maintain favorable
   ventilatory mechanics despite drainage of fluids which would suggest
   that abdominal malignancy process is primary driver of persistent
   ventilatory failure.
   -Patient with likely persistent restriction of chest wall mechanics
   with abdominal malignancy and has been minimally improved with chest
   tube drainage.
   -Alb/Atrovent nebs PRN
   -Based upon patient wishes will have to decide on course of extubation
   and mask ventilation support
   -Currently not expected to be able to tolerate extubation given current
   ventilatory mechanics, expect that might initially be successful for a
   day or so as before
   2)Sepsis-Possible fungal source of infection
   -Meropenem-for enterobacter treatment
   -Caspofungin-for initial treatment of fungal cultures
   -Levophed
   -Pred 20mg/d
   -IVF bolus as needed to look to wean pressors (yesterday recieved 500
   cc bolus, 250 cc bolus) however suspect that all of this fluid in
   extravascular space
   -will d/c a-line as has been for a long time
   3)Acute Renal Failure--Had evidence of persistent limited urine flow
   but right now no evidence of need for return to dialysis
   - d/c foley yesterday with only 100 cc of urine produced. bladder scan
   showed no fluid in the bladder however this is obviously limited by
   diffuse whole body anasarca, nursing unable yet to replace foley
   catheter due to whole body swelling
   - currently electrolytes are OK, would like to hold off on CVVH or
   dialysis for now especially in the setting of potential transfer?
   Although K now 5
   - will check an EKG, will discuss with renal goals of care
   -No evidence of return of renal function
   4)Metastatic Malignancy-
   -No further chemotherapy recommended per oncology here
   -Favor clamp of chest tube with intermittent drainage
   -No other role for intervention based upon oncology team here.
   -Will need to evalaute patient's goals for care in the setting of
   absence of reversible progression of malignancy

The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She is currently on pressors and previously on CVVH, transferred from west to east ICU for ureteral stenting. The patient has not responded to chemotherapy and is now experiencing persistent ventilatory failure, renal failure, and sepsis caused by a fungal infection. The patient's family has not been able to obtain a second opinion yet.

24-Hour Events:
- Dr. [Last Name (STitle)] spoke with the patient's family and explained the patient's condition, including that she is dying.
- The patient's son has not found an oncologist willing to come and see the patient.
- An ophthalmology consultation was performed, indicating no signs of [Female First Name] in the eye.
- Foley catheter was discontinued, with minimal urine output since then.
- Nursing is unable to scan the bladder due to large volume edema.
- The patient has significant body swelling (anasarca).
- Allergies include oxycodone, nausea/vomiting, and antibiotics.
- Infusions include midazolam, norepinephrine, and pantoprazole.
- Other ICU medications are morphine sulfate and caspofungin.

   and continue to bolus PRN
   - keep brachial a-line for now, if fails to improve clinically consider
   switching out the lines
   - repeat blood cultures
   3)Acute Renal Failure--Had evidence of persistent limited urine flow
   but right now no evidence of need for return to dialysis
   - d/c foley yesterday with only 100 cc of urine produced. bladder scan
   showed no fluid in the bladder however this is obviously limited by
   diffuse whole body anasarca, nursing unable yet to replace foley
   catheter due to whole body swelling
   - this AM with large volume of incontinent urine
   - currently electrolytes are OK, although K 5.0
   - do not think that patient should be offerred furthur CVVH or HD at
   this time given clinical scenario
   - check PM lytes
   - monitor UOP
   4)Metastatic Malignancy-
   -No further chemotherapy recommended per oncology here

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with newly diagnosed metastatic ovarian cancer. She is currently on pressors and previously underwent CVVH. She was transferred from the west ICU to the east ICU for ureteral stenting. The patient has not responded to one round of chemotherapy, and her family has not been able to obtain a second opinion. The patient's condition is deteriorating, with persistent ventilatory failure, renal failure, and sepsis caused by a fungal infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires increased ventilatory support due to malignant effusions and restriction of chest wall mechanics caused by abdominal malignancy.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a fungal infection, which is a possible source of infection. She has already received treatment with meropenem and caspofungin. Continuous monitoring and appropriate management of the infection are crucial.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's urine output is limited, and there is a concern about the need for dialysis. The presence of anasarca makes it difficult to replace the foley catheter. Regular monitoring of urine output and electrolytes is essential.
4. Metastatic Malignancy: The patient's metastatic malignancy is progressing, and further chemotherapy is not recommended. Evaluating the patient's goals for care in the setting of irreversible progression of malignancy is important.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic adenocarcinoma and absence of response to
   chemotherapy.  No further treatment offered by oncology.  She has had
   persisent hypotension and worsening respiratory failure with CMV now
   required for support of venilation and oxygenation which is a decline
   compared with yesterday.  Pressor requirement for support of blood
   pressure remains unchanged.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Acute and Chronic
   -Versed and MSO4 PRN for discomfort
   -Chest tubes with continued large volume drainage
will clamp tubes and
   drain intermittently
   -Continue with CMV support given need for full support
   -Continue empiric antibiotic support
   2)Acute Renal Failure-
   -No inidcations for dialysis at this moment
   -Minimal evidence of return of renal function
   -Will continue to minimize fluid inputs
   -Will have to consider the possibility of even offering dialysis should
   it need to be re-considered in the setting of progressive clinical
   decline and no expectation for recovery
   -F/U EKG for possible peak t-waves
   3)Sepsis-
   -Levophed
   -Caspo/Meropenem
   -Prednisone 10mg qd and will taper to off
   -Maintain goal CVP8-10 and bolus as necessary
   -All venous lines and foley catheter changed in the setting of
   candidemia
   4)Malignancy-
   -No treatment offered at this time
   -Will continue with palliative interventions consitent with the patient
   wishes.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic adenocarcinoma. The patient has persistent hypotension and worsening respiratory failure, requiring CMV support for ventilation and oxygenation. The patient also has acute renal failure, sepsis, and malignancy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute and chronic in nature. There is a decline in oxygenation and ventilation compared to the previous day. The patient requires full support from CMV, and chest tubes with large volume drainage may need to be clamped and drained intermittently.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient shows minimal evidence of return of renal function. There are no indications for dialysis at the moment, but it may need to be reconsidered in the setting of progressive clinical decline and no expectation for recovery.

3. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, which is being treated with Levophed (norepinephrine), caspofungin, and meropenem. Prednisone is also being given at a dose of 10mg qd and will be tapered off. The goal CVP is maintained between 8-10, and bolus administration is done as necessary. All venous lines and Foley catheter have been changed due to candidemia.

4. Malignancy: The patient has metastatic adenocarcinoma, and no further treatment"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic adenocarcinoma now with persistent
   ventilatory failure, renal failure and sepsis with most recent pathogen
   identified as fungus present within blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   Her sepsis did appear to transiently improve with antibacterial therapy
   and we were able to D/C IV pressors, however, we now have had recurrent
   decline in the setting of positive fungal cultures.
    1)Respiratory Failure-Continued high output from chest tubes due to
   malignant effusions.  Have no capacity to maintain favorable
   ventilatory mechanics despite drainage of fluids which would suggest
   that abdominal malignancy process is primary driver of persistent
   ventilatory failure.  Patient is currently requiring increased
   ventilatory support.
   - currently not on sedation
   -contact IP about chest tubes (will likely stay in and stay clamped for
   now)
   -Alb/Atrovent nebs PRN
   -continue to assess for extubation however unlikely today as pt still
   on AC
   2)Sepsis-Possible fungal source of infection
   -Meropenem-d/c today
   -Caspofungin-for initial treatment of fungal cultures
   -Levophed, will continue to try to wean as tolerated
   -Prednisone 10mg qd
   -f/u cultures
   3)Acute Renal Failure--Had evidence of persistent limited urine flow
   but right now no evidence of need for return to dialysis
   - d/c foley yesterday with only 100 cc of urine produced. bladder scan
   showed no fluid in the bladder however this is obviously limited by
   diffuse whole body anasarca, nursing unable yet to replace foley
   catheter due to whole body swelling
   - continues to be incontinent of urine
   - closely monitor K
   - if hyperkalemic- EKG, kayexelate, lasix if necessary
   -renally dose medications
   -attempt to keep I/O even
   4)Metastatic Malignancy-
   -Family is working on 2^nd opinion from outside oncologist
   -Favor clamp of chest tube with intermittent drainage
   -No other role for intervention based upon oncology team here.
   -Will need to evalaute patient's goals for care in the setting of
   absence of reversible progression of malignancy

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic adenocarcinoma. She is currently in the ICU with persistent ventilatory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. The recent pathogen identified is a fungus present in blood, urine, and sputum cultures. The patient's sepsis initially improved with antibacterial therapy, but there has been a recurrent decline with positive fungal cultures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires increased ventilatory support due to persistent high output from chest tubes caused by malignant effusions. The abdominal malignancy process is likely the primary driver of the ventilatory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a possible fungal source of infection. She was treated with meropenem, which has been discontinued, and caspofungin for the initial treatment of fungal cultures.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had evidence of limited urine flow, but currently, there is no need for dialysis. However, she is incontinent of urine and continues to be monitored closely for potassium levels.
4. Metastatic Malignancy: The patient's metastatic malignancy is not reversible, and the family is working on obtaining a second opinion from an outside oncologist."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient's vital signs are currently stable, but there have been fluctuations in blood pressure. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors. Fluid balance and respiratory support are being closely monitored. The patient's laboratory values show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, indicating potential hypotension. This may require adjustment of vasopressor infusion rates or other interventions to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics, suggesting a possible infection. It is important to monitor the patient's response to antibiotics and consider further diagnostic tests if necessary.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,481 mL and output of 3,100 mL, indicating a positive fluid balance. This could lead to fluid overload, which can have adverse effects on cardiac function and pulmonary status.
4. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level suggests possible kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly is necessary.
5. Respiratory issues: The patient is receiving respiratory support, and his ABG results show some abnormalities. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential to ensure adequate respiratory function.
6. Sedation and delirium: The patient is sedated with midazolam (versed), which can cause sedation and potentially delirium. Regular assessments of the patient's mental status and appropriate weaning of sedation should be considered."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic adenocarcinoma now with persistent
   ventilatory failure, renal failure and sepsis with most recent pathogen
   identified as fungus present within blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   Her sepsis did appear to transiently improve with antibacterial therapy
   and we were able to D/C IV pressors, however, we now have had recurrent
   decline in the setting of positive fungal cultures.
    1)Respiratory Failure-Continued high output from chest tubes due to
   malignant effusions.  Have no capacity to maintain favorable
   ventilatory mechanics despite drainage of fluids which would suggest
   that abdominal malignancy process is primary driver of persistent
   ventilatory failure.  Patient is currently requiring increased
   ventilatory support.
   - leave chest tube clamped for today with plan for intermittient
   drainage as needed for pulmonary support
   -Patient with likely persistent restriction of chest wall mechanics
   with abdominal malignancy and has been minimally improved with chest
   tube drainage.
   -Alb/Atrovent nebs PRN
   -Currently not expected to be able to tolerate extubation given current
   ventilatory mechanics, expect that might initially be successful for a
   day or so as before
   2)Sepsis-Possible fungal source of infection
   -Meropenem-for enterobacter treatment
   -Caspofungin-for initial treatment of fungal cultures
   - seen by opthalmology who did not see any evidence of fungus in the
   retina
   -Levophed, will continue to try to wean as tolerated
   -Pred 20mg/d
   -IVF bolus as needed to look to wean pressors (yesterday recieved 500
   cc bolus, 250 cc bolus) however suspect that all of this fluid in
   extravascular space, will again give 500 cc NS this morning for low CVP
   and continue to bolus PRN
   - keep brachial a-line for now, if fails to improve clinically consider
   switching out the lines
   - repeat blood cultures
   3)Acute Renal Failure--Had evidence of persistent limited urine flow
   but right now no evidence of need for return to dialysis
   - d/c foley yesterday with only 100 cc of urine produced. bladder scan
   showed no fluid in the bladder however this is obviously limited by
   diffuse whole body anasarca, nursing unable yet to replace foley
   catheter due to whole body swelling
   - this AM with large volume of incontinent urine
   - currently electrolytes are OK, although K 5.0
   - do not think that patient should be offerred furthur CVVH or HD at
   this time given clinical scenario
   - check PM lytes
   - monitor UOP
   4)Metastatic Malignancy-
   -No further chemotherapy recommended per oncology here
   -Favor clamp of chest tube with intermittent drainage
   -No other role for intervention based upon oncology team here.
   -Will need to evalaute patient's goals for care in the setting of
   absence of reversible progression of malignancy

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic adenocarcinoma. She has persistent ventilatory failure, renal failure, and sepsis, with the most recent pathogen identified as a fungus present in blood, urine, and sputum cultures. The patient's sepsis appeared to transiently improve with antibacterial therapy, but there has been a recurrent decline with positive fungal cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires increased ventilatory support due to high output from chest tubes caused by malignant effusions. There is a restriction of chest wall mechanics due to abdominal malignancy, which has not been significantly improved with chest tube drainage. It is unlikely that the patient will be able to tolerate extubation given the current ventilatory mechanics.

2. Sepsis: The possible fungal source of infection needs to be addressed. The patient is currently receiving meropenem for enterobacter treatment and caspofungin for initial treatment of fungal cultures. Levophed will continue to be used as tolerated, and efforts will be made to wean the patient off pressors. Prednisone (Pred 20mg/d) has been prescribed. Blood cultures have been repeated.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic adenocarcinoma now with persistent
   ventilatory failure, renal failure and sepsis with most recent pathogen
   identified as fungus present within blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   Her sepsis did appear to transiently improve with antibacterial therapy
   and we were able to D/C IV pressors, however, we now have had recurrent
   decline in the setting of positive fungal cultures.
    1)Respiratory Failure-Continued high output from chest tubes due to
   malignant effusions.  Have no capacity to maintain favorable
   ventilatory mechanics despite drainage of fluids which would suggest
   that abdominal malignancy process is primary driver of persistent
   ventilatory failure.  Patient is currently requiring increased
   ventilatory support.
   - currently not on sedation
   -contact IP about chest tubes (will likely stay in and stay clamped for
   now)
   -Alb/Atrovent nebs PRN
   -continue to assess for extubation however unlikely today as pt still
   on AC
   2)Sepsis-Possible fungal source of infection
   -Meropenem-d/c today
   -Caspofungin-for initial treatment of fungal cultures
   -Levophed, will continue to try to wean as tolerated
   -Prednisone 10mg qd
   -f/u cultures
   3)Acute Renal Failure--Had evidence of persistent limited urine flow
   but right now no evidence of need for return to dialysis
   - d/c foley yesterday with only 100 cc of urine produced. bladder scan
   showed no fluid in the bladder however this is obviously limited by
   diffuse whole body anasarca, nursing unable yet to replace foley
   catheter due to whole body swelling
   - continues to be incontinent of urine
   - closely monitor K
   - if hyperkalemic- EKG, kayexelate, lasix if necessary
   -renally dose medications
   -attempt to keep I/O even
   4)Metastatic Malignancy-
   -Family is working on 2^nd opinion from outside oncologist
   -Favor clamp of chest tube with intermittent drainage
   -No other role for intervention based upon oncology team here.
   -Will need to evalaute patient's goals for care in the setting of
   absence of reversible progression of malignancy

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic adenocarcinoma who is experiencing persistent ventilatory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. The patient's respiratory failure is likely driven by the abdominal malignancy process. She is currently on increased ventilatory support and is not ready for extubation. Sepsis is suspected to be caused by a fungal infection, for which treatment with caspofungin has been initiated. The patient also has acute renal failure, and efforts are being made to manage her kidney function by monitoring potassium levels and administering medications accordingly. The patient's metastatic malignancy requires further evaluation and management, including obtaining a second opinion from an outside oncologist. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent ventilatory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function and difficulty weaning off the ventilator.
2. Sepsis: The ongoing infection, potentially of fungal origin, can progress and cause systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and potentially death if not effectively managed.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate, leading to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for dialysis.
4. Metastatic Malignancy: The progression of the underlying malignancy may lead to further complications and limitations in treatment options.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the provided progress note."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer, pleural and pericardial effusions, and ascites. She has had a complicated course including acute respiratory failure, restrictive physiology due to malignant pleural effusions/ascites, hypotension requiring ongoing pressors, and acute renal failure on intermittent continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient also had fungemia caused by Candida albicans and has been pressor-dependent for over a month. She is currently on mechanical ventilation (ACV) with the CT (cannula/tracheostomy) remaining clamped. The patient's digit necrosis is new and may not be reversible given her prolonged pressor dependence. There are plans to switch to dopamine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) without the same effect as levophed. Further tapering of prednisone is also planned. The patient's family is continuing to search for a second opinion regarding her metastatic ovarian cancer. In the ICU, the patient is receiving nutrition via Nutren Renal at 30 mL/hour, and her glycemic control is being monitored. She has multiple lines in place, including an arterial line and a multi-lumen line. Prophylaxis measures include DVT prevention with boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention with mouth care and head-of-bed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic adenocarcinoma presenting with persistent ventilatory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. She has positive fungal cultures in her blood, urine, and sputum. The patient has been intubated for more than three weeks and requires a tracheostomy. She has high output chest tubes, indicating ongoing pleural effusions. Her respiratory mechanics show low tidal volume, low respiratory system compliance, and high plateau pressures, suggesting a restrictive component possibly due to chest wall edema. The patient is aware and off sedation, with low secretions. 

The patient's sepsis is being treated with caspofungin, and she is still on levophed as pressors. Prednisone is being tapered down from 10mg to 5mg per day. Cultures will be followed up. 

The patient has acute renal failure with persistent oliguria and an increasing creatinine level. Hemodialysis or continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) may be needed soon, but no indication has been provided yet. 

Regarding the metastatic malignancy, the family is working on a second opinion from an outside oncologist. The oncology team here does not have any further intervention to offer. The patient's goals for care should be evaluated in the absence of reversible progression of malignancy.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic adenocarcinoma. She has persistent ventilatory failure, renal failure, and sepsis caused by a fungal infection, as indicated by positive fungal cultures in her blood, urine, and sputum. The patient's respiratory failure is due to aspiration pneumonia, bilateral pleural effusions, and ascites. She has been intubated for over three weeks and requires a tracheostomy. 

The patient is currently receiving norepinephrine (Levophed) to support her blood pressure, midazolam (Versed) for sedation, and various antibiotics for the fungal infection. She is also on caspofungin for initial treatment of the fungal infection. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and she may soon require dialysis. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function leading to acute renal failure, and complications related to her metastatic malignancy. The patient's nutritional status is also a concern due to her inability to eat by mouth and the need for tube feeds. 

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic adenocarcinoma now with persistent
   ventilatory failure, renal failure and sepsis with most recent pathogen
   identified as fungus present within blood, urine and sputum cultures.
   Her sepsis did appear to transiently improve with antibacterial therapy
   and we were able to D/C IV pressors, however, we now have had recurrent
   decline in the setting of positive fungal cultures.
   # Respiratory Failure- Patient with aspiration PNA s/p treatment,
   bilateral pleural effusions that have been stable, ascities that
   slightly improved. Now with bilateral chest tubes, which have very high
   output. On the ventilator mechanics, she has very low tidal volume, low
   risbi, but gets tired easily after being extubated. She has
   continuously high peak pressures with high plateaus suggesting some
   restrictive component, which may be due to chest wall edema, since
   lungs are clear with stable effusions. - Patient receiving 3 mcg
   midazolam, wean if possible
   -Patient has been intubated for more than 3 weeks now and needs a
   tracheostomy
   -Continue nebs
   -If worsening effusions will unclamp chest tubes
   # Sepsis-Possible fungal source of infection
   -Caspofungin-for initial treatment of fungal cultures
   -Levophed, will continue to try to wean as tolerated (currently 0.1
   mcg/kg/min)
   -Prednisone 10mg qd decreased to 5mg yesterday
   -f/u cultures
   # Acute Renal Failure- Has persisten UOP, but it is not being
   quantified due to technical difficulties with her body habitus,
   anasarca and weeping skin. Creatinine slowly creeping up. [**Month (only) 51**] need
   HD/CVVH soon, but no indication as far as today. If so were to happen
   she would need a tunneled catheter.
   - Renally dose meds
   - Monitor lytes
   # Metastatic Malignancy-
   -Family is working on 2nd opinion from outside oncologist
   -Favor clamp of chest tube with intermittent drainage
   -No other role for intervention based upon oncology team here.
   -Will need to evalaute patient's goals for care in the setting of
   absence of reversible progression of malignancy

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic adenocarcinoma who is currently experiencing persistent ventilatory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. The most recent pathogen identified is a fungus present in blood, urine, and sputum cultures. The patient had a transient improvement in sepsis with antibacterial therapy, but there has been a recurrent decline due to positive fungal cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated for over three weeks and requires a tracheostomy. She has low tidal volume, low respiratory system compliance, high peak pressures, and high plateaus suggesting restrictive lung disease, which may be due to chest wall edema.
2. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have a fungal source of infection. She is receiving caspofungin for initial treatment of fungal cultures and will continue to be monitored with follow-up cultures.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has persistent oliguria due to technical difficulties with her body habitus, anasarca, and weeping skin. Her creatinine levels are slowly increasing, indicating the need for hemodialysis or continuous veno-venous hemofiltration soon.
4. Metastatic Malignancy: The patient's family is seeking a second opinion from an outside oncologist. Intervention options include clamping the chest tube with intermittent drainage. The patient will need to be evaluated for"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma admitted with
   persistent respiratory failure with multipe failed extubations,
   hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure
   requiring CVVH, and [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia.
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient has completed antimicrobial therapy for
   aspiration pneumonia.  She has bilateraly chest tubes in place that are
   currently clamped off. CXR this morning suggests improved pleural
   effusion on right and unchanged on left.  Patient has been intubated
   for a significant period of time, and will likely be difficult to
   extubate successfully in the short-term.
   - Continue nebs
   - If pleural effusions worsen, unclamp chest tubes
   - Consult IP for possible tracheostomy.
   # Fungemia: Patient with [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia treated currently with
   Caspofungin.
   - Continue caspofungin for [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia
   - Continue prednisone 5 mg
   - F/u cultures
   # Hypotension: Patient persistently hypotensive requiring prolonged
   norepinephrine. Failed trial of dopamine yesterday after she became
   tachycardic.
   - Wean levophed
   - Monitor UOP, lactate, mentation
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with difficult to quantify UOP. FC was
   discontinued after patient was found to have [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia.  Renal
   is following patient and will assess need for CVVH on a daily basis.
   - Trend creatinine, BUN, electrolytes
   - Place FC, monitor UOP
   - Urine lytes
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   # Metastatic Malignancy:
   - Family is working on 2nd opinion from outside oncologist, will
   discuss with med onc.
   - No other role for intervention based upon oncology team here.
   -Will need to evalaute patient's goals for care in the setting of

The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma admitted to the ICU for persistent respiratory failure, hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and candidemia.

The patient has completed antimicrobial therapy for aspiration pneumonia and has bilateral chest tubes in place, currently clamped off. A chest X-ray this morning suggests improved pleural effusion on the right and unchanged on the left. The patient has been intubated for a significant period of time and is likely to be difficult to extubate successfully in the short-term.

The patient has candidemia treated with caspofungin. Cultures are being followed up. Prednisone is continued at 5 mg. 

The patient remains persistently hypotensive and requires prolonged norepinephrine. A trial of dopamine was unsuccessful due to tachycardia. Levophed is being weaned. 

The patient's acute renal failure is being closely monitored, with trends in creatinine, BUN, and electrolytes. Fluid challenge (FC) has been discontinued after finding candidemia. Renal is assessing the need for CVVH on a daily basis. The patient's urine output is difficult to quantify. 

Metastatic malignancy is being evaluated with the family working on a second opinion from an outside oncologist. No other role for intervention based on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma admitted to the ICU. She has persistent respiratory failure with multiple failed extubations, hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), and [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia. The patient has bilateral chest tubes in place, which are currently clamped off. Her CXR this morning suggests improved pleural effusion on the right and unchanged on the left. She has been intubated for a significant period of time and will likely be difficult to extubate successfully in the short-term.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure and has undergone multiple failed extubations. She may face difficulties in successfully being extubated in the short-term, which could lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Hypotension: The patient requires prolonged pressor support due to persistent hypotension. Failure to maintain adequate blood pressure can result in organ perfusion issues.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, and her urine output is difficult to quantify. This could lead to further deterioration of renal function and the need for ongoing renal support.
4. Fungemia: The patient has [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia, for which she is currently being"

   .
   # Hypotension: Patient persistently hypotensive requiring prolonged
   norepinephrine. Failed trial of dopamine secondary to tachycardia.
   Failed wean off of norepinephrine yesterday secondary to decreased UOP
   and MAP~60, although still mentating well.
   - Add vasopressin, titrate down on levophed.
   - Monitor UOP, lactate, mentation
   - F/u on TFTs per endocrine request
   - Continue prednisone 5 mg for additional 2 days.

   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine this AM up to 1.6 from 1.4, and
   potassium up to 5.3 from 5.1. FC placed yesterday with UOP of 187cc
   from 1p-12am yesterday (17cc/hr).  Renal is following patient and will
   assess need for CVVH on a daily basis.
   - Trend creatinine, BUN, electrolytes
   - Place FC, monitor UOP
   - Urine lytes pending
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u with renal

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma admitted to the ICU for persistent respiratory failure with multiple failed extubations, hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and Candida fungemia. The patient has completed antimicrobial therapy for aspiration pneumonia and has bilateral chest tubes in place. She has been intubated for a significant period and is expected to be difficult to extubate successfully in the short-term. The patient also has anasarca, peripheral edema, and cold digits. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 94/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets. Blood cultures were positive for Candida. Renal function tests indicate worsening renal failure. Other lab values such as glucose, electrolytes, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers are within normal range.

Plan:

1. Continue nebulizer treatments.
2. Consider discontinuing right chest tube and send off cell count, glucose, and culture from left chest tube.
3. Discuss with the interprofessional team regarding tracheostomy on Wednesday.
4. Continue caspofungin for Candida"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma admitted to the ICU with persistent respiratory failure, hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and fungemia. The patient has completed antimicrobial therapy for aspiration pneumonia and has bilateral chest tubes in place. She is currently intubated and will likely be difficult to extubate successfully in the short-term. The patient's condition is complicated by anasarca, peripheral edema, and cold digits. Her laboratory values show abnormalities including elevated creatinine, potassium, and lactic acid levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure puts her at risk for further respiratory complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's requirement for prolonged pressor support indicates ongoing hypotension, which may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function, as indicated by increasing creatinine levels, puts her at risk for further renal deterioration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Fungemia: Although the patient is currently being treated for [Female First Name (un)] fungemia with caspofungin, there is a risk of treatment failure or development of antifungal resistance.
5. Metastatic Malignancy: The patient's underlying metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma may progress despite treatment, leading to worsening symptoms and potentially limiting treatment options.
6. Anasarca and Peripheral Edema: The patient's generalized swelling (anasarca) and peripheral edema can contribute to respiratory distress and increase the risk of pressure ulcers and other complications related to immobility.
7. Cold Digits: The patient's cold digits may indicate poor peripheral circulation, which could be a sign of peripheral arterial disease or another underlying condition.
8. Medication Side Effects: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including midazolam, norepinephrine, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate. These medications have potential side effects that need to be monitored and managed.

Please note that this summary and list of potential medical complications are based solely on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma admitted with
   persistent respiratory failure with multipe failed extubations,
   hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure
   requiring CVVH, and [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia.
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient has completed antimicrobial therapy for
   aspiration pneumonia.  She has bilateraly chest tubes in place that are
   currently clamped off. CXR this morning suggests improved pleural
   effusion on right and unchanged on left.  Patient has been intubated
   for a significant period of time, and will likely be difficult to
   extubate successfully in the short-term.
   - Continue nebs
   - If pleural effusions worsen, unclamp chest tubes
   - Discussed with IP, tentative plan for trach on Wednesday, will need
   to discuss with family. DDAVP available on call for Wednesday. NPO with
   TF shut off at midnight.
   .
   # Fungemia: Patient with [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia treated currently with
   Caspofungin.
   - Continue caspofungin for [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia
   - Discontinue prednisone 5 mg
   - F/u cultures, last positive on [**10-9**]
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient persistently hypotensive requiring prolonged
   norepinephrine. Failed trial of dopamine secondary to tachycardia.
   Failed wean off of norepinephrine yesterday secondary to decreased UOP
   and MAP~60, although still mentating well.
   - Continue levophed
   - Monitor UOP, lactate, mentation
   - F/u on TFTs per endocrine request
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine this AM up to 1.6 from 1.4, and
   potassium up to 5.4 from 5.3. FC placed yesterday with UOP of 187cc
   from 1p-12am yesterday (17cc/hr).  Renal is following patient and will
   assess need for CVVH on a daily basis.
   - Trend creatinine, BUN, electrolytes
   - Place FC, monitor UOP
   - Urine lytes pending
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   .
   # Metastatic Malignancy: Provider to provider second opinion requested
   yesterday.
   - Follow-up with oncology.
   -Will need to evalaute patient's goals for care in the setting of
   absence of reversible progression of malignancy

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma who was admitted with persistent respiratory failure, hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), and candidemia. She has completed antimicrobial therapy for aspiration pneumonia and has bilateral chest tubes in place. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to prolonged intubation and difficulty weaning off the ventilator.

The patient's hypotension is refractory to treatment, requiring prolonged norepinephrine support. She has also experienced acute renal failure, as indicated by an increasing creatinine level and potassium level. The patient has been placed on peritoneal dialysis to manage her renal failure.

The patient has been diagnosed with candidemia and is currently being treated with caspofungin. Fungemia cultures have been positive for Candida auris.

The patient's metastatic malignancy requires a provider-to-provider second opinion. The oncology team will evaluate the patient's goals for care in the context of the absence of reversible progression of malignancy.

In terms of medical complications, the patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation. She also has significant peripheral edema with cold digits, which could indicate a circulatory problem. Additionally, the patient's acute renal failure and electrolyte imbalances need close monitoring and management.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition"

   # Respiratory Failure: Patient has completed antimicrobial therapy for
   aspiration pneumonia.  She has bilateral chest tubes in place that are
   currently clamped off. CXR this morning suggests unchanged pleural
   effusions.  Patient has been intubated for a significant period of
   time, and will likely be difficult to extubate successfully in the
   short-term.  Discussed with IP, tentative plan for bedside trach today.
   - Plan per IP for trach tomorrow. Will order ddAVP 60 minutes prior.
   Patient NPO at midnight.

   norepinephrine. Failed trial of dopamine secondary to tachycardia.
   Failed wean off of norepinephrine secondary to hypotension.  Attempted
   to convert to vasopressin yesterday and patient became hypotensive.
   Currently on max vasopressin and minimal levophed.
   - Continue vasopressin and attempt to titrate down on levophed.
   - Monitor UOP, lactate, mentation
   - Continue prednisone 5 mg for additional 1 day.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma admitted to the ICU for persistent respiratory failure with multiple failed extubations, hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and [Female First Name (un)] fungemia. The patient has completed antimicrobial therapy for aspiration pneumonia and has bilateral chest tubes in place. She is currently intubated and will likely be difficult to extubate successfully in the short-term. A tentative plan for a bedside tracheostomy has been made for today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening hypoxemia due to prolonged intubation and difficulty with extubation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support increases the risk of organ ischemia, particularly in the kidneys and brain. This could lead to worsening renal function or neurological impairment.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure, indicated by increasing creatinine levels and hyperkalemia, may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately. This could result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
4. Fungemia: Although the patient has received treatment with casp"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma. She was admitted with persistent respiratory failure, multipe failed extubations, hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure requiring CVVH, and candidemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has completed antimicrobial therapy for aspiration pneumonia, but still has bilateral chest tubes in place with clamped-off drainage. She is intubated and may be difficult to extubate successfully in the short-term. A tracheostomy is planned for Friday.
2. Fungemia: The patient has been treated with caspofungin for a total of 14 days from the earliest negative blood culture. Fungal cultures are ongoing.
3. Hypotension: The patient requires prolonged norepinephrine support and has failed trials of dopamine and weaning off norepinephrine due to persistent hypotension. Vasopressin has been initiated, and the goal is to titrate down on levophed.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level remains unchanged at 1.6, and potassium levels are rising. CVVH is being monitored daily by the renal team.
5. Metastatic Malignancy: A second opinion is requested for the patient's metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma.
6. Feeding: Tube feeds have been held due"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma admitted with
   persistent respiratory failure with multipe failed extubations,
   hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure
   requiring CVVH, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia and new VAP with 4+ GNR in sputum.
   # VAP:  New tachycardia overnight with thickened secretions and 4+ GNR
   in sputum. Prior history of resistant enterobactor in sputum from
   [**2138-10-5**].
   - start meropenem
   - f/u sputum speciation
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient had completed antimicrobial therapy for
   aspiration pneumonia with new evidence of VAP.  She had bilateral chest
   tubes in place that were removed [**10-23**].  CXR this morning after removal
   of CTs suggests no interval change in effusions, question of RUL patchy
   opacity.  Patient has been intubated for a significant period of time,
   and will likely be difficult to extubate successfully in the short-term
   in setting of new VAP.  Family agreed to trach.
   - discuss with [**Hospital1 189**] if they will accept patient w/ pressors, ETT in
   place as family requesting transfer and possibly willing to accept
   deescalation of care outside of hospital.
   - per thoracics unwilling to do trach while still on pressors, will
   readdress once we have requirements for admission to [**Hospital1 189**]
   - Continue nebs
   - Pleural fluid gram stain negative, f/u cultures
   - f/u repeat sputum sent
   - f/u CXR read
   -
   # Fungemia: Patient with [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia treated currently with
   Caspofungin for total of 14 days from earliest negative blood culture.
   - Continue caspofungin for Candidemia ([**10-5**])
   - F/u cultures, last positive on [**10-9**]
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient persistently hypotensive requiring prolonged
   norepinephrine. Failed trial of dopamine secondary to tachycardia.
   Failed wean off of norepinephrine secondary to hypotension.  Attempted
   to convert to vasopressin [**10-22**] and patient became hypotensive.
   Currently on vasopressin and minimal levophed. Was off levophed
   transiently on [**10-23**] but failed [**2-22**] LOP and hypotension
   - Continue vasopressin and attempt to titrate down on levophed as
   tolerated.
   - Monitor UOP, lactate, mentation
   - Converted systemic steroids to 10 mg hydrocortisone q12h [**10-22**].
   Continue systemic steroids at current dose.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely a result of effective intravascular volume
   depletion secondary to hypoalbuminemia.  Serum and urine osmolality
   WNL. Urine NA<assay. Hypervolemic hyponatremia [**2-22**] anasarca
   - stop free water boluses and continue to monitor, currently out of
   danger .
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Creatinine this AM unchanged at 1.6.
   Potassium up to 5.2. FC in place with continued minimal UOP.  Renal is
   following patient and will assess need for CVVH on a daily basis.
   Patient currently not a candidate for HD. Use of CVVH persistently is
   not consistent with its clinical indication.
   - Trend creatinine, BUN, electrolytes
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u with renal recs.
   .
   # Anemia:.  Hct up to 27.7.
   - Trend hct and transfuse for hct <21
   # Metastatic Malignancy: Provider to provider second opinion requested
   both for [**Company 2021**] and at [**Hospital1 19**].
   - Follow-up with oncology.
   - Will need to evalaute patient's goals for care in the setting of
   absence of reversible progression of malignancy
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: Patient not a candidate for TPN [**2-22**] fungemia. Not
   tolerating TF
   - continue Q4 finger sticks, D50 prn hypoglycemia
   # FEN: tube feeds held secondary to increased residuals as a result of
   likely rising intra-abdominal pressure that we are unable to treat..
   Started erythromycin for promotility on [**10-23**] and attempt to slowly
   restart tube feeds if residuals resolve, IVF bolus PRN. OG discontinued
   [**10-22**], unable to site NG but nurse was able to place NGT on [**10-23**]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma. She was admitted with persistent respiratory failure, hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure, and fungemia. The patient has developed new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with 4+ GNR in sputum, and there is evidence of resistant enterobacter in sputum from 10/5. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure with multipe failed extubations. She has completed antimicrobial therapy for aspiration pneumonia but now has new evidence of VAP. She is intubated for a significant period of time and will likely be difficult to extubate successfully in the short-term. The family agreed to tracheostomy. 

2. Hypotension: The patient is persistently hypotensive requiring prolonged norepinephrine. She failed a trial of dopamine secondary to tachycardia and failed weaning off norepinephrine due to hypotension. 

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Her creatinine level is 1.6, and potassium is elevated at 5.2. 

4. Fungemia: The patient had fungemia with Candida albicans treated with caspofungin for a"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma admitted with
   persistent respiratory failure with multipe failed extubations,
   hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure
   requiring CVVH, and [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia.
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient has completed antimicrobial therapy for
   aspiration pneumonia.  She has bilateral chest tubes in place that are
   currently clamped off.  CXR this morning suggests
..  Patient has been
   intubated for a significant period of time, and will likely be
   difficult to extubate successfully in the short-term.  Family agreed to
   trach. With increasing secretion, and episodes of tachycarida with
   relative hyperthermia, concern for evolving new VAP.
   - Plan per thoracics for trach today, will give DDAVP 60 mins prior
   - Continue nebs
   - Pleural fluid gram stain negative, f/u cultures
   - f/u repeat sputum sent
   - Consider pulling chest tubes as patient is unlikely to be succesfully
   extubated, await plan from IP
   # Fungemia: Patient with [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia treated currently with
   Caspofungin for total of 14 days from earliest negative blood culture.
   - Continue caspofungin for Candidemia ([**10-5**])
   - F/u cultures, last positive on [**10-9**]
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient persistently hypotensive requiring prolonged
   norepinephrine. Failed trial of dopamine secondary to tachycardia.
   Failed wean off of norepinephrine secondary to hypotension.  Attempted
   to convert to vasopressin [**10-22**] and patient became hypotensive.
   Currently on vasopressin and minimal levophed.
   - Continue vasopressin and attempt to titrate down on levophed.
   - Monitor UOP, lactate, mentation
   - Converted systemic steroids to 10 mg hydrocortisone q12h yesterday.
   Continue systemic steroids.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely a result of effective intravascular volume
   depletion secondary to hypoalbuminemia.  Serum and urine osmolality
   - Repeate lytes this pm.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine this AM unchanged at 1.6.  Potassium
   up to 5.4 from 5.3. FC placed with continued minimal UOP.  Renal is
   following patient and will assess need for CVVH on a daily basis.
   - Trend creatinine, BUN, electrolytes
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u with renal recs
   - Started on CaCO3 yesterday per renal recs.
   .
   # Anemia: Repeat hct 22.0, prior labs likely erroneous.  Hct up to
   27.7.
   - Trend hct and transfuse for hct <21
   # Metastatic Malignancy: Provider to provider second opinion requested
   both for [**Company 2021**] and at [**Hospital1 19**].
   - Follow-up with oncology.
   - Will need to evalaute patient's goals for care in the setting of
   absence of reversible progression of malignancy
   .
   # FEN: tube feeds held secondary to increased residuals.  Start

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma who was admitted with persistent respiratory failure, hypotension, acute renal failure, and candidemia. She has been intubated for a significant period and has multiple complications including evolving new ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hyponatremia, anemia, and hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has increasing secretions, tachycardia, and relative hyperthermia, which are concerning for evolving new VAP. A tracheostomy is planned today to address this issue.
2. Fungemia: The patient had [Female First Name (un)] fungemia treated with caspofungin for 14 days. It is important to continue monitoring for any recurrence of fungal infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient requires prolonged norepinephrine support due to persistent hypotension. There have been failed trials of dopamine and conversion to vasopressin, with ongoing monitoring of UOP, lactate, and mentation.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level and is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is necessary.
5. Hyponatremia: This may be a result of effective intrav"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma admitted with
   persistent respiratory failure with multipe failed extubations,
   hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure
   requiring CVVH, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia, and VAP.
   .
   # VAP: Patient with 3+ GNR on sputum yesterday and started on
   meropenem.
   - Follow-up culture results, but if Pseudomonas, will treat for 15
   days.
   - Continue meropenem.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient with new evidence of VAP after already
   having completed antimicrobial therapy for VAP.  Chest tubes removed
   yesterday. Patient has been intubated for a significant period of time,
   and will likely be difficult to extubate successfully in the
   short-term.  Thoracic surgery has evaluated patient and do not feel
   that she is a good candidate for trach given prognosis.
   .
   # Fungemia: Patient with [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia treated currently with
   Caspofungin for total of 14 days from earliest negative blood culture.
   - Continue caspofungin for Candidemia ([**1-4**])
   - F/u cultures, last positive on [**10-9**], surveillance culture today
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient persistently hypotensive requiring prolonged
   norepinephrine. Patient has failed dopamin, vasopressin, and midodrine.
   - Continue levophed.
   - continue hydrocortisone
   - Monitor UOP, lactate, mentation
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine this AM unchanged at 1.6.  Potassium
   up to 5.4 from 5.3. FC placed with continued minimal UOP.  Renal is
   following patient and will assess need for CVVH on a daily basis.
   - Trend creatinine, BUN, electrolytes
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u with renal recs
   - Started on CaCO3 yesterday per renal recs.
   .
   # Metastatic Malignancy: Provider to provider second opinion requested
   both for [**Company 2021**] and at [**Hospital1 19**].
   - Follow-up with oncology.
   -Will need to evalaute patient's goals for care in the setting of
   absence of reversible progression of malignancy
   .
   # FEN: tube feeds held secondary to increased residuals.  Start
   erythromycin for promotility and attempt to slowly restart tube feeds,
   IVF bolus PRN. OG discontinued yesterday, unable to site NG. Plan for
   fluoro-guided NG placement today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma. She has been admitted with persistent respiratory failure, hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure, fungemia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition is critical, and multiple interventions have been attempted but without success. The medical team is considering a tracheostomy, but thoracic surgery does not believe the patient is a good candidate for this procedure. The patient's respiratory failure is severe, and she has shown no improvement despite completing antimicrobial therapy for VAP. The patient's renal function remains stable, but close monitoring is required. There is also a concern regarding the patient's metastatic malignancy, and a provider-to-provider second opinion has been requested. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure indicates a high risk of further respiratory complications. She may continue to experience difficulty weaning off the ventilator, increasing the likelihood of prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requires continuous monitoring and management. Despite previous interventions, the patient remains dependent on vasopressors, which can lead to complications such as organ dysfunction or ischemia.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure indicates a risk of worsening kidney function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and daily assessment of the need for continuous veno-ven"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma admitted with
   persistent respiratory failure with multipe failed extubations,
   hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure
   requiring CVVH, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia, and VAP.
   .
   # VAP: Patient with pseudomonas on sputum and started on meropenem
   ([**10-24**]).
   - Will treat  Pseudomonas with 15 days.
   - Continue meropenem.
   - f/u CXR
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient with new evidence of VAP after already
   having completed antimicrobial therapy for VAP during admission.  Chest
   tubes removed ([**10-24**]). Patient has been intubated for a significant
   period of time, and will likely be difficult to extubate successfully
   in the short-term.  Thoracic surgery has evaluated patient and do not
   feel that she is a good candidate for trach given prognosis.
   .
   # Fungemia: Patient with [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia treated currently with
   Caspofungin for total of 14 days from earliest negative blood culture.
   - Continue caspofungin for Candidemia ([**1-4**]??) Will f/u with ID
   - F/u cultures, last positive on [**10-9**], surveillance culture today
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient persistently hypotensive requiring prolonged
   norepinephrine. Patient has failed dopamine, vasopressin, and
   midodrine.
   - Continue levophed and attempt to wean
   - pt needs post-pyloric tube for feeding before starting midodrine
   - continue hydrocortisone
   - Monitor UOP, lactate, mentation
   .
   # Acute Renal FailureUnable to obtain labs from patient this AM.  FC
   placed with continued minimal UOP.  Renal is following patient and will
   assess need for CVVH on a daily basis.
   - Will hold off on daily labs
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u with renal recs
   .
   # Metastatic Malignancy: Provider to provider second opinion requested
   both for [**Company 2021**] and at [**Hospital1 19**].  Ca-125 was 43 (previous was 70)
   - Follow-up with oncology.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma.
- She was admitted with persistent respiratory failure, multiple failed extubations, hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure requiring CVVH, fungemia, and VAP.
- The patient has completed antimicrobial therapy for VAP but still shows new evidence of VAP.
- She is currently intubated and has been for a significant period of time, making extubation difficult.
- Thoracic surgery does not recommend tracheostomy due to the patient's prognosis.
- The patient is being treated with caspofungin for Candidemia.
- She continues to be hypotensive and requires prolonged norepinephrine support.
- Midodrine is not started as the patient needs a post-pyloric tube for feeding.
- The patient has acute renal failure and is on CVVH.
- Metastatic malignancy is also a concern, with a Ca-125 level of 43 (previous was 70).
- Plans include obtaining a second opinion for the metastatic malignancy and starting an IR post-pyloric feeding tube early next week.
- The patient's code status is full code.
- The arterial line will be removed due to severe damping.
- Sputum culture is positive for Pseudomonas, awaiting sensitivities.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma admitted with
   persistent respiratory failure with multipe failed extubations,
   hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure
   requiring CVVH, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia, and VAP.
   .
   # VAP: Patient with pseudomonas on sputum and started on meropenem
   ([**10-24**]).  Sensitivites today indicate Pseudomonas resistant to meropenem
   sensitive but with poor MICSs to ceftazidime, amikacin, and pip/tazo.
   Patient today also obtunded with new leukocytosis and low grade fever
   also suggesting systemic infection.
   - Discontinue meropenem, start ceftaz and amikacin (one dose).
   - Blood cultures x2
   - Replace CVL
   .
   # Obtundation: As above, in setting of leukocytosis, low grade fever,
   and sputum culture likely represents VAP with possible systemic
   spread.  Other potential sources include encephalopathy in setting of
   slowly worsening renal failure +/- sedation, CNS bleed, or CNS
   metastases.
   - non-con CTH to rule out mets or bleed
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above
   - Titrate down on sedation
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient with new evidence of VAP after already
   having completed antimicrobial therapy for VAP during admission.  Chest
   tubes removed ([**10-24**]). Patient has been intubated for a significant
   period of time, and will likely be difficult to extubate successfully
   in the short-term.  Thoracic surgery has evaluated patient and do not
   feel that she is a good candidate for trach given prognosis.
   .
   # Fungemia: Patient with [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia treated currently with
   Caspofungin for total of 14 days from earliest negative blood culture.
   - Continue caspofungin for Candidemia (13/14).
   - F/u cultures, last positive on [**10-9**]
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient persistently hypotensive requiring prolonged
   norepinephrine. Patient has failed dopamine, vasopressin, and
   midodrine.
   - Continue levophed and attempt to wean
   - pt needs post-pyloric tube for feeding before starting midodrine,
   discuss with IR.
   - continue hydrocortisone
   - Monitor UOP, lactate, mentation
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with hemolyzed labs overnight with
   variable bun/creatinine, likely representing hemolyzed specimen or lab
   error.  She did receive insulin and kaexylate for possible
   hyperkalemia.  FC placed with continued minimal UOP.  Renal is
   following patient and will assess need for CVVH on a daily basis.
   - Trend BUN/creatinine/potassium
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u with renal recs
   .
   # Metastatic Malignancy: Provider to provider second opinion requested
   both for [**Company 2021**] and at [**Hospital1 19**].  Ca-125 was 43 (previous was 70)
   - Follow-up with oncology.
   .
   # FEN: tube feeds held secondary to increased residuals.  Replete as
   necessary.  Patient will need IR guided post-pyloric feeding tube, will
   discuss with IR.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma admitted to the ICU for persistent respiratory failure, hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), fungemia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently unresponsive, intubated, and on multiple medications including sedatives, antibiotics, and antifungals. The patient's recent lab results indicate leukocytosis and low-grade fever, suggesting a systemic infection. The patient's sputum culture shows resistance to meropenem but sensitivity to ceftazidime, amikacin, and piperacillin-tazobactam. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, with variable BUN and creatinine levels. The patient's prognosis is poor, and a provider-to-provider second opinion has been requested for metastatic malignancy. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of VAP, and the recent sputum culture indicates resistance to meropenem, necessitating a change in antibiotic therapy. This suggests the possibility of a systemic spread of infection.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by variable BUN and creatinine levels. This can lead to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma. She was admitted with persistent respiratory failure, hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure, fungemia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has shown evidence of VAP despite completing antimicrobial therapy during her admission. She has also had multiple failed extubations and is currently unresponsive, intubated, and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent respiratory failure and has been intubated for a significant period of time. There is a risk of further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheostomy-related infections.

2. Hypotension: The patient requires prolonged norepinephrine support due to persistent hypotension. There is a risk of cardiovascular collapse if the blood pressure cannot be stabilized.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a risk of worsening kidney function or the need for continued renal replacement therapy.

4. Fungemia: The patient had Candida fungemia treated with caspofungin. There is a risk of relapse or development of drug-resistant fungal infection.

5. Metastatic Malignancy: The patient has metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma, and her condition may continue to deteriorate. There is a risk of further spread of the"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma admitted with
   persistent respiratory failure with multipe failed extubations,
   hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure
   requiring CVVH, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia, and VAP.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient persistently hypotensive requiring prolonged
   norepinephrine. Patient has failed dopamine, vasopressin, and
   midodrine.  Overnight progressively hypotensive requiring max dose
   levophed.  She is likely intravascularly volume depleted secondary to
   hypoalbuminemia in addition to sepsis, although she has profound
   anasarca.
   - Continue levophed, add vasopressin if necessary
   - 500 cc IVF bolus
   - continue hydrocortisone, increase to stress dose level.
   - Monitor UOP
   .
   # VAP: Patient with pseudomonas on sputum and started on meropenem
   ([**10-24**]).  Sensitivities indicate Pseudomonas resistant to meropenem
   sensitive but with poor MICSs to ceftazidime, amikacin, and pip/tazo.
   Patient continues to be obtunded, now with leukocytosis to 29.1 from
   17.7 yesterday, although C. diff is likely contributing to this.
   Unlikely to be meningoencephalitis given
   - Continue ceftazidime
   - Received one dose of amikacin yesterday.
   - Replace CVL
   - f/u blood cultures, CVL tip culture.
   .
   # C. diff: Patient with diarrhea overnight positive for C. difficile
   toxin.  Increased leukocytosis to 29.1 this AM consistent with C.diff.
   - Continue IV flagyl
   - Add po/pr vancomycin
   .
   # Obtundation: As above, in setting of leukocytosis, low grade fever,
   and sputum culture likely represents infectious process, whether
   systemic spread of VAP or de [**Last Name (un) 2451**] infection.  Other potential sources
   include encephalopathy in setting of progressive renal failure.
   Non-contrast CTH did not demonstrate ICH or significant mass effect.
   Sedation held from yesterday morning to overnight, when fentaynl was
   restarted.  Unlikely to be meningoencephalitis given likely pseudomonas
   source.
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above
   - Titrate sedation
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient with new evidence of VAP after already
   having completed antimicrobial therapy for VAP during admission.  Chest
   tubes removed ([**10-24**]). Patient has been intubated for a significant
   period of time, and will likely be difficult to extubate successfully
   in the short-term.  Thoracic surgery has evaluated patient and do not
   feel that she is a good candidate for trach given prognosis.
   .
   # Fungemia: Patient with [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia treated currently with
   Caspofungin for total of 14 days from earliest negative blood culture.
   - Continue caspofungin for Candidemia (14/14).
   - F/u cultures, last positive on [**10-9**]
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with slowly worsening renal function.
   Creatinine this AM 2.2 from 2.0 yesterday.  BUN continues to rise, this
   AM to 79 from 71.  Potassium this AM 5.1.  Renal is following patient
   and will assess need for CVVH on a daily basis.
   - Trend BUN/creatinine/potassium
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u with renal recs
   .
   # Metastatic Malignancy: Provider to provider second opinion requested
   both for [**Company 2021**] and at [**Hospital1 19**].  Ca-125 was 43 (previous was 70)
   - Follow-up with oncology.
   .
   # FEN: tube feeds held secondary to increased residuals.  Replete as
   necessary.  Patient will need IR guided post-pyloric feeding tube, will
   hold off until patient stabilized.
   .
   # PPx: SCDs and PPI
   .
   # Code: Full code, reconfirmed with family.
   .
   # Access: Right IJ, OG, FC, ETT.

   # VAP: Patient with pseudomonas on sputum and started on meropenem
   ([**10-24**]).  Sensitivities indicate Pseudomonas resistant to meropenem
   sensitive but with poor MICSs to ceftazidime, amikacin, and pip/tazo.
   Patient continues to be obtunded, now with leukocytosis to 29.1 from
   17.7 yesterday, although C. diff is likely contributing to this.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma. She was admitted with persistent respiratory failure, hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure requiring CVVH, Candida fungemia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been unresponsive and has shown signs of infection, including leukocytosis and fever. She has also been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and is being treated with IV flagyl. The patient's respiratory failure is severe, and she has failed multiple extubation attempts. She has undergone multiple interventions, including replacing the central venous line (CVL) and starting different antibiotics. Her renal function has been worsening, with an increase in creatinine and BUN levels. The patient's blood cultures are positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to meropenem but sensitive to ceftazidime, amikacin, and pip/tazo. The patient is also being treated for Candida fungemia with caspofungin. She continues to require aggressive management, including continued antibiotic therapy, CVVH, and titration of sedation. The patient's code status remains full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient has already developed VAP once and is at risk for further infections while intubated.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma admitted with
   persistent respiratory failure with multipe failed extubations,
   hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure
   requiring CVVH, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia, and VAP.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient deteriorating overnight, now requiring near max
   dose 3 pressors (levophed, vasopressin, and phenylephrine).  Unable to
   place arterial line secondary to anasarca and BP cuff with inconsistent
   [**Location (un) **].  She received 500 cc bolus x2 yesterday with minimal benefit,
   and continues to have minimal UOP.  Patient likely with sepsis given
   low grade temperature, hypotension, and elevated lactate to 8.  Patient
   increasingly acidotic with pH <7 requiring sodium bicarb IVF.  Patient
   this AM with increasingly distended and rigid abdomen concerning for
   perforation.
   - Continue levophed, vasopressin, and neo
   - Continue stress dose hydrocortisone
   - Monitor UOP
   - IVF unlikely to help given degree of hypoalbuminemia, anasarca, but
   given degree of acidosis, give 1 liter NaHC03 IVF.
   .
   # VAP: Patient with pseudomonas on sputum and started on meropenem
   ([**10-24**]).  Sensitivities indicate Pseudomonas resistant to meropenem
   sensitive but with poor MICSs to ceftazidime, amikacin, and pip/tazo.
   Patient continues to be obtunded, now with leukocytosis to 29.1 from
   17.7 yesterday, although C. diff is likely contributing to this.
   - Continue ceftazidime, has received one dose of amikacin
   - f/u blood cultures, CVL tip culture.
   .
   # C. diff: Patient with C. difficile.  Increased leukocytosis to 30.1
   from 29.1 this AM.
   - Continue IV flagyl, added po/pr vancomycin yesterday.
   .
   # Obtundation: As above, in setting of leukocytosis, low grade fever,
   and sputum culture likely represents infectious process, whether
   systemic spread of VAP or C. diff colitis.  Patient also with worsening
   renal failure, so encephalopathy likely contributing.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient with new evidence of VAP after already
   having completed antimicrobial therapy for VAP during admission.  Chest
   tubes removed ([**10-24**]). Patient has been intubated for a significant
   period of time, and will likely be difficult to extubate successfully
   in the short-term.  Thoracic surgery has evaluated patient and do not
   feel that she is a good candidate for trach given prognosis.
   .
   # Fungemia: Patient with [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia treated with Caspofungin for
   total of 14 days from earliest negative blood culture.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with slowly worsening renal function.
   Creatinine this AM 2.5 from 2.2.  Potassium this AM 6, patient received
   kaexylate, calcium gluconate. Has been essentially anuric.  Given
   current hemodynamic instability, patient would not tolerate CVVHD.
   - Trend BUN/creatinine/potassium
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u with renal recs
   .
   # Metastatic Malignancy: Provider to provider second opinion requested
   both for [**Company 2021**] and at [**Hospital1 19**].  Ca-125 was 43 (previous was 70)
   - Follow-up with oncology.
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Patient with significant hypothyroid with low T3 and T4.
   - F/u with endocrine regarding treating with synthroid or cytomel.
   .
   # FEN: tube feeds held secondary to increased residuals.  Replete as
   necessary.  Patient will need IR guided post-pyloric feeding tube, will
   hold off until patient stabilized.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma. She has been admitted with persistent respiratory failure, multiple failed extubations, hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), [Female First Name (un)] fungemia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's condition has deteriorated overnight, necessitating near-maximum doses of three pressors (levophed, vasopressin, and phenylephrine). The patient is unable to have an arterial line placed due to anasarca and inconsistent blood pressure readings with BP cuff. She received 500 cc boluses twice yesterday with minimal benefit and continues to have minimal urine output. The patient likely has sepsis given the low-grade temperature, hypotension, and elevated lactate level of 8. The patient is also increasingly acidotic with a pH less than 7 requiring sodium bicarbonate IVF.

The patient's abdomen is distended and rigid, which is concerning for perforation. She is currently sedated and unresponsive, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including meropenem, ceftazidime, amikacin, and caspofungin. However, the sensitivities indicate that Pseudomonas is resistant to meropenem and sensitive to"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma admitted with
   persistent respiratory failure with multipe failed extubations,
   hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure
   requiring CVVH, [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia, and VAP.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient deteriorating overnight, now requiring near max
   dose 3 pressors (levophed, vasopressin, and phenylephrine).  Unable to
   blace arterial line secondary to anasarca and BP cuff with inconsistent
   [**Location (un) **].  She received 500 cc bolus x2 yesterday with minimal benefit,
   and continues to have minimal UOP.  Patient likely with sepsis given
   low grade temperature, hypotension, and elevated lactate to 8.  Patient
   increasingly acidotic with pH <7 requiring sodium bicarb IVF.
   - Continue levophed, vasopressin, and neo
   - Continue stress dose hydrocortisone
   - Monitor UOP
   - IVF unlikely to help given degree of hypoalbuminemia, anasarca, but
   given degree of acidosis, give 1 liter NaHC03 IVF.
   .
   # VAP: Patient with pseudomonas on sputum and started on meropenem
   ([**10-24**]).  Sensitivities indicate Pseudomonas resistant to meropenem
   sensitive but with poor MICSs to ceftazidime, amikacin, and pip/tazo.
   Patient continues to be obtunded, now with leukocytosis to 29.1 from
   17.7 yesterday, although C. diff is likely contributing to this.
   - Continue ceftazidime, has received one dose of amikacin
   - f/u blood cultures, CVL tip culture.
   .
   # C. diff: Patient with C. difficile.  Increased leukocytosis to 30.1
   from 29.1 this AM.
   - Continue IV flagyl, added po/pr vancomycin yesterday.
   .
   # Obtundation: As above, in setting of leukocytosis, low grade fever,
   and sputum culture likely represents infectious process, whether
   systemic spread of VAP or de [**Last Name (un) 2451**] infection.  Other potential sources
   include encephalopathy in setting of progressive renal failure.
   Non-contrast CTH did not demonstrate ICH or significant mass effect.
   Sedation held from yesterday morning to overnight, when fentaynl was
   restarted.  Unlikely to be meningoencephalitis given likely pseudomonas
   source.
   - Antimicrobial therapy as above
   - Titrate sedation
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient with new evidence of VAP after already
   having completed antimicrobial therapy for VAP during admission.  Chest
   tubes removed ([**10-24**]). Patient has been intubated for a significant
   period of time, and will likely be difficult to extubate successfully
   in the short-term.  Thoracic surgery has evaluated patient and do not
   feel that she is a good candidate for trach given prognosis.
   .
   # Fungemia: Patient with [**Female First Name (un) 1354**] fungemia treated with Caspofungin for
   total of 14 days from earliest negative blood culture.  Hold
   caspofungin today.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with slowly worsening renal function.
   Creatinine this AM 2.5 from 2.2.  Potassium this AM 6, patient received
   kaexylate, calcium gluconate.  Renal is following patient and will
   assess need for CVVH on a daily basis.
   - ECG today
   - Trend BUN/creatinine/potassium
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   - f/u with renal recs
   .
   # Metastatic Malignancy: Provider to provider second opinion requested
   both for [**Company 2021**] and at [**Hospital1 19**].  Ca-125 was 43 (previous was 70)
   - Follow-up with oncology.
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Patient with significant hypothyroid with low T3 and T4.
   - F/u with endocrine regarding treating with cytomel.
   .
   # FEN: tube feeds held secondary to increased residuals.  Replete as
   necessary.  Patient will need IR guided post-pyloric feeding tube, will
   hold off until patient stabilized.
   .
   # PPx: SCDs and PPI
   .
   # Code: Full code, reconfirmed with family.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic ovarian adenocarcinoma who has been admitted with persistent respiratory failure, hypotension requiring prolonged pressor support, acute renal failure, fungemia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She is currently unresponsive and intubated, with anasarca and hypoalbuminemia. Her vital signs are unstable, with a blood pressure of 80/30 mmHg and a heart rate of 119 bpm. The patient has leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and metabolic acidosis. She has received multiple antibiotics for VAP, but the organism is resistant to some of them. The patient also has Clostridium difficile infection and is being treated with vancomycin. She has acute renal failure with worsening creatinine levels and potassium levels. Her thyroid function is abnormal, and she has hypothyroidism. The patient requires a post-pyloric feeding tube due to increased residuals. She is on full code status and is receiving ICU level of care.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This could lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are progressively increasing, indicating worsening renal function. This may require continuous renal replacement therapy or hemodialysis.
3. Fungemia: The patient had an episode of fungemia treated with"
