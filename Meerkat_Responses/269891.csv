   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 20 year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety
   and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications presenting with
   increasing paranoia, fevers and stiffness.
   .
   Plan:
   # Fever, rigitidy: Patient remained afebrile overnight and his rigidity
   has improved with ativan. Initial presentation concerning for NMS-
   fever, rigidity, tachycardia and elevated BP, and mental status
   changes, namely catatonia/mutism and paranoia. These have largely
   improved. CK have remained stable, LDH increased. Malignant catatonia,
   a psychiatric diagnosis, also presents in this manner. Patient has no
   signs of meningitis on exam, TSH is normal, which make infection and
   thyrotoxicosis less likely. Per psychiatry patients with low serum iron
   studies have worse prognosis in NMS; patient is slightly anemic.
   - IV NS@ 150cc/hr
   - Trend CK, lactate
   - Ativan 0.5-1mg PO q3, 1mg PO PRN and 1mg IV PRN
   - EKG q6h
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   .
   # Paranoia
 Improved since admission with benzo. Will touch base with
   psychiatry prior to transfer/discharge to ensure appropriate follow-up
   and recommendations regarding psych medications. Given patient's
   discontinued use of marijuana this could be due to withdrawal vs. new
   onset schizophrenia (increased risk given first degree relative with
   diagnosis)vs. malignant catatonia. Unlikely to be drug related given
   patient's toxicology is negative. Also unlikely is a primary CNS
   mass/hemorrhage given negative CT.
   -treat as above with benzos, avoid neuroleptics
   -f/u any new psych recommendations
   -psych consult
   # Leukocytosis - Most concerning for infection, given fever and
   tachycardia. Blood and urine cultures were taken in the ED and are
   pending. The patient does not present with any meningeal signs on exam.
   Will continue to monitor his mental status, fever curve and WBC for
   indications of meningitis. He also has a new murmur on exam which has
   not been documented previously.
   -repeat CBC
   -f/u pending cultures
   -ETT to work-up new murmur on exam
   # Asthma - currently stable on exam. Patient taking his own
   albuterol/fluticasone IH.
   .
   # Eczema- restart outpatient topical creams.
   # FEN: IV NS@150cc/hr, monitor electrolytes closely, regular diet as
   tolerated

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety, and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications. He presented with symptoms such as paranoia, fevers, and stiffness. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure of 136/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He has been diagnosed with potential NMS (Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome) and malignant catatonia. His physical examination reveals a new murmur, leukocytosis, and eczema patches on his arms and legs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis raise concerns for an underlying infection. Blood and urine cultures were taken but are pending.
2. Meningitis: Although the patient does not present with meningeal signs on exam, it is still a possibility given the fever and elevated white blood cell count. Monitoring his mental status, fever curve, and WBC count will help assess for meningitis.
3. Cardiac issues: The new murmur on examination should be further evaluated, especially since it has not been documented previously. An echocardiogram (ETT) has been ordered to work-up this new finding.
4. NMS: The patient's initial presentation was concerning for NMS, which is characterized by"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety, and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications. He presented with increasing paranoia, fevers, and stiffness. The patient has been treated with lorazepam (Ativan) for fever and rigidity. Initial presentation was concerning for NMS (Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome) - fever, rigidity, tachycardia, and elevated blood pressure, along with mental status changes. These symptoms have largely improved. The patient's CK (Creatine Kinase) levels have remained stable, while LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) increased. Malignant catatonia, a psychiatric diagnosis, is also considered. The patient shows no signs of meningitis on exam, TSH (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone) is normal, making infection and thyrotoxicosis less likely.

The patient's paranoia has improved since admission with the use of benzo (benzodiazepine). It will be necessary to consult with psychiatry prior to transfer/discharge to ensure appropriate follow-up and recommendations regarding psych medications. The patient's leukocytosis is being monitored for signs of infection. Blood and urine cultures were taken in the ED (Emergency Department) and are pending. A new murmur on exam will be evaluated further with an ETT (Echocardiogram). The patient's asthma is currently stable on exam."

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring due to his unstable condition.

On review of systems, the patient complains of chest pain radiating to the left arm, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.7°C (99.8°F), current temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate 105 bpm (81-127 bpm), blood pressure 136/63 mmHg (81/126-150/112 mmHg), respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute (17-29 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation 100% on room air, and sinus tachycardia on ECG.

The patient is receiving multiple infusions including lorazepam for sedation and other medications for his condition. He has been receiving antibiotics since admission. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 634 mL and output of 1,800 mL since midnight, indicating potential fluid overload.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's blood glucose level is significantly low at 55 mg/dL, which may require correction.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 20 year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety
   and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications presenting with
   increasing paranoia, fevers and stiffness.
   .
   Plan:
   # Fever, rigitidy: Patient remained afebrile overnight and his rigidity
   has improved with ativan. Initial presentation concerning for NMS-
   fever, rigidity, tachycardia and elevated BP, and mental status
   changes, namely catatonia/mutism and paranoia. These have largely
   improved. CK have remained stable, LDH increased. Malignant catatonia,
   a psychiatric diagnosis, also presents in this manner. Patient has no
   signs of meningitis on exam, TSH is normal, which make infection and
   thyrotoxicosis less likely. Per psychiatry patients with low serum iron
   studies have worse prognosis in NMS; patient is slightly anemic.
   - continue IV NS@ 100cc/hr
   - Trend CK, lactate
   - Ativan 2mg IV, would switch to PO today and decrease to [**Hospital1 **]
   - EKG q6h
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   .
   # Paranoia
 Improved significantly since admission. Will touch base
   with psychiatry prior to transfer/discharge to ensure appropriate
   follow-up and recommendations regarding psych medications. Given
   patient's discontinued use of marijuana this could be due to withdrawal
   vs. new onset schizophrenia (increased risk given first degree relative
   with diagnosis)vs. malignant catatonia. Unlikely to be drug related
   given patient's toxicology is negative. Also unlikely is a primary CNS
   mass/hemorrhage given negative CT.
   -treat as above with benzos, avoid neuroleptics
   -f/u any new psych recommendations
   -psych consult
   # Leukocytosis - Most concerning for infection, given fever and
   tachycardia. Blood and urine cultures were taken in the ED and are
   pending. The patient does not present with any meningeal signs on exam.
   Will continue to monitor his mental status, fever curve and WBC for
   indications of meningitis. He also has a new murmur on exam which has
   not been documented previously.
   -repeat CBC
   -f/u pending cultures
   -ETT to work-up new murmur on exam
   # Asthma - currently stable on exam. Would hold off giving albuterol
   standing as pt is still tachycardic.
   # FEN: IV NS@100cc/hr, monitor electrolytes closely, regular diet as
   tolerated
   .
   # Access: PIV
   .
   # PPx:  heparin SC
   .
   # Code:  presumed full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU care for now

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety, and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications. He presented with increasing paranoia, fevers, and stiffness. His initial presentation was concerning for NMS (Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome) due to fever, rigidity, tachycardia, and elevated blood pressure, as well as mental status changes. However, his symptoms have largely improved, except for a slightly elevated LDH level.

Plan:
1. Continue IV normal saline at 100cc/hr.
2. Trend CK and lactate levels.
3. Administer Ativan 2mg IV and switch to PO today, decreasing the dose to [**Hospital1**].
4. Perform EKG every 6 hours.
5. Follow-up blood, urine, and sputum cultures.
6. Trend WBC count fever curve.

2. Improve paranoia:
   - Treat as above with benzos.
   - Avoid neuroleptics.
   - Follow up any new psych recommendations.
   - Psych consult.

3. Leukocytosis:
   - Most concerning for infection, given fever and tachycardia.
   - Blood and urine cultures were taken in the ED and are pending.
   - Monitor mental status, fever curve, and WBC for indications of meningitis.
   - Repeat CBC.

   Assessment and Plan
   23 year old male with asthma, eczema, recent development of anxiety and
   paranoia.
   Worsening paranoia after Seroquel, in combintation with rigid muscle
   tone, fevers, elevated BP's concerning for neuroleptic malignant
   syndrome vs malignant catatonia.
   Throughout the night, he has had intermittent worsening of increased
   tone/tachycardia despite scheduled Ativan. Recurrence at 4 am after
   getting 10 pm dose suggests that Ativan needs to be dosed in shorter
   intervals. Other measures such as CK's, fevers, QT by EKG have not been
   concerning.
   Plan:
   *Change to Ativan 2 mgIV or po Q6h and also q2 h prn
   *Increase volume resuscitation to 150 cc/hour
   *Continue monitoring of ECG's and lactate
   *Psych continuing to follow
   Continue to f/u cultures and Echo

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 23-year-old male with a history of asthma, eczema, and recent development of anxiety and paranoia. The patient has been experiencing worsening paranoia after starting on Seroquel, along with rigid muscle tone, fevers, and elevated blood pressure. These symptoms are concerning for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or malignant catatonia.

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia with a heart rate of 126 beats per minute, slightly elevated blood pressure ranging from 143/60 to 150/112 mmHg, respiratory rate of 44 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's temperature has fluctuated between 36.7°C and 37.7°C.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. The patient has low glucose levels, normal electrolyte levels, and elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and troponin-T. The patient's ECGs will be monitored for any changes.

The plan of care includes changing Ativan to be given intravenously or orally every 6 hours, increasing volume resuscitation, continuing monitoring of ECGs and lactate, and following up with psychiatric consultation. Cultures and an echocardiogram will also be continued.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening NMS or malignant cat"

   Assessment and Plan
   20 year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety and recent
   initiation of antipsychotic medications presenting with increasing
   paranoia, fevers and stiffness.
   #. Intermittent tachycardia
   #. Paranoia
   #. Leukocytosis
   #. Asthma
   Plan:
   # Fever, rigitidy: Patient remained afebrile overnight and his rigidity
   has improved with ativan. Initial presentation concerning for NMS-
   fever, rigidity, tachycardia and elevated BP, and mental status
   changes, namely catatonia/mutism and paranoia. These have largely
   improved. CK have remained stable, LDH increased. Malignant catatonia,
   a psychiatric diagnosis, also presents in this manner. Patient has no
   signs of meningitis on exam, TSH is normal, which make infection and
   thyrotoxicosis less likely. Per psychiatry patients with low serum iron
   studies have worse prognosis in NMS; patient is slightly anemic.
   - IV NS@ 150cc/hr
   - Trend CK, lactate
   - Ativan 0.5-1mg PO q3, 1mg PO PRN and 1mg IV PRN
   - EKG q6h
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count fever curve
   .
   # Paranoia
 Improved since admission with benzo. Will touch base with
   psychiatry prior to transfer/discharge to ensure appropriate follow-up
   and recommendations regarding psych medications. Given patient's
   discontinued use of marijuana this could be due to withdrawal vs. new
   onset schizophrenia (increased risk given first degree relative with
   diagnosis)vs. malignant catatonia. Unlikely to be drug related given
   patient's toxicology is negative. Also unlikely is a primary CNS
   mass/hemorrhage given negative CT.
   -treat as above with benzos, avoid neuroleptics
   -f/u any new psych recommendations
   -psych consult
   # Leukocytosis - Most concerning for infection, given fever and
   tachycardia. Blood and urine cultures were taken in the ED and are
   pending. The patient does not present with any meningeal signs on exam.
   Will continue to monitor his mental status, fever curve and WBC for
   indications of meningitis. He also has a new murmur on exam which has
   not been documented previously.
   -repeat CBC
   -f/u pending cultures
   -ETT to work-up new murmur on exam
   # Asthma - currently stable on exam. Patient taking his own
   albuterol/fluticasone IH.
   .
   # Eczema- restart outpatient topical creams.
   # FEN: IV NS@150cc/hr, monitor electrolytes closely, regular diet as
   tolerated

   Assessment and Plan
   20 year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety and recent
   initiation of antipsychotic medications presenting with increasing
   paranoia, fevers and stiffness.
   #. Intermittent tachycardia
 Sinus tachycardia to 160 last night.
   Unclear etiology.  Per psychiatry, unlikely NMS. Possible malignant
   catatonia which can be associated with autonomic dysfunction. No
   indication of infection. Thyroid function is normal. BUN/creatinine
   does not support that he is dry. Negative tox screen on admission.
   Given beta-blocker last night. As unclear of etiology, will hold off on
   further beta-blocker until hemodynamically unstable.
   -          Continue to monitor on telemetry.
   -          Beta-blocker if tachycardia and hemodynamically unstable.
   -          Ativan standing and prn for anxiety related tachycardia
   -          Encourage good PO intake
   #. Paranoia
 Per psychiatry, patient likely needs to be on
   antipsychotic
 still with paranoia, occasional agitation. Psychiatry
   would like to try Seroquel once again while in hospital
   -          Start Seroquel at low-dose today
   -          Ativan 4mg Q6 standing + Ativan prn with hold parameters
   -          Touch base regarding transfer to psychiatry
   -          Follow-up psychiatry recommendations
   #. Leukocytosis
 Unclear origin. Afebrile since admission to ICU;
   febrile to 100.8 in ED. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures with no
   growth to this point. NMS can be associated with mild leukocytosis;
   unsure if this is the same with malignant catatonia.
   -          Trend WBC count and fever curves
   -          Continue to follow blood, urine, and sputum cultures

","Summary:
The patient is a 20-year-old male with a history of asthma, anxiety, and recent initiation of antipsychotic medications. He presents with symptoms of paranoia, fevers, and stiffness. The patient experienced intermittent tachycardia, with a heart rate reaching up to 160 beats per minute last night. His blood pressure is within normal range. The patient's respiratory support is not required, and his physical examination shows no significant abnormalities. Laboratory results indicate mild leukocytosis, elevated creatine kinase levels, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's mental status is described as alert and oriented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intermittent Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate was elevated to 160 beats per minute last night, which could be a sign of autonomic dysfunction associated with malignant catatonia. Monitoring on telemetry and administration of beta-blockers if tachycardia and hemodynamically unstable are recommended.
2. Paranoia: Despite previous adverse reaction to antipsychotic medications, psychiatry recommends restarting Seroquel at a low dose while in the hospital. Continuing Ativan for anxiety-related tachycardia and encouraging good oral intake are advised.
3. Leukocytosis: The cause of leukocytosis is unclear, and it could potentially be related to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or malignant catatonia. Trending WBC count and fever curves, as well"
