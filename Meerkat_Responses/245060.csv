   Hepatology serologies and iron studies pending
   Imaging: INGS: Note is made that this is a limited study due to the
   patient's body
   habitus. The gallbladder is not distended and there are no gallstones.
   There
   is no gallbladder wall edema and no pericholecystic fluid is seen.
   There is
   no biliary dilatation and the common duct measures 0.6 cm. The portal
   vein is
   patent with hepatopetal flow. No focal or textural abnormality is seen
   within
   the liver; however, the hepatic assessment is limited due to the
   patient's
   body habitus. No ascites is seen in the right upper quadrant.
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of cholecystitis and no biliary dilatation
   seen.
   Microbiology: All cultures NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   50M with uncontrolled HTN admitted for hypertensive emergency
   complicated by hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular
   bleeding. Hospitalization complicated by VAP which was successfully
   treated with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin (also
   empirically for a possible UTI, but no positive cultures). Pt was
   improving clinically and was briefly on the floor, however he developed
   altered mental status due to ventriculitis. He also developed a large
   DVT of the LLE which is impairing circulation and a large R PE.
   Finally, he remains febrile with abdominal pain concerning for
   cholecystitis v pancreatitis.
   .
   # Intraventricular hemorrhage: Believed due to ICH from hypertensive
   emergency. Had significant blood in the ventricles initially. Requires
   ongoing decompression of his ventricles with ventrilostomies.
   - Neurosurgery following. Recommendations greatly appreciated. Pager
   [**Numeric Identifier 3245**]
   - Continue ventriculostomies in place with goal ICP<20cmH2O
   - Continue Phenytoin Sodium (IV) 200 mg IV Q8H as seizure prophylaxis
   - Goal Phenytoin level 15-20 (currently at corrected goal), but will
   d/w NSGY if can switch to keppra w/ LFT abn.
   - Permissive hypertension to SBP between 120-160. d/c
   antihypertensive meds with low BPs last night.  Now off pressors, will
   continue to monitor.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to PE.
   - Intubated for now
   - Treating PE as below
   - tolerating CPAP overnight, will consider extubation today.
   .
   # Pulmonary embolus: Likely from heparin being held in the context of
   intraventricular bleed, stasis, PICC line advanced in the RV, and
   generally poor medical status.
   - Continue heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
   - GI PPx with famotidine
   - IVC filter in place. Will hopefully be removed once recovered from
   the present illness
   - Will eventually requre 3-6 months of AC for provoked DVT
   .
   # LLE DVT: Significant DVT on the L. Concern for vascular compromise
   from back flow venous hypertension.
   - Vascular surgery following. Recommendations appreciated.
   - Keep LLE elevated and wrapped in a compression bandage
   - Heparinize as above for PE
   .
   # Ventriculitis: Elevated CSF WBC. Ventriculostomies in place.
   - Infectious disease following. Recommendations greatly appreciated.
   - Will keep ventriculostomies in place for now and plan to antibiose
   for at least 14 days after tube removal as hardware is a nidus for
   infection
   - Continue vancomycin 1g IV Q12H until at least 14 days after
   ventroculostomy removal. Goal vancomycin level 15-20
   - Continue ceftazidime 2g IV Q8H until at least 14 days after
   ventriculostomy removal
   - CSF and blood cultures pending
   .
   # Fevers: Ventricultiis vs. clot burden likely source of continued
   fevers.  No evidence of acute cholycstitis on ultrasound.  No new
   infiltrates on CXR. Will resend UA/Urince Cx.
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: DDx includes cholecystitis or pancreatitis given
   pain, rising transaminases, elevated lipase, and ? hemoconcentration.
   No cholecystitis on u/s. Has been on dylantin which is hepatotox.c
   - BCx pending
   - Trend transaminases and lipase
   - If lipase rises, will obtain abdominal CT to evaluate pancreatitis
   - IVF
   - Switch propofol to fentanyl plus midazolam for now, discussed with
   NSGY
   - holding TF, more for planned extubation.
   - chekcing hepatitis serologies and for hemachromotosis
   .
   # Hypertension: Will permit SPB between 120-160 for now
   - d/c
d antihypertensive meds
   - now of neo, cont to monitor.
   .
   # Diabetes: HISS
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes on scales, tube feeds held for planned
   extubation and trend lipase.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 50-year-old male with uncontrolled hypertension admitted for hypertensive emergency complicated by hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular bleeding. The patient's hospitalization has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which was successfully treated with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin. The patient was briefly on the floor but developed altered mental status due to ventriculitis. Additionally, he developed a large deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the left lower extremity, impairing circulation, and a large right pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient remains febrile with abdominal pain concerning for cholecystitis versus pancreatitis.

The patient's current medical issues include:
1. Intraventricular hemorrhage: Believed due to intracerebral hemorrhage from hypertensive emergency. Requires ongoing decompression of his ventricles with ventriculostomies.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to PE. Intubated for now. Treating PE as below. Tolerating CPAP overnight, will consider extubation today.
3. Pulmonary embolus: Likely from heparin being held in the context of intraventricular bleed, stasis, PICC line advanced in the right ventricle, and generally poor medical status. Continue heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100. Maintain up-to-date type and"

","The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of hypertension who was admitted to the ICU for a hemorrhagic stroke. He was intubated and transferred to another hospital, where he developed respiratory failure and fever. He was treated with antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was extubated and transferred to the floor, but he continued to have persistent tachypnea and hypoxemia. On December 4th, he was noted to be somnolent, and a CT scan showed improvement in the hemorrhage. However, his temperature increased to 101.3°F, and he was diagnosed with central nervous system (CNS) infection. He was reintubated due to respiratory distress and found to have a large right-sided pulmonary embolism (PE). An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, and he was started on heparin. The patient's condition remains unstable, with ongoing fever and low blood pressure. He has been transferred to the MICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Further deterioration in respiratory function due to the ongoing infection and PE.
2. Development of additional coagulation issues or bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy.
3. Progression of the CNS infection or development of new infections.
4. Hemodynamic instability and potential organ dysfunction.
5. Potential need for surgical intervention, such as embolectomy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of hypertension who was admitted to the ICU for a large intracranial hemorrhage. He was initially intubated and transferred from the emergency department. The patient subsequently developed worsening respiratory failure and fever, leading to the initiation of treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI) with vancomycin and ceftazidime.

The patient was successfully extubated on [**12-1**] and transferred to the floor on [**12-3**]. However, he continued to experience persistent tachypnea and hypoxemia. On [**12-4**], the patient was noted to be somnolent, and a repeat CT scan of the head showed improvement in the hemorrhage. The patient's temperature increased to 101.3°F, and he was treated for presumed ventriculitis with vancomycin and ceftazidime.

On [**12-5**], the patient's blood pressure dropped to the 90s, and lower extremity swelling was observed. An ultrasound revealed extensive lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient was reintubated for respiratory distress, and a pulmonary embolism (PE) was identified on a PE-CT scan. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, and the PICC line was removed due to the presence"

   3. Endotracheal tube terminating 6 cm above the carina.
   4. Bibasilar atelectasis.
   TTE [**12-6**]:
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. On the subcostal short-axis views, the
   overall left ventricular systolic function appears at least mildly
   depressed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
   circumferential. No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic
   collapse is seen.
   IMPRESSION: Normal right ventricular size and global systolic function.
   At least mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Small pericardial
   effusion.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension who was admitted with a hemorrhagic stroke. He underwent a ventriculostomy drain placement and was later found to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's condition worsened, leading to recurrent hypoxemia and the need for reintubation. He was also discovered to have right-sided pulmonary emboli (PEs) and subsequently placed on anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's current condition includes persistent tachypnea and hypoxemia, somnolence, fever, and left lower extremity swelling. Imaging studies revealed extensive deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity and a large right-sided PE. An IVC filter was placed, and the patient's PICC line was removed due to thrombus formation.

The patient's vital signs show fluctuating blood pressures ranging from the 80s to the 160s, tachycardia, and normal oxygen saturation. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated liver enzymes. Imaging findings include a small pericardial effusion, mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and no evidence of pneumothorax or cholecystitis.

The patient's medical team has implemented several interventions, including weaning sedation, checking hypercoagulability panel, and considering extubation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with hypertension and a history of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) admitted to the ICU. He was initially intubated due to worsening respiratory failure and fever, treated with antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was extubated on [**12-1**] but remained tachypneic and hypoxic. On [**12-4**], he became somnolent, and a CT scan showed improvement of the hemorrhage. The patient developed fever, and cultures revealed 250 white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leading to the treatment for presumed ventriculitis with vancomycin and ceftazidime. He also exhibited lower extremity swelling, and an ultrasound confirmed extensive lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient was reintubated for respiratory distress and diagnosed with a large right-sided pulmonary embolism (PE). An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, and the patient was started on heparin without a bolus. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU). On [**12-6**], his fever reached 101.9 degrees, and he experienced hypotension in the 80s overnight, requiring a bolus of 500cc and briefly on neografting, now off. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on [**2170-12-6**] at 10:00 PM and ceftazidime on [**2170-12-7**] at 05:28 AM. His current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, metoprolol, and dilantin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI)
4. Ventriculitis
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
6. Pulmonary embolism (PE)
7. Hypotension
8. Acute respiratory failure
9. Fever

Note: The patient's condition is complex, with multiple medical complications and ongoing management in the ICU. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are crucial to prevent further complications and improve the patient's health status."

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Acute pulmonary emboli involving the right interlobar pulmonary
   artery
   extending into the right lower and middle lobar branches, without
   evidence of
   right cardiac strain. Small-to-moderate pericardial effusion.
   CXR [**12-6**]:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. New right IJ central venous catheter terminating at the mid SVC.
   2. The right PICC is not well visualized on this radiograph, however
   the PICC
   is seen terminating within the right ventricle on the corresponding CTA
   exam
   from earlier today.
   2. No evidence of pneumothorax.
   3. Endotracheal tube terminating 6 cm above the carina.
   4. Bibasilar atelectasis.
   TTE [**12-6**]:
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. On the subcostal short-axis views, the
   overall left ventricular systolic function appears at least mildly
   depressed. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
   circumferential. No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic
   collapse is seen.
   IMPRESSION: Normal right ventricular size and global systolic function.
   At least mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Small pericardial
   effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   50 y o man with HTN, admitted with ICH [**1-15**] HTN emergency, then with
   course c/b VAP, now with R sided PEs
   1. ICH: s/p ventriculostomy drain, with continued output, ICP 5 this
   am.
   - ICP goal < 20
   - Change  to Keppra for SZ prophylaxis
   - goal SBPs 120s-160s per NSG
   2. Respiratory failure: reintubated in a setting of recurrent
   hypoxemia, found to have R sided PEs, rest of lung parenchyma looks
   largely clear, so VAP much improved.  s/p IVC filter, on heparin w/out
   a bolus
   - continue heparin gtt with goal PTT 60-80
   - wean sedation, SBT with potential extubation today
   - check hypercoag panel
   3. Neuro:  sedated now on the [**Last Name (LF) 494**], [**Name8 (MD) **] RN report, was following
   commands earlier today.  LP with neg culture, per ID, c/w
   ventriculitis.
   - wean sedation
   - continue vanco/ceftaz for ventriculitis (hold vanco today given
   trough of 30), check another trough tomorrow
   - f/up ID recs
   - f/up NSG recs re: ventriculostomy drain
   4. Fever: s/p course for VAP, now with known DVT/PE, resolving VAP, and
   likely ventriculitis per ID.  LFTs [**Last Name (LF) 548**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]/lipase up, RUQ w/out
   cholecystitis.  ?[**1-15**] dilantin,
   - trend LFTs/[**Doctor First Name **]/lipase
   - limit Tylenol to 2gm/day
   - f/up hepatitis serologies
   5. Hypotension: BPs in the 80s o/n, briefly on neo overnight, now off.
   CTA with pericardial effusion.  No RH strain by exam. TTE yesterday
   with small pericardial effusion
   - Monitor BPs, consider repeat TTE if recurrent HoTN
   6. ARF:  ?CIN given contrast load for PE-CT, slow rise today.  Got
   bicarb and mucomyst yesterday.
   - check UA, UCx, urine lytes
   - check urine sediment
   - monitor UOP

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension, who was admitted with an intracranial hemorrhage. He underwent a ventriculostomy drain and was later found to have worsening respiratory failure and fever, for which he was treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ciprofloxacin for urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was extubated on [**12-1**] and transferred to the floor, but continued to experience tachypnea and hypoxemia. On [**12-4**], the patient was noted to be somnolent, and a CT scan of the head showed improvement in the hemorrhage. However, the patient's temperature increased to 101.3, and he was started on treatment for presumed ventriculitis with vancomycin and ceftazidime. He also developed hypotension, leading to the placement of an IVC filter and removal of a PICC line due to thrombus. The patient was reintubated for respiratory distress and found to have a large right-sided pulmonary embolism (PE) on a PE-CT. He was transferred to the MICU.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of hypertension, admitted to the hospital with a hemorrhagic stroke. He was intubated, underwent ventriculostomy, and was transferred to the SICU. The patient developed respiratory failure and fever, treated with antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI). He was extubated on [**12-1**], transferred to the floor on [**12-3**], but continued to have persistent tachypnea and hypoxemia. On [**12-4**], he was noted to be somnolent, and a CT scan showed improvement of the hemorrhage. The patient's temperature increased to 101.3°F, and he was found to have a central nervous system infection with 250 white blood cells (WBCs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but cultures were negative. He also had hypotension in the 90s and lower extremity swelling, which revealed extensive lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on ultrasound. The patient experienced respiratory distress and was reintubated. A pulmonary embolism (PE) was confirmed on a PE-CT scan. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, and the PICC line was removed due to thrombus formation. The patient was started on heparin without a bolus and was transferred"

   50M with uncontrolled HTN admitted for hypertensive emergency
   complicated by hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular
   bleeding. Hospitalization complicated by VAP which was successfully
   treated with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin (also
   empirically for a possible UTI, but no positive cultures). Pt was
   improving clinically and was briefly on the floor, however he developed
   altered mental status due to ventriculitis. He also developed a large
   DVT of the LLE which is impairing circulation and a large R PE.
   Finally, he remains febrile with abdominal pain concerning for
   cholecystitis v pancreatitis.
   .
   # Intraventricular hemorrhage: Believed due to ICH from hypertensive
   emergency. Had significant blood in the ventricles initially. Requires
   ongoing decompression of his ventricles with ventrilostomies.
   - Neurosurgery following. Recommendations greatly appreciated. Pager
   [**Numeric Identifier 3245**]
   - Continue ventriculostomies in place with goal ICP<20cmH2O
   - Continue Phenytoin Sodium (IV) 200 mg IV Q8H as seizure prophylaxis
   - Goal Phenytoin level 15-20 (currently at corrected goal), but will

   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to PE.
   - Intubated for now
   - Treating PE as below
   - tolerating CPAP overnight, will consider extubation today.
   .
   # Pulmonary embolus: Likely from heparin being held in the context of
   intraventricular bleed, stasis, PICC line advanced in the RV, and
   generally poor medical status.
   - Continue heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
   - GI PPx with famotidine
   - IVC filter in place. Will hopefully be removed once recovered from
   the present illness
   - Will eventually requre 3-6 months of AC for provoked DVT
   .
   # LLE DVT: Significant DVT on the L. Concern for vascular compromise
   from back flow venous hypertension.
   - Vascular surgery following. Recommendations appreciated.
   - Keep LLE elevated and wrapped in a compression bandage
   - Heparinize as above for PE
   .
   # Ventriculitis: Elevated CSF WBC. Ventriculostomies in place.
   - Infectious disease following. Recommendations greatly appreciated.
   - Will keep ventriculostomies in place for now and plan to antibiose
   for at least 14 days after tube removal as hardware is a nidus for
   infection
   - Continue vancomycin 1g IV Q12H until at least 14 days after
   ventroculostomy removal. Goal vancomycin level 15-20

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of uncontrolled hypertension, who was admitted for a hypertensive emergency complicated by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subsequent ventriculitis. He developed a large deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the left lower extremity and a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient also remains febrile with abdominal pain, possibly due to cholecystitis or pancreatitis. He is currently extubated and on minimal oxygen requirements.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Intraventricular hemorrhage: Ventriculostomies in place to decompress the ventricles and maintain intracranial pressure below 20 cmH2O.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Intubated, tolerating CPAP, considering extubation today.
3. Pulmonary embolism: Treating with heparin drip, maintaining up-to-date type and screen, GI prophylaxis with famotidine, IVC filter in place.
4. Left lower extremity DVT: Elevation and compression bandage applied.
5. Ventriculitis: Infectious disease following recommended, continue vancomycin and ceftazidime until at least 14 days after ventriculostomy removal.
6. Fevers: Source likely from ventriculitis or clot burden. No evidence of acute cholecystitis on ultrasound.

 HYPERTENSION, MALIGNANT (HYPERTENSIVE CRISIS, HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY)
   50M with uncontrolled HTN admitted for hypertensive emergency
   complicated by hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular
   bleeding. Hospitalization complicated by VAP which was successfully
   treated with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin (also
   empirically for a possible UTI, but no positive cultures). Pt was
   improving clinically and was briefly on the floor, however he developed
   altered mental status due to ventriculitis. He also developed a large
   DVT of the LLE which is impairing circulation and a large R PE.
   Finally, he remains febrile with abdominal pain concerning for
   cholecystitis v pancreatitis.
   .
   # Intraventricular hemorrhage: Believed due to ICH from hypertensive
   emergency. Had significant blood in the ventricles initially. Requires
   ongoing decompression of his ventricles with ventrilostomies.
   - Neurosurgery following. Recommendations greatly appreciated. Pager
   [**Numeric Identifier 3245**]
   - Continue ventriculostomies in place with goal ICP<20cmH2O
   - Continue Phenytoin Sodium (IV) 200 mg IV Q8H as seizure prophylaxis
   - Goal Phenytoin level 15-20 (currently at corrected goal), but will
   d/w NSGY if can switch to keppra w/ LFT abn.
   - Permissive hypertension to SBP between 120-160. d/c
   antihypertensive meds with low BPs last night.  Now off pressors, will
   continue to monitor.
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to PE.
   - Intubated for now
   - Treating PE as below
   - tolerating CPAP overnight, will consider extubation today.
   .
   # Pulmonary embolus: Likely from heparin being held in the context of
   intraventricular bleed, stasis, PICC line advanced in the RV, and
   generally poor medical status.
   - Continue heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
   - GI PPx with famotidine
   - IVC filter in place. Will hopefully be removed once recovered from
   the present illness
   - Will eventually requre 3-6 months of AC for provoked DVT
   .
   # LLE DVT: Significant DVT on the L. Concern for vascular compromise
   from back flow venous hypertension.
   - Vascular surgery following. Recommendations appreciated.
   - Keep LLE elevated and wrapped in a compression bandage
   - Heparinize as above for PE
   .
   # Ventriculitis: Elevated CSF WBC. Ventriculostomies in place.
   - Infectious disease following. Recommendations greatly appreciated.
   - Will keep ventriculostomies in place for now and plan to antibiose
   for at least 14 days after tube removal as hardware is a nidus for
   infection
   - Continue vancomycin 1g IV Q12H until at least 14 days after
   ventroculostomy removal. Goal vancomycin level 15-20
   - Continue ceftazidime 2g IV Q8H until at least 14 days after
   ventriculostomy removal
   - CSF and blood cultures pending
   .
   # Fevers: Ventricultiis vs. clot burden likely source of continued
   fevers.  No evidence of acute cholycstitis on ultrasound.  No new
   infiltrates on CXR. Will resend UA/Urince Cx.
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: DDx includes cholecystitis or pancreatitis given
   pain, rising transaminases, elevated lipase, and ? hemoconcentration.
   No cholecystitis on u/s. Has been on dylantin which is hepatotox.c
   - BCx pending
   - Trend transaminases and lipase
   - If lipase rises, will obtain abdominal CT to evaluate pancreatitis
   - IVF
   - Switch propofol to fentanyl plus midazolam for now, discussed with
   NSGY
   - holding TF, more for planned extubation.
   - chekcing hepatitis serologies and for hemachromotosis

   50M with uncontrolled HTN admitted for hypertensive emergency
   complicated by hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular
   bleeding. Hospitalization complicated by VAP which was successfully
   treated with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin (also
   empirically for a possible UTI, but no positive cultures),
   ventriculits, and DVT/PE.
   # Intraventricular hemorrhage/Hypertension: Believed due to ICH from
   hypertensive emergency. Had significant blood in the ventricles
   initially. Requires ongoing decompression of his ventricles with
   ventrilostomies.
   - Neurosurgery following. Recommendations greatly appreciated. Pager
   [**Numeric Identifier 3245**]
   - Continue ventriculostomies in place with goal ICP<20cmH2O
   - Change Pheytoin to Keppra given LFT abnormalities. Plan to increase
   Keppra to 1g [**Hospital1 7**] tommorow
   - Goal SBP less than 170 mmHg. Start clonidine patch 0.2 td and
   consider metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**] if pressure tolerates. When renal
   function stabilizes ace/betablocker combination may be effective
   without clonidine
   - Q2 hour neuro checks
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to PE. Completed VAP course
   already. Now extubated and on minimal oxygenation. [**Month (only) 51**] also have a
   component of fluid overload based on CXR.
   - Supplelmental O2 via NC for now
   - lasix 20 mg IV x1 with goal net negative 1 L
   .
   # Pulmonary embolus: Likely from heparin being held in the context of
   intraventricular bleed, stasis, PICC line advanced in the RV, and
   generally poor medical status.
   - Continue heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100 given possible upcoming
   procedures
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
   - GI PPx with famotidine
   - IVC filter in place. Will hopefully be removed once recovered from
   the present illness
   - Will eventually requre 3-6 months of AC for provoked DVT

   # LLE DVT: Significant DVT on the L. Concern for vascular compromise
   from back flow venous hypertension.
   - Vascular surgery following. Recommendations appreciated.
   - Keep LLE elevated and wrapped in a compression bandage
   - Heparinize as above for PE
   .
   # Ventriculitis: Elevated CSF WBC. Ventriculostomies in place.
   Infectious disease following. Recommendations greatly appreciated.
   - Will keep ventriculostomies in place for now and plan to antibiose
   for at least 14 days after tube removal as hardware is a nidus for
   infection
   - Continue vancomycin 1.25 daily  until at least 14 days after
   ventroculostomy removal. Goal vancomycin level 15-20
   - Continue ceftazidime 2g IV Q8H until at least 14 days after
   ventriculostomy removal
   - CSF and blood cultures pending

   # Acute renal failure: Thought to be due to contrast nephropathy. Cr
   improved from 1.8 to 1.5. Also urine positive for eos in the setting of
   betalactam use, raising suspicion for AIN.
   - Trend Cr daily
   - Peripheral CBC with diff
   - If Cr worsens, may need to consider stopping betalactam
   .
   # LFT abnormalities: Improving markedly and may have been related to
   phenytoin/propafol vs shock liver.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of uncontrolled hypertension, admitted for a hypertensive emergency complicated by intraventricular hemorrhage (ICH) and respiratory failure. The patient has also been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity, ventriculitis, acute renal failure, and liver function abnormalities. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypertensive crisis or emergency: The patient's history of uncontrolled hypertension increases the risk of malignant hypertension, which can lead to further complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or organ damage.
2. Ventriculitis: The elevated CSF WBC indicates an infection in the ventricles, which may require prolonged antibiotic treatment and monitoring for signs of meningitis or brain abscess.
3. DVT/PE: The patient has been diagnosed with DVT and PE. If left untreated, there is a risk of further clot formation and potential embolization to other organs, leading to complications such as acute pulmonary hypertension or stroke.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, which can be caused by various factors such as contrast nephropathy or drug-induced nephrotoxicity. Monitoring renal function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly is essential to prevent further deterioration.
5. Liver function abnormalities: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate drug-induced hepatotoxic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension who was admitted with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and respiratory failure. The patient underwent a ventriculostomy drain for ICH and was treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient also had deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), for which an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Intracranial hemorrhage: The patient has a ventriculostomy drain with continued output, and intracranial pressure (ICP) is maintained at 10-11 mmHg. Keppra is being given for seizure prophylaxis, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) goals are set between 120s-160s per neurosurgeon's recommendation.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was reintubated due to recurrent hypoxemia and was found to have right-sided PEs. The rest of the lung parenchyma appears largely clear, indicating improvement in VAP. The patient is extubated and on 4L nasal cannula oxygen. The target body temperature below (TBB) is to be reduced by 500 cc today, and heparin gtt will continue with a goal partial thromboplastin time (PTT"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of hypertension (HTN) who was admitted with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and emergency HTN. He underwent ventriculostomy drain placement and developed worsening respiratory failure, fever, and was treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was extubated twice but required reintubation due to worsening respiratory failure. He was found to have deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), for which an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed. The patient's medical history includes hypertension, stroke, and alcohol abuse.

24-hour events include extubation, initiation of non-invasive ventilation, improvement in mental status, discontinuation of dilantin due to elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and initiation of levetiracetam (Keppra) for seizure prophylaxis. The patient received prn hydralazine and metoprolol for blood pressure control overnight.

Assessment and Plan:
1. ICH: The patient has ongoing intraventricular hemorrhage with continued drain output. The target intracranial pressure (ICP) is less than 20 mmHg. Keppra will be increased to 1000 mg per day, and blood pressure goals will be relaxed per neurosurgical consultation.
2. Respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of hypertension, admitted with an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in the setting of hypertensive emergency. He underwent ventriculostomy drain placement and was initially intubated due to worsening respiratory failure and fever. He was treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI), and then extubated. However, he required reintubation for worsening respiratory failure and was found to have a right-sided pulmonary embolism (PE). An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, and he is currently on heparin without a bolus. He is extubated again and now on 4L nasal cannula.

Assessment and Plan:
1. ICH: The patient had a large intracranial hemorrhage and underwent ventriculostomy drain placement. His intracranial pressure (ICP) is within goal range.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has recurrent hypoxemia and was reintubated. He has right-sided PEs, but the rest of his lung parenchyma looks largely clear. His VAP is much improved.
3. Neuro: The patient is sedated and was following commands earlier today. A lumbar puncture with negative culture was performed, indicating ventriculitis. Vancomycin levels are high, so the dose was changed to 1250 daily. He"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old man with a history of hypertension, who was admitted with a hemorrhagic stroke in the setting of an emergency. He required intubation and was transferred to [**Hospital1**], where he underwent a ventriculostomy drain. The patient then developed worsening respiratory failure and fever, for which he was treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection (UTI). He was extubated but later reintubated due to worsening respiratory failure. Additionally, he was found to have deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE), for which an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed. The patient is currently extubated again and on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, intracranial hemorrhage, respiratory failure, fever, DVT/PE, and ventriculitis. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/73 to 180/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His ICP is within the target range of 10-11 mmHg, and his sedation level is currently on [**Doctor Last Name 533**].

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes. His electrolytes and renal function tests are within normal limits. The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin, fentanyl, metoprolol, hydralazine, and phenytoin (Keppra) for seizure prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intracranial Hypertension (ICH): The patient's ICP is being closely monitored, and measures are in place to keep it below 20 mmHg. However, there is still a risk of increased ICP due to the ongoing drain output and potential complications from the ventriculostomy.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Although the patient's VAP has improved significantly, there is still a risk of recurrent infection or progression of the current condition. Antibiotics have been prescribed, and the patient's response to treatment will be closely monitored.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism (DVT/PE): The patient has been diagnosed with DVT/PE, and appropriate anticoagulation therapy with heparin has been initiated. An IVC filter has also been placed to prevent further pulmonary emboli. Regular monitoring of the patient's coagulation profile and follow-up hypercoagulability panel are recommended.

4. Ventriculitis:"

","The patient is a 50-year-old man with hypertension, who was admitted with a hemorrhagic stroke in the setting of a hypertensive emergency. He was intubated and underwent a ventriculostomy drain placement. The patient then developed worsening respiratory failure, fever, and was treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI). He was extubated but required reintubation due to worsening respiratory failure. The patient was found to have deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), for which an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed. He is currently extubated and on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, and he has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin and ceftazidime. He is receiving heparin sodium intravenously, as well as fentanyl, metoprolol, and hydralazine for blood pressure control.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.7 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 150/73 to 180/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula.

The patient's respiratory status improved, but he developed right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). He was given an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter and started on heparin without a bolus. The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, likely due to ventriculitis, which is being treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime. He also has leg swelling and hypotension, which could be related to the clot burden. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, and there is a concern for possible drug-induced liver injury or hepatitis. The patient's kidney function is also impaired, possibly due to acute kidney injury (ARF) from contrast exposure during the PE-CT. The patient's blood pressure remains low, and there is a concern for possible cardiac issues, such as pericardial effusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of hypertension, who was admitted to the ICU with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and respiratory failure. The patient underwent ventriculostomy drainage and was treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was extubated on 12/1 but continued to experience persistent tachypnea and hypoxemia. On 12/4, the patient was noted to be somnolent, and a CT scan showed improvement in the hemorrhage. The patient's temperature rose to 101.3, and he was treated for presumed ventriculitis with vancomycin and ceftazidime. The patient developed hypotension in the 90s and lower extremity swelling, with an ultrasound revealing extensive lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient was reintubated due to respiratory distress and found to have a large right-sided pulmonary embolism (PE) on a CT scan. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, and a PICC line was removed due to thrombosis. The patient was started on heparin without a bolus and transferred to the MICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventriculitis: The patient's fever and altered mental status raise concern for ventriculitis, especially considering the presence of WBCs"

   parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. Unchanged position of right
   central

   Assessment and Plan
   50M with uncontrolled HTN admitted for hypertensive emergency
   complicated by hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular
   bleeding. Hospitalization complicated by VAP which was successfully
   treated with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin (also
   empirically for a possible UTI, but no positive cultures),
   ventriculits, and DVT/PE.
   # Intraventricular hemorrhage/Hypertension: Believed due to ICH from
   hypertensive emergency. Had significant blood in the ventricles
   initially. Requires ongoing decompression of his ventricles with
   ventrilostomies.
   - Neurosurgery following. Recommendations greatly appreciated. Pager
   [**Numeric Identifier 3245**]
   - Continue ventriculostomies in place with goal ICP<20cmH2O
   - Change Pheytoin to Keppra given LFT abnormalities. Plan to increase
   Keppra to 1g [**Hospital1 7**] tommorow
   - Goal SBP less than 170 mmHg. Start clonidine patch 0.2 td and
   consider metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**] if pressure tolerates. When renal
   function stabilizes ace/betablocker combination may be effective
   without clonidine
   - Q2 hour neuro checks
   .
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to PE. Completed VAP course
   already. Now extubated and on minimal oxygenation. [**Month (only) 51**] also have a
   component of fluid overload based on CXR.
   - Supplelmental O2 via NC for now
   - lasix 20 mg IV x1 with goal net negative 1 L
   .
   # Pulmonary embolus: Likely from heparin being held in the context of
   intraventricular bleed, stasis, PICC line advanced in the RV, and
   generally poor medical status.
   - Continue heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100 given possible upcoming
   procedures
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
   - GI PPx with famotidine
   - IVC filter in place. Will hopefully be removed once recovered from
   the present illness
   - Will eventually requre 3-6 months of AC for provoked DVT
   - f/u hypercoaguable workup
 Factor V, antithrombin pending
   .
   # LLE DVT: Significant DVT on the L. Concern for vascular compromise
   from back flow venous hypertension.
   - Vascular surgery following. Recommendations appreciated.
   - Keep LLE elevated and wrapped in a compression bandage
   - Heparinize as above for PE
   .
   # Ventriculitis: Elevated CSF WBC. Ventriculostomies in place.
   Infectious disease following. Recommendations greatly appreciated.
   - Will keep ventriculostomies in place for now and plan to antibiose
   for at least 14 days after tube removal as hardware is a nidus for
   infection
   - Continue vancomycin 1.25 daily  until at least 14 days after
   ventroculostomy removal. Goal vancomycin level 15-20
   - Continue ceftazidime 2g IV Q8H until at least 14 days after
   ventriculostomy removal
   - CSF and blood cultures pending
   # Acute renal failure: Thought to be due to contrast nephropathy. Cr
   improved from 1.8 to 1.5. Also urine positive for eos in the setting of
   betalactam use, raising suspicion for AIN.
   - Trend Cr daily
   - Peripheral CBC with diff
   - If Cr worsens, may need to consider stopping betalactam
   # LFT abnormalities: Improving markedly and may have been related to
   phenytoin/propafol vs shock liver.
   - Dilantin changed to keppra as noted above
   - Trend LFts and lipase
   - BCx pending
   - Trend transaminases and lipase

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with uncontrolled hypertension admitted for hypertensive emergency complicated by hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular bleeding. The patient has been hospitalized with various complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventriculitis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), and left lower extremity DVT. The patient's current condition includes ongoing decompression of ventricles with ventriculostomies, controlled hypertension, hypoxic respiratory failure, pulmonary embolus, left lower extremity DVT, ventriculitis, acute renal failure, and liver function abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intraventricular hemorrhage/hypertension: The patient has significant blood in the ventricles initially due to hypertensive emergency, leading to intraventricular hemorrhage. Ongoing decompression of ventricles with ventriculostomies is required.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient likely has hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary embolism. The patient is extubated and on minimal oxygenation.

3. Pulmonary embolus: The patient has a likely pulmonary embolism, which could be due to factors such as heparin being held in the context of intraventricular bleed, stasis, PICC line advanced in the right ventricle, and poor medical status.

   removed.
   Plan to start 1g [**Hospital1 7**] keppra [**12-9**]
   NS may remove drains monday. Goal BP ""normotensive""
   Added 12.5mg metoprolol to regimen for slightly better control.
   O2 req. up slightly this am. CXR looks wet. Got 20mg IV lasix and
   didn't respond great so got 40mg IV.
   Urine eos positive and diff with 5% eos but cr. trending down, if going
   back up consider AIN and get rid of Ceftaz.
   Tolerating clear liqs but not wanting much of them.
   Right drain with some decreased output throughout the day, per NS it
   still drains well when put to gravity so no occlusion, just decreased

   Imaging: CXR [**12-8**]:
   As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
   change. Moderate cardiomegaly with minimal overhydration. Decrease of
   retrocardiac atelectasis. No evidence of pleural effusions, no focal
   parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. Unchanged position of right
   central
   venous access line.
   Assessment and Plan
   50M with uncontrolled HTN admitted for hypertensive emergency
   complicated by hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular
   bleeding. Hospitalization complicated by VAP which was successfully
   treated with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin (also
   empirically for a possible UTI, but no positive cultures),
   ventriculits, and DVT/PE.
   # Intraventricular hemorrhage/Hypertension: Believed due to ICH from
   hypertensive emergency. Had significant blood in the ventricles
   initially. Requires ongoing decompression of his ventricles with
   ventrilostomies.
   - Neurosurgery following. Recommendations greatly appreciated. Pager
   [**Numeric Identifier 3245**]
   - Continue ventriculostomies in place with goal ICP<20cmH2O, raised to
   20cm.  Plan for repeat NCHCT in am, if stable, will put to clam with
   repeat imaging
   - increase Keppra to 1g [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Goal SBP less than 170 mmHg. Back on clonidine patch 0.2 td and
   increasing  metoprolol 25  mg [**Hospital1 7**] if pressure tolerates. When renal
   function stabilizes ace/betablocker combination may be effective
   without clonidine
   - Q2 hour neuro checks
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to PE. Completed VAP course
   already. Now extubated and on minimal oxygenation. [**Month (only) 51**] also have a
   component of fluid overload based on CXR.
   - Supplelmental O2 via NC for now
   - Heparing gtt for PE
   .
   # Pulmonary embolus: Likely from heparin being held in the context of
   intraventricular bleed, stasis, PICC line advanced in the RV, and
   generally poor medical status.
   - Continue heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100 given possible upcoming
   procedures
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
   - GI PPx with famotidine
   - IVC filter in place. Will hopefully be removed once recovered from
   the present illness
   - Will eventually requre 3-6 months of AC for provoked DVT
   - f/u hypercoaguable workup
 Factor V, antithrombin pending
   .
   # LLE DVT: Significant DVT on the L. Concern for vascular compromise
   from back flow venous hypertension.
   - Vascular surgery following. Recommendations appreciated.
   - Keep LLE elevated and wrapped in a compression bandage
   - Heparinize as above for PE
   # Ventriculitis: Elevated CSF WBC. Ventriculostomies in place.
   Infectious disease following. Recommendations greatly appreciated.
   - Will keep ventriculostomies in place for now and plan to antibiose
   for at least 14 days after tube removal as hardware is a nidus for
   infection
   - Continue vancomycin 1.25 daily  until at least 14 days after
   ventroculostomy removal. Goal vancomycin level 15-20
   - Continue ceftazidime 2g IV Q8H until at least 14 days after
   ventriculostomy removal
   - CSF and blood cultures pending
   # Acute renal failure: Thought to be due to contrast nephropathy. Cr
   improved from 1.8 to 1.5. Also urine positive for eos in the setting of
   betalactam use, raising suspicion for AIN.
   - Trend Cr daily
   - Peripheral CBC with diff
   - If Cr worsens, may need to consider stopping betalactam
   - resent UA today
   # LFT abnormalities: Improving markedly and may have been related to
   phenytoin/propafol vs shock liver.
   - Dilantin changed to keppra as noted above
   - Trend LFts and lipase

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 50-year-old male admitted for a hypertensive emergency complicated by hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular bleeding. The patient has also been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventriculitis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), left lower extremity DVT, and acute renal failure.

Summary:
- Patient is extubated and on minimal oxygenation.
- Goal blood pressure is normotensive.
- Right drain output is decreased, but there is no occlusion.
- Urine eosinophils positive with a trend of improving creatinine levels.
- The patient's left lower extremity is wrapped with an ACE wrap due to DVT.
- Ventriculostomies in place for ongoing decompression of ventricles.
- Heparin drip continues for PE treatment.
- IVC filter is in place and will be removed once recovered.
- Antibiotic regimen includes vancomycin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin.
- Acute renal failure is thought to be due to contrast nephropathy.
- Liver function tests are improving and may have been related to phenytoin/propofol use.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male who was admitted with an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subsequent ventriculostomy drains. The patient has had recent hospital events including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis (PE/DVT), and ventriculitis. The patient's respiratory status is improving, but the mental status (MS) continues to fluctuate, requiring frequent neurological checks.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is currently on oxygen, and the plan is to wean off as tolerated. Diuretics are being used slowly to manage fluid balance.
2. Constipation (Obstipation, FOS): The patient's bowel regimen will continue to be monitored for signs of constipation.
3. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient is on a sliding scale for insulin management.
4. Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH): The patient has raised drains up to the 20th thiamine level, and a follow-up CT scan is planned today. Keppra dosage has been increased to 1g, and the patient remains intermittently very somnolent. Close monitoring is ongoing.
5. Hypertension, Malignant (Hypertensive Crisis, Hypertensive Emergency): The patient's blood pressure is being titrated up with a beta-blocker.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU. They have been experiencing various health issues, including hypoxia, constipation, diabetes mellitus, intracerebral hemorrhage, hypertension, renal failure, and dysphagia. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with elevated blood pressure and heart rate. They have also shown signs of respiratory distress and require supplemental oxygen. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, abnormal kidney function, and other abnormalities. The patient is receiving multiple medications and interventions, including heparin, antibiotics, diuretics, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a risk of hypoxia. This could lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not managed promptly.
2. Constipation: The patient's difficulty in passing stool can increase the risk of complications such as fecal impaction, which may require manual disimpaction or enemas.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's elevated blood glucose levels and the presence of ketones in the blood or urine suggest the possibility of DKA. If left untreated, it can lead to severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and acidosis.
4. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH): The patient's elevated intracranial pressure and neurological symptoms indicate a risk of ICH progression. This could lead to increased intracranial pressure, brain herniation,"

   - Continue ventriculostomies in place with goal ICP<20cmH2O, raised to
   20cm.  Plan for repeat NCHCT in am, if stable, will put to clam with
   repeat imaging
   - increase Keppra to 1g [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Goal SBP less than 170 mmHg. Back on clonidine patch 0.2 td and
   increasing  metoprolol 25  mg [**Hospital1 7**] if pressure tolerates. When renal
   function stabilizes ace/betablocker combination may be effective
   without clonidine
   - Q2 hour neuro checks
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to PE. Completed VAP course
   already. Now extubated and on minimal oxygenation. [**Month (only) 51**] also have a
   component of fluid overload based on CXR.
   - Supplelmental O2 via NC for now
   - Heparing gtt for PE
   # Pulmonary embolus: Likely from heparin being held in the context of
   intraventricular bleed, stasis, PICC line advanced in the RV, and
   generally poor medical status.
   - Continue heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100 given possible upcoming
   procedures
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
   - GI PPx with famotidine
   - IVC filter in place. Will hopefully be removed once recovered from
   the present illness

   # LLE DVT: Significant DVT on the L. Concern for vascular compromise
   from back flow venous hypertension.
   - Vascular surgery following. Recommendations appreciated.
   - Keep LLE elevated and wrapped in a compression bandage
   - Heparinize as above for PE
   # Ventriculitis: Elevated CSF WBC. Ventriculostomies in place.
   Infectious disease following. Recommendations greatly appreciated.
   - Will keep ventriculostomies in place for now and plan to antibiose
   for at least 14 days after tube removal as hardware is a nidus for
   infection
   - Continue vancomycin 1.25 daily  until at least 14 days after
   ventroculostomy removal. Goal vancomycin level 15-20
   - Continue ceftazidime 2g IV Q8H until at least 14 days after
   ventriculostomy removal
   - CSF and blood cultures pending
   # Acute renal failure: Thought to be due to contrast nephropathy. Cr
   improved from 1.8 to 1.5. Also urine positive for eos in the setting of
   betalactam use, raising suspicion for AIN.
   - Trend Cr daily
   - Peripheral CBC with diff
   - If Cr worsens, may need to consider stopping betalactam
   - resent UA today
   # LFT abnormalities: Improving markedly and may have been related to
   phenytoin/propafol vs shock liver.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with uncontrolled hypertension who was admitted for a hypertensive emergency complicated by hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular bleeding. During hospitalization, he developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which was successfully treated with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin. He also had ventriculitis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypertensive emergency with intraventricular hemorrhage: The patient's uncontrolled hypertension led to a hemorrhagic stroke, causing bleeding in the basal ganglia and ventricles. Ongoing monitoring and management are required to prevent further complications.

2. Ventriculitis: The elevated white blood cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) suggests an infection in the ventricles. Antibiotic therapy is necessary, and the presence of ventriculostomies helps to drain the infected CSF.

3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient likely developed PE due to prolonged immobilization, a PICC line advanced into the right ventricle, and poor medical status. Anticoagulation therapy is essential, and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed. Long-term anticoagulation may be required.

4. Deep vein thrombosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   50M with uncontrolled HTN admitted for hypertensive emergency
   complicated by hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular
   bleeding. Hospitalization complicated by VAP which was successfully
   treated with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin (also
   empirically for a possible UTI, but no positive cultures),
   ventriculits, and DVT/PE.
   # Intraventricular hemorrhage/Hypertension: Believed due to ICH from
   hypertensive emergency. Had significant blood in the ventricles
   initially. Requires ongoing decompression of his ventricles with
   ventrilostomies.
   - Neurosurgery following. Recommendations greatly appreciated. Pager
   [**Numeric Identifier 3245**]
   - Continue ventriculostomies in place with goal ICP<20cmH2O, raised to
   20cm.  Plan for repeat NCHCT in am, if stable, will put to clamp with
   repeat imaging
   - increase Keppra to 1g [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Goal SBP less than 170 mmHg. Back on clonidine patch 0.2 td and
   increasing  metoprolol 25  mg [**Hospital1 7**] if pressure tolerates. When renal
   function stabilizes ace/betablocker combination may be effective
   without clonidine
   - Q2 hour neuro checks
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to PE. Completed VAP course
   already. Now extubated and on minimal oxygenation. [**Month (only) 51**] also have a
   component of fluid overload based on CXR.
   - Supplelmental O2 via NC for now
   - Heparin gtt for PE
   # Pulmonary embolus: Likely from heparin being held in the context of
   intraventricular bleed, stasis, PICC line advanced in the RV, and
   generally poor medical status.
   - Continue heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100 given possible upcoming
   procedures
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
   - GI PPx with famotidine
   - IVC filter in place. Will hopefully be removed once recovered from
   the present illness
   - Will eventually requre 3-6 months of AC for provoked DVT
   - f/u hypercoaguable workup

   - Keep LLE elevated and wrapped in a compression bandage
   - Heparinize as above for PE
   # Ventriculitis: Elevated CSF WBC. Ventriculostomies in place.
   Infectious disease following. Recommendations greatly appreciated.
   - Will keep ventriculostomies in place for now and plan to antibiose
   for at least 14 days after tube removal as hardware is a nidus for
   infection
   - Continue vancomycin 1.25 daily  until at least 14 days after
   ventroculostomy removal. Goal vancomycin level 15-20
   - Continue ceftazidime 2g IV Q8H until at least 14 days after
   ventriculostomy removal

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history includes:

1. Uncontrolled hypertension leading to a hypertensive emergency and subsequent hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular bleeding.
2. Ventriculitis, which is an infection of the brain's ventricles, likely due to the presence of a ventriculostomy tube.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE) caused by heparin being held, stasis, PICC line advancement in the right ventricle, and poor medical status.
4. Left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
5. Acute renal failure, possibly due to contrast nephropathy.
6. Liver function test abnormalities.
7. Diabetes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of intraventricular hemorrhage/hypertension, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potential brain herniation.
2. Ventriculitis progressing to meningitis or abscess formation.
3. Pulmonary embolism worsening and causing hypoxic respiratory failure.
4. Deep vein thrombosis developing into a pulmonary embolism.
5. Acute renal failure worsening, potentially requiring dialysis.
6. Liver function test abnormalities progressing to hepatic encephalopathy or fulminant hepatic failure.
7. Poor glycemic control in the context of diabetes.

These are potential complications based on the patient's current condition and medical history."

","The patient is a 50-year-old male admitted with a hypertensive emergency and basal ganglia bleed. He initially received NSGY service and had bilateral ventricular drains placed. The patient was intubated and treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), eventually being extubated. Subsequently, he was found to have a large pulmonary embolism (PE) along with upper and lower extremity deep vein thromboses (DVTs). An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, and the patient is currently on a heparin drip with therapeutic anticoagulation.

The patient's recent events include a repeat head CT today, with plans to remove the ventriculostomy drain if no significant change is observed. The dose of metoprolol has been increased to 25 mg three times a day.

The patient has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics, ceftazidime and vancomycin, were administered on 12/09.

The patient's current infusions include heparin sodium at a rate of 2,000 units per hour. Other ICU medications include hydralazine, metoprolol, and famotidine (Pepcid).

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the mentioned events. Flow sheet data as of 12/10/20 indicates the following vital signs: maximum temperature (Tmax) of 37.8 degrees Celsius (100"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old man admitted on [**2170-11-25**] with a hypertensive emergency and basal ganglia bleed. Initially, he was intubated and treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and later extubated. He was found to have a large pulmonary embolism (PE) as well as upper and lower extremity deep vein thromboses (DVTs). An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, and he was started on a heparin drip with therapeutic anticoagulation.

The patient's recent events include ventricular drains being clamped after a head CT showed improved ventricular bleed, and more hypertension despite titrating up metoprolol with systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 200s. He was started on a nitroglycerin drip overnight.

The patient's allergies are noted as no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin on [**2170-12-10**] at 10:16 AM and Ceftazidime on [**2170-12-11**] at 05:50 AM.

The patient is currently receiving several infusions including nitroglycerin at 0.3 mcg/kg/min and heparin sodium at 2,000 units/hour. Other ICU medications include famotidine, metoprolol, and hydralazine. He also has a clonidine patch.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flowsheet Data as of [**2170-12-11**] 07:17 AM shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also documented.

Physical examination findings include the patient being alert but not oriented, clear lungs, right-sided lower extremity edema, and peripheral vascular assessments incomplete. Neurologic examination was not assessed.

Laboratory results include blood glucose, complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), coagulation profile, and arterial blood gas (ABG) values. Imaging studies such as a CT scan of the head are also mentioned.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE) - an IVC filter has been placed, and the patient is on a heparin drip at therapeutic doses.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS) - the patient is doing well on 2 liters nasal cannula (NC).
3. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) - the patient's mental status remains unchanged, and a repeat head CT with ventricular drains clamped is planned. If there is no change, the ventricular drains can be removed.
4. Ventriculitis - the patient is on vancomycin and ceftazidime for"

","The patient is a 50-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a hypertensive emergency and basal ganglia bleed. He has been treated for VAP and found to have large PE as well as upper and lower extremity DVTs. An IVC filter was placed, and he is on a heparin drip with therapeutic anticoagulation.

The patient's vitals show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/69 to 219/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg, intracranial pressure (ICP) is 14 mmHg, and blood glucose is within normal range.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is alert but not oriented, with clear lungs and right-sided lower extremity edema. Peripheral pulses could not be assessed due to the presence of DVTs. Neurological examination was not performed.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Blood chemistry shows elevated levels of creatinine, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), lactate, and lipase. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   50M with uncontrolled HTN admitted for hypertensive emergency
   complicated by hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular
   bleeding. Hospitalization complicated by VAP which was successfully
   treated with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin (also
   empirically for a possible UTI, but no positive cultures),
   ventriculits, and DVT/PE.
   # Intraventricular hemorrhage/Hypertension: Believed due to ICH from
   hypertensive emergency. Had significant blood in the ventricles
   initially. Requires ongoing decompression of his ventricles with
   ventrilostomies.
   - Neurosurgery following. Recommendations greatly appreciated. Pager
   [**Numeric Identifier 3245**]
   - Continue ventriculostomies in place with goal ICP<20cmH2O, raised to
   20cm.  Plan for repeat NCHCT in am, if stable, will put to clamp with
   repeat imaging
   - increase Keppra to 1g [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Goal SBP less than 170 mmHg. Back on clonidine patch 0.2 td and
   increasing  metoprolol 25  mg [**Hospital1 7**] if pressure tolerates. When renal
   function stabilizes ace/betablocker combination may be effective
   without clonidine
   - Q2 hour neuro checks
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to PE. Completed VAP course
   already. Now extubated and on minimal oxygenation. [**Month (only) 51**] also have a
   component of fluid overload based on CXR.
   - Supplelmental O2 via NC for now
   - Heparin gtt for PE
   # Pulmonary embolus: Likely from heparin being held in the context of
   intraventricular bleed, stasis, PICC line advanced in the RV, and
   generally poor medical status.
   - Continue heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100 given possible upcoming
   procedures
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
   - GI PPx with famotidine
   - IVC filter in place. Will hopefully be removed once recovered from
   the present illness
   - Will eventually requre 3-6 months of AC for provoked DVT
   - f/u hypercoaguable workup
 Factor V, antithrombin pending
   # LLE DVT: Significant DVT on the L. Concern for vascular compromise
   from back flow venous hypertension.
   - Vascular surgery following. Recommendations appreciated.
   - Keep LLE elevated and wrapped in a compression bandage
   - Heparinize as above for PE
   # Ventriculitis: Elevated CSF WBC. Ventriculostomies in place.
   Infectious disease following. Recommendations greatly appreciated.
   - Will keep ventriculostomies in place for now and plan to antibiose
   for at least 14 days after tube removal as hardware is a nidus for
   infection
   - Continue vancomycin 1.25 daily  until at least 14 days after
   ventroculostomy removal. Goal vancomycin level 15-20
   - Continue ceftazidime 2g IV Q8H until at least 14 days after
   ventriculostomy removal
   - CSF and blood cultures pending
   # Acute renal failure: Thought to be due to contrast nephropathy. Cr
   improved from 1.8 to 1.5. Also urine positive for eos in the setting of
   beta lactam use, raising suspicion for AIN.
   - Trend Cr daily
   - Peripheral CBC with diff
   - If Cr worsens, may need to consider stopping beta lactam
   - resent UA today
   # LFT abnormalities: Improving markedly and may have been related to
   phenytoin/propafol vs shock liver.
   - Dilantin changed to keppra as noted above
   - Trend LFts and lipase
   - BCx pending
   - Trend transaminases and lipase

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with uncontrolled hypertension admitted for a hypertensive emergency complicated by hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular bleeding. The patient's hospitalization has been complicated by ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventriculitis, and deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE).

The patient's current condition includes ongoing decompression of his ventricles with ventriculostomies due to intraventricular hemorrhage/hypertension. His goal is to maintain intracranial pressure (ICP) below 20 cmH2O. He is also being treated for hypoxic respiratory failure likely due to PE, pulmonary embolus, left lower extremity DVT, and ventriculitis.

The patient's medical complications include acute renal failure thought to be due to contrast nephropathy, liver function test abnormalities possibly related to phenytoin/propofol, and diabetes.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through ground solids and thin liquids, glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale, and has multiple lines including an arterial line and multi-lumen line. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with systemic anticoagulation using heparin gtt, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, and VAP prevention.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and"

","The patient is a 50-year-old man who was admitted with a hypertensive emergency and basal ganglia bleed. Initially, he was on the neurosurgery service with the placement of bilateral ventricular drains, initially intubated and treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ultimately extubated on December 1st and transferred to the floor. On December 6th, he developed hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring re-intubation, and a large pulmonary embolism (PE) as well as upper and lower extremity deep vein thromboses (DVTs) were found. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, and he was started on a heparin drip with therapeutic anticoagulation. The ventricular drains were removed on December 11th.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/72 to 166/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula, and a sinus rhythm. The patient's weight is 141 kg, height is 72 inches, central venous pressure (CVP) is 12 mmHg, intracranial pressure (ICP) is 11 mmHg, and blood glucose is 117 mg/dL.

The patient has been receiving various medications including metoprolol,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of uncontrolled hypertension, who was admitted for a hypertensive emergency complicated by hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular bleeding. During hospitalization, the patient developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventriculitis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE), and lower extremity edema (LEE DVT). The patient underwent removal of ventriculostomy catheters and has been receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment for VAP and ventriculitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intraventricular hemorrhage/hypertension: The patient initially presented with hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular bleeding due to a hypertensive emergency. There is a possibility of further complications related to hypertension, such as recurrent bleeding or increased intracranial pressure.
2. Pulmonary embolus: The patient is likely to have developed a pulmonary embolism due to immobilization and the presence of DVT. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure or even mortality if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has been found to have elevated sodium levels, which can lead to neurological complications if not corrected promptly.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating possible acute renal failure. Monitoring renal function and addressing any contributing factors, such as contrast neph"

   status post removal of ventriculostomy catheters with unchanged
   dilation of the right frontal [**Doctor Last Name 758**] of the lateral ventricle.
   Assessment and Plan
   50M with uncontrolled HTN admitted for hypertensive emergency
   complicated by hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular
   bleeding. Hospitalization complicated by VAP which was successfully
   treated with vancomycin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin (also
   empirically for a possible UTI, but no positive cultures),
   ventriculits, and DVT/PE.
   # Intraventricular hemorrhage/Hypertension: Believed due to ICH from
   hypertensive emergency.  Drains removed [**12-11**].
   - cont clonidine PO 0.1mg po tid
   - wean  nitro gtt, goal SBP < 170
   - repeat head CT stable but slightly more somnolent, may be related to
   hypernatremia
   - f/u nsurg recs
   - keppra 1g [**Hospital1 **]
   - Q4 hour neuro checks
   # Pulmonary embolus: Likely from heparin being held in the context of
   intraventricular bleed, stasis
   - Continue heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100 given possible upcoming
   procedures
   - Maintain up to date type and screen
   - GI PPx with famotidine
   - IVC filter in place. Will hopefully be removed once recovered from
   the present illness
   - Will eventually requre 3-6 months of AC for provoked DVT
   - f/u hypercoaguable workup
 Factor V, antithrombin pending
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: PE and VAP.
   -continue heparin gtt, s/p IVC filter
   -continue abx x 2 week course after removing of drains (day 1 = [**12-12**])
   -O2 via nasal cannula
   # Hypernatremia:
   - correct with D5W
   # LLE DVT: as above heparin gtt and IVC filter
   # Ventriculitis: Elevated CSF WBC. Ventriculostomies pulled [**12-11**], will
   need two weeks of antibx
   - Continue vancomycin 1.25 daily  until at least 14 days after
   ventroculostomy removal. Goal vancomycin level 15-20. (day 1 = [**12-12**])
   - Continue ceftazidime 2g IV Q8H until at least 14 days after
   ventriculostomy removal
   - f/u ID recs
   - CSF and blood cultures pending
    # Acute renal failure: ?contrast nephropathy.  Cr 1.6.
   - Trend Cr daily
   - trend UOP
   - If Cr worsens, may need to consider stopping beta lactam
   # LFT abnormalities:  trend.   Improving markedly and may have been
   related to phenytoin/propafol vs shock liver.
   - Dilantin changed to keppra as noted above
   - Trend LFts and lipase
   - BCx pending
   - Trend transaminases and lipase
   - f/u hepatitis serologies

","Summary of Progress Note:

A 50-year-old male with uncontrolled hypertension was admitted for a hypertensive emergency complicated by hemorrhage in the basal ganglia and intraventricular bleeding. During hospitalization, the patient developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which was successfully treated with antibiotics. The patient also had ventriculitis and deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE).

The patient's current condition is stable with improved neurological status, but still somnolent. The head CT scan shows unchanged intraventricular hemorrhage status post removal of ventriculostomy catheters with unchanged dilation of the right frontal horn of the lateral ventricle. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intraventricular hemorrhage/hypertension: The patient's intraventricular hemorrhage is believed to be due to a hypertensive emergency. The drains were removed on [12-11]. The plan includes controlling blood pressure, monitoring neurological status, and correcting hypernatremia.

2. Pulmonary embolus: The patient likely developed a pulmonary embolus from heparin being held in the context of intraventricular bleed, stasis. The plan includes continuing heparin drip with goal PTT 60-100 given possible upcoming procedures, maintaining an up-to-date type and screen, and removing the inferior vena cava (IVC) filter once recovered from the present illness.

3. Hypoxic"
