","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), urinary tract infection (UTI), and a previous central line-associated bloodstream infection (CoNS bacteremia). He was admitted for ischemic bowel and underwent small bowel resection and primary anastomosis. The patient is now admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with hypotension and low-grade fever.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C, heart rate (HR) of 64 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 125/59 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm (SR) on electrocardiogram (ECG). The central venous pressure (CVP) is 3 mmHg, and the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 86 mmHg. The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is currently on norepinephrine infusion at 0.03 mcg/kg/min.

The patient has a history of abdominal compartment syndrome"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, urinary tract infection (UTI), and recent admission for ischemic bowel with small bowel resection and primary anastomosis. The patient presented to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with hypotension, low-grade temperatures, and white blood cell count of 4K. The patient's lactate levels are within normal limits, and the systemic vascular oxygen saturation (SVO2) is 66. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics during the last hospitalization, making Clostridium difficile (C. diff) a possible cause. The patient also has a central venous catheter (PICC line) in place.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The cause of hypotension is unclear, with possibilities including sepsis/SIRS or hemorrhagic shock. The patient has low-grade temperatures, hypotension, and a high white blood cell count, but lactate levels are normal, and SVO2 is 66. No clear source has been identified yet. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for aspiration pneumonia and abdominal sources, which will be continued for 7 days if the patient appears to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, mechanical aortic valve replacement, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and previous urinary tract infection. He was recently admitted for ischemic bowel and underwent small bowel resection and primary anastomosis. The patient is now admitted to the MICU with hypotension, likely due to septic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and likely septic shock may lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly managed.
2. PICC Line Infection: There is concern for a potential infection at the site of the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, which could result in bacteremia or sepsis.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's recent bowel surgery and reduced level of consciousness increase the risk of aspiration, leading to pneumonia.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's worsening hypoxemia may be due to volume overload, which can compromise respiratory function and increase the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient's low platelet count may be related to heparin exposure, either from the mechanical aortic valve replacement or as part of"

   5) Mild hemoptysis
   Plan:
   1) Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   2) Currently BP at baseline but will monitor closely -> gentle fluid
   bolus followed by pressors if drops -> if this occurs, will check
   central venous sat/cardiac output as may benefit from inotropes if
   hemodynamics deteriorate
   3)  Let coagulopathy auto-correct given valve.  Has some mild
   hemoptysis that began after deep suctioning.  No indication for
   intervention at this time but IP aware and if problem worsens in the
   night will intervene
   Time Spent: 30 minutes

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), history of urinary tract infection (UTI), and recent admission for ischemic bowel surgery. He is currently admitted to the MICU with hypotension likely due to septic shock.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's recent admission for ischemic bowel surgery and mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of developing pneumonia. The presence of right lower lobe atelectasis/infiltrate on the CT torso supports this concern.

2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, elevated white blood cell count (WBC), and positive blood cultures indicate sepsis. This is further supported by the presence of right lower lobe atelectasis/infiltrate, which may be a source of infection.

3. Myocardial dysfunction: The patient's known reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 25% and mechanical AVR increase the risk of myocardial dysfunction. The patient's current hypotension and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest ongoing myocardial injury.

4. AVR: The patient is on coumadin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, urinary tract infection (UTI), and previous central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and low-grade fever. He has been experiencing chronic abdominal pain since surgery, specifically ischemic bowel and subsequent small bowel resection and primary anastomosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis, hemorrhagic shock, or another cause. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
2. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of systolic heart failure with an EF of 20%. His current condition indicates acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure, which requires careful management of fluid balance and cardiac output.
3. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome/Intra-abdominal Hypertension (ACS/IAH): The patient's abdominal pain and distension suggest the possibility of ACS/IAH, especially considering his recent abdominal surgery. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Anemia: The patient appears to have acute-on-chronic"

   67 yo male with CAD s/p CABG, systolic CHF EF 20%, mechanical AVR, DM2,
   HTN, h/o UTI, h/o CoNS bacteremia, recently admitted for ischemic bowel
   s/p small bowel resection and primary anastomosis now admitted to the
   MICU with hypotension and low grade temps.
   .
   # Hypotension: Unclear if sepsis/SIRS vs hemorrhagic shock. The patient
   with low grade temps, hypotensive, and WBC of 6K but lactate wnl and
   SVO2 60. At this time, no clear source.  UA negative; CXR with RLL
   atelectasis vs aspiration.  CT abdomen without any clear pathology on
   prelim read, though patient has continued abdominal pain (chronic).
   Currently, LFTs all WNL.  Patient was on antibiotics during last
   hospitalization (linezolid and meropenem), so c.diff possible as well.
   Line infection also possible given patient has had PICC line in place.
   Would also consider re-expansion pulmonary edema
   - goal CVP 8-12; maintain goal MAP>65, has not required pressors in
   - hold antihypertensives at this time
   - f/u blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum and c.diff
   - f/u PICC tip culture
   - broad spectrum abx (vanco/zosyn) to cover for aspiration PNA,
   abdominal source for now until cultures return or additional data
   available; continue for 7 days if appears to be septic shock
   .
   # Anemia: appears acute on chronic; HCT dropped from 28
22; bumped
   appropriately after 2U prbcs overnight; currently 33.4.  Guaiac
   negative in ED.  CT without any evidence of acute bleed.  INR
   supratherapeutic on admission (5).
   - check hemolysis labs; LDH/Hapto (low).  t.bili [**Name (NI) 7167**] unclear if
   hemolysis given aortic valve
   - DIC labs wnl
   - guaiac all stools
   - Q12H HCT
   - CT without e/o RP bleed
   - 2 units pRBC with goal HCT >30 given CHF and mild trop leak (though
   likely demand and less than priors)
   - hold warfarin for now, avoid FFP because patient has mechanical AVR
   -IV PPI given anticoagulation
   .
   #Acute on Chronic Systolic CHF: most recent EF 20%.  patient on
   diuretics, carvedilol, ace-I as outpatient.  Received approx 2 liters
   of IVFs and 2U prbcs.  Appears volume overloaded this AM
   -Single dose 60mg IV Lasix this AM
   - hold torsemide and metalozone for now
   - close monitoring of respiratory status; patient is full code
   - Bolus prn if needed
   - hold ace-I and carvedilol for now given hypotension
   .
   # Mechical AVR: patient on warfarin; INR goal 2.5-3.5.  Arrives with
   supratherapeutic INR and INR 4.0 today
   - will hold warfarin for now; allow to drift down
   - no FFP for now
   - restart warfarin once 2.5-3.5
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: patient has chronic abd pain since surgery; had
   ischemic bowel and is s/p anastamosis.  Currently complains of his pain
   as well, usually relieved by oxycodone; last dose given last night. CT
   torso without any acute pathology noted.  LFTs are WNL.  patient
   reports that current pain is consistent with pain he has been having
   since discharge
   - check c.diff as above
   - guaiac all stools
   - follow lactate for possible recurrence of ischemic bowel
   - f/u surgery recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, mechanical aortic valve replacement, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, urinary tract infection (UTI) history, and central nervous system (CNS) bacteremia. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and low-grade fever. The patient has undergone small bowel resection and primary anastomosis due to ischemic bowel.

24-hour events include a transesophageal echo, removal of a PICC line, and the placement of a new central line. The patient's left ventricular cavity size is slightly smaller, and global left ventricular ejection fraction is slightly improved compared to the prior study. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) are now identified. The patient was hypotensive multiple times and received fluid boluses with improvement in blood pressure. A chest X-ray showed new right lower/middle lobe opacity. Blood cultures did not show any growth. The patient's allergies include heparin flush.

Infusions include piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, and other ICU medications. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. Flow sheet data indicates vital signs within"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions and tests. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has improved from 25% to slightly better compared to the previous study. However, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) are now identified. The patient experienced episodes of hypotension, which were addressed with fluid boluses. A chest X-ray showed new right lower/middle lobe opacity, indicating possible pneumonia. The patient's allergies include heparin flush, and antibiotics such as piperacillin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam have been administered. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the mentioned events. Vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, normal respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation within normal limits. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals low central venous pressure (CVP), high mixed venous oxygen saturation, and positive fluid balance. The patient's physical examination shows distant heart sounds, crackles in the chest, edema in the right lower extremity, and a left below-knee amputation (BKA). Lab results indicate anemia, elevated lactate level, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient is on various medications and has a history of abdominal compartment syndrome/intraabdominal hypertension (ACS"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic heart failure with ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), urinary tract infection (UTI), and central nervous system (CNS) bacteremia. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for ischemic bowel and small bowel resection with primary anastomosis. Currently, the patient presents with hypotension, low-grade fever, and white blood cell count of 6K. The patient's lactate level is within normal limits, and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO2) is 60%. The patient's chest X-ray shows right lower lobe atelectasis versus aspiration. The abdominal CT scan does not show any clear pathology, although the patient continues to have abdominal pain. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is slightly improved, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now identified. Increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is also noted. The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (prbcs) overnight, with a current hematocrit (Hct) of 33.4%.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is being treated for pneumonia, suspected to be the source of sepsis. The patient also has a history of chronic heart failure and recently underwent an abdominal bypass surgery (AVR). 

Overnight, the patient experienced some low blood pressures that responded to fluid administration. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4Â°C, pulse rate in the 80s, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, blood pressure around 110/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient appears alert and awake, with no acute distress. 

Physical examination findings include bilateral chest crepitations, normal heart sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12,400 cells/mmÂ³, slightly elevated creatinine level, and elevated troponin T level. Imaging reveals right lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. Microbiology cultures are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Pneumonia
2) Sepsis
3) CHF (acute on chronic)
4) S/P AVR

The patient's condition has improved, and they are now more alert and responsive. The plan includes continuing antibiotics for pneumonia and PICC line infection, monitoring"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient's condition is being managed in the ICU. The patient has a history of chronic heart failure and has undergone below-knee amputation (BKA). 

Key events in the past 24 hours include a transesophageal echo performed at 01:52 PM, and the removal of a PICC line at 03:20 PM. The patient has allergies to heparin flush (porcine/pf) and unknown antibiotics. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.4Â°C (99.3Â°F), current temperature 37.2Â°C (99Â°F), heart rate (HR) 66 bpm with a range of 63-87 bpm, blood pressure (BP) 106/54 mmHg with a range of 67/42-112/61 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) 19 breaths per minute with a range of 16-22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) 100% on nasal cannula, and first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg with a range of -11 to 28 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation at 60%, total in 1,992 mL with a balance of -1,803 mL, and total out 3,795 mL with a balance of -263 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a nasal cannula with SpO2 of 100%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) values are pH 7.42, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 44 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 59 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) 95%. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 74.

During the physical examination, the patient appeared well-nourished and showed no acute distress. The cardiovascular examination revealed a normal first and second heart sounds with an additional third heart sound (S3). There were no peripheral pulses assessed in the extremities. The respiratory/chest examination showed symmetric breath sounds with crackles in the right lower lung field (RLL). The abdominal examination revealed a soft and non-tender abdomen. The extremities showed right lower extremity edema at 1+ and absent edema in the left lower extremity, which has undergone BKA. The neurologic examination was unremarkable.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count (WBC) of 6.3 K/uL with a range of 6.0-7.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 31.0% with a range of 31.0-33.4%, platelet count (Plt) of 254 K/uL with a range of 249-300 K/uL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL with a range of 1.0-1.2 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.04 with a range of 0.04-0.10, glucose of 79 mg/dL with a range of 104-124 mg/dL, and other lab values listed in the note. Imaging includes a chest X-ray (CXR) showing right lower lobe infiltrate. Microbiology is pending for the catheter tip and respiratory culture.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypotension (not in shock) likely due to pneumonia or PICC line infection, heart failure (systolic and diastolic), acute on chronic, and other conditions. The plan includes follow-up sputum and blood culture data, continuation of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) pending this, and checking vancomycin trough. The patient's heart failure regimen will be resumed, and oxygen will be weaned off. The rest of the plan is per the attending physician's note. 

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and communication. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is transfer to the floor. The total time spent with the patient is 30 minutes."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, urinary tract infection (UTI), and central nervous system (CNS) bacteremia. He was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension and low-grade temperatures. The patient has a history of ischemic bowel and underwent small bowel resection and primary anastomosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is most likely secondary to hospital-associated pneumonia (PNA). Further evaluation is needed, including blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum, and Clostridium difficile (c.diff) testing. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam) have been initiated to cover for aspiration PNA.
2. Anemia: The patient appears to have acute-on-chronic anemia, with a hematocrit (HCT) drop from 28% to 22%. Two units of packed red blood cells (prbcs) have been transfused overnight, and the HCT is now 33.4. Guaiac negative in the emergency department (ED), and a computed tomography (CT) scan did not reveal any evidence"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), urinary tract infection (UTI), and central nervous system (CNS) bacteremia. The patient was recently admitted for ischemic bowel and underwent small bowel resection and primary anastomosis. He is now admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with hypotension and low-grade temperatures.

The patient has several medical complications, including hypotension, anemia, acute-on-chronic systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), mechanical AVR, abdominal pain, aspiration pneumonia (PNA), and chronic atrial fibrillation.

Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is most likely secondary to healthcare-associated pneumonia (PNA). Blood cultures, urine cultures, sputum cultures, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) tests should be followed up. A PICC line culture should also be obtained. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam) have been started.

Anemia: The patient's anemia appears to be acute-on-chronic, with a decrease in hemoglobin concentration from 28 to 22. Two units of packed red blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), urinary tract infection (UTI), and central nervous system (CNS) bacteremia. The patient was recently admitted for ischemic bowel and underwent small bowel resection and primary anastomosis. He is now admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with hypotension and low-grade fever.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis/SIRS or hemorrhagic shock. The patient has a low-grade fever, hypotension, and a white blood cell count of 6,000 but normal lactate levels and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO2) of 60%. There is no clear source of infection, and the urine analysis (UA) is negative. A chest X-ray shows right lower lobe atelectasis versus aspiration. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen does not show any clear pathology, although the patient continues to experience chronic abdominal pain. The patient has received antibiotics during the last hospitalization, so Clostridium difficile infection is possible. A line infection is also possible given the presence of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a male with multiple medical conditions and complications. Here are the summarized information and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is being treated with Vancomycin (Vanco) and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) for 8 days.
2. The patient also has heart failure (CHF), both systolic and diastolic, acute on chronic. His fluid balance is euvolemic, and efforts are being made to keep it even. He will need to resume his home torsemide before discharge and continue to monitor his intake and output (I/O).
3. The patient has atrial fibrillation (AFib), for which an elevated INR is observed. Coumadin will be resumed at a lower dose.
4. The patient is currently hypotensive but not in shock. His blood pressure is 107/60 mmHg.
5. The patient has right lower extremity edema, likely due to his history of left below-knee amputation (BKA).
6. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3Â°C, pulse rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
7. The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, low"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a well-nourished individual without acute distress.
- Vital signs are within normal range, with a slight decrease in blood pressure.
- The patient's heart rhythm is a first-degree AV block.
- There is right lower extremity edema due to a previous left below-knee amputation.
- Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movement with normal tone.
- Lab results indicate a slightly elevated white blood cell count and low platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range.
- Imaging shows improvement in right lower lobe lung infiltrate.
- Microbiology results are negative.
- The patient has been treated for hypotension, heart failure, pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation.
- Plan includes monitoring fluid balance, resuming torsemide before discharge, continuing Vancomycin and Zosyn for pneumonia, restarting Coumadin at a lower dose for atrial fibrillation, and transferring to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is still being treated for pneumonia with antibiotics (Vanco and Zosyn) for 8 days. Monitoring for clinical improvement and resolution of symptoms is important. If there is no improvement, alternative antibiotics may be considered.

2. Heart Failure: The patient has acute-on-chronic heart failure, which needs to be closely monitored. Fluid balance should be maintained, and diuretics"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a medical history of systolic heart failure (sCHF) with ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, recent partial colectomy for ischemic bowel, and mechanical aortic valve. The patient was admitted to the ICU for acute pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.

The patient had an episode of hypotension to systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 80s in the SICU, which resolved spontaneously. He also had a brief episode of respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5Â°C (99.5Â°F), heart rate (HR) of 73 beats per minute (71-109 bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 99/50 mmHg to 84/47 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute (16-28 bpm), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.47, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 220, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 87 mEq/L. The patient's white blood cell (WBC)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrioventricular replacement (AVR), and recent partial colectomy for ischemic colitis. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and systolic heart failure after presenting with suspected pneumonia and septic shock. The patient was extubated this morning after doing well on a spontaneous breathing trial. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 117/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 34. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is hospital-acquired and non-ventilator-associated. He also has hypotension that is not in shock, acute systolic and diastolic heart failure on top of chronic heart failure, abdominal compartment syndrome/intraabdominal hypertension (ACS/IAH), anemia, other abdominal pain (including tenderness), and decubitus ulcer present at admission. 

The plan includes continuing efforts at diuresis with Lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and systolic heart failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has undergone various interventions, including diuresis, arterial line placement, and multi-lumen catheter insertion. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and low oxygen saturation. His physical examination reveals wheezing breath sounds, cool skin, and the presence of a systolic murmur. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, troponin T, and D-dimer levels. The patient's medical history includes abdominal compartment syndrome, anemia, aspiration pneumonia, decubitus ulcer, and chronic heart failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, cough, and abnormal chest x-ray findings, suggest the possibility of pneumonia. It is important to monitor for any changes in respiratory status and consider appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's systolic heart failure may worsen due to the stress of critical illness. Close monitoring of fluid balance and cardiac function is necessary to manage heart failure effectively.
3. Abdominal Compartment Syndrome: The patient's history of abdominal compartment syndrome increases the risk of intra-abdominal hypertension. Regular assessment of abdominal pain and distension is crucial to prevent further complications.
4. Anemia: The elevated hemoglobin level indicates anemia, which may contribute to the patient's fatigue and decreased"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 67-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, and mechanical aortic valve, was admitted to the ICU for acute pulmonary edema.
- He has been extubated and is breathing spontaneously on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 35%.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 102/48 mmHg, heart rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.
- Physical examination reveals crackles at the bilateral bases and 2+ edema to the knees.
- Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and elevated troponin-T levels.
- Imaging and microbiology reports are pending.
- The patient's conditions include hypoxic respiratory failure, hospital-acquired pneumonia, systolic heart failure, diabetes mellitus, mechanical aortic valve, anemia, hypertension, abdominal pain, and hepatitis C.
- The plan is to continue with Lasix gtt to maintain urine output, continue antibiotics for pneumonia, restart ACEi and BB for systolic heart failure, restart home diuretic regimen, and continue other ongoing treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of flash pulmonary edema and current respiratory status indicate a potential for worsening respiratory failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of systolic heart failure (EF 20%), atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes, mechanical aortic valve, and chronic venous stasis changes in the lower extremities. The patient presented to the ICU with flash pulmonary edema, which was treated with intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has been extubated and is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with supplemental oxygen. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about potential complications such as hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory acidosis, hospital-acquired pneumonia, systolic heart failure, diabetes, mechanical aortic valve dysfunction, anemia, hypertension, abdominal pain, hepatitis C, seizure disorder, and fluid electrolyte imbalance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of systolic heart failure and chronic pulmonary edema increases the risk of recurrent flash pulmonary edema, leading to hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Acute Respiratory Acidosis: The patient's current condition of being extubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with supplemental oxygen may lead to acute respiratory acidosis due to inadequate ventilation.
3. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and use of mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia.
4. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's pre-existing systolic heart failure may"

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrioventricular valve replacement (AVR), and recent partial colectomy for ischemic colitis. He presented this hospitalization from rehab with suspected pneumonia and septic shock. He was initially stabilized and transferred to the floor but was readmitted to the ICU due to flash pulmonary edema, resulting in intubation.

The patient's current condition includes pneumonia, which is hospital-acquired and non-ventilator-associated (VAP), and acute systolic and diastolic heart failure on top of chronic CHF. He is being managed with a diuresis using Lasix drip and has had his ACE inhibitor restarted.

The patient has been extubated and is doing well with good oxygen saturation levels. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 82/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is alert and oriented, with well-nourished general appearance.

Physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, right lower extremity edema, and left lower extremity edema. Neurological assessment is incomplete.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 26800/uL, elevated tropon"
