","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and bradycardia. She presented to the emergency department with bradycardia and hypotension, suspected to be due to a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose. She was treated with calcium gluconate, glucagon, and insulin IV. Despite improvement in heart rate, she remained hypotensive and required dopamine for blood pressure support. The patient's oxygenation improved after intubation and was weaned off supplemental oxygen. She also produced urine with the help of dopamine and fluid boluses. However, she continues to be hypoglycemic and is being monitored closely with frequent fingerstick glucose measurements. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, and she has a history of Corynebacterium bacteremia treated with vancomycin. She also has transaminitis with elevated ALT and AST levels, which may be related to hepatic toxicity or ischemia. There are concerns about possible acute renal failure, coronary artery disease, and subendocardial ischemia. The patient's rhythm is being managed considering her history of atrial fibrillation and current medications."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and bradycardia. She presented to the emergency department with bradycardia and hypotension, which was suspected to be due to beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose. The patient received treatment for this overdose, including calcium gluconate, glucagon, and insulin IV. Despite initial improvement in heart rate, she remained hypotensive and required dopamine infusion to maintain blood pressure. The patient also showed signs of flash pulmonary edema, likely secondary to fluid overload or myocardial ischemia, and was intubated in the emergency department. Oxygenation has been improving since then, and the patient is currently on assisted ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. The patient's acute renal failure/anuria is likely prerenal in nature due to bradycardia and hypotension, but there is improvement with dopamine infusion and fluid administration. Leukocytosis is present, and the patient has a history of Corynebacterium bacteremia, so blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been obtained, and vancomycin was given. The patient also has transaminitis with elevated ALT and AST levels, which may be due to hepatic toxicity from the medications she was taking. There are concerns about possible coronary artery disease and subendocardial ischemia, but cardiac enzymes are negative, and a recent echoc"

   Assessment and Plan
   82F w/ pmh HTN, afib, p/w bradycardia and hypotension in setting of
   likely beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose.
   .
   #Hypotension: Differential includes BB or CCB toxicity vs. septic
   shock. Patient has history of similar presentation after overdose of
   diltiazem. EKG showed afib with slow rhythm, no heart block, no signs
   of ischemia. HR improved with atropine.  The patient was treated for BB
   or CCB overdose with calcium gluconate, glucagon, and Insulin IV. HR
   continued to improve but still remained hypotensive. Blood pressure
   eventually improved with dopamine. Insulin was discontinued on
   presentation to ICU. Pressure responded to fluid boluses overnight.
   Plan is to wean off dopamine.  If becomes hypotensive will transition
   to levophed for septic shock.
   -Goal MAP > 60
   -wean off dopamine gtt, switch to levophed if necessary
   .
   #Hypoxia:Likely secondary to flash pulmonary edema, as per report in ED
   resp status deteriorated rapidly after getting 1.5L NS. CXR showing
   pulmonary edema. Possibly from fluid overload in setting of diminished
   contractility from BB toxicity, or may be from acute diastolic
   dysfunction from myocardial ischemia given ST depressions in lateral
   leads. Intubated in ED. Oxygenation has been improving since
   presentation, FiO2 weaned from 100->40%, currently on AC with pO2 140.
   -holding diuresis in setting of improving oxygenation, oliguria and
   hypotension.
   -Intubated on AC, FiO2 40%
   -wean off PEEP
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure/anuria: Likely prerenal in setting of bradycardia
   and hypotension. Pressure increased on dopamine. Producing scant urine
   on presentaiton to CCU. Mucus membranes dry, may be from hypovolemia
   vs. anticholinergic effects of atropine.  Cr improved after 3L fluid
   overnight.
   -NS 250cc Boluses prn urine output 30cc/hr.
   -UA
   -u lytes
   .
   #Leukocytosis: Afebrile, but in the setting of hypotension may be
   suggestive of septic shock. History of Corynebacterium bacteremia, s/p
   14 days vancomycin. CXR with persistent right hilar consolidation. Will
   pan-culture, blood, urine, sputum. Received one dose of vancomycin
   early this am.
   -f/u blood, urine, sputum Cx
   -chest CT, has persistent right hilar consolidation.
   .
   #Transaminitis:ALT 154, AST 234, new during this admission. Possibly
   from hepatic toxicity as metoprolol, diltiazem, and nifedipine are
   metabolized by liver. [**Month (only) 8**] also be due to hepatic ischemia from
   hypotension.
   -trend daily
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No history of CAD. Precordial ST depressions present on
   ekg upon admission to CCU.  Likely subendocardial ischemia in setting
   of hypotension and low systemic diastolic pressures.
   -cardiac enzymes negative.
   .
   # PUMP:Recent echo on [**1-5**] with normal LV and RV function, without
   wall motion abnormalities, LVEF 55%. Previously hypotensive in setting
   of bradycardia from likely BB or CCB toxicity.
   .
   # RHYTHM:History of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, metoprolol, and
   diltiazem.   Held metoprolol and diltiazem in setting over overdose.
   Once pressure tolerates will restart metoprolol and diltiazem.
   -hold metoprolol, diltiazem in setting of overdose.
   -hold coumadin in setting of supratherapeutic INR
   .
   #Hypertension:.
   -hold metoprolol, diltiazem, nifedipine, HCTZ
   .
   #Hyperlipidemia:holding lipitor in setting of transaminitis.
   .
   #FEN:  NPO, replete K, Mg, PO4

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 82-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a recent history of beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose. The patient presented with bradycardia and hypotension, which responded to treatment for beta blocker or calcium channel blocker toxicity with calcium gluconate, glucagon, and insulin IV. The patient's blood pressure continued to improve with dopamine, and fluids were given overnight.

The patient's respiratory status deteriorated rapidly after receiving 1.5L of normal saline, leading to flash pulmonary edema, as indicated by the chest X-ray showing pulmonary edema. This may be due to fluid overload in the setting of diminished contractility from beta blocker toxicity or acute diastolic dysfunction from myocardial ischemia given ST depressions in lateral leads. The patient is currently intubated and on assisted ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. PEEP is being weaned off, and oxygenation has been improving since presentation.

The patient also has acute renal failure/anuria, likely prerenal in the setting of bradycardia and hypotension. The patient's creatinine improved after receiving 3L of fluids overnight. Maintaining urine output of 30cc/hr is planned, and a urine analysis and electrolytes are pending.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and bradycardia. She was admitted to the ICU with suspected beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose, presenting as hypotension and bradycardia. The patient has shown improvement with dopamine and levophed infusions, but continues to be hypotensive and tachycardic. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to fever, sputum culture, and right hilar consolidation on chest X-ray. Her respiratory status has improved, and she is currently being weaned off mechanical ventilation. The patient also has acute renal failure/anuria, which has responded to fluid administration, and is scheduled for diuresis with lasix. She has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and is currently being managed with diltiazem. The patient's transaminitis is suspected to be due to hepatic toxicity from medications or hypotension. She has no history of coronary artery disease, but showed evidence of subendocardial ischemia on EKG. The patient's recent echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular and right ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 55%. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulation therapy. The patient's hypertension is currently being managed by holding multiple antihypertensive medications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and possible beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose. She presented with bradycardia and hypotension, which improved after cardioversion. The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and is being treated with vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension may be due to beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose. She has been transitioned to levophed and is currently weaning off. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. Levophed should be weaned off once the patient's blood pressure stabilizes.
2. Respiratory status: The patient was on assisted ventilation overnight and had a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 40 during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). She will attempt extubation today.
3. Acute renal failure/anuria: The patient initially had anuria with elevated creatinine levels. However, her renal function has improved with fluid administration. She has a fluid balance of 6600cc, indicating fluid overload. Diuretic therapy with lasix will be initiated to remove excess fluid.
4. Fever: The patient has a fever with sputum culture showing >25 PMNs, 1+ Gram-positive cocci, and 1+ Gram"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 82-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and likely beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose. She was admitted to the ICU due to bradycardia and hypotension. The patient underwent cardioversion yesterday and has remained in sinus rhythm with improved blood pressure. She is currently on norepinephrine (Levophed) which is being weaned down, and her goal MAP is >60.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, as she was on assisted ventilation overnight and will have a spontaneous breathing trial this morning with an RSBI of 40. Extubation will be attempted today.

The patient has acute renal failure with creatinine improving and electrolytes consistent with prerenal ARF. She will continue to receive lasix to maintain even I/O.

The patient also has a fever with multiple sources including sputum culture showing >25 PMNs, 1+ Gram positive cocci, and 1+ gram negative rods. Her chest X-ray shows persistent right hilar consolidation. She has been started on vancomycin and flagyl for C. diff and VRE in her urine. Legionella urinary antigen is negative. She will continue to receive ceftriaxone, azithromycin, flagyl, and PO vancomycin. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures will be followed up.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and bradycardia. She was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and bradycardia, likely due to beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP mode. She has a positive urine culture for VRE (vancomycin-resistant enterococci) and is being treated with linezolid. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows acidosis with hypercarbia. She has anemia consistent with iron deficiency, and her lipid levels are elevated. She also has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to her inability to ventilate appropriately, even on CPAP. Weaning sedation may help improve her respiratory function, but close monitoring is required to prevent further respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has multiple sources of infection, including sputum with Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative rods, positive urine culture for VRE, and C. difficile. Appropriate antibiotics have been started, but continuous monitoring for any signs of worsening infection is essential.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance of 1.4 L over the past 24 hours,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, and hypotension. She was admitted to the ICU due to suspected beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose. Her current condition includes atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, fever, and transaminitis. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 96.1°F, blood pressure ranging from 103-126 mmHg, heart rate between 93-123 bpm, respiratory rate of 13-20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving CPAP support. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,679 mL and output of 1,163 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 516 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, but she has elevated liver enzymes and abnormal blood glucose levels. The patient's medications include amiodarone, metoprolol, fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and lasix. The patient's medical plan includes weaning off levophed, attempting extubation, continuing lasix, and administering appropriate antibiotics based on culture results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient is still on CPAP support, indicating a potential need"

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and bradycardia. She was admitted to the ICU due to likely beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose, presenting with bradycardia and hypotension. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory status: The patient is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is oxygenating well. However, she is not ventilating appropriately, so sedation will be weaned, and she will remain intubated until cardioversion tomorrow.

2. Volume status: The patient has a positive fluid balance of 6 liters over the length of her stay. She also has upper extremity pitting edema. Lasix 40mg IV was administered yesterday, and it is planned to repeat today with the goal of keeping a negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters.

3. Acid-base status: The patient has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to diarrhea and increased saline administration.

4. Infectious disease: The patient has multiple sources of infection, including sputum with >25 PMNs, 1+ Gram-positive cocci, and 1+ Gram-negative rods. She has right hilar consolidation on chest X-ray and is positive for C. difficile. She has been started on PO vancomycin and metronidazole. Her urine culture grew vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), which is sensitive to line"

The patient presented with bradycardia and hypotension, likely due to beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose. The patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

The patient has several ongoing medical complications that need attention:

1. Shock, septic: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely caused by multiple sources of infection including respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection. The patient's sputum culture showed >25 PMNs, 1+ Gram-positive cocci, and 1+ Gram-negative rods. The chest X-ray revealed persistent right hilar consolidation. The patient has received vancomycin, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone for suspected CAP. However, the urine culture grew VRE (Vancomycin-resistant enterococci), which is sensitive to linezolid. The patient has also tested positive for C. difficile and started on PO vanc and flagyl.

2. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, as indicated by an elevated serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL and a decreased urine output of 3.27 mL in 24 hours. The patient requires aggressive fluid resuscitation and careful monitoring of renal function.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and bradycardia. She was admitted to the ICU due to likely beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose. The patient has been experiencing bradycardia and hypotension, which are consistent with her medication overdose.

24-hour events:
- Cardioversion was postponed until today, so the patient was not extubated either.
- Amiodarone infusion continued overnight at 0.5mg/min.
- The patient received 40 IV lasix yesterday with a result of -1.2 liters.
- RSBI 65 this morning.
- No new events on tele.
- The patient responded well to commands and denied pain. Family will be visiting today.
- EKG today showed atrial fibrillation, rate of 94, one PVC, QTc of 411.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Alteration in elimination related to diarrhea
2. Bradyarrhythmia
3. Shock, septic
4. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB)
5. Hypotension (not in shock)
6. Hypoxemia
7. Leukocytosis
8. Hypoglycemia
9. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF)

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory status: The patient is on PSV overnight, oxygenating well, but there may be a risk of respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 82-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation. She was admitted to the ICU due to bradycardia and hypotension, suspected to be caused by beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), blood pressure ranging from 116/46mmHg to 141/82mmHg, heart rate of 98 bpm with atrial fibrillation, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. Other laboratory results show leukocytosis, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient has a history of multiple infections, including pneumonia with pansensitive klebsiella, urinary tract infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and Clostridium difficile. She has received various antibiotics for these infections, including azithromycin, ceftriaxone, linezolid, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

The patient's atrial fibrillation could not be converted to sinus rhythm and is currently being managed with amiodarone infusion. The plan is to perform cardioversion once the patient's condition stabil"

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and bradycardia. She presented to the ICU with hypotension and bradycardia, likely due to beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose.

She was initially on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated to face mask with good oxygen saturation. After extubation, she became hypertensive and her heart rate increased to the 70s-80s. Her metoprolol dose was increased from 50 to 75 mg QID.

The patient's sedation was weaned, and she underwent a spontaneous breathing trial, which she successfully completed. However, she developed agitation and confusion overnight and was given haloperidol 2 mg IV x 2.

She also experienced increased crackles and oxygen requirements, necessitating the administration of lasix 40 mg IV x 1. Allergies include ace inhibitors, cough, and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/64 to 159/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

   #Altered mental status:  Patient has been agitated and confused this
   morning in the setting of having stopped sedation yesterday with
   extubation.  She is intermittently re-directable, responding well to IV
   haldol.  Currently refusing PO meds.  Differential includes infection,
   electrolyte imbalance, hypoxia, alcohol withdrawal.  Family denies any
   history of EtOH.  Electrolytes and O2 Sat
   - redirect frequently
   - encourage family to be present and re-directing
   - haldol 2 mg IV PRN
   - convert PO to IV meds if she continues to refuse

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and bradycardia. She presented with bradycardia and hypotension, which was suspected to be due to beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose. The patient was cardioverted successfully from atrial fibrillation back into sinus rhythm, but later reverted back to atrial fibrillation. She has been treated with amiodarone and underwent another successful cardioversion. The patient has been extubated and is now on low flow oxygen. Her vital signs are stable, but she is hypertensive and agitated, showing signs of confusion. The patient has upper extremity edema and crackles in her lungs, indicating fluid overload. She has multiple infections, including a urinary tract infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, and she has iron deficiency anemia. The patient's lipid levels are being managed, and she is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. Her code status is full code, and she is currently in the CCU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation of bradycardia and hypotension suggests potential hypotension. This could be due to the suspected beta blocker or calcium"

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and bradycardia. She presented with bradycardia and hypotension, which was likely due to a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose. The patient was initially cardioverted into sinus rhythm but reverted back to atrial fibrillation. She received amiodarone and was successfully re-cardioverted yesterday. Currently, she is on amiodarone and metoprolol.

The patient underwent invasive ventilation and was extubated successfully yesterday. She is currently on supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula and her oxygen saturation is in the low 90s. Her blood pressure is hypertensive, and her heart rate is in the 70s-80s. Metoprolol was increased from 50 to 75mg QID.

The patient has crackles in her lungs and increased oxygen requirement, indicating possible fluid overload. Lasix 40mg IV was given yesterday morning and again overnight for respiratory distress. The goal is to achieve negative 1-2 liters of fluid balance.

The patient has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to diarrhea and increased saline administration. This is resolving.

The patient has multiple sources of infection, including pneumonia with pansensitive klebsiella, positive for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Clostridium difficile (C. Diff). She was treated with vancomy"

   #Atrial Fibrillation: Cardioverted initially on [**2-9**], sinus rhythm for
   12 hours, then reverted back to afib.  Began amiodarone [**2-10**], now on
   PO and s/p successful re-cardioversion yesterday, [**2-12**].  Now
   supratherapeutic on coumadin in the setting of amiodarone/abx.
   - hold Coumadin
   - continue  Amiodarone 400mg PO BID
   - Continue metoprolol.
   .
   #Respiratory status: s/p successful extubation yesterday now with good
   O2 Sat on nasal cannula.
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   .
   #Hypervolemia: Persistent upper extremity pitting edema and crackles in
   lungs. Required 40 mg IV lasix yesterday morning to be negative 750 cc,
   but an additional 40 mg IV given O/N for respiratory distress, good UOP
   after.
   - lasix 40 IV this afternoon
   - goal negative 1-2L
   .
   #Altered mental status:  Patient has been agitated and confused this
   morning in the setting of having stopped sedation yesterday with
   extubation.  She is intermittently re-directable, responding well to IV
   haldol.  Currently refusing PO meds.  Differential includes infection,
   electrolyte imbalance, hypoxia, alcohol withdrawal.  Family denies any
   history of EtOH.  Electrolytes and O2 Sat
   - redirect frequently
   - encourage family to be present and re-directing
   - haldol 2 mg IV PRN
   - convert PO to IV meds if she continues to refuse
   .
   #Acid Base: Non-Ag metabolic acidosis resolving. Likely from diarrhea
   and increased saline administration.
   .
   #ID: Multiple sources of infection, including  sputum with pansensitive
   Klebsiella, on azithro and ctx for CAP.  UA on admission growing VRE,
   on linezolid.  Also positive for C.Diff, on PO vanc and IV flagyl.
   - continue ceftriaxone day [**6-17**]
   - azithromycin day [**6-15**], will d/c today
   - continue inezolid, ending [**2-16**], day [**5-18**]
   - continue IV flagyl, PO vancomycin, day 3
   -f/u blood Cx.
   -reculture given altered mental status
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No history of CAD. Precordial ST depressions present on
   ekg upon admission to CCU.  Likely subendocardial ischemia in setting
   of hypotension and low systemic diastolic pressures.  CE were neagive

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and previous cardioversion. She presents with bradycardia and hypotension, likely due to beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose. The patient has been agitated and confused this morning, with intermittent redirectability. She has a history of altered mental status, infection, electrolyte imbalance, hypoxia, and alcohol withdrawal. Her respiratory status has improved with successful extubation and is now on a nasal cannula. She has hypervolemia with upper extremity pitting edema and crackles in the lungs. There are multiple sources of infection, including sputum with pansensitive Klebsiella, urinary tract infection with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient also has anemia, hyperlipidemia, and renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status and agitation may indicate delirium or confusion. This can be caused by various factors such as infection, electrolyte imbalance, hypoxia, or alcohol withdrawal.
2. Alteration in Elimination: The patient has shown signs of altered renal function, including acute renal failure. This can be due to factors like hypotension, septic shock, or medications.
3. Bradyarrhythmia: The patient's bradycardia may"

   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2134-2-14**] 02:30 AM
   - patient agitated, crawling out of bed, yelling at 2100.  She was
   given Haldol 2.5 mg IV x 2 with minimal effect.  EKG showed QTc 450.
   She was then given Ativan 1 mg IV after which she fell asleep.
   - After falling asleep, she was unable to take PO meds.  Lopressor 75
   mg was due at 2400, and HR high 90's (sinus), so she was given 5 mg IV
   lopressor x 2.
   - During her episode of agitation and continuing after she calmed down,
   RR was in the mid-20's.  Lungs had crackles, and repeat CXR showed
   unchanged to slightly worse fluid overload.  She was given 40 mg IV
   lasix.  UOP was ~1.5 L over 3 hours.

   #Hypervolemia: Persistent upper extremity pitting edema and crackles in
   lungs. Required 40 mg IV lasix last night.
   - lasix 40 IV this afternoon if not at goal, but will give with
   potassium
   - goal negative 1-2L
   .
   #Altered mental status:  Patient has been agitated and confused this
   morning in the setting of having stopped sedation yesterday with
   extubation.  She is intermittently re-directable, responding well to IV
   haldol and ativan last night.  Intermitienly refusing PO meds.
   Differential includes infection, electrolyte imbalance, hypoxia,
   alcohol withdrawal.
   - redirect frequently
   - encourage family to be present and re-directing
   - haldol 2 mg IV PRN
   - convert PO to IV meds if she continues to refuse

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and a recent overdose of beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers. She presented with bradycardia and hypotension. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. She received amiodarone for atrial fibrillation and was successfully cardioverted back to sinus rhythm. However, she converted back to atrial fibrillation in the morning. She is currently on amiodarone and Coumadin, but her Coumadin levels are supratherapeutic due to the interaction with amiodarone and antibiotics.

The patient's respiratory status improved, and she was successfully extubated. However, she is experiencing shortness of breath, possibly due to the side effects of beta-blockers. Metoprolol was changed to a long-acting beta-blocker to decrease respiratory side effects. Oxygen therapy was initiated, and she is being weaned off it as tolerated.

The patient has hypervolemia, as evidenced by upper extremity pitting edema and crackles in her lungs. She received 40 mg IV lasix last night and will receive another dose of 40 mg IV this afternoon if her fluid balance does not improve. The goal is to achieve negative 1-2 liters of fluid balance.

The patient has altered mental status, characterized by agitation, confusion, and intermittent refusal of oral medications. She responded well to"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation, presenting with bradycardia and hypotension in the setting of likely beta blocker or calcium channel blocker overdose. She was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

During her stay, she developed delirium, altered mental status, and confusion, which were initially attributed to possible electrolyte imbalances, hypoxia, and alcohol withdrawal. However, these symptoms persisted despite addressing these potential causes.

The patient also experienced respiratory distress, requiring extubation and subsequent oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. Her respiratory status improved, but she continued to have episodes of shortness of breath.

She exhibited signs of hypervolemia, as evidenced by upper extremity pitting edema and crackles in her lungs. This led to the administration of IV lasix to manage fluid overload.

The patient's kidney function deteriorated, resulting in acute renal failure. Her renal function tests showed elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen.

She had multiple infections, including community-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and Clostridium difficile colitis. She received various antibiotics to treat these infections.

Her coronary artery disease was evaluated, and she had evidence of subendocardial ischemia on the electrocardiogram. Her left ventricular ejection fraction was normal.

She also had iron deficiency anemia and hyperlipidemia,"
