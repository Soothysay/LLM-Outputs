   Disposition:
","The patient's medical history indicates that they have coronary artery disease (CAD), also known as ischemic heart disease. They are currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and interventions.

From the 24-hour events section, it is mentioned that the IABP (Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump) line was started on 04/23/2182 at 03:43 PM. The patient has allergies to lisinopril and experiences cough as a side effect. The last dose of antibiotics was given, and the patient is receiving an infusion of heparin sodium at a rate of 1,900 units per hour. Other ICU medications and other medications are also being administered.

In the review of systems, the patient's flowsheet data shows vital signs within normal range, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates stable blood pressure and cardiac output. Fluid balance shows a total intake of 294 mL and total output of 370 mL over the past 24 hours.

Physical examination findings include sinus bradycardia and an absence of peripheral pulses assessment. Neurologic examination was not performed. Lab results show a white blood cell count of 10.7 K/uL, hematocrit of 40.4%, and platelet count of 181 K/uL.

The assessment and plan indicate ongoing management for coronary artery disease in the ICU. The patient is receiving specialized care, including nutrition and glycemic"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3431**] is a 62 YOM with coronary artery disease status post bare
   metal stent to left circumflex who presented for elective
   catheterization secondary to exertional angina and positive stress
   Sestamibi, who was found to have significant left main disease and is
   status post balloon pump while awaiting CABG.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Known coronary artery disease with previous bare metal
   stent.  Now found to have significant disease throughout the left main,
   LAD, and right coronary artery.  The patient is at significant risk for
   ischemia and would benefit from CABG.  Because of severity of coronary
   artery disease he had placement of balloon pump necessitating ICU
   monitoring.
   -- continue heparin gtt
   -- Continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **] (will hold if HR < 55)
   -- Continue full dose asa and simvastatin
   -- CT surgery consulted for CABG today with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2386**] (consented)
   -- Pre-op UA, CXR, coags
   -- NPO at MN
   -- Will need PT consult after CABG
   -- On balloon pump for increased perfusion of coronary arteries not
   because of decreased EF, but because degree of stenosis and goal of
   increased coronary perfusing pressure
   .
   # PUMP:  Evidence of moderate RV dilation and hypokinesis and regional
   left ventricular systolic dyfunction but preserved EF.
   -- On balloon pump as above
   -- Will need to start [**Last Name (un) 284**] (allergy to ACEi)
   -- Continue metoprolol
   .
   # RHYTHM: Patient is in NSR with rates in the low 60s, high 50s.  No
   evidence of AV delay or heart block
   -- continue to monitor on telemetry
   -- Replete lytes PRN
   -- Will give metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], but hold if HR < 55
   .
   #  HYPERTENSION: BP in the 140s.  Pt thinks he is supposed to take 100
   mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **], however, this was recently changed to half this dose
   ([**2182-4-22**])
   -- as above continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   #  HYPERLIPIDEMIA:
   -- Continue simvastatin
   .
   #  GLUCOSE INTOLLERANCE:
   -- FS QID
   -- Insulin SS

   #  DEPRESSION:
   -- Continue Lexapro
   -- SW consult for coping

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presented for elective catheterization due to exertional angina and positive stress Sestamibi. He was found to have significant left main disease and is currently on a balloon pump while awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient is at risk for ischemia and would benefit from CABG. He is being monitored in the ICU.

Assessment and Plan:
- Continue heparin gtt
- Continue metoprolol 50 mg (Hospital1) (will hold if HR < 55)
- Continue full dose asa and simvastatin
- CT surgery consulted for CABG today with Dr. (Last Name (STitle) 2386) (consented)
- Pre-op UA, CXR, coags
- NPO at MN
- Will need PT consult after CABG
- On balloon pump for increased perfusion of coronary arteries not because of decreased EF, but because of the degree of stenosis and goal of increased coronary perfusing pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemia: The patient is at significant risk for ischemia due to his severe coronary artery disease. This can lead to chest pain, heart attack, or even cardiac arrest.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of sinus bradycardia and the use of metoprolol may increase the risk of further arrhythm"
