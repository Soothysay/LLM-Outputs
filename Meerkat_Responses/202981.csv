   Assessment and Plan
   74 y/o M with CAD/DM who presented with obstructive cholangitis and
   course complicated by troponin leak & acute renal failure now s/p ERCP
   with stenting.
   .
   # Obstructive Cholangitis s/p ERCP with stenting:  Pt with obstructive
   cholestasis & cholangitis s/p stenting & removal of stones from CBD.
   Currently comfortable and sedated post ERCP.  Adm to ICU for monitoring
   post ERCP for worsening abd pain, fevers, hypotension etc.
   -strict NPO with IVF
   -Morphine 2mg prn
   -Zosyn renally dosed
   -f/u GI/ERCP recs
   -IR for cholecystomy drainage procedure in am
   -trend LFTs, amylase/lipase post procedure
   .
   # CAD: Pt with known CAD s/p CABG in 84 & 94 and known positive stress
   MIBI from '[**15**] with inferior wall defect that has been medically managed
   due to CRI.  Pt developped troponin leak with elevated CKs in setting
   of acute illness.  Pt denies any CP & EKGs are essentially unchanged
   from prior with RBBB & terminal deflection in qrs.  Suspect that this
   is demand related damage and apprec Cards consult. CK trending down on
   recent labs.
   - will restart heparin gtt now post ERCP (no sphincterotomy)
   - continue ASA, statin
   - start Metoprolol 7.5mg IV q6hrs, goal HR<80
   - monitor on telemetry, f/u serial EKGs
   - restart isosorbide in am prn
   - f/u am ECHO
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure:  Pt presented to OSH with creatinine
   of 3.3 up from baseline of 2.7.  Creatinine continued to rise, it was
   4.3 on transfer and 5.1 on arrival to ICU.  This rapid deterioration in
   function suggests acute insult, no report of hypotension, may be due to
   contrast? vs AIN from [**Last Name (LF) 40**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] also be intravascularly depleted.
   Repeat K at 5.3 and pt having some marginal UOP, dark [**Location (un) **] fluid.
   - send urine lytes
   - monitor creatinine/Potassium, avoid nephrotoxins
   - bolus IVF now & place foley
   - renal U/s in am
   - consider renal consult in am
   .
   # Anemia: Pt with baseline hct in 37-40 range, presented to OSH with
   hct of 34.  Currently 31.4 and hemodynamically stable.
   - monitor hct carefully given h/o GI bleed now on heparin gtt
   - guaic all stools

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus who presented with obstructive cholangitis and experienced complications such as troponin leak and acute renal failure. The patient has undergone an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stenting and removal of stones from the common bile duct. 

The patient's current condition is stable post-ERCP, but he remains admitted to the ICU for monitoring due to the risk of worsening abdominal pain, fevers, and hypotension. His vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.2Â°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 119/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. The creatinine level has increased from 2.7 to 5.1, indicating acute renal failure. 

The patient's plan includes strict nothing by mouth (NPO) with intravenous fluids, administration of morphine as needed for pain, dosed renal dosing of Zosyn antibiotic, follow-up gastrointestinal/ERCP recommendations, and an interventional radiology procedure for cholecystomy drainage in the morning. 

The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, with previous coronary artery bypass grafting"

   Avoid nephrotoxins.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Replete.  Monitor I/O, maintain positive fluid
   balance.
   ABNORMAL LFTS -- likely due to biliary obstruction.  Monitor serial
   LFT.
   PANCREATITIS, acute -- likely due to biliary stones and ERCP.  Monitor
   serial amylase & lipase.
   CAD -- positive troponins, likley demand ischemia in context of
   sepsis.  Doubt primary event.  Cardiology Consultant following.  d/c

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of cholangitis, sepsis, and recent ERCP decompression of the biliary tree. They have ongoing low urine output responsive to IV fluids, remain somewhat somnolent, and await percutaneous biliary drain placement. The patient has multiple medical complications including acute renal failure, abnormal liver function tests, acute pancreatitis, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), nutritional concerns, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's hypovolemia and third spacing due to pancreatitis may lead to acute renal failure. Maintaining vigorous IV fluids, avoiding nephrotoxins, monitoring I/O, and closely observing BUN and creatinine levels are essential.

2. Abnormal Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's abnormal LFTs are likely due to biliary obstruction. Monitoring serial LFTs is necessary to assess liver function.

3. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase levels indicate acute pancreatitis, likely caused by biliary stones and ERCP. Serial monitoring of amylase and lipase is crucial.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Positive troponins suggest possible cardiac ischemia, but it is likely secondary to sepsis. Cardiology consultation is required, and maintaining Hct >28, beta-blocker administration,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient's history reveals allergies to certain medications and previous hospitalizations.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including an EKG, ultrasound, and percutaneous drain insertion. They have also received various infusions and medications, such as morphine sulfate, midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, metoprolol, and heparin sodium.

The patient's review of systems shows fatigue, no fever, no weight loss, and no other significant findings. Vital signs indicate a temperature of 37.5Â°C (99.5Â°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/72 to 140/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

Physical examination reveals jaundice, mild abdominal pain, and warm skin. The patient is alert and oriented but appears to be delirious at times. Neurologic examination shows no abnormalities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and liver enzymes. There are also abnormal levels of electrolytes, glucose, troponin-T, creatinine, and kidney function tests.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is diagnosed with cholangitis, sepsis, renal failure, pancreatitis, fluid hypovolemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   Cholangitis, sepsis.
   CHOLANGITIS -- s/p ERCP drainage, s/p percutaneous drain placement.
   Will require surgical resection in future, but poor surgical candidate
   currently.
   SEPSIS -- cholangitis.  Maintining BP currently.  Continue current
   level of care.
   CAD -- troponin leak likely demand ischemia.  Check echo.  Trend
   cardiac enzymes.  Diaphoresis may represent ischemia.
   RENAL FAILURE -- progressive.  Likely ATN.  Check ABG.  Monitor urine
   output, BUN, creatinine.  Will likely need dialysis soon if creatinine
   continues to rise.
   PANCREATITIS -- s/p ERCP vs. gallstone pancreatitis.  Trend amylase &
   lipase.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.   Replete.  [**Month (only) 51**] need central line, then follow
   CVP.
   ANEMIA -- blood loss, related to phlebotomy and
   instrumentation/procedures, and dilutional.
   DELERIUM -- medication (opiates) and evolving uremia.
   DIABETES MELLITUS -- hypoglycemia, likely due to persistent use of oral
   hypoglycemic agents in setting of renal failure.
   COAGULOPATHY -- liver disease, antibiotics, nutrition.  Evolving DIC?
   Provide vit K.

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis, acute renal failure.
   SEPSIS -- improved.  Responding to current management.  Cholangitis as
   etiology.
   CHOLANGITIS -- s/p ERCP and percutaneous drainage.  LFT's improving.
   Persistent RUQ pain may reflect GB disease (?gangrenous).  Likely will
   need surgical resection
   CAD -- demand ischemia.  Continue to trend troponins.  Continue ASA,
   beta-blocker.  Hold statin, ACE inhibitor.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- ATN;  creatitine may have peaked, now with
   plateaued creatinine, increased urine output.  No acute indication of
   acute dialysis.  Would continue to hold, support, allow spontaneous
   recovery.
   ENCEPHALOPATHY -- improved.  Multifactorial (medications, sepsis,
   uremia, LFT abnormality)

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a [**Male First Name (un)**] with chief complaints of sepsis.
- The patient has a history of allergies to Pneumovax 23, Allopurinol, and Hydralazine.
- The patient was admitted with sepsis, acute renal failure, cholangitis, and coronary artery disease (CAD).
- The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and percutaneous drainage for cholangitis.
- The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, but there is persistent right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, which may indicate gallbladder disease, possibly gangrenous.
- The patient's troponins are still trending, indicating ongoing cardiac ischemia. Current management includes continuing ASA and beta-blocker, holding statin and ACE inhibitor.
- The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), with creatinine plateauing and increased urine output.
- The patient's encephalopathy has improved, likely due to multifactorial causes including medications, sepsis, uremia, and abnormal LFTs.
- The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient's code status is full code"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented with obstructive cholangitis. He underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stenting and removal of stones from the common bile duct. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for monitoring after the procedure. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Obstructive Cholangitis: The patient had obstructive cholestasis and cholangitis prior to the ERCP procedure. There is a risk of worsening abdominal pain, fevers, and hypotension, which may indicate a recurrence or worsening of the condition.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated rapidly, suggesting an acute insult such as contrast-induced nephropathy or acute tubular necrosis. Close monitoring of creatinine and potassium levels is necessary to avoid further nephrotoxicity.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CAD and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Elevated troponin levels indicate myocardial injury, possibly due to demand-related ischemia. Cardiac consultation is recommended, and the patient should be monitored on telemetry with serial EKGs.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, which may be due to chronic gastrointestinal bleeding or other causes. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and consideration of blood transfusion"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. They have a history of allergies to allopurinol, hydralazine, and pneumovax 23. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for fatigue, dry mouth, mild pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), and encephalopathy. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3Â°C (97.4Â°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 132/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving several medications and infusions, including piperacillin/tazobactam, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Sepsis: The patient's chief complaint and diagnosis of sepsis indicate a systemic infection. This can lead to various complications such as organ dysfunction, septic shock, and multiple organ failure.

2. Cholangitis: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and fever, along with the diagnosis of cholangitis, suggest an infection of the bile ducts. This condition can progress rapidly and may require surgical intervention if conservative measures fail.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has a history of allergies to certain medications and is currently receiving treatment for cholangitis, renal failure, and encephalopathy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 132/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Fluid balance is being closely monitored. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood glucose levels have been relatively stable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of sepsis could lead to further complications such as organ dysfunction or failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or septic shock.
2. Cholangitis: The patient has cholangitis, which may progress to severe complications like cholecystitis, liver abscesses, or biliary sepsis if not properly managed.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and if left untreated, it could lead to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease, requiring long-term dialysis or kidney transplantation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and has a history of sepsis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, renal failure, and gout. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and percutaneous drainage for cholangitis. They also received hemodialysis (HD) for uremia due to encephalopathy. The patient's right toe pain is related to a history of gout. The patient's condition has shown improvement, but they remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's history of sepsis indicates an increased risk of infections in the ICU. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or elevated white blood cell count, is essential.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient has a history of multiple organ dysfunction, including renal failure and pancreatitis. Regular monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and organ function is necessary to detect any further deterioration.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored due to their desire for a net negative fluid status. Excessive fluid administration can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema or worsening renal function.
4. Gout Flare-up: The patient's right toe pain suggests a potential flare-up of gout. It is important to manage this symptomatically and avoid nephrotoxins that could worsen renal function.
5. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/72 to 175/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient has a right bundle branch block heart rhythm. The patient's weight is 111.3 kg, with a height of 70 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 950 mL total, including 600 mL by mouth, 350 mL through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and 210 mL through intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient has received a total output of 1,940 mL, including 1,810 mL of urine, 130 mL of drain output, and 30 mL of stool output. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an ABG result of 23. Physical examination reveals the patient to be overweight/obese, with normal eye/conjunctiva, head/ears/nose/throat, lymphatic, cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, respiratory/chest, abdominal, extremities, musculoskeletal, skin, and neurologic assessments. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cholangitis: The patient has been diagnosed with cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile ducts.
2. Cholecystitis: The patient may also have cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder.
3. Pancreatitis: Pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, is another potential complication.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored due to the risk of acute renal failure.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high, indicating hypertension.
6. Encephalopathy: There is a possibility of encephalopathy, which refers to brain dysfunction.
7. Anemia: The patient may develop anemia due to various factors such as blood loss or decreased production.
8. Pleural effusion: The patient may have pleural effusion, which is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space around the lungs.
9. Volume overload: The patient is substantially volume overloaded, indicating a need for careful management of fluid balance.
10. Infection: Due to the patient's ICU stay and invasive procedures, there is a risk"
