   valvular heart disease and fixed cardiac output, acute blood loss, and
   sedation / intraoperative beta blocker administration. Given estimated
   loss of ~400cc blood and 10pt Hct drop, hypovolemia is the most likely
   contributor to hypotension. Lastly, although sinus tachycardia / atrial
   fibrillation is compensatory in setting of hypovolemia, given her fixed
   cardiac output she may benefit from rate control, however difficult to
   do in setting of vasopressor requirement. Lastly, regarding choice of
   vasopressor, will need to avoid chronotropically active agents (B1/B2
   stimulation) and although increasing afterload is not ideal in this
   setting, it is the preferred option
   -- Neosynephrine as tolerated
   -- Lasix IV pushes with goal -50-100cc /hr
   -- Transfuse blood over 5 hours with lasix in between doses
   -- Avoid futher IV fluids
   # Hypoxia: No significant oxygen requirement at this time, however in
   setting of anemia will continue oxygen supplementation.
   -- supplemental oxygen
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: In setting of poor forward flow from AS and also
   now from hypovolemia and anemia. Patient does not seem volume
   overloaded at this time howver as above will need to strike fluid
   balance to avoid flash pulmonary edema

","Summary:
The patient is a 96-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension. She has an acute spontaneous right femur fracture and postoperative hypotension. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypovolemia: The patient has experienced significant blood loss during surgery, resulting in hypovolemia. This can lead to low blood pressure and inadequate perfusion to vital organs.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's poor forward flow from aortic stenosis, along with hypovolemia and anemia, puts her at risk for acute renal failure. Close monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels is necessary.
3. Hypoxia: The patient may experience hypoxia due to anemia and impaired oxygen delivery to tissues. Supplemental oxygen should be provided to maintain adequate oxygenation.
4. Femur fracture/orif: The patient has a right femur fracture, which requires orthopedic intervention. Surgical site integrity needs to be monitored, and pain management should be optimized.
5. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, and careful management of her cardiac function is crucial during the perioperative period.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is at high risk for atrial fibrillation due to acute pain and perioperative stress. Rate control measures should be implemented, and anticoag"

","The patient is a 91-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. She has an acute spontaneous right femur fracture and postoperative hypotension. The patient's current medical conditions include hypovolemia, hypotension, hypoxia, acute renal failure, femur fracture/orif, CAD, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and fen/gi issues.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypovolemia leading to shock, further hypotension, hypoxia, acute renal failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential complications from the femur fracture surgery.

Based on the information provided, it appears that the patient is at high risk for these complications due to her age, underlying medical conditions, and recent surgery. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), 500cc of saline, and 40 mg of lasix. The Neo (presumably referring to a medication or treatment) was weaned down to 0.3 mcg/kg from 1 mcg/kg.

The patient has multiple allergies, including Darvocet-N 100, Codeine, Fosamax, Darvon, Doxycycline, and several medications with unknown allergies.

The patient's last dose of antibiotics is not specified. They are currently receiving infusions of Phenylephrine at 0.3 mcg/kg/min and Pantoprazole. Other ICU medications include colace, simvastatin, and tylenol. The patient is also taking pantoprazole, colace, simvastatin, and tylenol as other medications.

There are no changes to the patient's medical and family history, and the review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 102 bpm (with a normal range of 93-115 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 107/46 mmHg to 137/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 15-25 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,010 mL and total output of 812 mL, with a net fluid balance of 420 mL. The patient has received 975 mL of blood products and has had a urine output of 135 mL. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, and their ABG results indicate a pH of 7.35, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, HCO3- of 118 mEq/L, BE of -3, and O2 saturation of 97%.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the bilateral lungs, and their peripheral pulses are not assessed. The patient's skin is not assessed, but their right hip dressing is clean, dry, and intact. Neurologic examination is also not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 18.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL, platelet count of 226 K/uL, creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 56 mg/dL, sodium of 141 mEq/L, potassium of 5"

   I saw and examined the patient with the pulmonary fellow, the
   assessment and plan was discussed in detail.  I would emphasize the
   following.  Volume shifts postoperatively seems to be an issue.
   Transfused overnight with lasix.  Able to discontinue neo.
   Persistent crackles on exam bilaterally [**1-31**] way up.
   Urine output decreased, rising Cr.  Significant AS.
   Agree with conservative management, no active diuresis at this point as
   she is reasonably well compensated from a respiratory standpoint (on 3L
   NC).  No further active diuresis.
   Will continue and monitor in the ICU given severe AS.

   valvular heart disease and fixed cardiac output, acute blood loss, and
   sedation / intraoperative beta blocker administration. Given estimated
   loss of ~400cc blood and 10pt Hct drop, hypovolemia is the most likely
   contributor to hypotension. Lastly, although sinus tachycardia / atrial
   fibrillation is compensatory in setting of hypovolemia, given her fixed
   cardiac output she may benefit from rate control, however difficult to
   do in setting of vasopressor requirement. Lastly, regarding choice of
   vasopressor, will need to avoid chronotropically active agents (B1/B2
   stimulation) and although increasing afterload is not ideal in this
   setting, it is the preferred option
   -- Neosynephrine and wean as tolerated today
   -- Plan to keep patient even for now (hold on IVF and encourage po
   intake)
   -- Transfuse blood over 5 hours with lasix in between doses
   -- Avoid futher IV fluids
   # Hypoxia: No significant oxygen requirement at this time, however in
   setting of anemia will continue oxygen supplementation.

","The patient is a 2437-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. She has an acute spontaneous right femur fracture and postoperative hypotension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure of 117/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 18.6 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 35.1 g/dL, platelet count of 78 thousand/mm3, creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 156 mg/dL, and potassium level of 4.8 mEq/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include hypotension, acute renal failure, femur fracture/orif, CAD, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, FEN/GI, PPX, and code status. The patient is currently on various medications such as pantoprazole, metoprolol, simvastatin, and morphine for pain control.

Potential medical complications that can arise include hypotension leading to organ perfusion and potential shock, acute renal failure due to poor forward flow from aortic stenosis and hypovolemia, femur fracture complications such as infection or"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 94-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. She has an acute spontaneous right femur fracture and postoperative hypotension. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has low urine output and decreased hemoglobin levels. Her blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and troponin T levels. The patient's medical history includes a possible acute renal failure, hypoxia, femur fracture with ORIF surgery, CAD, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and fen/gi issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, including severe valvular heart disease, acute blood loss, sedation/intraoperative beta blocker administration, and hypovolemia.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's poor forward flow from aortic stenosis, along with hypovolemia and anemia, may contribute to acute renal failure.
3. Femur Fracture/ORIF: The patient has a right femur fracture that underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. There is a concern for postoperative pain management due to her tight valvular stenosis, making her a high-risk candidate for general anesthesia.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which may"

   Attending Note: I saw and examined the patient, and was physically
   present with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 10164**] for the key portions of the services provided.
   I agree with the note above, including the assessment and plan. I would
   emphasize and add the following points:
   Lovely [**Age over 90 2437**] yr old woman with severe aortic stenosis s/p ORIF for hip
   fracture, now with acute blood loss anemia, requiring several
   transfusions of prbc. Despite appropriate increases in Hct after
   transfusion she has had acute decreases by 5 points, including today.
   She is also at high risk of acute CHF given her aortic stenosis. Thus
   far, has tolerated fluids well. She has acute renal failure with creat
   of 2.0 from baseline 1.3. Urine output appears to be picking up now.
   Exam is notable for MAP 56-86, hard of hearing, awake, alert, bilat
   breath sounds without crackles. Agree with starting low dose beta
   blocker. Per ortho, SCH restarted but would hold on aspirin for now
   given drop in hematocrit. DNR/DNI yet critically ill. Time 30 minutes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis who underwent an operation for a hip fracture. She is now experiencing acute blood loss anemia and has required multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBC). Despite appropriate increases in hematocrit (Hct) after transfusion, she has had acute decreases by 5 points, including today. She is at high risk of acute congestive heart failure (CHF) given her aortic stenosis. The patient has also developed acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.0 from a baseline of 1.3. Her urine output appears to be improving with the use of PRBC.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/52 to 138/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, symmetrical chest expansion, soft and non-tender abdomen, absence of lower extremity edema, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 18.6 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, platelet count of 178 K/uL, creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 118 to 160 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances such as sodium of 24 mEq/L, potassium of 4.8 mEq/L, and chloride of 104 mEq/L. Other lab values indicate elevated troponin-T levels and elevated lactate levels.

Imaging reveals a stable chest X-ray with the patient's chest slightly rotated. Microbiology results are negative for any new findings.

The assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring of Hct and urine output, holding off on active diuresis or aggressive volume resuscitation, and allowing the patient to self-replete fluids orally. The patient will also be started on a low-dose beta-blocker, and aspirin will be restarted once the hematocrit stabilizes. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is currently in the ICU."

The patient is a 95-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension. She presented with an acute spontaneous right femur fracture and postoperative hypotension. The patient has impaired balance, gait, knowledge, muscle performance, range of motion, and transfers. She also has impaired respiration/gas exchange due to a fracture and other medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 104/39 to 97/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient has a history of allergies to Darvocet-N 100, Codeine, Fosamax, Darvon, Doxycycline, and multiple unknown medications. She received infusions of Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications. The patient has been transfused overnight and has shown improvement in her creatinine level. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is multifactorial in nature. Factors contributing to hypotension include severe valvular heart disease, fixed cardiac output, acute blood loss, sedation/intraoperative beta-blocker administration, and vasopressor requirement.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 2437**] year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, CAD, and HTN, now with
   an acute spontaneous right femur fracture with post operative
   hypotension
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Resolved, initially multifactorial in this elderly woman
   with severe valvular heart disease and fixed cardiac output, acute
   blood loss, and sedation / intraoperative beta blocker administration.
   Given estimated loss of ~400cc blood and 10pt Hct drop, hypovolemia is
   the most likely contributor to hypotension. Lastly, although sinus
   tachycardia / atrial fibrillation is compensatory in setting of
   hypovolemia, given her fixed cardiac output she may benefit from rate
   control, however difficult to do in setting of vasopressor requirement.
   Lastly, regarding choice of vasopressor, will need to avoid
   chronotropically active agents (B1/B2 stimulation) and although
   increasing afterload is not ideal in this setting, it is the preferred
   option. Now off pressors for past 24 hours.
   -- Plan to keep patient even for now (hold on IVF and encourage po
   intake)
   -- Now s/p repeat transfusion overnight
   -- Avoid further IV fluids
   # Hypoxia: Resolved, No significant oxygen requirement at this time
   -- supplemental oxygen PRN
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Improving, In setting of poor forward flow from
   AS and also now from hypovolemia and anemia. Patient does not seem
   volume overloaded at this time however as above will need to strike
   fluid balance to avoid flash pulmonary edema
   -- avoid IVF for now given concern for overload
   -- FeUrea 15%
   .
   # Femur fracture / ORIF: Appreciate ortho team recs. Currently
   following, surgical site intact
   -- She appears comfortable with adequate pain, tolerating being out of
   bed
   -- continue standing tylenol 1g q8
   -- continue morphine IR prn for breakthrough
   .
   # CAD: No clear documentation, however given age calcific
   atherosclerosis is highly likely
   -- continue statin
   -- uptitrate BB to 25mg daily
   -- hold aspirin in perioperative period
   .
   # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: In setting of acute pain and peri-op. Will need
   to monitor as pt with high CHADS score, however in periop period would
   not be able to have systemic anticoagulation
   -- Rate control with beta blocker once stable
   -- If unstable, would use esmolol first, cardiovert would be heroic
   measure.
   .
   # HTN: Better controlled on floor. Good BP control essential for
   preventing flash pulmonary edema in setting of AS.
   - continue metoprolol, as above
   - continue to monitor BP and consider adding another [**Doctor Last Name **] such
   as amlodipine 5mg daily if BP sustains above SBP 150s
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia
   - continue simvastatin 40mg PO daily
   .
   # FEN/GI: Low sodium diet, replete lytes PRN
   .
   # PPX: Pneumoboots for now given blood loss, may start heparin for
   prophylaxis in AM
   .

","Summary:
- The patient is a 95-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension.
- She has an acute spontaneous right femur fracture and post-operative hypotension.
- The patient's hypotension has resolved, initially caused by multifactorial reasons including valvular heart disease, acute blood loss, and sedation/intraoperative beta-blocker administration.
- The most likely contributor to hypotension is hypovolemia due to blood loss of approximately 400cc and a 10-point Hct drop.
- The patient may benefit from rate control for sinus tachycardia/atrial fibrillation, especially given her fixed cardiac output.
- Vasopressors were required but are now off for the past 24 hours.
- The patient's hypoxia has resolved, and supplemental oxygen is given as needed.
- The patient is improving from acute renal failure, likely due to poor forward flow from aortic stenosis and hypovolemia/anemia.
- Fluid balance needs to be carefully managed to avoid flash pulmonary edema.
- The femur fracture/ORIF site is intact and comfortable, and pain management is ongoing.
- The patient has a history of CAD, and medication adjustments are being made, including continuing a statin, uptitrating beta-blocker to 25mg daily, and holding aspirin in the perioperative period.
- Atrial fibrillation is monitored, and rate control"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with a history of multiple medical conditions. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently being treated for several issues, including impaired respiration and gas exchange, a fracture, hypovolemia, prerenal azotemia, atrial fibrillation (afib), anemia, and aortic stenosis (AS). The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 89 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 101/57 mmHg to 125/59 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is at 92% on a nasal cannula. Fluid balance shows an intake of 519 mL and output of 1,027 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 508 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit levels, and elevated troponin-T levels. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including heparin, metoprolol, morphine, and others. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and they are expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary complications: The patient's history of impaired respiration and gas exchange puts them at risk for further pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiac complications: With a history of atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, and elevated troponin-T levels, the patient is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a well-nourished individual with a stable hemoglobin concentration. The patient has received ambien and morphine overnight for insomnia and was confused but not agitated in the morning. They have allergies to several medications including Darvocet-N 100, Codeine, Fosamax, Darvon, Doxycycline, and Heparin Sodium.

The patient's medical and family history, as well as review of systems, remain unchanged from admission except where noted above and below. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature range of 36.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 77-101 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 65-125 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%.

The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin for DVT and has undergone various interventions and treatments, including the administration of different medications. The patient's respiratory support includes the use of a nasal cannula with an oxygen saturation of 92%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelets (Plt), and troponin-T. Other lab results indicate abnormal levels of potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), BUN, creatinine (Cr), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4). The patient's glucose levels have been consistently high.

The assessment and plan include addressing impaired gas exchange, a fracture, hypovolemia, prerenal azotemia, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and altered mental status. The patient is also being managed for ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), communication, code status, and disposition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's initial presentation included mild pulmonary edema, which has since resolved. However, there is a possibility of recurrent pulmonary edema if fluid balance is not properly managed.
2. Infection: The elevated WBC count may indicate an underlying infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic treatment if necessary is important.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient is receiving prophylactic heparin, there is still a risk of developing DVT due to immobility in the ICU setting. Regular assessment for symptoms of DVT is crucial.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest potential renal dysfunction. Monitoring renal function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly is essential.
5. Hyperglycemia: The consistently high glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control. Close monitoring and management of blood glucose levels are necessary to prevent complications related to hyperglycemia.
6. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of beta-blockers increase the risk of arrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is important to detect any abnormal heart rhythms promptly.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and overall clinical condition to promptly identify and manage any potential complications that may arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 2437**] year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, CAD, and HTN, now with
   an acute spontaneous right femur fracture with post operative
   hypotension
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Resolved, initially multifactorial in this elderly woman
   with severe valvular heart disease and fixed cardiac output, acute
   blood loss, and sedation / intraoperative beta blocker administration.
   Given estimated loss of ~400cc blood and 10pt Hct drop, hypovolemia is
   the most likely contributor to hypotension. Lastly, although sinus
   tachycardia / atrial fibrillation is compensatory in setting of
   hypovolemia, given her fixed cardiac output she may benefit from rate
   control, however difficult to do in setting of vasopressor requirement.
   Lastly, regarding choice of vasopressor, will need to avoid
   chronotropically active agents (B1/B2 stimulation) and although
   increasing afterload is not ideal in this setting, it is the preferred
   option. Now off pressors for past 48 hours.
   -- Plan to keep patient even for now (hold on IVF and encourage po
   intake)
   # Hypoxia: Resolved, No significant oxygen requirement at this time
   -- supplemental oxygen PRN
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Improving, In setting of poor forward flow from
   AS and also now from hypovolemia and anemia. Patient does not seem
   volume overloaded at this time however as above will need to strike
   fluid balance to avoid flash pulmonary edema
   -- avoid IVF for now given concern for overload
   -- FeUrea 15%
   .
   # Femur fracture / ORIF: Appreciate ortho team recs. Currently
   following, surgical site intact
   -- She appears comfortable with adequate pain, tolerating being out of
   bed
   -- continue standing tylenol 1g q8
   -- continue morphine IR prn for breakthrough
   .
   # CAD: No clear documentation, however given age calcific
   atherosclerosis is highly likely
   -- continue statin
   -- uptitrate BB 25mg daily, aspirin
   .
   # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: In setting of acute pain and peri-op. Will need
   to monitor as pt with high CHADS score, however in periop period would
   not be able to have systemic anticoagulation
   -- Rate control with beta blocker
   -- If unstable, would use esmolol first, cardiovert would be heroic
   measure.
   .
   # HTN: Better controlled on floor. Good BP control essential for
   preventing flash pulmonary edema in setting of AS.
   - continue metoprolol, as above
   - continue to monitor BP and consider adding another [**Doctor Last Name **] such
   as amlodipine 5mg daily if BP sustains above SBP 150s
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia
   - continue simvastatin 40mg PO daily
   .
   # FEN/GI: Low sodium diet, replete lytes PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. She presented with an acute spontaneous right femur fracture and post-operative hypotension. The patient has since resolved her hypotension, hypoxia, and acute renal failure. She is currently tolerating being out of bed and has intact surgical site post ORIF for femur fracture. The patient has a history of CAD, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and is on various medications including statin, beta-blocker, aspirin, and PPI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has shown improvement in renal function but remains at risk due to poor forward flow from aortic stenosis, hypovolemia, and anemia. Fluid balance management will be crucial to avoid flash pulmonary edema.
2. Femur Fracture/Ortho Trauma: The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for the femur fracture. Care should be taken to prevent surgical site infections and ensure proper wound healing.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Given the patient's age and history of CAD, there is a risk of recurrent myocardial infarction or angina. Monitoring of cardiac symptoms and continued use of antiplatelet and statin therapy is essential.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 2437**] year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis, CAD, and HTN, now with
   an acute spontaneous right femur fracture with post operative
   hypotension
   .
   # Femur fracture / ORIF: Appreciate ortho team recs. Currently
   following, surgical site intact
   -- She appears comfortable with adequate pain, tolerating being out of
   bed
   -- continue standing tylenol 1g q8
   -- continue morphine IR prn for breakthrough
   -- weught bear as tolerated
   -- f/u ortho recs
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Resolved, initially multifactorial in this elderly woman
   with severe valvular heart disease and fixed cardiac output, acute
   blood loss, and sedation / intraoperative beta blocker administration.
   Given estimated loss of ~400cc blood and 10pt Hct drop, hypovolemia is
   the most likely contributor to hypotension. Lastly, although sinus
   tachycardia / atrial fibrillation is compensatory in setting of
   hypovolemia, given her fixed cardiac output she may benefit from rate
   control, however difficult to do in setting of vasopressor requirement.
   Lastly, regarding choice of vasopressor, will need to avoid
   chronotropically active agents (B1/B2 stimulation) and although
   increasing afterload is not ideal in this setting, it is the preferred
   option. Now off pressors for past 48 hours.
   -- Plan to keep patient even for now (hold on IVF and encourage po
   intake)
   # Hypoxia: Resolved, No significant oxygen requirement at this time
   -- supplemental oxygen PRN
   .
   # ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Improving, In setting of poor forward flow from
   AS and also now from hypovolemia and anemia. Patient does not seem
   volume overloaded at this time however as above will need to strike
   fluid balance to avoid flash pulmonary edema
   -- avoid IVF for now given concern for overload
   -- FeUrea 15%
   .
   .
   # CAD: No clear documentation, however given age calcific
   atherosclerosis is highly likely
   -- continue statin
   -- uptitrate BB 25mg daily, aspirin
   .
   # ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: In setting of acute pain and peri-op. Will need
   to monitor as pt with high CHADS score, however in periop period would
   not be able to have systemic anticoagulation
   -- Rate control with beta blocker
   -- If unstable, would use esmolol first, cardiovert would be heroic
   measure.
   .
   # HTN: Better controlled on floor. Good BP control essential for
   preventing flash pulmonary edema in setting of AS.
   - continue metoprolol, as above
   - continue to monitor BP and consider adding another [**Doctor Last Name **] such
   as amlodipine 5mg daily if BP sustains above SBP 150s
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia
   - continue simvastatin 40mg PO daily
   .
   # FEN/GI: Low sodium diet, replete lytes PRN
   .
   # PPX: Heparin SC
