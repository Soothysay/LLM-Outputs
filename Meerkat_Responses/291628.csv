   # RHYTHM:  Patient currently in NSR.  Patient with ICD in place with AT
   pacing at rates > 180, Firing at rates > 250.  On review of ECG,
   appears to be an inferior focus of VT, likely secondary to scar.  Other
   inciting events can include ischemia, ETOHism.  Patient reports drop
   attacks over the past year - this may represent slow VT in this patient
   that is not subject to AT pacing or shock.  On review of ICD
   interrogation report, and on [**8-19**] patient had an episode of VT (180s
   BPM) for which his ICD did not fire.  This may have represented
   patient's syncopal event 1-2 months ago, but unclear.  Patient's
   syncopal/pre-syncopal events may be related to slow VT that leads to
   hypoperfusion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (efficiency 20%) who presented with ventricular tachycardia storm. The patient's current vital signs are as follows:

- Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
- Heart rate: 79 bpm with a normal range of 79-87 bpm
- Blood pressure: 109/79 mmHg with a range of 101/72-109/86 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute with a range of 11-22 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on nasal cannula

The patient's physical examination reveals the following:
- General: The patient is alert, oriented, and has appropriate mood and affect.
- HEENT: No abnormalities noted in the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat.
- Neck: Supple neck with jugular venous pressure of 10 cm.
- Cardiac: Inferiorly displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), midclavicular line. Regular rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds. A third heart sound (S3) or fourth heart sound (S4) is not present. There is a III/VI holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border (LLSB) without thrills or lifts.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20%) who presented with a VT storm. The patient has an ICD in place and experienced an episode of VT that was not terminated by the ICD. The patient also had a syncopal event in the past that may be related to slow VT leading to hypoperfusion.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, which was initially treated with an amio drip but was discontinued. The patient underwent VT ablation, but was unable to induce arrhythmia. However, slow VT was induced, and the patient was shocked out of it, resulting in pulseless electrical activity (PEA). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated, and the patient was resuscitated. Anakinetic left ventricle (LV) was observed, and the patient received norepinephrine and dopamine infusions. A balloon pump was also started, and the patient regained some LV function, suggesting myocardial stunning.

The patient's physical examination revealed an inferiorly displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), midclavicular line, with a normal S1 and loud S2. A third heart sound (S3) was not heard.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) who presented with a VT storm. The patient underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure yesterday and has been in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) since then. 

The patient experienced a syncopal episode, which is believed to be caused by episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT). During the EP procedure, they were unable to induce arrhythmia, but a slow VT was induced and the patient required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity (PEA). 

The patient has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in place with automatic atrioventricular (AT) pacing at rates above 180 and firing at rates above 250. He is currently on a balloon pump and will be sedated with propofol while on the balloon pump, potentially switching to fentanyl/versed if propofol is not tolerated. 

The patient has a history of large anterior myocardial infarction in [**2192**] and is being continued on statin, aspirin, and beta-blocker therapy. His ejection fraction (EF) is estimated to be around 20%. 

The patient requires anticoagulation with heparin while in the hospital and the balloon pump will be weaned as tolerated. 

The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation requiring volume"

   Chief Complaint: ICD firing
   24 Hour Events:
   -Hypotensive to 80's - Amio drip d/c'ed
   -pt went to cath for VT ablation, unable to induce arrhythmia, however
   did induce slow VT, pt shocked out of it, went into PEA (sinus
   rhythm).  CPR initiated in cath lab.  Akinetic LV, started norepi &
   dopa gtt, started balloon pump.  Pulse back, on re-echo, pt had
   regained some LV funx, therefore presumed stunning from shock.  Belly
   also tense, therefore concerned for bleed secondary to recent
   instrumentation, sent to CT, no evidence of obvious bleed by CT (final
   read pending).  Pt transferred to floor.  Intubated, sedated on
   propofol on levophed.
   -ECHO: Moderately dilated LV with severe focal akinesis in the
   distribution of the LAD. The right ventricle is mildly
   dilated/hypokinetic with moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and
   at least mild pulmonary hypertension.

   Imaging: TTE [**9-21**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
   severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. The basal inferolateral
   wall contracts best (LVEF = 20 %). A large mural thrombus is suggested
   along the distal half of the septum and extending into the apex. The
   right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free
   wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
   mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**12-4**]+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
   seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is a trivial pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargmenet with severe systolic
   dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process. Probable
   apical left ventricular mural thrombus. Right ventricular cavity
   enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (morning of [**2202-9-20**]; images reviewed),
   the right ventricular systolic function is now more depressed. Left
   ventricular cavity size and free wall motion are similar. A mural
   thrombus is also suggested on the prior study.

   1. No acute intracranial process.
   2. Paranasal sinus disease with fluid and secretions seen in the
   nasopharynx, presumably related to the presence of the endotracheal
   tube.
   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient currently in NSR and pt has been without evidence of
   arrhythmia since return from EP procedure yesterday.  Suspect that
   episodes of VT caused his syncopal episode.  Unable to induce
   arrhythmia in cath lab o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required
   resuscitation for PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at
   rates > 180, Firing at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p
   cardiac arrest in EP lab.  Troponins x3 negative, therefore low concern
   for ischemic etiology.  Balloon pump pulled yesterday, sedation
   continued as patient became very agitated on vent with propofol.
   - Continue propofol sedation while intubated, can switch to
   fentanyl/versed if pressures do not tolerate propofol
   - Continue metoprolol for rate control
   - Continue Heparin gtt for a fib (and thrombus, as below)
   - f/u EP recs re: need for additional intervention
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.
   -Continue heparin IV for anticoagulation
   .
   # Respiratory: Sedated on vent with volume assist, agitated and
   fighting the vent when propofol interrupted or when suctioned.  Will
   wean as tolerated and attempt extubation today if stable.
   -Wean sedation today, attempt extubation as tolerated
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical Akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE yesterday.  IABP removed
   [**9-21**].
   -Goal even to net negative today
   -anticoagulation with heparin while in-patient
   -Continue Metoprolol and Lisinopril, titrate up as tolerated,
   particularly once propofol is weaned
   .
   # Cool L Lower Extremity:  L foot slightly cooler than R, but without
   asymmetry, erythema, or swelling of LEs, 2+ DP pulses b/l.  Given LV
   thrombus, would consider LE US but suspicion low.
   - Consider LE doppler US
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].   Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during arrest in the
   setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function improved to
   baseline on admission.
   -Trend Cr daily
   .
   # Elevated LFTs:  Alcoholic (more likely) versus Gallstone etiology (AP
   291, no other LFT abn), GGT elevated.  Patient has unremarkable CT.
   - Trend Lipase, LFTs
   - NPO on vent
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given propofol sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   .  .
   #Abd distension: Stable, CT yesterday negative.  Will monitor with
   serial abdominal exams.

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm.
2. The patient underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure, but experienced a cardiac arrest in the lab. He was resuscitated and placed on a balloon pump.
3. Troponin levels were negative, indicating a low concern for an ischemic etiology.
4. The patient has been sedated on propofol and intubated due to agitation on the ventilator.
5. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed left ventricular cavity enlargement with severe systolic dysfunction consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) or other diffuse process. A mural thrombus was also suggested in the left ventricle.
6. Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis was noted, along with pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7. The patient's right ventricular systolic function is now more depressed compared to the prior study.
8. A head CT scan showed no acute intracranial process.
9. The patient's rhythm has been mostly normal sinus rhythm (NSR), but there were episodes of VT in the past.
10. The patient's renal function improved to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) who presented with ventricular tachycardia storm. He underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure and was placed on a balloon pump due to cardiac arrest during the procedure. The patient's troponins are negative, indicating low concern for an ischemic etiology. The patient is currently sedated on propofol and intubated, requiring volume assist. He has a large mural thrombus in the left ventricle, but his head CT was negative for embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and weaning of sedation and extubation are planned as tolerated. The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with antero-apical akinesis, and anticoagulation with heparin is planned while in the hospital. The patient's renal function improved to baseline after an episode of acute renal failure, likely related to poor perfusion during cardiac arrest. His liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, possibly due to alcoholic hepatitis or gallstones, and he has a history of chronic ethanol abuse. The patient's abdominal distension is stable, and his glycemic control is being monitored. The patient is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

     2. No pathologic focus of enhancement.
     3. Paranasal sinus disease with fluid and secretions seen in the
   nasopharynx and sphenoid sinuses, presumably related to the presence of
   the endotracheal tube.
   NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is no evidence of acute
   territorial infarction; there is a 10mm chronic lacune in the mid-left
   cerebellar hemisphere, in addition to the smaller one in the left
   thalamus, both likely unchanged since the remote [**12-4**] study.
   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure.  Suspect that episodes of VT
   caused his syncopal episode.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Troponins x3 negative, therefore low concern for ischemic
   etiology (then post-procedure troponins peaked at 0.75 and now
   downtrending).  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as
   patient became very agitated on vent with propofol. Had episodes of
   NSVT o/n
 ICD shocked him back into normal rhythm.
   - Continue propofol sedation while intubated, can switch to
   fentanyl/versed if pressures do not tolerate propofol
   - Continue metoprolol for rate control
   - Continue Heparin gtt for afib (and thrombus, as below)
   - f/u EP recs re: need for additional intervention, consider amiodarone
   versus other antiarrhythmic
   - can stop checking cardiac enzymes as peaked yesterday and now
   downtrending
   - digoxin level infratherapeutic today (0.4)
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.
   -Continue heparin IV gtt for anticoagulation
   .
   # Respiratory: Ventilated with pressure
 CPAP.
   -Wean sedation today, attempt extubation as tolerated
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for subclinical seizures, or withdrawal, or
   excess sedation not being cleared by liver/kidneys.
   - Neuro consult
   - Monitor clinically
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical Akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE yesterday.  IABP removed
   [**9-21**].
   -Goal even to net negative today
   -anticoagulation with heparin while in-patient
   -Continue Metoprolol and Lisinopril, titrate up as tolerated,
   particularly once propofol is weaned
   .
   # Positive sputum & U/A & Tmax 101: Repeat cultures sent, and patient
   started on vanc/zosyn on [**9-22**].
   - f/u repeat cultures
   - trend WBC, fever curve (Tmax 101 o/n; WBC 9.3 (his highest during
   this hospitalization))
   .
   # Cool L Lower Extremity:  L foot slightly cooler than R, but without
   asymmetry, erythema, or swelling of LEs, 2+ DP pulses b/l.  Given LV
   thrombus, would consider LE US but suspicion low.
   - Consider LE doppler US
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].   Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during arrest in the
   setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function improved again
   today.
   -Trend Cr daily
   .
   # Elevated LFTs:  Alcoholic (more likely) versus Gallstone etiology (AP
   291, no other LFT abn), GGT elevated.  Patient has unremarkable CT.
   - Trend Lipase, LFTs
   - NPO on vent
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given propofol sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   .  .
   #Abd distension: Stable, CT negative.  Will monitor with serial
   abdominal exams.
   .
   #Macrocytic Anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol. Stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure.  Suspect that episodes of VT
   caused his syncopal episode.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Troponins x3 negative, therefore low concern for ischemic
   etiology (then post-procedure troponins peaked at 0.75 and now
   downtrending).  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as
   patient became very agitated on vent with propofol. Had episodes of
   NSVT o/n
 ICD shocked him back into normal rhythm.
   - Continue propofol sedation while intubated, can switch to
   fentanyl/versed if pressures do not tolerate propofol
   - Continue metoprolol for rate control
   - Continue Heparin gtt for afib (and thrombus, as below)
   - f/u EP recs re: need for additional intervention, consider amiodarone
   versus other antiarrhythmic
   - can stop checking cardiac enzymes as peaked yesterday and now
   downtrending
   - digoxin level infratherapeutic today (0.4)
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.
   -Continue heparin IV gtt for anticoagulation
   .
   # Respiratory: Ventilated with pressure
 CPAP.
   -Wean sedation today, attempt extubation as tolerated
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for subclinical seizures, or withdrawal, or
   excess sedation not being cleared by liver/kidneys.
   - Neuro consult
   - Monitor clinically
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical Akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE yesterday.  IABP removed
   [**9-21**].
   -Goal even to net negative today
   -anticoagulation with heparin while in-patient
   -Continue Metoprolol and Lisinopril, titrate up as tolerated,
   particularly once propofol is weaned
   .
   # Positive sputum & U/A & Tmax 101: Repeat cultures sent, and patient
   started on vanc/zosyn on [**9-22**].
   - f/u repeat cultures
   - trend WBC, fever curve (Tmax 101 o/n; WBC 9.3 (his highest during
   this hospitalization))
   .
   # Cool L Lower Extremity:  L foot slightly cooler than R, but without
   asymmetry, erythema, or swelling of LEs, 2+ DP pulses b/l.  Given LV
   thrombus, would consider LE US but suspicion low.
   - Consider LE doppler US
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].   Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during arrest in the
   setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function improved again
   today.
   -Trend Cr daily
   .
   # Elevated LFTs:  Alcoholic (more likely) versus Gallstone etiology (AP
   291, no other LFT abn), GGT elevated.  Patient has unremarkable CT.
   - Trend Lipase, LFTs
   - NPO on vent
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given propofol sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   .  .
   #Abd distension: Stable, CT negative.  Will monitor with serial
   abdominal exams.
   .
   #Macrocytic Anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol. Stable.

   Disposition: CCU
","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20%) who presents with ventricular tachycardia storm. The patient underwent an electrophysiology procedure, during which he experienced a cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated and returned to the ICU on a balloon pump. Troponin levels were initially negative, but later peaked at 0.75 and are now downtrending. The patient has been experiencing episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) overnight.

The patient's current medications include Coumadin started at 5 mg daily, captopril increased to 25 mg three times a day, and metoprolol increased to 50 mg three times a day. Allergies include no known drug allergies.

In terms of medical complications that can arise, the patient is at risk for rhythm disturbances, specifically ventricular tachycardia or other arrhythmias. There is also a concern for potential embolic events due to the presence of a left ventricular mural thrombus, although the head CT is negative for any acute process. The patient's mental status may fluctuate due to subclinical seizures, withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by the liver and kidneys. Additionally, the patient has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, and there is a concern for further complications related to this condition. The patient also"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He presents with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm and experienced a syncopal episode. The patient underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure, but unable to induce arrhythmia in the cath lab. He required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity (PEA) during the procedure. Troponins are negative, indicating low concern for ischemic etiology.

The patient has been on a balloon pump and was sedated with propofol, which was discontinued since 2 pm on September 22nd. He has been experiencing episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and had one episode of sustained VT, which was shocked back into normal sinus rhythm (NSR) by the ICD.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions:

1. Mental status: The patient is not responsive to verbal stimuli or sternal rub. There is a concern for anoxic brain injury, subclinical seizures, or alcohol withdrawal.

2. Respiratory: The patient is ventilated with pressure CPAP. Mental status is a key point keeping the patient intubated.

3. PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has euvolemic examination without significant pedal edema. Antero-apical ak"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) who presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm. He underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure, but could not be induced to have arrhythmia in the cath lab. However, the patient experienced a slow rhythm that required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity (PEA). He was returned to the ICU on a balloon pump after cardiac arrest in the EP lab. Troponins were negative initially, indicating low concern for ischemic etiology, but later peaked and are now downtrending.

The patient had two more episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) yesterday and was shocked back into sinus tachycardia. No episodes have occurred since starting lidocaine. The patient's current medications include lidocaine, amiodarone, digoxin, metoprolol, and heparin.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Rhythm: The patient had episodes of VT storm, which caused his syncopal episode. He required resuscitation for PEA during the EP procedure. The patient's ICD is pacing at rates >180 and firing at rates >250. He is on a balloon pump and sedated with propofol, but agitation has occurred on the vent, so it has been stopped since 2 pm on [**9-22**].

2. LV Mural Thrombus/Embolism: A thrombus/embolus was seen on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) [**9-21**], and the head CT was negative for embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or other acute processes. The patient will continue with heparin IV gtt for anticoagulation.

3. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFT): There is concern for spurious lab values, medication toxicity (amiodarone? Lidocaine?) versus shock liver. The patient has unremarkable CT results. Rechecking LFT and consulting with a hepatologist would be appropriate.

4. Mental Status: The patient may have anoxic brain injury due to hypoperfusion, subclinical seizures, or excess sedation not being cleared by the liver/kidneys. Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2 pm. Neuro consult and EEG results should be followed up on, and the patient's mental status should be monitored.

5. Respiratory: The patient was overbreathing the vent with pressure support and developed respiratory alkalosis. Switching to controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) was done overnight. Monitoring ABG, mental status, and considering weaning off ventilation if appropriate is recommended.

6. PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient is euvolemic on examination without significant pedal edema. Antero-ap"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure.  Suspect that episodes of VT
   caused his syncopal episode.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab. Troponins x3 negative, therefore low concern for ischemic
   etiology (then post-procedure troponins peaked at 0.75 and now
   downtrending).  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as
   patient became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since
   2pm on [**9-22**]. Had multiple episodes of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him
   back into sinus tachycardia. Decrease VT runs since starting Lidocaine.
   - f/u EP recs
   - Continue lidocaine gtt
   - Discontinue digoxin (d/t renal failure)
   - Discontinue amiodarone
   - Start Dronedarone
   - Continue metoprolol 50mg tid
   - Continue Heparin gtt for afib (and thrombus, as below)
   - Can stop checking cardiac enzymes as peaked yesterday and now
   downtrending
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.
   -Continue heparin IV gtt for anticoagulation
   -Decrease coumadin dose to 2mg daily as INR elevated quickly, and in
   setting of prior amiodarone
   .
   # Elevated LFT
s: Concern for spurious lab value versus medication
   toxicity (amiodarone? Lidocaine?) versus viral etiology versus shock
   liver (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or
   secondary to multiple ICD firings)? Patient had unremarkable abdominal
   CT.
   - Recheck LFT
s this AM
   - RUQ U/S stat
   - [**Hospital1 **] LFT
   - check albumin, INR, to sense liver
s functional capabilities
   - check viral hepatitis serologies
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - consider hepatology consult
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (secondary thoughts: subclinical seizures, or etoh withdrawal, or
   excess sedation not being cleared by liver/kidneys.) Off sedation since
   [**9-22**] at 2pm. Mental status does not appear improved since yesterday
   morning.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG results
   - Monitor clinically
   .
   # Respiratory: Overnight was overbreathing the vent with respiratory
   alkalosis, so adjusted CMV.
   -Monitor ABG
   -Place A-line
   -Monitor mental status
   -Consider wean off ventilation, if appropriate
   -If need more sedation while continuing ventilation, consider
   midazolam/fentanyl as better option than propofol; also consider bolus
   of sedatives rather than gtt
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE yesterday.  IABP removed
   [**9-21**].  ~600mL positive in last 24 hours.
   -Goal negative 500mL today to make up for positives last 2 days
   -40mg IV lasix now
   -f/u I
s & O
   -Anticoagulation with heparin as bridge to coumadin (goal INR [**1-5**]);
   need therapeutic overlap for 2 days, so continue both
   -Continue Metoprolol
   -D/c Lisinopril d/t renal failure
   .
   # Positive sputum & U/A & Tmax 103.6 & rising WBC: Patient started on
   antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Continue to vancomycin/cefepime
   - Vanc trough ~35 and patient received vanco this AM, so d/c order and
   then check trough tomorrow AM and then redose as appropriate,
   especially given supratherapeutic level in combination with rising Cr
   - f/u repeat cultures
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - resend c.diff test (patient with diarrhea)
   - Start flagyl 500mg po tid, for anaerobic gut coverage
   .
   # Cool L Lower Extremity:  L foot slightly cooler than R, but without
   asymmetry, erythema, or swelling of LEs, 2+ DP pulses b/l. Feet without
   hair suggest chronic arterial insufficiency. Could be small cholesterol
   emboli thrown down from when balloon pump pulled, but stable/improved
   clinically.
   - Monitor clinically
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during arrest in the
   setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function had been
   improving, and now acutely worsened again today. Urine output down to
   ~10cc/hour; even after given small fluid boluses, did not see UO
   pick-up.
   -f/u urine lytes (ordered this AM)
   -trend Cr
   -d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   -[**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given propofol sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .  .
   #Abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, acutely elevated LFT
   - Will monitor with serial abdominal exams.
   - Monitor LFT
   .
   #Macrocytic Anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol. Stable/improved today.
   - Monitor daily Hct

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: CCU
","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) who presents with ventricular tachycardia storm. He underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure and was resuscitated for pulseless electrical activity (PEA) during the procedure. The patient is currently on a balloon pump and has been intubated. He has experienced multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and ventricular tachycardia, with some episodes resulting in ICD shocks. He has been receiving lidocaine, metoprolol, and heparin infusions. His vital signs include a temperature of 102.1°F, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His urine output has been low, and he has a positive blood culture for enterococcus. The patient also has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, elevated liver enzymes, mental status changes, acute renal failure, chronic alcoholism, and macrocytic anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient is experiencing recurrent episodes of VT, which can potentially lead to hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrest.
2. Infection: The positive blood culture for enterococcus indicates a potential bloodstream infection. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure.  Suspect that episodes of VT
   caused his syncopal episode.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab. Troponins x3 negative, therefore low concern for ischemic
   etiology (then post-procedure troponins peaked at 0.75 and now
   downtrending).  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as
   patient became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since
   2pm on [**9-22**]. Had multiple episodes of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him
   back into sinus tachycardia. Decrease VT runs since starting Lidocaine.
   - f/u EP recs
   - Continue lidocaine gtt
   - Discontinue digoxin (d/t renal failure)
   - Discontinue amiodarone
   - Start Dronedarone
   - Continue metoprolol 50mg tid
   - Continue Heparin gtt for afib (and thrombus, as below)
   - Can stop checking cardiac enzymes as peaked yesterday and now
   downtrending
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.
   -Continue heparin IV gtt for anticoagulation
   -Decrease coumadin dose to 2mg daily as INR elevated quickly, and in
   setting of prior amiodarone
   .
   # Elevated LFT
s: Concern for spurious lab value versus medication
   toxicity (amiodarone? Lidocaine?) versus viral etiology versus shock
   liver (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or
   secondary to multiple ICD firings)? Patient had unremarkable abdominal
   CT.
   - Recheck LFT
s this AM
   - RUQ U/S stat
   - [**Hospital1 **] LFT
   - check albumin, INR, to sense liver
s functional capabilities
   - check viral hepatitis serologies
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - consider hepatology consult
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (secondary thoughts: subclinical seizures, or etoh withdrawal, or
   excess sedation not being cleared by liver/kidneys.) Off sedation since
   [**9-22**] at 2pm. Mental status does not appear improved since yesterday
   morning.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u EEG results
   - Monitor clinically
   .
   # Respiratory: Overnight was overbreathing the vent with respiratory
   alkalosis, so adjusted CMV.
   -Monitor ABG
   -Place A-line
   -Monitor mental status
   -Consider wean off ventilation, if appropriate
   -If need more sedation while continuing ventilation, consider
   midazolam/fentanyl as better option than propofol; also consider bolus
   of sedatives rather than gtt
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE yesterday.  IABP removed
   [**9-21**].  ~600mL positive in last 24 hours.
   -Goal negative 500mL today to make up for positives last 2 days
   -40mg IV lasix now
   -f/u I
s & O
   -Anticoagulation with heparin as bridge to coumadin (goal INR [**1-5**]);
   need therapeutic overlap for 2 days, so continue both
   -Continue Metoprolol
   -D/c Lisinopril d/t renal failure
   .
   # Positive sputum & U/A & Tmax 103.6 & rising WBC: Patient started on
   antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Continue to vancomycin/cefepime
   - Vanc trough ~35 and patient received vanco this AM, so d/c order and
   then check trough tomorrow AM and then redose as appropriate,
   especially given supratherapeutic level in combination with rising Cr
   - f/u repeat cultures
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - resend c.diff test (patient with diarrhea)
   - Start flagyl 500mg po tid, for anaerobic gut coverage
   .
   # Cool L Lower Extremity:  L foot slightly cooler than R, but without
   asymmetry, erythema, or swelling of LEs, 2+ DP pulses b/l. Feet without
   hair suggest chronic arterial insufficiency. Could be small cholesterol
   emboli thrown down from when balloon pump pulled, but stable/improved
   clinically.
   - Monitor clinically
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during arrest in the
   setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function had been
   improving, and now acutely worsened again today. Urine output down to
   ~10cc/hour; even after given small fluid boluses, did not see UO
   pick-up.
   -f/u urine lytes (ordered this AM)
   -trend Cr
   -d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   -[**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given propofol sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .  .
   #Abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, acutely elevated LFT
   - Will monitor with serial abdominal exams.
   - Monitor LFT
   .
   #Macrocytic Anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol. Stable/improved today.
   - Monitor daily Hct

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: CCU
","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, presenting with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm. The patient underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure, during which he experienced a cardiac arrest and required resuscitation. The patient was placed on a balloon pump and sedated with propofol, but agitation occurred upon discontinuation of propofol. The patient has had multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and was shocked back into sinus tachycardia by the ICD. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and he has positive fluid balance, likely due to chronic heart failure. The patient also has positive sputum, urine, and temperature indicating an infection, for which antibiotics were started. The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury or other causes. He has a history of chronic alcoholism, and his liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated. The patient's coronary arteries are compromised due to a previous large anterior myocardial infarction. He also has acute renal failure, likely secondary to poor perfusion during cardiac arrest. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of VT storm and ICD placement puts him at risk for recurrent ventricular arrhythmias.
2. Cardi"

   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus, still with fevers of 102 with rising
   leukocytosis.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Continue to vancomycin/cefepime/Cipro/Flagyl
   - Dose Vanc by trough; 35 today, hold and re-check trough tomorrow
   - f/u repeat cultures and speciation of sputum
   .
   # Shock: Concern for spurious lab value versus medication toxicity
   (amiodarone? Lidocaine?) versus viral etiology versus shock liver
   (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or secondary to
   multiple ICD firings)? Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT, negative
   RUQ US.  Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion
   during arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal
   function worsening with poor urine output.  BP responds to 250cc
   boluses but UOP not responding to fluids.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD
   today; Renal following.
   - LFT
s daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes given acute renal failure
   - CVVH vs. HD today per Renal recs, as low UOP and volume overloaded.
   2-4U FFP prior to HD line placement, holding anticoagulation for
   procedure.
   - f/u viral hepatitis serologies
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures.
   Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u evoked potential test results
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure.  Suspect that episodes of VT
   caused his syncopal episode.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab. Troponins x3 negative, therefore low concern for ischemic
   etiology (then post-procedure troponins peaked at 0.75 and now
   downtrending).  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as
   patient became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since
   2pm on [**9-22**]. Had multiple episodes of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him
   back into sinus tachycardia. Decrease VT runs since starting Lidocaine.
   - Discontinue lidocaine gtt
   - Discontinue digoxin (d/t renal failure)
   - Discontinue amiodarone
   - Continue Dronedarone
   - Continue metoprolol 50mg tid
   - Hold Heparin gtt for afib (and thrombus, as below), as Renal to place
   line for HD vs. CVVH today
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.
   -Hold heparin IV gtt, as above
   -Hold coumadin dose 2mg daily, as above
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE yesterday.  IABP removed
   [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, anticipate initiation
   of CVVH vs. HD today, [**9-25**].
   -CVVH vs. HD today; f/u Renal recs
   -Anticoagulation with heparin as bridge to coumadin (goal INR [**1-5**]);
   need therapeutic overlap for 2 days, so continue both
   -Continue Metoprolol
   -D/c Lisinopril d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   # Cool L Lower Extremity:  L foot slightly cooler than R, but without
   asymmetry, erythema, or swelling of LEs, 2+ DP pulses b/l. Feet without
   hair suggest chronic arterial insufficiency. Could be small cholesterol
   emboli thrown down from when balloon pump pulled, but stable/improved
   clinically.

   #Abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus, still with fevers of 102 with rising
   leukocytosis.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Continue to vancomycin/cefepime/Cipro/Flagyl
   - Dose Vanc by trough; 35 today, hold and re-check trough tomorrow
   - f/u repeat cultures and speciation of sputum
   .
   # Shock: Concern for spurious lab value versus medication toxicity
   (amiodarone? Lidocaine?) versus viral etiology versus shock liver
   (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or secondary to
   multiple ICD firings)? Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT, negative
   RUQ US.  Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion
   during arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal
   function worsening with poor urine output.  BP responds to 250cc
   boluses but UOP not responding to fluids.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD
   today; Renal following.
   - LFT
s daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes given acute renal failure
   - CVVH vs. HD today per Renal recs, as low UOP and volume overloaded.
   2-4U FFP prior to HD line placement, holding anticoagulation for
   procedure.
   - f/u viral hepatitis serologies
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures.
   Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u evoked potential test results
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure.  Suspect that episodes of VT
   caused his syncopal episode.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab. Troponins x3 negative, therefore low concern for ischemic
   etiology (then post-procedure troponins peaked at 0.75 and now
   downtrending).  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as
   patient became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since
   2pm on [**9-22**]. Had multiple episodes of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him
   back into sinus tachycardia. Decrease VT runs since starting Lidocaine.
   - Discontinue lidocaine gtt
   - Discontinue digoxin (d/t renal failure)
   - Discontinue amiodarone
   - Continue Dronedarone
   - Continue metoprolol 50mg tid
   - Hold Heparin gtt for afib (and thrombus, as below), as Renal to place
   line for HD vs. CVVH today
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.
   -Hold heparin IV gtt, as above
   -Hold coumadin dose 2mg daily, as above
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE yesterday.  IABP removed
   [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, anticipate initiation
   of CVVH vs. HD today, [**9-25**].
   -CVVH vs. HD today; f/u Renal recs
   -Anticoagulation with heparin as bridge to coumadin (goal INR [**1-5**]);
   need therapeutic overlap for 2 days, so continue both
   -Continue Metoprolol
   -D/c Lisinopril d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   # Cool L Lower Extremity:  L foot slightly cooler than R, but without
   asymmetry, erythema, or swelling of LEs, 2+ DP pulses b/l. Feet without
   hair suggest chronic arterial insufficiency. Could be small cholesterol
   emboli thrown down from when balloon pump pulled, but stable/improved
   clinically.
   .
   #Abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.
   .
   #Macrocytic Anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol. Stable/improved today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20%) who presented with ventricular tachycardia storm. The patient has multiple comorbidities including chronic systolic heart failure, chronic alcoholism, and a history of large anterior myocardial infarction.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has positive sputum culture growing Enterococcus, fevers of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, and rising leukocyte count. He is already on antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole), and his antibiotic regimen will be continued. The dose of vancomycin will be adjusted based on the trough levels.
2. Shock: There is concern for spurious lab values, medication toxicity, viral etiology, or hypoperfusion during the code or multiple ICD firings. The patient is in acute renal failure, likely due to poor perfusion during arrest in the setting of poor forward flow. Renal function is worsening with poor urine output. The patient may require continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) or intermittent hemodialysis (HD) due to acute renal failure.
3. Mental status: There is concern for anoxic brain injury, ethanol withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by the liver or kidneys"

   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - Continue Dronedarone
   - Continue metoprolol 50mg tid for rate control
   - Hold Heparin gtt for afib and mural thrombus

   worsening with poor urine output.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD; Renal
   following.   Waiting for neuro results and family meeting prior to
   starting dialysis.  No urgent need for dialysis but hemodialysis line
   in place for dialysis if indicate.  Appreciate renal recs.
   - follow daily lytes, creatinine, fluid balance, UOP.
   - consider CVVHD vs. HD on Monday per Renal recs, given low UOP and
   volume overloaded.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

- The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm, which required resuscitation and placement on a balloon pump. The patient also experienced episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and was treated with lidocaine and amiodarone. He is currently on dronedarone for rhythm control and metoprolol for rate control. Heparin was held due to atrial fibrillation and concern for mural thrombus.

- The patient has an altered mental status, possibly due to anoxic brain injury from hypoperfusion, ethanol withdrawal, or excess sedation. Neurological assessment does not suggest sub-clinical seizures based on EEG. Sedation was reduced on September 22nd.

- The patient has fever and leukocytosis, with positive sputum culture for Neisseria meningitides. He was started on antibiotics on September 22nd and is now being treated with ampicillin for vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus in the urine. Cefepime is being continued for gram-negative bacteria in the sputum. Foley catheter change is planned, along with re-culture of urine.

- The patient has transaminit"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - Continue Dronedarone
   - Continue metoprolol 50mg tid for rate control
   - Hold Heparin gtt for afib and mural thrombus
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u evoked potential test results, will need to re-address recovery
   potential with family once these results have been obtained.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus, still with fevers of 102 with rising
   leukocytosis.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days), will dc vanco
   - continue cefepime for gram negatives in sputum
   - foley change (last change [**9-19**]) and re-culture urine
   .
   # Transaminitis: Elevated transaminases, LDH concerning for medication
   toxicity (amiodarone) versus viral etiology versus shock liver
   (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or secondary to
   multiple ICD firings)  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]),
   negative RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - f/u viral hepatitis serologies
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #ARF: Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during
   arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function
   worsening with poor urine output.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD; Renal
   following.   Waiting for neuro results and family meeting prior to
   starting dialysis.  No urgent need for dialysis but hemodialysis line
   in place for dialysis if indicate.  Appreciate renal recs.
   - follow daily lytes, creatinine, fluid balance, UOP.
   - consider CVVHD vs. HD on Monday per Renal recs, given low UOP and
   volume overloaded.
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  INR
   supertherapeutic now.
   -Continue heparin for now
   -Hold warfarin for now, will restart when INR therapeutic
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20%) who presented with ventricular tachycardia storm. He underwent an electrophysiology procedure for VT and experienced a syncopal episode. The patient has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in place with atrial pacing at rates >180 bpm and firing at rates >250 bpm. He was returned to the ICU on a balloon pump after experiencing cardiac arrest during the EP procedure. The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury, and he has been off sedation since September 22nd. His rhythm control medications include Dronedarone and Metoprolol, and he has been transitioned off amiodarone due to toxicity concerns. The patient has elevated liver enzymes and is at risk for medication toxicity or viral etiology. He is also experiencing acute renal failure, likely secondary to poor perfusion during cardiac arrest. The patient's urine output has been low, and he requires close monitoring of his electrolytes, creatinine, and fluid balance. CVVH or HD may be necessary in the future. The patient has evidence of a left ventricular mural thrombus, and heparin has been continued. He has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with antero-apical akinesis on TTE and has been off coumadin at home. The patient's coronary arteries are compromised"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - Continue Dronedarone
   - Continue metoprolol 5mg IV Q4H for rate control
   - On Heparin gtt for afib and mural thrombus
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u evoked potential test results, will need to re-address recovery
   potential with family once these results have been obtained.
   .
   # Respiratory status: currently on PSV with peep of 5, he is initiating
   spontanous breathing.  Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off
   the vent and may likely will aspirate.
   - trial wean off status
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus, still with fevers of 102 with rising
   leukocytosis.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days), off  vanco
   - continue cefepime for gram negatives in sputum
   - foley change (last change [**9-26**])
   .
   # Transaminitis: Elevated transaminases, LDH concerning for medication
   toxicity (amiodarone) versus viral etiology versus shock liver
   (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or secondary to
   multiple ICD firings)  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]),
   negative RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - f/u viral hepatitis serologies
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #ARF: Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during
   arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function
   worsening with poor urine output.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD; Renal
   following.   Waiting for neuro results and family meeting prior to
   starting dialysis.  No urgent need for dialysis but hemodialysis line
   in place for dialysis if indicate.  Appreciate renal recs.  UOP and
   volume status improving.
   - follow daily lytes, creatinine, fluid balance, UOP.
   - f/u Renal recs
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  INR
   supertherapeutic now.
   -Continue heparin for now
   -Hold warfarin for now, will restart when INR therapeutic
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, anticipate
   initiation of CVVH vs. HD today, [**9-25**].
   -Continue Metoprolol
   -Lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   #Cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.
   .
   #Abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.
   .
   #Macrocytic Anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol. Stable/improved today.

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - Continue Dronedarone
   - Continue metoprolol 5mg IV Q4H for rate control
   - On Heparin gtt for afib and mural thrombus
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u evoked potential test results, will need to re-address recovery
   potential with family once these results have been obtained.
   .
   # Respiratory status: currently on PSV with peep of 5, he is initiating
   spontanous breathing.  Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off
   the vent and may likely will aspirate.
   - trial wean off status
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus, still with fevers of 102 with rising
   leukocytosis.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days), off  vanco
   - continue cefepime for gram negatives in sputum
   - foley change (last change [**9-26**])
   .
   # Transaminitis: Elevated transaminases, LDH concerning for medication
   toxicity (amiodarone) versus viral etiology versus shock liver
   (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or secondary to
   multiple ICD firings)  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]),
   negative RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - f/u viral hepatitis serologies
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #ARF: Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during
   arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function
   worsening with poor urine output.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD; Renal
   following.   Waiting for neuro results and family meeting prior to
   starting dialysis.  No urgent need for dialysis but hemodialysis line
   in place for dialysis if indicate.  Appreciate renal recs.  UOP and
   volume status improving, creatinine stable around 5.
   - follow daily lytes, creatinine, fluid balance, UOP.
   - d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   - f/u Renal recs
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  INR
   supertherapeutic now.
   -Continue heparin for now
   -Hold warfarin for now, will restart when INR therapeutic
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, anticipate
   initiation of CVVH vs. HD today, [**9-25**].
   -Continue Metoprolol
   -Lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   #Cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.
   .
   #Abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.
   .
   #Macrocytic Anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol. Stable/improved today.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20%) who presents with ventricular tachycardia storm. The patient underwent an electrophysiology procedure for VT, which was likely the cause of his syncopal episode. The patient's rhythm control medication has been changed from amiodarone to dronedarone due to concern for toxicity. The patient also has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, acute renal failure, and a left ventricular mural thrombus.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventricular arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of VT storm, there is a risk of recurrent arrhythmias.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest during the electrophysiology procedure, which highlights the potential for future cardiac arrests.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient is at risk of aspiration due to his sedation and inability to protect his airway.
4. Enterococcus urinary tract infection: The patient has a positive urine culture for enterococcus, indicating a urinary tract infection.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and he may require dialysis.
6. Liver dysfunction: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to medication toxicity or hypoperfusion during the cardiac arrest.
7. Deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism: The patient has been immobil"

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) who presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm. He underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure, but experienced a cardiac arrest during the procedure and required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity (PEA). The patient has been in the ICU since then, requiring multiple interventions for rhythm control, including lidocaine, amiodarone, and dronedarone. He also has acute renal failure, positive urine culture for enterococcus, transaminitis, and a history of alcohol abuse. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, with plans for weaning off soon. His mental status is fluctuating, and there is a concern for anoxic brain injury or seizures. The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he remains at risk for aspiration. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of VT storm and ICD firing indicate a high risk for recurrent ventricular arrhythmias.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, which may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Infection: The positive urine culture for enterococcus indicates a urinary tract infection. The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest a systemic"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - Continue Dronedarone
   - Continue metoprolol 5mg IV Q4H for rate control
   - On Heparin gtt for afib and mural thrombus
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u evoked potential test results, will need to re-address recovery
   potential with family once these results have been obtained.
   .
   # Respiratory status: currently on PSV with peep of 5, he is initiating
   spontanous breathing.  Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off
   the vent and may likely will aspirate.
   - trial wean off status
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus, still with fevers of 102 with rising
   leukocytosis.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days), off  vanco
   - continue cefepime for gram negatives in sputum
   - foley change (last change [**9-26**])
   .
   # Transaminitis: Elevated transaminases, LDH concerning for medication
   toxicity (amiodarone) versus viral etiology versus shock liver
   (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or secondary to
   multiple ICD firings)  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]),
   negative RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - f/u viral hepatitis serologies
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #ARF: Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during
   arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function
   worsening with poor urine output.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD; Renal
   following.   Waiting for neuro results and family meeting prior to
   starting dialysis.  No urgent need for dialysis but hemodialysis line
   in place for dialysis if indicate.  Appreciate renal recs.  UOP and
   volume status improving, creatinine stable around 5.
   - follow daily lytes, creatinine, fluid balance, UOP.
   - d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   - f/u Renal recs
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  INR
   supertherapeutic now.
   -Continue heparin for now
   -Hold warfarin for now, will restart when INR therapeutic
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, anticipate
   initiation of CVVH vs. HD today, [**9-25**].
   -Continue Metoprolol
   -Lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   #Cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.
   .
   #Abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.
   .
   #Macrocytic Anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol. Stable/improved today.

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - Continue Dronedarone
   - Continue metoprolol 5mg IV Q4H for rate control
   - On Heparin gtt for afib and mural thrombus
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u evoked potential test results, will need to re-address recovery
   potential with family once these results have been obtained.
   .
   # Respiratory status: currently on PSV with peep of 5, he is initiating
   spontanous breathing.  Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off
   the vent and may likely will aspirate.
   - trial wean off status
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus, still with fevers of 102 with rising
   leukocytosis.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days), off  vanco
   - continue cefepime for gram negatives in sputum
   - foley change (last change [**9-26**])
   .
   # Transaminitis: Elevated transaminases, LDH concerning for medication
   toxicity (amiodarone) versus viral etiology versus shock liver
   (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or secondary to
   multiple ICD firings)  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]),
   negative RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - f/u viral hepatitis serologies
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #ARF: Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during
   arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function
   worsening with poor urine output.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD; Renal
   following.   Waiting for neuro results and family meeting prior to
   starting dialysis.  No urgent need for dialysis but hemodialysis line
   in place for dialysis if indicate.  Appreciate renal recs.  UOP and
   volume status improving.
   - follow daily lytes, creatinine, fluid balance, UOP.
   - f/u Renal recs
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  INR
   supertherapeutic now.
   -Continue heparin for now
   -Hold warfarin for now, will restart when INR therapeutic
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, anticipate
   initiation of CVVH vs. HD today, [**9-25**].
   -Continue Metoprolol
   -Lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   #Cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.
   .
   #Abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.
   .
   #Macrocytic Anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol. Stable/improved today.

","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20%) who presented with ventricular tachycardia storm. He underwent an electrophysiology procedure for the VT, which was likely the cause of his syncopal episode. The patient has an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in place and has experienced multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), for which he required resuscitation due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA). The patient was on balloon pump support after experiencing cardiac arrest during the EP procedure.

The patient's current medications include Dronedarone for rhythm control, metoprolol for rate control, and heparin for atrial fibrillation and mural thrombus. His mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury, but neurologic examination does not believe it to be subclinical seizures based on EEG. The patient was sedated but is now off sedation since September 22nd at 2pm.

The patient's respiratory status is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5, and he is initiating spontaneous breathing. There are concerns about his ability to tolerate being off the ventilator and the risk of aspiration.

The patient underwent an EP procedure for VT, but unfortunately experienced a cardiac arrest during the procedure and required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity (PEA). He was placed on a balloon pump and returned to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and has been treated with lidocaine and amiodarone. He is now being transitioned to dronedarone for rhythm control due to concerns about toxicity with amiodarone. Digoxin has also been discontinued due to renal failure.

The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury, but it is unclear whether this is due to hypoperfusion, etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation. The patient has been off sedation since September 22nd, but still exhibits agitation. An EEG has been performed, and neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures. Follow-up neuro recommendations are pending, along with evoked potential test results. The patient's fever and leukocytosis have improved, but a positive urine culture for enterococcus remains. Antibiotics were started on September 22nd, and the Foley catheter needs to be changed along with re"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - Continue Dronedarone
   - Continue metoprolol 50mg tid for rate control
   - Hold Heparin gtt for afib and mural thrombus
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u evoked potential test results, will need to re-address recovery
   potential with family once these results have been obtained.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus, still with fevers of 102 with rising
   leukocytosis.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days), will dc vanco
   - continue cefepime for gram negatives in sputum
   - foley change (last change [**9-19**]) and re-culture urine
   .
   # Transaminitis: Elevated transaminases, LDH concerning for medication
   toxicity (amiodarone) versus viral etiology versus shock liver
   (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or secondary to
   multiple ICD firings)  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]),
   negative RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - f/u viral hepatitis serologies
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #ARF: Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during
   arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function
   worsening with poor urine output.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD; Renal
   following.   Waiting for neuro results and family meeting prior to
   starting dialysis.  No urgent need for dialysis but hemodialysis line
   in place for dialysis if indicate.  Appreciate renal recs.
   - follow daily lytes, creatinine, fluid balance, UOP.
   - consider CVVHD vs. HD on Monday per Renal recs, given low UOP and
   volume overloaded.
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  INR
   supertherapeutic now.
   -Continue heparin for now
   -Hold warfarin for now, will restart when INR therapeutic
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, anticipate
   initiation of CVVH vs. HD today, [**9-25**].
   -Continue Metoprolol
   -Lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   # Cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.
   .
   #Abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.
   .
   #Macrocytic Anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol. Stable/improved today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and previous ICD placement. He presented with a ventricular tachycardia storm and underwent an electrophysiology procedure. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest during the procedure and required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity. He was returned to the ICU on a balloon pump and was sedated with propofol due to agitation on the ventilator. Sedation was discontinued since September 22nd.

The patient had multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia yesterday, which improved with lidocaine and amiodarone. He is now being transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and off amiodarone due to concerns about toxicity. Digoxin has also been discontinued due to renal failure.

The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury post-hypoperfusion, possibly exacerbated by alcohol withdrawal or excess sedation. Neurological evaluation does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures based on EEG. Follow-up neuro recommendations and evoked potential test results are pending.

The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, with positive urine cultures growing enterococcus. He started on antibiotics on September 22nd and will continue ampicillin for vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus in the urine. Cefepime will continue for gram-negative organisms in the sputum. Foley catheter"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - Continue Dronedarone
   - Continue metoprolol 5mg IV Q4H for rate control
   - On Heparin gtt for afib and mural thrombus
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u evoked potential test results, will need to re-address recovery
   potential with family once these results have been obtained.
   .
   # Respiratory status: currently on PSV with peep of 5, he is initiating
   spontanous breathing.  Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off
   the vent and may likely will aspirate.
   - trial wean off status
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus, still with fevers of 102 with rising
   leukocytosis.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days), off  vanco
   - continue cefepime for gram negatives in sputum
   - foley change (last change [**9-26**])
   .
   # Transaminitis: Elevated transaminases, LDH concerning for medication
   toxicity (amiodarone) versus viral etiology versus shock liver
   (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or secondary to
   multiple ICD firings)  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]),
   negative RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - f/u viral hepatitis serologies
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #ARF: Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during
   arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function
   worsening with poor urine output.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD; Renal
   following.   Waiting for neuro results and family meeting prior to
   starting dialysis.  No urgent need for dialysis but hemodialysis line
   in place for dialysis if indicate.  Appreciate renal recs.  UOP and
   volume status improving, creatinine stable around 5.
   - follow daily lytes, creatinine, fluid balance, UOP.
   - d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   - f/u Renal recs
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  INR
   supertherapeutic now.
   -Continue heparin for now
   -Hold warfarin for now, will restart when INR therapeutic
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, anticipate
   initiation of CVVH vs. HD today, [**9-25**].
   -Continue Metoprolol
   -Lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   #Cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.
   .
   #Abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.
   .
   #Macrocytic Anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol. Stable/improved today.

The patient underwent an evoked potential study and is scheduled for a family meeting with the cardiologist tomorrow.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate between 62-81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/68 to 141/82 mmHg, respiratory rate between 13-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, using an endotracheal tube, and receiving supplemental oxygen.

The patient has several medical conditions, including acute renal failure likely due to poor perfusion during cardiac arrest, fever with leukocytosis, transaminitis, and a possible LV mural thrombus. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and he is being treated with antibiotics for a urinary tract infection caused by enterococcus. He also has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, coronary artery disease, and chronic alcoholism.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, liver enzymes, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits. The patient's"

   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - Continue Dronedarone
   - Continue metoprolol 5mg IV Q4H for rate control
   - On Heparin gtt for afib and mural thrombus
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u evoked potential test results, will need to re-address recovery
   potential with family once these results have been obtained.
   .
   # Respiratory status: currently on PSV with peep of 5, he is initiating
   spontanous breathing.  Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off
   the vent and may likely will aspirate.
   - trial wean off status
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus, still with fevers of 102 with rising
   leukocytosis.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days), off  vanco
   - continue cefepime for gram negatives in sputum
   - foley change (last change [**9-26**])
   .
   # Transaminitis: Elevated transaminases, LDH concerning for medication
   toxicity (amiodarone) versus viral etiology versus shock liver
   (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or secondary to
   multiple ICD firings)  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]),
   negative RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - f/u viral hepatitis serologies
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #ARF: Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during
   arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function
   worsening with poor urine output.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD; Renal
   following.   Waiting for neuro results and family meeting prior to
   starting dialysis.  No urgent need for dialysis but hemodialysis line
   in place for dialysis if indicate.  Appreciate renal recs.  UOP and
   volume status improving, creatinine stable around 5.
   - follow daily lytes, creatinine, fluid balance, UOP.
   - d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   - f/u Renal recs
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  INR
   supertherapeutic now.
   -Continue heparin for now
   -Hold warfarin for now, will restart when INR therapeutic
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, anticipate
   initiation of CVVH vs. HD today, [**9-25**].
   -Continue Metoprolol
   -Lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   #Cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm, which was likely the cause of his syncopal episode. The patient underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure for VT but experienced a cardiac arrest during the procedure and required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity (PEA). He was placed on a balloon pump and returned to the ICU. The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury due to hypoperfusion, but an EEG ruled out subclinical seizures. He has been off sedation since September 22nd.

The patient's respiratory status is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5. He is initiating spontaneous breathing but there are concerns about his ability to tolerate weaning off the ventilator and the risk of aspiration. His fever improved, but his white blood cell count (WBC) remains elevated. He has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus, and sputum culture is pending. Antibiotics were started on September 22nd.

The patient has elevated transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and concerns for medication toxicity (amiodarone) versus viral etiology or shock"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20%) who presented with ventricular tachycardia storm. The patient underwent an evoked potential study but the results are pending. There is a planned family meeting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4284**] tomorrow at 5 pm.

The patient's medical history includes ICD placement, ventricular tachycardia, syncopal episode, and balloon pump usage. The patient experienced multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) yesterday and was shocked back into sinus tachycardia by the ICD. The patient is currently on dronedarone for rhythm control and metoprolol for rate control.

The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury, possibly due to hypoperfusion or excess sedation. The neurologist does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures based on the EEG, and the patient has been off sedation since September 22nd at 2 pm.

Respiratory status shows the patient on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5. The patient is initiating spontaneous breathing but may have a risk of aspiration and pneumonia. A trial weaning off the ventilator may be considered.

The patient has fever and leukocytosis"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - Continue Dronedarone
   - Continue metoprolol 5mg IV Q4H for rate control
   - On Heparin gtt for afib and mural thrombus
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u evoked potential test results, will need to re-address recovery
   potential with family once these results have been obtained.
   - family meeting is scheduled today at 5pm (contact Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and
   [**Doctor Last Name 4284**])
   .
   # Respiratory status: currently on PSV with peep of 5, he is initiating
   spontanous breathing.  Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off
   the vent and may likely will aspirate.
   - trial wean off status
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus, still with fevers of 102 with rising
   leukocytosis.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days), off  vanco
   - continue cefepime for gram negatives in sputum
   - foley change (last change [**9-26**])
   .
   # Transaminitis: Elevated transaminases, LDH concerning for medication
   toxicity (amiodarone) versus viral etiology versus shock liver
   (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or secondary to
   multiple ICD firings)  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]),
   negative RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - f/u viral hepatitis serologies
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #ARF: Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during
   arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function
   worsening with poor urine output.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD; Renal
   following.   Waiting for neuro results and family meeting prior to
   starting dialysis.  No urgent need for dialysis but hemodialysis line
   in place for dialysis if indicate.  Appreciate renal recs.  UOP and
   volume status improving, creatinine stable around 5.
   - follow daily lytes, creatinine, fluid balance, UOP.
   - d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   - f/u Renal recs
 D/C HD line
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  INR
   supertherapeutic now.
   -Continue heparin for now
   -Hold warfarin for now, will restart when INR therapeutic
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, anticipate
   initiation of CVVH vs. HD today, [**9-25**].
   -Continue Metoprolol
   -Lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   #Cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.
   .
   #Abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.
   .
   #Macrocytic Anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol. Stable/improved today.

","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Rhythm control: The patient has a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and has experienced multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT), which required resuscitation. He is currently on dronedarone and metoprolol for rhythm control. The patient's ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) is firing at rates > 250, indicating potential ongoing arrhythmia issues.

2. Mental status: The patient's mental status is a concern, with possible anoxic brain injury due to hypoperfusion during a cardiac arrest. There is also a concern for excess sedation or etoh withdrawal. The patient's EEG does not support the presence of subclinical seizures.

3. Respiratory status: The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a PEEP of 5, and he is initiating spontaneous breathing. There is a risk of aspiration if the patient is extubated.

4. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has persistent fever and leukocytosis, which suggests an ongoing infection. Enterococcus is growing in the urine and sputum culture, and the patient is already on antibiotics.

5. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated transaminases, which could be due to medication toxicity (amiodarone), viral etiology"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - Continue Dronedarone
   - Continue metoprolol 5mg IV Q4H for rate control
   - On Heparin gtt for afib and mural thrombus
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u evoked potential test results, will need to re-address recovery
   potential with family once these results have been obtained.
   - family meeting is scheduled today at 5pm (contact Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and
   [**Doctor Last Name 4284**])
   .
   # Respiratory status: currently on PSV with peep of 5, he is initiating
   spontanous breathing.  Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off
   the vent and may likely will aspirate.
   - trial wean off status
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus, still with fevers of 102 with rising
   leukocytosis.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days), off  vanco
   - continue cefepime for gram negatives in sputum
   - foley change (last change [**9-26**])
   .
   # Transaminitis: Elevated transaminases, LDH concerning for medication
   toxicity (amiodarone) versus viral etiology versus shock liver
   (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or secondary to
   multiple ICD firings).  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]),
   negative RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  Neg Hep serologies.  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # ARF: Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during
   arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function
   worsening with poor urine output.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD; Renal
   following.   Waiting for neuro results and family meeting prior to
   starting dialysis.  No urgent need for dialysis but hemodialysis line
   in place for dialysis if indicate.  Appreciate renal recs.  UOP and
   volume status improving, creatinine stable around 5.
   - follow daily lytes, creatinine, fluid balance, UOP.
   - d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   - f/u Renal recs
 they feel that HD is unlikely to be needed at this
   time; d/c HD line
   - fluid repletion @ 65 cc/hr to replace insensible losses
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  INR
   supertherapeutic now.
   - Continue heparin for now
   - Hold warfarin for now
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, anticipate
   initiation of CVVH vs. HD today, [**9-25**].
   -Continue Metoprolol
   -Lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   #Cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) who presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm. He underwent an evoked potential study, which is still pending review. The patient also had an ICD placement, but his ICD was pacing at rates > 180 and firing at rates > 250, so he was placed on a balloon pump. The balloon pump was removed on [9-20], and the patient continued to be sedated due to agitation on the ventilator with propofol. Propofol was discontinued since 2 pm on [9-22], and the patient showed little improvement in mental status.

The patient experienced multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) yesterday, and the ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. He was given lidocaine and amiodarone, which improved his condition. Now, he has been transitioned to dronedarone for rhythm control due to concern for amiodarone toxicity. Metoprolol has been continued for rate control, and heparin has been started for atrial fibrillation and mural thrombus.

The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury due to hypoperfusion during the cardiac arrest and VT runs. Neuro"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20%) who presented with ventricular tachycardia storm. The patient underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure for VT, which was likely the cause of his syncopal episode post-implantation. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a cardiac arrest during the EP procedure and required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity (PEA). 

The patient has been placed on a balloon pump and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Rhythm Control: The patient has had multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and ventricular tachycardia (VT). He is currently on Dronedarone for rhythm control and Metoprolol for rate control. There is a concern for ongoing arrhythmias, and the patient may require further antiarrhythmic medications or interventions.

2. Mental Status: The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury due to hypoperfusion, alcohol withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by the liver and kidneys. The EEG did not indicate subclinical seizures, and the patient has been off sedation since September 22nd. Further neurologic evaluations and tests, such as evoked potential studies, are planned to assess the"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - Continue Dronedarone, f/u with EP regarding D/C dosing.
   - Continue metoprolol 5mg IV Q4H for rate control
   - On Heparin gtt for afib and mural thrombus
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.  Evoked potential noted
   to be intact, neuro status may recover (1-10%) chance.
   - f/u neuro recs.
   - consider DC to rehab
   .
   # Respiratory status: currently on PSV with peep of 5, he is initiating
   spontanous breathing.  Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off
   the vent and may likely will aspirate.
   - trial wean off status
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   - need to get trach and PEG prior to rehab
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus, still with fevers of 102 with rising
   leukocytosis.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days), off  vanco
   - continue cefepime for gram negatives in sputum
   - foley change (last change [**9-26**])
   - f/u Bcx, urine cx, line cx.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Elevated transaminases, LDH concerning for medication
   toxicity (amiodarone) versus viral etiology versus shock liver
   (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or secondary to
   multiple ICD firings).  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]),
   negative RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  Neg Hep serologies.  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # ARF: Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during
   arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function
   worsening with poor urine output.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD; Renal
   following.   Waiting for neuro results and family meeting prior to
   starting dialysis.  No urgent need for dialysis but hemodialysis line
   in place for dialysis if indicate.  Appreciate renal recs.  UOP and
   volume status improving, creatinine trending down to 3
s.  anticipating
   post-ATN diuresis.
   - follow daily lytes, creatinine, fluid balance, UOP.
   - d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   - f/u Renal recs
 they feel that HD is unlikely to be needed at this
   time
   - d/c HD line after getting access (PICC line), need to culture HD line
   tip.
   - fluid repletion @ 65 cc/hr to replace insensible losses
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  INR
   supertherapeutic now.
   - Continue heparin for now
   - Hold warfarin for now
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, but now has
   been having increased urine output.
   -Continue Metoprolol
   -Lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   #Cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.
   .
   #Abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.
   .
   #Macrocytic Anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol. Stable/improved today.

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - Continue Dronedarone
   - Continue metoprolol 5mg IV Q4H for rate control
   - On Heparin gtt for afib and mural thrombus
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.
   - f/u neuro recs
   - f/u evoked potential test results, will need to re-address recovery
   potential with family once these results have been obtained.
   - family meeting is scheduled today at 5pm (contact Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and
   [**Doctor Last Name 4284**])
   .
   # Respiratory status: currently on PSV with peep of 5, he is initiating
   spontanous breathing.  Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off
   the vent and may likely will aspirate.
   - trial wean off status
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus, still with fevers of 102 with rising
   leukocytosis.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days), off  vanco
   - continue cefepime for gram negatives in sputum
   - foley change (last change [**9-26**])
   .
   # Transaminitis: Elevated transaminases, LDH concerning for medication
   toxicity (amiodarone) versus viral etiology versus shock liver
   (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or secondary to
   multiple ICD firings).  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]),
   negative RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  Neg Hep serologies.  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # ARF: Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during
   arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function
   worsening with poor urine output.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD; Renal
   following.   Waiting for neuro results and family meeting prior to
   starting dialysis.  No urgent need for dialysis but hemodialysis line
   in place for dialysis if indicate.  Appreciate renal recs.  UOP and
   volume status improving, creatinine stable around 5.
   - follow daily lytes, creatinine, fluid balance, UOP.
   - d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   - f/u Renal recs
 they feel that HD is unlikely to be needed at this
   time; d/c HD line
   - fluid repletion @ 65 cc/hr to replace insensible losses
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  INR
   supertherapeutic now.
   - Continue heparin for now
   - Hold warfarin for now
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, anticipate
   initiation of CVVH vs. HD today, [**9-25**].
   -Continue Metoprolol
   -Lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   #Cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.
   .
   #Abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.
   .
   #Macrocytic Anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol. Stable/improved today.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He presented with ventricular tachycardia storm and required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity (PEA). The patient has had multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and is currently on Dronedarone for rhythm control. He also has a history of chronic alcohol abuse and may be at risk for alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury due to hypoperfusion, but this has not been definitively diagnosed. He has been off sedation since September 22nd, and neurological recovery is expected to be poor, with a prognosis of only a 1-10% chance of neurologic recovery.

The patient's respiratory status is currently stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5, and he is initiating spontaneous breathing. However, there is a concern about his ability to tolerate extubation and the risk of aspiration.

The patient has fever and leukocytosis with a positive urine culture for enterococcus. He has been started on antibiotics, and his urine output has improved. His liver function tests (LFTs) were elevated but are now downtrending, and he is being closely monitored for medication"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). He presents with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm, which is a life-threatening arrhythmia. The patient underwent an electrophysiology (EP) study and was found to have inducible VT. However, attempts to resuscitate him failed, leading to a cardiac arrest. The patient was placed on a balloon pump and eventually returned to the ICU.

The patient has been experiencing multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), for which he received lidocaine and amiodarone infusions. Amiodarone was chosen due to its efficacy in treating VT and preventing arrhythmic death. However, due to concerns about amiodarone toxicity, especially in the setting of renal failure, the patient has been transitioned to dronedarone for rhythm control.

The patient also has mental status changes, likely secondary to anoxic brain injury from hypoperfusion during the cardiac arrest. His neuro status may recover, although the chances are low. There is ongoing discussion with the family regarding goals of care and prognosis.

In terms of respiratory status, the patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5. He is initiating spontaneous breathing and may be weaned off the ventilator soon."

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - Continue Dronedarone, f/u with EP regarding D/C dosing.
   - Continue metoprolol 5mg IV Q4H for rate control
   - On Heparin gtt for afib and mural thrombus
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.  Evoked potential noted
   to be intact, neuro status may recover (1-10%) chance.
   - f/u neuro recs.
   - consider DC to rehab
   .
   # Respiratory status: currently on PSV with peep of 5, he is initiating
   spontanous breathing.  Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off
   the vent and may likely will aspirate.
   - trial wean off status
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   - need to get trach and PEG prior to rehab
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus, still with fevers of 102 with rising
   leukocytosis.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days), off  vanco
   - continue cefepime for gram negatives in sputum
   - foley change (last change [**9-26**])
   - f/u Bcx, urine cx, line cx.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Elevated transaminases, LDH concerning for medication
   toxicity (amiodarone) versus viral etiology versus shock liver
   (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or secondary to
   multiple ICD firings).  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]),
   negative RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  Neg Hep serologies.  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # ARF: Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during
   arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function
   worsening with poor urine output.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD; Renal
   following.   Waiting for neuro results and family meeting prior to
   starting dialysis.  No urgent need for dialysis but hemodialysis line
   in place for dialysis if indicate.  Appreciate renal recs.  UOP and
   volume status improving, creatinine trending down to 3
s.  anticipating
   post-ATN diuresis.
   - follow daily lytes, creatinine, fluid balance, UOP.
   - d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose Vancomycin)
   - f/u Renal recs
 they feel that HD is unlikely to be needed at this
   time
   - d/c HD line after getting access (PICC line), need to culture HD line
   tip.
   - fluid repletion @ 65 cc/hr to replace insensible losses
   .
   # LV mural thrombus/ ? embolism:  Thrombus/embolus seen on TTE [**9-21**],
   head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  INR
   supertherapeutic now.
   - Continue heparin for now
   - Hold warfarin for now
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, but now has
   been having increased urine output.
   -Continue Metoprolol
   -Lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   #Cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.
   .
   #Abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.
   .
   #Macrocytic Anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol. Stable/improved today.

   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - continue dronedarone per EP recs
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV Q4H for rate control
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.  Evoked potential noted
   to be intact, neuro status may recover (1-10%) chance.  Ongoing
   discussion with family re: goals of care, prognosis.
   - f/u neuro recs.
   - consider DC to rehab
   .
   # Respiratory status: currently on PSV with peep of 5, he is initiating
   spontanous breathing.  Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off
   the vent and may likely will aspirate.
   - trial wean off status
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   - need to get trach and PEG prior to rehab.  This cannot be done by IP
   this week; will consider Gsurg/IR consults for placement.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus, still with fevers of 102 with rising
   leukocytosis.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days), off  vanco
   - continue cefepime for gram negatives in sputum
   - foley change (last change [**9-26**])

   # Transaminitis: Elevated transaminases, LDH concerning for medication
   toxicity (amiodarone) versus viral etiology versus shock liver
   (hypoperfusion during code or during multiple VT runs, or secondary to
   multiple ICD firings).  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]),
   negative RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  Neg Hep serologies.  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # ARF: Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor perfusion during
   arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF 20%.  Renal function
   worsening with poor urine output.  Will likely need CVVH vs. HD; Renal
   following.   Waiting for neuro results and family meeting prior to
   starting dialysis.  No urgent need for dialysis but hemodialysis line
   in place for dialysis if indicate.  Appreciate renal recs.  UOP and
   volume status improving, creatinine trending down to 3
s.  anticipating
   post-ATN diuresis.
   - follow daily lytes, creatinine, fluid balance, UOP.
   - d/c nephrotoxic meds (Lisinopril, digoxin; re-dose vancomycin)
   - f/u Renal recs
 they feel that HD is unlikely to be needed at this
   time
   - d/c HD line (PICC placed), need to culture HD line tip.
   - fluid repletion @ 65 cc/hr to replace insensible losses
   .
   # hypernatremia
 Na 150 this AM.
   - Free water deficit approx 2.6 L.  Will give free water flushes with
   tube feeds if tolerated without significant gastric residuals.  If not,
   will give D5W MIVF instead of
 NS.

   # ?LV mural thrombus
 Initially felt that thrombus/embolus seen on TTE
   [**9-21**], head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  After
   discussion with EP, it was felt that this was likely just fibrin and no
   clear thrombus was present.
   - heparin gtt was d/ced per EP recs as it was felt that there probably
   was no LV thrombus, just fibrin, on TTE.
   - SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, but now has
   been having increased urine output.
   - continue Metoprolol
   - lisinopril held d/t renal failure

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) who presented with a ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm. The patient underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure for VT, which was likely the cause of his syncopal episode prior to admission. Unfortunately, the patient experienced a cardiac arrest during the EP procedure and required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity (PEA). The patient has been placed on a balloon pump and sedation has been continued due to agitation on the ventilator.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Mental status: The patient may have anoxic brain injury due to hypoperfusion, ethanol withdrawal, or excess sedation. Neurological examination does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures based on EEG. The patient has been off sedation since September 22nd and evoked potential was noted to be intact, indicating a possibility of neurological recovery (1-10%) chance. Ongoing discussion with family regarding goals of care and prognosis is ongoing.

2. Respiratory status: The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 and is initiating spontaneous breathing. There are concerns about the patient's ability to tolerate extubation and the risk of aspiration.

3. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20%) who presents with ventricular tachycardia storm. The patient has undergone an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement and has been experiencing episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which were successfully treated with lidocaine and amiodarone. The patient is currently on dronedarone for rhythm control. 

The patient's mental status is a concern for anoxic brain injury due to hypoperfusion, ethanol withdrawal, or excess sedation. Neurological examination reveals intact evoked potentials, indicating potential recovery (1-10%) chance. There is ongoing discussion with the family regarding goals of care and prognosis.

Respiratory status shows that the patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5. He is initiating spontaneous breathing, but there is a question about his ability to tolerate extubation and the risk of aspiration. Tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) are planned prior to rehabilitation.

The patient has fever and leukocytosis with positive urine culture growing enterococcus. Sputum culture results are pending, but there is already a positive sputum culture. Antibiotics have been started for vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus in the urine.

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - continue dronedarone per EP recs
   - continue metoprolol
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.  Evoked potential noted
   to be intact, neuro status may recover (1-10%) chance.  Ongoing
   discussion with family re: goals of care, prognosis.  The family has
   decided to pursue Trach/Peg for the patient.  Consulted IP and are
   planning on procedure on Monday.
   - Trach/Peg Monday
   .
   # Respiratory status: currently on PSV with peep of 5, he is initiating
   spontanous breathing.  Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off
   the vent and may likely will aspirate.
   - trial wean off status
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   - need to get trach and PEG prior to rehab.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus,.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days),
   - d/c cefepime as is Day 10
   - foley change (last change [**9-26**])
   - f/u Bcx, urine cx, line cx.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Improving transaminases, Likely shock liver from
   hypoperfusion  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]), negative
   RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  Neg Hep serologies.  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # ARF: Improving.  Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor
   perfusion during arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF
   20%.  Renal function worsening with poor urine output
   - Monitor
   .
   # hypernatremia
 Resolved.
   .
   # ?LV mural thrombus
 Initially felt that thrombus/embolus seen on TTE
   [**9-21**], head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  After
   discussion with EP, it was felt that this was likely just fibrin and no
   clear thrombus was present.
   - heparin gtt was d/ced per EP recs as it was felt that there probably
   was no LV thrombus, just fibrin, on TTE.
   - SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, but now has
   been having increased urine output.
   - continue Metoprolol
   - lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   # cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.
   .
   # abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.
   .
   # macrocytic anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol.  Continuing to trend

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and an implanted ICD. He presents with a ventricular tachycardia storm and required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity. The patient has been in the ICU since September 20th and has had multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia, which improved with lidocaine and amiodarone. He is now on dronedarone for rhythm control due to concerns about amiodarone toxicity. The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury or ethanol withdrawal. Neuro status may recover with a small chance. The family has decided to pursue tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for the patient. The patient's respiratory status is currently on pressure support ventilation with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5, and he is initiating spontaneous breathing. There is a concern about his ability to tolerate weaning off the ventilator and potential aspiration risk. The patient has fever and leukocytosis, with a positive urine culture growing enterococcus. He has improving transaminases likely due to shock liver from hypoperfusion. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely secondary to poor perfusion during his cardiac arrest.

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT yesterday
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These
   episodes improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - continue dronedarone per EP recs
   - continue metoprolol
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.  Evoked potential noted
   to be intact, neuro status may recover (1-10%) chance.  Ongoing
   discussion with family re: goals of care, prognosis.  The family has
   decided to pursue Trach/Peg for the patient.  Consulted IP and are
   planning on procedure on Monday.
   - Trach/Peg Monday
   .
   # Respiratory status: currently on PSV with peep of 5, he is initiating
   spontanous breathing.  Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off
   the vent and may likely will aspirate.
   - trial wean off status
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   - need to get trach and PEG prior to rehab.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus,.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days),
   - d/c cefepime as is Day 10
   - foley change (last change [**9-26**])
   - f/u Bcx, urine cx, line cx.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Improving transaminases, Likely shock liver from
   hypoperfusion  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]), negative
   RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  Neg Hep serologies.  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # ARF: Improving.  Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor
   perfusion during arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF
   20%.  Renal function worsening with poor urine output
   - Monitor
   .
   # hypernatremia
 Resolved.
   .
   # ?LV mural thrombus
 Initially felt that thrombus/embolus seen on TTE
   [**9-21**], head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  After
   discussion with EP, it was felt that this was likely just fibrin and no
   clear thrombus was present.
   - heparin gtt was d/ced per EP recs as it was felt that there probably
   was no LV thrombus, just fibrin, on TTE.
   - SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, but now has
   been having increased urine output.
   - continue Metoprolol
   - lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   # cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.
   .
   # abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm. The patient underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure for VT, which was likely the cause of his syncopal episode. However, during the procedure, the patient experienced a cardiac arrest and required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity (PEA). He was placed on a balloon pump and sedation was continued due to agitation on the ventilator. Propofol was used but stopped since 2 pm on [**9-22**] with little improvement in mental status (MS). The patient had multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) yesterday and was shocked back into sinus tachycardia by the ICD. These episodes improved with lidocaine and amiodarone, and now the patient has been transitioned to dronedarone for rhythm control due to concern for toxicity with amiodarone. Digoxin was also discontinued given renal failure.

The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury secondary to hypoperfusion, etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by the liver/kidneys.

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm, which led to his syncopal episode post ICD placement. The patient underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure for VT and was unable to induce arrhythmia. However, he experienced a slow rhythm that required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity (PEA). The patient has been on a balloon pump since cardiac arrest in the EP lab and had propofol sedation but was taken off on 9/22 due to agitation. He had multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) yesterday and was shocked back into sinus tachycardia by the ICD. The patient's rhythm control has been transitioned from amiodarone to dronedarone due to concerns of toxicity, and digoxin has been discontinued due to renal failure.

The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury due to hypoperfusion or possible etoh withdrawal or excess sedation not being cleared by the liver/kidneys. Neuro status may recover with a small chance. The family has decided to pursue a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for the patient, with the procedure planned for Monday.

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These episodes
   improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   - continue dronedarone per EP recs
   - continue metoprolol
   - started oral magnesium given daily need for magnesium repletion
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.  Evoked potential noted
   to be intact, neuro status may recover (1-10%) chance.  Ongoing
   discussion with family re: goals of care, prognosis.  The family has
   decided to pursue Trach/Peg for the patient.  Consulted IP and are
   planning on procedure on Monday.
   -          Trach/Peg Monday, waiting
   -          NPO after midnight
   .
   # Respiratory status: currently on PSV with peep of 5, he is initiating
   spontaneous breathing.  Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off
   the vent and likely will aspirate.
   - anticipate long term intubation, placing trach/PEG on monday
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   - need to get trach and PEG prior to rehab.
   - ancef on call to trach/PEG
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus,.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days),
   - d/c
d cefepime as is Day 10
   - foley change (last change [**9-26**])
   - f/u Bcx, urine cx, line cx.
   .
   # Transaminitis: Improving transaminases, Likely shock liver from
   hypoperfusion  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]), negative
   RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  Neg Hep serologies.  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # ARF: Improving.  Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor
   perfusion during arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF
   20%.  Renal function worsening with poor urine output
   - Monitor
   .
   # hypernatremia
 Resolved.
   .
   # ?LV mural thrombus
 Initially felt that thrombus/embolus seen on TTE
   [**9-21**], head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  After
   discussion with EP, it was felt that this was likely just fibrin and no
   clear thrombus was present.
   - heparin gtt was d/ced per EP recs as it was felt that there probably
   was no LV thrombus, just fibrin, on TTE.
   - SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, but now has
   been having increased urine output.
   - continue Metoprolol
   - lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   - Lasix to (- 500ml)
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   # cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.
   .
   # abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.
   .
   # macrocytic anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol.  Continuing to trend
   daily.

","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) who presents with ventricular tachycardia storm. He underwent an electrophysiology procedure for VT, which was likely the cause of his syncopal episode post procedure. The patient required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity (PEA) and is currently on a balloon pump after experiencing cardiac arrest in the EP lab. He was sedated with propofol but agitation occurred when taken off propofol on [**9-22**], so sedation was continued. On [**9-23**], the patient had multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and was shocked back into sinus tachycardia by his ICD. These episodes improved with lidocaine and amiodarone, and now the patient has been transitioned to dronedarone for rhythm control due to concern for toxicity with amiodarone. Digoxin was discontinued due to renal failure.

The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury due to hypoperfusion. Neuro status may recover with a low chance (1-10%). There is ongoing discussion with the family regarding goals of care and prognosis. The family has decided to pursue tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for the patient. Consulted with IP and planning for the procedure on Monday.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) who presented with ventricular tachycardia storm. The patient underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure for VT, which was likely the cause of his syncopal episode. However, during the procedure, the patient experienced a slow rhythm that required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity (PEA). The patient was placed on a balloon pump and returned to the ICU.

The patient has been experiencing multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which were successfully treated with lidocaine and amiodarone. The patient has now been transitioned to dronedarone for rhythm control due to concerns about amiodarone toxicity, especially with the patient's renal failure. Metoprolol is also being continued.

The patient's mental status is a concern, with possible anoxic brain injury due to hypoperfusion. Neurological evaluation shows intact evoked potentials, indicating a potential chance of recovery. There is ongoing discussion with the family regarding goals of care and prognosis. The family has decided to pursue a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for the patient.

The patient's respiratory status is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)"

   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These episodes
   improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   Usually noted to have HR 68-74 SR with short periods of ventricular
   bigeminy. BP 89-123/60-70 on metroprolol and dronederone.
   - continue dronedarone per EP recs
   - continue metoprolol
   - started oral magnesium given daily need for magnesium repletion

   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.  Evoked potential noted
   to be intact, neuro status may recover (1-10%) chance.  Ongoing
   discussion with family re: goals of care, prognosis.  The family has
   decided to pursue Trach/Peg for the patient.  Consulted IP and are
   planning on procedure on Monday.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He presented with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm and underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure. The patient required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity (PEA) during the EP procedure and was placed on a balloon pump. Sedation was continued due to agitation on the ventilator, and propofol was used but stopped since 2 pm on [9-22]. The patient had multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which improved with lidocaine and amiodarone. Dronedarone was transitioned for rhythm control due to concern for amiodarone toxicity, and digoxin was discontinued due to renal failure.

The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury post hypoperfusion, with ongoing discussion with the family regarding goals of care and prognosis. The family has decided to pursue tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for the patient. The patient is initiating spontaneous breathing but may have an increased risk of aspiration.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20%) who presented with ventricular tachycardia storm. He underwent an electrophysiology procedure for VT, which was likely the cause of his syncopal episode. The patient required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity (PEA) during the procedure. He has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in place with atrial pacing at rates greater than 180, firing at rates greater than 250. The patient returned to the ICU on a balloon pump after experiencing a cardiac arrest during the procedure. 

The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury due to hypoperfusion. He is off sedation since September 22nd at 2 pm, and his evoked potential is intact. Neurologically, there is a small chance of recovery (1-10%). 

The patient has been intubated and is currently on CPAP with pressure support (PS) and supplemental oxygen (FiO2 40%). His respiratory status has improved, but there is a concern for long-term intubation and the risk of aspiration. A tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) are planned for October 4th. 

The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, with a positive urine culture growing enterococcus. He has been started on antibiotics and is responding well to lasix. 

The patient's chronic systolic heart failure is euvolemic without significant pedal edema. He has antero-apical akinesis on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and was off coumadin at home due to non-compliance with international normalized ratio (INR) checks. A left ventricular thrombus was seen on TTE this admission. The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was removed on September 21st. 

The patient has a history of large anterior myocardial infarction in 1992. He is on statin, aspirin, and beta-blocker therapy. 

The patient has chronic ethanolism and likely underestimates his alcohol use. He is not currently requiring CIWA (Alcohol Withdrawal Seizure) due to sedation. 

The patient had transaminitis likely secondary to hypoperfusion. His liver function tests (LFTs) are improving. 

The patient is in acute renal failure, likely secondary to poor perfusion during arrest in the setting of poor forward flow (ejection fraction 20%). 

The patient's hypernatremia has resolved. 

There was an initial concern for a left ventricular mural thrombus, but it was later determined to be just fibrin. Heparin was discontinued per electrophysiology recommendations.

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These episodes
   improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   Usually noted to have HR 68-74 SR with short periods of ventricular
   bigeminy. BP 89-123/60-70 on metroprolol and dronederone.
   - continue dronedarone per EP recs
   - continue metoprolol
   - started oral magnesium given daily need for magnesium repletion
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.  Evoked potential noted
   to be intact, neuro status may recover (1-10%) chance.  Ongoing
   discussion with family re: goals of care, prognosis.  The family has
   decided to pursue Trach/Peg for the patient.  Consulted IP and are
   planning on procedure on Monday.
   - Trach/Peg on [**10-4**], waiting for placement
   .
   # Respiratory status: He is initiating spontaneous breathing.
   Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off the vent and likely
   will aspirate.  Intubated: CPAP w/ PS @  FiO2 40%/5 PSV/ 5 peep. O2 sat
   100%. RR 13-20. LS clear but diminished at bases. Very strong cough and
   frequenlt requires suctioning for clear, thick ETT secretions
   - anticipate long term intubation, placing trach/PEG on [**10-4**]
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   - need to get trach and PEG prior to rehab.
   - ancef on call to trach/PEG
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus,.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   Foley draining amber colored urine. On IV ampicillin for treatment of
   enteroccoccal UTI (afebrile).
   - responding to lasix
   - Ampicillin for vanc-sensitive enterococcus in urine (day 1=[**9-26**],
   continue for 10 days),
   - d/c
d cefepime as is Day 10
   - foley change (last change [**9-26**])
   - f/u Bcx, urine cx, line cx.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, but now has
   been having increased urine output.
   - continue Metoprolol
   - lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   - Lasix to (- 500ml), pm lytes
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   # Transaminitis: Improving transaminases, Likely shock liver from
   hypoperfusion  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]), negative
   RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  Neg Hep serologies.  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # ARF: Improving.  Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor
   perfusion during arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF
   20%.  Renal function worsening with poor urine output
   - Monitor
   .
   # hypernatremia
 Resolved.
   .
   # ?LV mural thrombus
 Initially felt that thrombus/embolus seen on TTE
   [**9-21**], head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  After
   discussion with EP, it was felt that this was likely just fibrin and no
   clear thrombus was present.
   - heparin gtt was d/ced per EP recs as it was felt that there probably
   was no LV thrombus, just fibrin, on TTE.
   - SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis
   .
   # cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.
   .
   # abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.   On TF at 60 ml/hr. NPO after MN. BG treated with RISS.
   .
   # macrocytic anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol.  Continuing to trend

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20%) who presented with ventricular tachycardia storm. He underwent an electrophysiology procedure for VT, but experienced a cardiac arrest during the procedure and required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity. The patient has an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in place with atrial pacing at rates greater than 180, and it has been firing at rates greater than 250. He is currently on a balloon pump after the cardiac arrest in the EP lab. The patient's mental status is concerning for anoxic brain injury due to hypoperfusion, and there is a discussion with the family regarding goals of care and prognosis. The patient's respiratory status is improving, but he is at risk for long-term intubation and aspiration. He has a Foley catheter in place and is experiencing symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Enterococcus species. His renal function is improving, and he has had an increase in urine output. The patient has chronic systolic heart failure and has been off Coumadin due to non-compliance with INR checks. He has an antero-apical akinesis on TTE and was found to have a left ventricular thrombus during this admission. His coronary arteries are diseased, and he has a history of large anterior myocardial infarction. The"

   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These episodes
   improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   Usually noted to have HR 68-74 SR with short periods of ventricular
   bigeminy. BP 89-123/60-70 on metroprolol and dronederone.
   - continue dronedarone per EP recs
   - continue metoprolol
   - started oral magnesium given daily need for magnesium repletion

   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.  Evoked potential noted
   to be intact, neuro status may recover (1-10%) chance.  Ongoing
   discussion with family re: goals of care, prognosis.  The family has
   decided to pursue Trach/Peg for the patient.  Consulted IP and are
   planning on procedure on Monday.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20%) who presented with ventricular tachycardia storm. He underwent an electrophysiology (EP) procedure for the VT and was subsequently resuscitated from a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in place, but it has been firing at rates >250. He was placed on a balloon pump after experiencing cardiac arrest in the EP lab. The balloon pump was pulled on [**9-20**], and sedation continued due to agitation on the ventilator with propofol. Propofol was discontinued since [**9-22**] at 2pm, and the patient's mental status has been fluctuating. Neurologically, there are concerns about anoxic brain injury, but an EEG does not support sub-clinical seizures. Evoked potential remains intact, indicating a possible chance of neuro recovery (1-10%). 

The patient's respiratory status shows that he is initiating spontaneous breathing but has a strong cough and frequent suctioning for clear, thick endotracheal tube (ETT) secretions. There is anticipation of long-term intubation, and a tracheostomy/PEG tube placement is planned on [**10-4**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, presenting with ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm. He underwent an electrophysiological (EP) procedure to address the VT but experienced a cardiac arrest in the EP lab. The patient was resuscitated and placed on a balloon pump. Sedation was continued due to agitation on the ventilator, but propofol was discontinued since September 22nd. The patient had multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which improved with lidocaine and amiodarone. He is now being transitioned to dronedarone for rhythm control and off amiodarone due to concerns about toxicity. Digoxin was also discontinued due to renal failure.

The patient has been noted to have a heart rate of 68-74 beats per minute with occasional ventricular bigeminy and blood pressure ranging from 89-123/60-70 mmHg on metoprolol and dronedarone. Oral magnesium has been started for daily repletion.

Concerns have been raised regarding the patient's mental status, with a possible anoxic brain injury due to hypoperfusion. Neurological status may recover with a 1-10% chance. There is ongoing discussion with the family regarding goals of care and prognosis. The family has decided to"

   Assessment and Plan
   43 y/o M w/ h/o Ischemic Dilated Cardiomyopathy (EF 20%) s/p ICD
   placement who presents with VT Storm.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Patient s/p EP procedure for VT which was likely the cause
   of his syncopal episode PTA.  Unable to induce arrhythmia in cath lab
   o/n, however slow rhythm induced and pt required resuscitation for
   PEA.  Patient with ICD in place with AT pacing at rates > 180, Firing
   at rates > 250.  Returned to ICU on ballon pump s/p cardiac arrest in
   EP lab.  Balloon pump pulled [**9-20**], sedation continued as patient
   became very agitated on vent with propofol. Off propofol since 2pm on
   [**9-22**] with little improvement in MS. On [**9-23**], pt had multiple episodes
   of SVT
 ICD shocked him back into sinus tachycardia. These episodes
   improved with lidocane gtt (dc
d [**9-25**]) and Amiodarone.  Now
   transitioned to Dronedarone for rhythm control and out of concern for
   toxicity with Amiodarone.  Digoxin also dc
d given renal failure.
   Usually noted to have HR 68-74 SR with short periods of ventricular
   bigeminy. BP 89-123/60-70 on metroprolol and dronederone.
   - continue dronedarone per EP recs
   - continue metoprolol
   - started oral magnesium given daily need for magnesium repletion
   .
   # Mental status: Concern for anoxic brain injury s/p hypoperfusion,
   (vs. etoh withdrawal, or excess sedation not being cleared by
   liver/kidneys.) Neuro does not believe this is sub-clinical seizures
   based on EEG.  Off sedation since [**9-22**] at 2pm.  Evoked potential noted
   to be intact, neuro status may recover (1-10%) chance.  Ongoing
   discussion with family re: goals of care, prognosis.  The family has
   decided to pursue Trach/Peg for the patient.  Consulted IP and are
   planning on procedure on Monday.
   - Trach/Peg on [**10-4**], waiting for placement
   .
   # Respiratory status: He is initiating spontaneous breathing.
   Questionable if patient is able to tolerate off the vent and likely
   will aspirate.  Intubated: CPAP w/ PS @  FiO2 40%/5 PSV/ 5 peep. O2 sat
   100%. RR 13-20. LS clear but diminished at bases. Very strong cough and
   frequenlt requires suctioning for clear, thick ETT secretions
   - anticipate long term intubation, placing trach/PEG on [**10-4**]
   - watch for aspiration risk, pna.
   - need to get trach and PEG prior to rehab.
   - ancef on call to trach/PEG
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis:  Fever improved but WBC remains elevated.  UA
   growing enterococcus. Positive sputum cx, speciation pending, positive
   U/A growing Enterococcus,.  Patient started on antibiotics on [**9-22**].
   Foley draining amber colored urine. On IV ampicillin for treatment of
   enteroccoccal UTI (afebrile).
   - d/c ampicillin (D10/10)
   - obtain sputum cx prior to discharge
   - f/u Bcx
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:  Euvolemic on examination
   without significant pedal edema.  Antero-apical akinesis on TTE, had
   been off coumadin at home given non-compliance with INR checks as an
   outpatient, now with LV thrombus seen on TTE this admission.  IABP
   removed [**9-21**].  Volume overloaded with poor urine output, but now has
   been having increased urine output.
   - continue Metoprolol
   - lisinopril held d/t renal failure
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient s/p large anterior myocardial infarction in
   [**2192**].
   - Continue statin, aspirin, beta blocker.
   .
   #  ETOHism - Chronic issue.  Patient likely minimizes his ETOH use.
   Not requiring CIWA currently given sedation.
   - CIWA Scale in place for when patient is extubated
   - MVI, folate, thiamine (NG)
   .
   # Transaminitis: Improving transaminases, Likely shock liver from
   hypoperfusion  Patient had unremarkable abdominal CT ([**9-20**]), negative
   RUQ US ([**9-24**]).  Neg Hep serologies.  LFTs now downtrending.
   - trend LFTs daily
   - check albumin, INR daily to follow liver function
   - keep tylenol level to less than 2gm / day
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   # ARF: Improving.  Patient in acute renal failure, likely [**1-4**] poor
   perfusion during arrest in the setting of poor forward flow [**1-4**] EF
   20%.  Renal function worsening with poor urine output
   - Monitor
   .
   # hypernatremia
 reinforce free water flushes, d5w as needed PM lytes
   check.
   .
   # ?LV mural thrombus
 Initially felt that thrombus/embolus seen on TTE
   [**9-21**], head CT negative for embolic CVA or other acute process.  After
   discussion with EP, it was felt that this was likely just fibrin and no
   clear thrombus was present.
   - heparin gtt was d/ced per EP recs as it was felt that there probably
   was no LV thrombus, just fibrin, on TTE.
   - SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis
   .
   # cool L Lower Extremity: Hx of L foot slightly cooler than R but
   stable/improved clinically.
   .
   # abd distension: Stable, +BS, CT negative, will monitor clinically
   daily.   On TF at 60 ml/hr. NPO after MN. BG treated with RISS.
   .
   # macrocytic anemia: Likely secondary to alcohol.  Continuing to trend
   daily.
   # DISPO: awaiting rehab

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 43-year-old male with a history of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 20%) who presents with ventricular tachycardia storm. The patient underwent an electrophysiology procedure for VT, which was likely the cause of his syncopal episode post-transplant. The patient's rhythm was slow and required resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity (PEA). The patient has an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in place with atrial pacing at rates >180, firing at rates >250. The patient returned to the ICU on a balloon pump following cardiac arrest in the EP lab. The balloon pump was pulled on 9/20, sedation continued as the patient became very agitated on the ventilator with propofol. Propofol was discontinued since 2 pm on 9/22 with little improvement in mental status. On 9/23, the patient had multiple episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that were successfully managed with lidocaine and amiodarone. The patient is now transitioned to dronedarone for rhythm control due to concerns about amiodarone toxicity. Digoxin was also discontinued due to renal failure.

The patient is typically noted to have a heart rate of 68-74 beats per minute in sinus rhythm with short periods of ventricular bigeminy. Blood pressure is 89-123/60-"
