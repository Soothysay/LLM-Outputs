","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with an enterocutaneous fistula who presented from a nursing home with GNR bacteremia and oxycodone overdose. The patient has been experiencing acute respiratory distress, likely due to flash pulmonary edema. She has been given bipap support and medications such as morphine, nitro paste, and lopressor.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 154 bpm, blood pressure of 119/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 1008 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 25 cmH2O.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, overweight/obese, anxious, and diminished pulses in the extremities. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.4 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.6 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 101 K/uL, elevated blood glucose level of 726 mg/dL, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CR"

- Acute respiratory distress, likely from flash pulmonary edema although respiratory distress:
  - Morphine and nitro prn
  - Bipap for now; intubated if needed
  - Echo today
  - Monitor uop
  - PE is possible; will consider empiric a/c and work-up with LENI and TTE; cannot lay flat for PECT
  - Cont nebs for copd; no indication for steroids for now
- Anemia: doubt transfusion reaction; also low plt
  - Anemia panel
  - Transfuse with different blood while work-up
  - Although g+ stool no signs of active gib; cont and increase ppi
  - Find out baseline plt (180 recent)
- GNR bacteremia: wbc down
  - Cont meropenem and start cipro until sensies return
  - Must d/c PICC line and place central line vs more peripherals
  - Fu cultures
- Access:
  - Will consider femoral line vs subclavian since cannot be supine
- HTN:
  - Tte"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with an enterocutaneous fistula who presents from a nursing home with GNR bacteremia and oxycodone overdose. The patient has been experiencing acute respiratory distress, likely due to flash pulmonary edema. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 154 bpm, blood pressure of 119/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on bipap. 

The physical examination reveals a well-nourished and overweight female who appears anxious. Cardiovascular examination shows a hyperdynamic precordium, diminished peripheral pulses, and a systolic murmur. Respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds with bibasilar crackles and wheezes. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Extremities show trace edema without cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination is not assessed. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.6 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 118 K/uL, elevated blood glucose at 726 mg/dL, and other abnormalities. Imaging shows a relatively clear chest X-ray with a properly positioned right percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line.

The assessment and plan include poisoning/overdose, alteration in nutrition, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypertension, and an enterocutaneous"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension. The patient experienced an episode of respiratory distress and was treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV), intravenous lasix, and nitropase. An echocardiogram was performed, revealing severe aortic stenosis (AS). The patient's medication was increased, including omeprazole to 40mg daily. A left subclavian line was placed. The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. The patient's vital signs are currently unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and temperature. The patient is on various infusions, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's lab results indicate anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated glucose levels. The patient has chronic anemia, poisoning/overdose, alteration in nutrition, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient is on glycemic control with a sliding scale of humalog insulin. The patient has multiple lines and prophylactic measures in place, including DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's initial presentation of hypotension suggests possible cardiovascular or circulatory issues. This may be related to the severe"

   The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular

   (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The aortic valve is not well

   given peak gradient >60mmHg). No definite aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve could not be adequated assessed. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be quantified. There is no definite
   pericardial effusion.

   69F with history of ? moderate AS, HTN, COPD, entero-cutaneous fistula
   after abdominal surgery on TPN, h/o multiple infections presents from
   rehab w/ hypoxia and hypotension after accidental overdose of
   oxycodone.
   #. Hypoxia: Acute respiratory distress ([**6-23**]) in setting of getting
   blood transfusion. [**Month (only) 51**] have been transfusion reaction, or manifestation
   of SIRS given her bacteremia.  CXR without overt pulmonary edema though
   may still have had flash pulmonary edema or TACO.  Improved with nitro
   paste, morphine, lasix and NIV. Echo shows severe AS. Think HAP less
   likely.
   - Continue NIV and wean as tolerated
   - Treating w/ broad-spectrum antibiotics that would cover a HAP
   (although minimal cough)
   - Continue usual inhalers for COPD
   - Send blood for possible transfusion reaction
   #. Sepsis:  GNR bacteremia.  Was being treated for UTI at rehab with
   imepenum. Clinically improving with decreasing WBC count.
   - Continue meropenum and cipro pending culture data, should be able to
   narrow to cipro alone once final sensis back
   - f/u pending cultures and CIS
   #. Hypotension:  Intiailly likely from both opiod effect along w/ GNR
   bacteremia.  On morning of [**6-23**] was hypertensive.  Hypertension may be
   combination of holding antihypertensives (including clonidine) and her
   narcotics. BPs still borderline [**6-23**] evening but improved this AM.

   setting of fluid recussitation.  No signs of active GI bleed. Hct
   bumped appropriately post transfusion yesterday
   - PPI
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hcts for now, maintain active T+S
   # Acute renal failure
   Cr bumped from 0.8 to 1.2 today. Might have become intravascularly
   depleted in setting of lasix yesterday. Consider also ATN in the
   setting of hypotensive. AIN in setting of antibiotics also a
   possibility.
   - Check UA, lytes
   - Renally doses meds, follow urine output
   - Repeat Cr in PM
   # Opioid overdose, resolved: Received naloxone 0.4 mg at rehab and 0.2
   mg first night of admission. Alert today.
   - Continue fentanyl patch
   #. OSA: Tolerated CPAP overnight
   #. Aortic stenosis: Loud murmur on exam.  Per patient, has been told
   she needs a balloon to open her valve. Echo repeated here shows severe
   AS.
   - Cautious fluid management

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of moderate aortic stenosis (AS), hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and entero-cutaneous fistula following abdominal surgery. She was admitted from a rehabilitation center with hypoxia and hypotension after an accidental overdose of oxycodone. 

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications including acute respiratory distress, sepsis with GNR bacteremia, hypotension, anemia, acute renal failure, opioid overdose, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), severe AS, gout, and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). 

The patient's condition has been improving with treatment, including non-invasive ventilation (NIV), broad-spectrum antibiotics, and fluid management. However, she continues to have ongoing issues such as COPD, gout, and DM2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory distress, which was likely due to the blood transfusion. This could be a manifestation of a transfusion reaction or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) given her bacteremia. The patient's condition improved with the use of NIV and medication. Continuous monitoring and management of oxygenation is essential to prevent further hypoxia.

2. Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia and was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and"

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of moderate aortic stenosis (AS), hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), entero-cutaneous fistula after abdominal surgery, and multiple infections. She presented to the ICU with hypoxia and hypotension after an accidental overdose of oxycodone. She also has a GNR bacteremia and acute renal failure. The patient's current condition is improving with treatment for sepsis, severe AS, and hypotension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient experienced acute respiratory distress possibly due to a transfusion reaction or manifestation of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Although the chest X-ray did not show overt pulmonary edema, there may still be flash pulmonary edema or tension pneumothorax. The patient was treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV), nitropaste, morphine, and lasix, which improved her condition.
2. Sepsis: The patient has GNR bacteremia, which was being treated at the rehabilitation facility with meropenem. Clinically, the patient is improving with decreasing white blood cell count. The PICC line has been removed.
3. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension was likely due to opioid effects along with GNR bacteremia. On the morning of [**6-23**], she was hypertensive, possibly from holding antihypertensive"

   Echo
   The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
   (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The aortic valve is not well
   seen. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area likely <1.0cm2
   given peak gradient >60mmHg). No definite aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve could not be adequated assessed. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be quantified. There is no definite
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Severe aortic stenosis. Normal
   left ventricular cavity size with preserved global systolic function.

   Assessment and Plan
   69F with history of ? moderate AS, HTN, COPD, entero-cutaneous fistula
   after abdominal surgery on TPN, h/o multiple infections presents from
   rehab w/ hypoxia and hypotension after accidental overdose of
   oxycodone.
   #. Hypoxia: Acute respiratory distress ([**6-23**]) in setting of getting
   blood transfusion. [**Month (only) 51**] have been transfusion reaction, or manifestation
   of SIRS given her bacteremia.  CXR without overt pulmonary edema though
   may still have had flash pulmonary edema or TACO.  Improved with nitro
   paste, morphine, lasix and NIV. Echo shows severe AS. Think HAP less
   likely.
   - Continue NIV and wean as tolerated
   - Treating w/ broad-spectrum antibiotics that would cover a HAP
   (although minimal cough)
   - Continue usual inhalers for COPD
   - Send blood for possible transfusion reaction
   #. Sepsis:  GNR bacteremia.  Was being treated for UTI at rehab with
   imepenum. Clinically improving with decreasing WBC count.
   - Continue meropenum and cipro pending culture data, should be able to
   narrow to cipro alone once final sensis back
   - f/u pending cultures and CIS
   - repeat blood cultures today
   #. Hypotension
 Hypertension:  Intiailly likely from both opiod effect
   along w/ GNR bacteremia.  On morning of [**6-23**] was hypertensive.
   Hypertension may be combination of holding antihypertensives (including
   clonidine) and her narcotics. BPs recently improved.
   - Holding home hypertensives
   #. Anemia: Microcytic w/ known iron-deficiency w/ guaiac + fistula
   output.  Apparently had an EGD in [**Month (only) 25**] w/ gastritis.  HCT has been
   stable at OSH over the past several days but dropped this in the
   setting of fluid recussitation.  No signs of active GI bleed. Hct
   bumped appropriately post transfusion yesterday
   - PPI
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hcts for now, maintain active T+S
   # Opioid overdose: Received naloxone 0.4 mg at rehab and 0.2 mg first
   night of admission. Alert today.
   - Continue fentanyl patch
   #. OSA: Tolerated CPAP overnight
   #. Aortic stenosis: Loud murmur on exam.  Per patient, has been told
   she needs a balloon to open her valve. Echo repeated here shows severe
   AS.
   - Cautious w/ either bolusing IVF or diuresis given this history
   #. Gout: colchicine (will decrease to daily given large volume of
   fistula output)
   #. DM2:  Per history diet controlled
   - SS humalog for now
   #. COPD/Asthma: advair, ipratropium nebs, hold albuterol given

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of moderate aortic stenosis (AS), hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and an enterocutaneous fistula following abdominal surgery. She presents to the ICU with hypoxia and hypotension after an accidental overdose of oxycodone.

The patient's 24-hour events include an episode of respiratory distress treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV), intravenous lasix, and nitroprase. An echocardiogram was obtained, revealing severe AS. Omeprazole was increased to 40 mg daily. A left subclavian line was placed, and the patient received a blood transfusion overnight.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.5Â°C (95.9Â°F), heart rate between 87-154 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 74-114/34-62 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently on CPAP and in standby ventilator mode.

Physical examination findings include diminished carotid upstrokes, regular S1 and S2 heart sounds with late peaking systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, clear lungs bilaterally, and mild tenderness in the abdomen wound area. Extremities are warm and well perfused.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and an entero-cutaneous fistula following abdominal surgery. She is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
- The patient presents from rehabilitation with hypoxia and hypotension and positive gram-negative rods (GNR) in her blood.
- She has been admitted to the ICU due to opiate overdose and bacteremia.
- Her condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in vital signs, including fever, low blood pressure responsive to fluids and transfusion, and altered mental status.
- She has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin.
- She is on prophylactic heparin sodium and omeprazole (Prilosec).
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fatigue, fever, and dry mouth.
- Physical examination shows that she appears well-nourished, overweight, and not in acute distress. Her cardiovascular examination reveals a normal S1 and S2 heart sound, and a systolic murmur. Her peripheral pulses are diminished on both arms and legs.
- Respiratory and abdominal examinations are unremarkable, except for mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant.
- Neurologic examination shows that she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately. However, movement, tone, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   69F with history of ? moderate AS, HTN, COPD, entero-cutaneous fistula
   after abdominal surgery on TPN, h/o multiple infections presents from
   rehab w/ hypoxia and hypotension after accidental overdose of
   oxycodone.
   #. Sepsis:
   Bacteremia with pan S E coli
   Was being treated for UTI at rehab with imepenum. Clinically improving
   with decreasing WBC count.  PICC line now out.
   - Continue cipro x7d course
   - f/u pending cultures and CIS
   #. Hypotension:
   Resolved
   Initially likely from both opiod effect along w/ GNR bacteremia.  On
   morning of [**6-23**] was hypertensive.  Hypertension may be combination of
   holding antihypertensives (including clonidine) and her narcotics. BPs
   still borderline [**6-23**] evening but improved this AM.
   - Start captopril and titrate PRN
   #. Hypoxia:
   Now significantly improved, on room air.
   Acute respiratory distress ([**6-23**]) in setting of getting blood
   transfusion. [**Month (only) 51**] have been transfusion reaction, or manifestation of
   SIRS given her bacteremia.  CXR without overt pulmonary edema though
   may still have had flash pulmonary edema or TACO.  Improved with nitro
   paste, morphine, lasix and NIV. Echo shows severe AS. Think HAP less
   likely.
   - Continue NIV as needed
   - Continue usual inhalers for COPD
   - Sent blood for possible transfusion reaction
   # Acute renal failure
   Cr stable.  Might have become intravascularly depleted in setting of
   lasix yesterday.
   - Check UA, lytes
   - Renally doses meds, follow urine output
   - Repeat Cr in PM
   #. Aortic stenosis: Echo repeated here shows severe AS.
   - Cautious fluid management
   - Will need cardiology followup
   #. Anemia: Microcytic w/ known iron-deficiency w/ guaiac + fistula
   output.  Apparently had an EGD in [**Month (only) 25**] w/ gastritis.  HCT has been
   stable at OSH over the past several days but dropped this in the
   setting of fluid resuscitation.  No signs of active GI bleed. Hct
   bumped appropriately post transfusion yesterday
   - PPI
   - Daily Hct
   # Opioid overdose, resolved: Received naloxone 0.4 mg at rehab and 0.2
   mg first night of admission. Alert today.
   - Continue fentanyl patch
   #. OSA: Tolerated CPAP overnight
   #. Gout: colchicine (will decrease to daily given large volume of
   fistula output)
   #. DM2:  Per history diet controlled
   - SS humalog for now
   #. COPD/Asthma: advair, ipratropium nebs, hold albuterol given
   tachycardia

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of moderate aortic stenosis (AS), hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), entero-cutaneous fistula after abdominal surgery, and multiple infections. She presented from rehabilitation with hypoxia and hypotension after an accidental overdose of oxycodone. She has been diagnosed with sepsis caused by pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia and was initially treated with imipenem. Her vital signs are stable, and she is improving with decreasing WBC count. She has resolved hypotension, hypoxia, acute respiratory distress, acute renal failure, and opioid overdose. She has severe AS confirmed by echocardiogram. She also has anemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gout, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma (COPD/Asthma). She is currently receiving TPN, captopril for hypertension, fentanyl patch, colchicine for gout, and inhalers for COPD. She is tolerating CPAP well and has no signs of active gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis caused by pan-sensitive E. coli bacteremia. Although her condition is improving, there is still a risk of complications associated with sepsis, such as organ dysfunction or failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a chief complaint of hypotension. She has been admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing several medical issues. The patient's admission blood cultures grew pan-sensitive E. coli, leading to the discontinuation of zosyn and the continuation of ciprofloxacin. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin at 02:20 AM on 06/25/2181. She also received vancomycin and meropenem on previous days. The patient is currently on TPN without lipids at 42 mL/hour since 07:00 PM on 06/24/2181.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for feeling comfortable with minimal chronic pain. Her vital signs show a blood pressure of 170/70 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on CPAP mask with SpO2 of 99%. Her ABG results are ///19/. On physical examination, she appears alert and interactive with clear lungs bilaterally, no rales/wheezing, and mild tenderness in the abdomen without rigidity or guarding. She has warm extremities with 1+ bilateral edema.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.7 g/dL, sodium of 158 mg/dL, potassium of 0.9 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, glucose of 726 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.03. Other lab values include elevated CK, CKMB, and PT/PTT/INR levels. Imaging studies show no significant findings.

Assessment and plan include ineffective coping, chronic anemia, poisoning/overdose, alteration in nutrition, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient is being cared for in the ICU with appropriate prophylaxis measures, such as DVT boots, stress ulcer PPI, and VAP precautions. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is transfer to the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, development of organ dysfunction, further electrolyte imbalances, potential for wound infection due to the abdominal wound vac in place, and possible complications related to prolonged immobilization and edema."

   Assessment and Plan
   69F with history of ? moderate AS, HTN, COPD, entero-cutaneous fistula
   after abdominal surgery on TPN, h/o multiple infections presents from
   rehab w/ hypoxia and hypotension after accidental overdose of
   oxycodone.
   #. Hypoxia:
   Now significantly improved, on room air.
   Acute respiratory distress ([**6-23**]) in setting of getting blood
   transfusion. [**Month (only) 51**] have been transfusion reaction, or manifestation of
   SIRS given her bacteremia.  CXR without overt pulmonary edema though
   may still have had flash pulmonary edema or TACO.  Improved with nitro
   paste, morphine, lasix and NIV. Echo shows severe AS. Think HAP less
   likely.
   - Continue NIV as needed
   - Treating w/ broad-spectrum antibiotics that would cover a HAP
   (although minimal cough)
   - Continue usual inhalers for COPD
   - Send blood for possible transfusion reaction
   #. Sepsis:
   Bacteremia with pan S E coli
   Was being treated for UTI at rehab with imepenum. Clinically improving
   with decreasing WBC count.  PICC line now out.
   - Continue cipro x7d course
   - f/u pending cultures and CIS
   #. Hypotension:
   Resolved
   Initially likely from both opiod effect along w/ GNR bacteremia.  On
   morning of [**6-23**] was hypertensive.  Hypertension may be combination of
   holding antihypertensives (including clonidine) and her narcotics. BPs
   still borderline [**6-23**] evening but improved this AM.
   - Can likely restart either ACEI or bblocker today
   # Acute renal failure
   Cr bumped from 0.8 to 1.2 today. Might have become intravascularly
   depleted in setting of lasix yesterday. Consider also ATN in the
   setting of hypotensive. AIN in setting of antibiotics also a
   possibility.
   - Check UA, lytes
   - Renally doses meds, follow urine output
   - Repeat Cr in PM
   #. Aortic stenosis: Echo repeated here shows severe AS.
   - Cautious fluid management
   - Will need cardiology followup
   #. Anemia: Microcytic w/ known iron-deficiency w/ guaiac + fistula
   output.  Apparently had an EGD in [**Month (only) 25**] w/ gastritis.  HCT has been
   stable at OSH over the past several days but dropped this in the
   setting of fluid resuscitation.  No signs of active GI bleed. Hct
   bumped appropriately post transfusion yesterday
   - PPI
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hcts for now, maintain active T+S
   # Opioid overdose, resolved: Received naloxone 0.4 mg at rehab and 0.2
   mg first night of admission. Alert today.
   - Continue fentanyl patch
   #. OSA: Tolerated CPAP overnight
   #. Gout: colchicine (will decrease to daily given large volume of
   fistula output)
   #. DM2:  Per history diet controlled
   - SS humalog for now
   #. COPD/Asthma: advair, ipratropium nebs, hold albuterol given
   tachycardia

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of moderate aortic stenosis (AS), hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), entero-cutaneous fistula after abdominal surgery, and multiple infections. The patient presented from rehabilitation with hypoxia and hypotension after an accidental overdose of oxycodone.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues that require attention:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's acute respiratory distress on June 23rd was likely due to a transfusion reaction or manifestation of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) caused by bacteremia. Although the chest X-ray did not show overt pulmonary edema, there might have been flash pulmonary edema or transient arrhythmias of cardiac origin (TACO). The patient improved with the use of nitro paste, morphine, lasix, and noninvasive ventilation (NIV). An echocardiogram showed severe AS, making hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) less likely.

- Continue NIV as needed.
- Treat with broad-spectrum antibiotics that cover HAP.
- Send blood for possible transfusion reaction.

2. Sepsis: The patient had bacteremia with pan-sensitive E. coli. She was being treated for a urinary tract infection (UTI) at the rehabilitation center with imipenem. Clinically, she is improving with a decreasing white blood cell count. The peripherally"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, initially presenting with hypotension and possible opiate overdose, and GNR bacteremia. She has been stable overnight, with controlled blood pressure and autodiuresis. The patient is afebrile and on various medications including antibiotics, pain management, and antidepressants.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.3Â°C (97.4Â°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/57 mmHg to 178/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP. The patient's central venous pressure is within normal range, and fluid balance shows a slight negative balance. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished but overweight/obese, with clear breath sounds and no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurological assessment indicates that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. Laboratory results show normal hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet counts, as well as electrolyte imbalances. Microbiology results indicate pan-eucaryotic coliform bacteria.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has ineffective coping, chronic anemia, poisoning/overdose, alteration in nutrition, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The plan includes continuing COPD treatment, restarting antihypertensive medications, pulling"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, initially presenting with hypotension and possible opiate overdose, and GNR bacteremia. She has been stable overnight, with her blood pressure climbing, autodiuresis, and no fever. The patient's allergies are unknown, and she has been receiving various antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. She is on multiple medications, including fentanyl, Advair, ciprofloxacin, metoprolol, mirazol, Tylenol, omeprazole, and oxycodone.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress, hypertension, and altered mental status. Her physical examination shows well-nourished, overweight/obese appearance, clear breath sounds, distended abdomen, and no muscle wasting or clubbing. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented, and not sedated or paralyzed.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.7 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.8 K/uL, thrombocytosis with a platelet count of 158 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine levels. Blood cultures show pan-e coli infection. Other lab values are within normal range.
