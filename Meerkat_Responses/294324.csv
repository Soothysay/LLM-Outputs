   1. No pulmonary embolism.

   somewhat nonspecific, and differential diagnosis includes multifocal
   pneumonia
   (particularly viral etiologies), diffuse alveolar injury or hemorrhage,
   and
   drug reaction. Pulmonary edema may be less likely given absence of
   significant septal thickening or effusions. Fulminant progression of
   idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is also possible.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o M w/IPF and baseline hypoxemia who presents with worsening
   dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis.
   1. Respiratory failure:  He is currently tachypneic in the 30s-40s and
   requiring a NRB but at this point does not need intubation.  The most
   likely etiology of his worsening hypoxia is bacterial pneumonia, given
   his abrupt worsening of symptoms over 2 days, chills, yellow sputum,
   and CT findings.  Other causes of pneumonia (fungal/PCP) are less
   likely as he is not immunosuppressed.  Viral pneumonia is also possible
   but wouldn't expect the consolidation on CT.  Also of concern is that
   this could represent a worsening of his IPF, given that the past 2 days
   of increased dyspnea are on a background of a few weeks of worsening
   dyspnea.  Pulmonary edema is much less likely given the normal BNP and
   CT findings not suggestive of this.  There is concern he could have
   pulmonary hypertension due to his underlying lung disease as a cause of
   his hypoxia but he certainly has enough parenchymal findings on CT to
   explain this.  He does not have any signs of R heart failure on exam.
   The hemoptysis is likely due to infection but will closely monitor for
   signs that this is DAH.
   - treat for community-acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone and
   azithromycin (given hospitalized in ICU)
   -send sputum cx, urine legionella antigen
   -if he fails to improve, consider empiric steroids for worsening IPF
   (although no data for this)
   2. Chest pain: Likely related to coughing.  ECG unchanged, cardiac
   enzymes negative.  Will not cycle enzymes.  Tachycardia likely related
   to respiratory distress.  No PE.
   3. DM: Cont lantus, metformin, insulin sliding scale.
   4. HTN: Cont atenolol.
   5. OSA:  Cont CPAP at night (pt gets 12 cm H2O through nasal mask).
   6. GERD: Cont PPI.

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and baseline hypoxemia. He presents with worsening dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis. The patient has been started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and placed on CPAP overnight for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). 

The patient had a brief episode of central chest tightness, worse with coughing, but no ECG changes. The pain on palpation of the chest was relieved with 2mg morphine IV X1. His vital signs show fever, tachycardia, low blood pressure, increased respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows sinus tachycardia. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated glucose level, prolonged PT/PTT/INR, low calcium and magnesium levels, and low potassium levels. Imaging reveals diffuse ground glass centrilobular airspace opacities on chest CT, which could be nonspecific and have various differential diagnoses including multifocal pneumonia, diffuse alveolar injury or hemorrhage, drug reaction, or pulmonary edema. 

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to bacterial pneumonia or worsening IPF, chest pain likely related to coughing, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, OSA, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. ICU"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old individual with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) presenting with respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing fever, coughing, and chest pain. Vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/66 to 146/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%. The patient is receiving high-flow oxygen through a neb device. The physical examination reveals crackles in both lungs, particularly at the right base. The patient's abdominal examination is unremarkable, and extremity pulses are absent on the right side but present on the left. Neurological assessment is not complete.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (12.7 K/uL), hemoglobin level (12.9 g/dL), platelet count (214 K/uL), blood glucose level (179 mg/dL), and slightly elevated potassium levels (4.1 mEq/L). Imaging shows worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient's current condition is assessed as worsening IPF with potential infection. The plan includes continuing azithromycin and ceftriaxone, administering pulse-dose steroids (solumedrol 500mg qd for three days), and adding tessalon for cough. Due to the high dose of steroids, the patient's diabetes management"

   CHEST:
   Degree of opacification in both lungs is probably unchanged since prior
   chest
   x-ray. While small effusions cannot be excluded, no large effusion is
   present, and there has been no increase in the cardiac size, which
   makes the
   increased opacification more likely due to some inflammatory condition
   on top
   of the fibrosis rather than failure.

   1. Respiratory failure:  He is currently tachypneic in the 30s-40s and

   his abrupt worsening of symptoms over 2 days, chills, yellow sputum,
   and CT findings.  Other causes of pneumonia (fungal/PCP) are less
   likely as he is not immunosuppressed.  Viral pneumonia is also possible
   but wouldn't expect the consolidation on CT.  Also of concern is that
   this could represent a worsening of his IPF, given that the past 2 days
   of increased dyspnea are on a background of a few weeks of worsening
   dyspnea.  Pulmonary edema is much less likely given the normal BNP and
   CT findings not suggestive of this.  There is concern he could have
   pulmonary hypertension due to his underlying lung disease as a cause of
   his hypoxia but he certainly has enough parenchymal findings on CT to
   explain this.  He does not have any signs of R heart failure on exam.
   The hemoptysis is likely due to infection but will closely monitor for

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who has developed acute respiratory failure. He is currently receiving pulse dose steroids with no improvement and has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/101 to 116/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88% on high-flow nasal cannula. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,119 mL and output of 2,800 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 681 mL. His respiratory support includes high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery.

The patient's ABG results indicate pH of 7.26, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 26 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 88 mmHg.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, crackles on lung auscultation, no edema in the extremities, and warm skin. Neurologic examination shows attentive behavior, purposeful movements, and response to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin (Hb) of 13.4 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) of 12.7 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) of 214 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose level of 179 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal range.

Chest X-ray shows bilateral diffuse opacification in the lower lung fields. The patient's sputum culture has been negative four times.

The assessment and plan include IPF with acute decompensation, receiving empiric solumedrol and antibiotics. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and high-dose supplemental oxygen are also being considered. The patient's weight issue and potential lung transplant listing should be discussed with the transplant service. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may be used if the patient tires or develops respiratory acidosis. The patient's code status remains DNR/DNI, and he is currently admitted to the ICU."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) who is experiencing progressive respiratory failure. He has been on pulse dose steroids without improvement and has a DNR/DNI code status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and empiric solumedrol and antibiotics. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 154/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 88%. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 213 mg/dL, and his white blood cell count has increased from 11.0 K/uL to 12.7 K/uL. His electrolytes show a slightly low potassium level of 3.1 mEq/L. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.26. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. The patient's neurologic examination shows that he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has purposeful movement. The patient's labs show elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and PT/PTT, with normal calcium and magnesium levels. The patient's microbiology results from sputum samples have been negative for four consecutive days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's progressive respiratory failure and low oxygen saturation indicate a high risk for worsening respiratory function. Close monitoring of oxygen levels and respiratory support may be necessary.
2. Infection: Despite negative sputum cultures, the patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible underlying infection. Continued surveillance for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic management are crucial.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 681 mL since midnight, indicating potential dehydration. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances and maintain adequate hydration.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level of 213 mg/dL indicates hyperglycemia. Tight glycemic control is important to prevent complications associated with elevated blood sugar levels.
5. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium level of 3.1 mEq/L requires careful monitoring and management to prevent cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
6. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities raise concerns for DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin should be continued to prevent thrombus formation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and baseline hypoxemia. He presents with worsening dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis. The patient's condition has been deteriorating despite treatment, and he is now requiring high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and showing signs of acute exacerbation of IPF. No evidence of infection is currently observed. The patient is being treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible community-acquired pneumonia and solu-medrol for worsening IPF. He is also started on N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for lung protection. Other medical conditions include chest pain, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The patient is currently in the ICU for critical care management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute exacerbation of IPF: The patient's worsening dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis indicate an acute exacerbation of IPF. This can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Respiratory failure: Due to the patient's baseline hypoxemia and worsening respiratory status, there is a risk of developing respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is necessary.
3. Pneumonia: Although the patient is being treated for possible community-acquired pneumonia, there is still a risk of developing pneumonia due to his compromised"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and baseline hypoxemia. He presents with worsening dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 141/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 84%. The patient is on high flow nasal cannula for respiratory support. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, and clear breath sounds with crackles. The patient has absent peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased hematocrit. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient is currently on comfort measures, including morphine for pain relief.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening dyspnea and low oxygen saturation indicate a potential risk of respiratory failure. The crackles heard during physical examination also suggest pulmonary congestion or worsening IPF.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has absent peripheral pulses, which may indicate peripheral vascular compromise. This increases the risk of developing DVT, especially considering the patient is immobile and in the ICU setting.

3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count could indicate an underlying infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with IPF and baseline hypoxemia who presents with worsening dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis. He has experienced a significant decline in clinical status overnight, with tachypnea, chest pain, and altered mental status. The main goal for the patient is comfort, and the focus will be on providing pain relief through a morphine drip. The patient's family has been updated on his change in status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, as indicated by the low oxygen saturation (84%) and crackles on auscultation. If not managed properly, there is a risk of progressing to respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. If left untreated, this could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs. Without prophylaxis, the patient may develop a DVT.

4. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient's critical illness and altered mental status increase the risk of stress ulcers in the stomach. If not given appropriate prophylaxis, the patient may develop gastrointestinal bleeding.

5. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's intubation and"
