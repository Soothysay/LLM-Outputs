","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, moderate aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation. She presented with cough, secretions, and difficulty walking, and was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory distress with fluid overload. She has been diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), as indicated by elevated troponin levels. The patient also has evidence of pulmonary edema, which may be related to her cardiac condition or fluid overload. She is currently receiving diuretics and morphine for symptom relief.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which can be attributed to pulmonary edema and cardiac ischemia. There is a need to closely monitor and manage her oxygenation and ventilation status.
2. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of low blood pressure, which may be due to overdiuresis, cardiogenic shock secondary to NSTEMI, or an infectious etiology. Gentle fluid boluses will be given as needed to maintain adequate blood pressure, while avoiding pulmonary edema. Dobutamine may be considered if the patient does not respond to fluid resuscitation.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia, likely exacerbated by respiratory distress. This should improve with treatment of underlying edema and potential infection.
4. Confusion/Weakness: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: Ms. [**Known lastname 7337**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with history of
   hypertension, mod aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation presenting with
   cough, secretions, difficulty walking transferred to the ICU after
   respiratory distress with fluid overload, now ruled in for NSTEMI.
   .
   #) Hypoxia/tachypnea: Differential includes likely pulmonary edema in
   the setting of ~2 L IV fluid and cardiac ischemia in the setting of AS
   and diastolic dysfunction. Patient with evidence of NSTEMI as ruled in
   by troponins, no significant EKG changes. Given ASA, not candidate for
   other intervention, troponin now trending down. Also treated for
   possible pneumonia as patient with sx of cough and secretions on
   admission in addition to concern for aspiration pneumonia/pnuemonitis.
   Received lasix and morphine [**5-1**]  with improvement in respiratory
   status. Echo shows EF 70%, LVH, mod AS, mild MR (but likely worsen,
   given shadows)
   - nebulizers
   - Repeat CXR, if negative will d/c levaquin
   - cultures negative to date
   .
   #) Hypotension: Concern for overdiuresis vs cardiogenic shock in
   setting of NSTEMI. Also would consider infectious etiology given cough
   at presentation and low grade fevers, however less likely. Given 250 cc
   bolus x 2 for SBPs in 70s with improvement in BP to 80/90s [**5-2**] and
   increase in urine output. Overnight SBPs improved 100s-130s and good
   UOP.
   - gentle fluid boluses as needed- will try to avoid pulmonary edema
   .
   #) Tachycardia: sinus tachycardia. Patient is on Diltiazem as
   outpatient. Likely worsened in the setting of respiratory distress.
   Improved with diuresis
   -holding dilt given hypotension
   .
   #) Confusion/weakness: Patient is alert, mentating well with SBPs
   70-80s. Mental status initially improved, more confused this morning.
   -repeat CXR to evaluate for pneumonia, if negative will d/c levaquin as
   this may be contributing to patient
s confusion
   .
   # diarrhea: Improved
   -send stool studies, C-diff if diarrhea
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a medical history of hypertension, moderate aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation. She presented with cough, secretions, and difficulty walking and was transferred to the ICU after experiencing respiratory distress with fluid overload. The patient has been ruled in for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and also has evidence of pneumonia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypoxia/tachypnea: The patient's respiratory distress and fluid overload may lead to pulmonary edema. Additionally, her cardiac ischemia due to aortic stenosis and diastolic dysfunction could also contribute to hypoxia. 

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to overdiuresis, cardiogenic shock in the setting of NSTEMI, or an infectious etiology. Gentle fluid boluses may be needed to maintain adequate blood pressure while avoiding pulmonary edema.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which could be a result of respiratory distress or the effects of diuresis. Holding diltiazem may be considered due to hypotension.

4. Confusion/weakness: The patient's mental status initially improved but has become more confused. Repeating CXR to evaluate for pneumonia and discontinuing levaquin if negative may help resolve this issue."

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Known Lastname 7337], a 90-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, moderate aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation, presented with cough, secretions, and difficulty walking. She was transferred to the ICU due to respiratory distress and fluid overload. The patient was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and treated accordingly. She also received lasix and morphine for respiratory improvement. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 70%, left ventricular hypertrophy, moderate aortic stenosis, and mild mitral regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypoxia/tachypnea: The patient's hypoxia and tachypnea could be due to pulmonary edema caused by the administration of approximately 2 liters of intravenous fluid, or it could be related to cardiac ischemia resulting from aortic stenosis and diastolic dysfunction. The patient has evidence of NSTEMI but no significant EKG changes. Troponin levels are now trending down. The patient is being treated for possible pneumonia as well, considering her symptoms of cough and secretions on admission.

2) Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to overdiuresis or cardiogenic shock in the setting of NSTEMI. There is also a possibility of an infectious etiology given her cough at presentation and low-grade"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension, moderate aortic stenosis, and mitral regurgitation. She presented with cough, secretions, and difficulty walking and was transferred to the ICU after experiencing respiratory distress with fluid overload. She was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ruled in for cardiac ischemia. The patient received lasix and morphine, showing improvement in respiratory status. An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 70%, left ventricular hypertrophy, moderate aortic stenosis, and mild mitral regurgitation. The patient was initially treated with levaquin for suspected pneumonia but was discontinued due to no obvious pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient's urine output improved after receiving an additional dose of lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient may experience hypoxia due to pulmonary edema caused by fluid overload and cardiac ischemia resulting from aortic stenosis and diastolic dysfunction.
2. Hypotension: The patient may be at risk of hypotension due to overdiuresis or cardiogenic shock in the setting of NSTEMI. Infectious etiology should also be considered.
3. Confusion/Weakness: The patient's mental status initially improved but became more delirious. Potential causes include medication-induced delirium, environmental factors, or infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT/PLAN: Ms. [**Known lastname 7337**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with history of
   hypertension, mod aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation presenting with
   cough, secretions, difficulty walking transferred to the ICU after
   respiratory distress with fluid overload, now ruled in for NSTEMI.
   .
   #) Hypoxia/tachypnea: Differential includes likely pulmonary edema in
   the setting of ~2 L IV fluid and cardiac ischemia in the setting of AS
   and diastolic dysfunction. Patient with evidence of NSTEMI as ruled in
   by troponins, no significant EKG changes. Given ASA, not candidate for
   other intervention, troponin now trending down. Also treated for
   possible pneumonia as patient with sx of cough and secretions on
   admission in addition to concern for aspiration pneumonia/pnuemonitis.
   Received lasix and morphine [**5-1**]  with improvement in respiratory
   status. Echo shows EF 70%, LVH, mod AS, mild MR (but likely worsen,
   given shadows). Initally received levaquin for ? pneumonia but d/c
   [**5-3**] as no obvious pneumonia on CXR. [**5-3**] received additional dose of
   lasix with 1.1 L urine output, net 620 cc net negative over 24 hours.
   - nebulizers
   - cultures negative to date
   - sputum cx
   .
   #) Hypotension: Concern for overdiuresis vs cardiogenic shock in
   setting of NSTEMI. Also would consider infectious etiology given cough
   at presentation and low grade fevers, however less likely. Given 250 cc
   bolus x 2 for SBPs in 70s with improvement in BP to 80/90s [**5-2**] and
   increase in urine output. [**5-3**] SBPs improved 100s-130s and good UOP.
   Overnight pressures stable.
   - gentle fluid boluses as needed- will try to avoid pulmonary edema
   - diltiazem being held in setting of hypotension
   .
   #) Confusion/weakness: Patient was alert, mentating well with SBPs
   70-80s. Mental status initially improved, became more delirious [**5-3**].
   Given haldol and zydis overnight.
   -levaquin d/c
d [**5-3**] due to concern it was contributing to patient
   confusion
   -continue to monitor for signs of infection

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and cardiac conditions, presenting with respiratory distress, cough, and difficulty walking. She was transferred to the ICU due to fluid overload and has been ruled in for NSTEMI (Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction). The patient's symptoms include hypoxia, tachypnea, confusion, weakness, and diarrhea. She is currently receiving treatment for possible pneumonia, cardiac ischemia, and overdiuresis. Her vital signs are stable, and she is receiving IV fluids and medications as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Tachypnea: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen levels could be due to pulmonary edema or cardiac ischemia. It is crucial to closely monitor her respiratory status and continue with appropriate interventions.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced low blood pressure, which may be related to overdiuresis, cardiogenic shock, or an infectious etiology. Gentle fluid boluses should be given as needed to maintain stable blood pressure while avoiding pulmonary edema.
3. Confusion/Weakness: The patient's mental status has fluctuated, initially improving but then becoming more delirious. This could be due to medication side effects or an underlying infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting medications accordingly is important.
4. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea has improved, but stool studies should still be sent to rule out any"
