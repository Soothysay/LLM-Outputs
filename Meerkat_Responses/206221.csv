","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes, colon cancer in remission, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. She was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of persistent altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing fevers, respiratory failure requiring minimal ventilator support, thrombocytopenia, anemia, acute renal failure, hematuria, and anemia with schistocytes on smear.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to sedating medications, hepatic encephalopathy, metastatic disease, encephalitis/meningitis, or TTP. Further evaluation is needed, including a lumbar puncture, parasitic workup, and increased dosing of lactulose and rifaximin.
2. Fevers: The patient's fevers could be caused by infection, TTP, or central causes. It is important to hold antibiotics for now, repeat cultures, consider ADAMTS13 and plasmapheresis if high suspicion of TTP, reassess the need for biliary drain, and check lactate levels.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on minimal vent support and reportedly passing daily spontaneous breathing trials. Continued monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has biopsy-proven cryptogenic cirrhosis, and a liver transplant consult should be obtained. The patient should continue to receive lact"

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 707 mL and output of 170 mL, with a negative balance of 537 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 7.3 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 70 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes including ALT and AST. Urinalysis reveals proteinuria and hematuria. 

The patient's imaging shows diffuse hazy opacities with right pleural effusion on chest X-ray. 

Assessment and plan include altered mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, sedating medication overload, metastatic disease, encephalitis/meningitis, or other infection. The patient is also febrile with a temperature of 38.3°C.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with cirrhosis of undetermined etiology, resolving ARDS, and persistent encephalopathy/delirium. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. The patient has a history of chronic thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus type I, decubitus ulcers (present at admission), and electrolyte/fluid disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy/Delirium: The patient's encephalopathy/delirium is persistent despite treatment. Further workup with a head CT and lumbar puncture is planned to rule out conditions like TTP/HUS. Lactulose will continue to be administered.
2. Cirrhosis: Consultation with hepatology is recommended for further evaluation and management of the patient's cirrhosis. A RUQ ultrasound with Dopplers will help confirm drain placement.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with current ventilator settings. Tracheostomy mask trials will be resumed once radiologic studies are complete.
4. Fevers: Antibiotics are being held, and cultures are being sent for biliary drain fluid. The PICC line from OSH will be replaced with a new line. Wound care consult is requested for decubitus ulcers.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved to"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo F with h/o diabetes, colon cancer in remission, cryptogenic
   cirrhosis, s/p long hospital course at [**Hospital3 4838**] now
   transferred for evaluation of persistant altered mental status.
   #.  Altered Mental Status: Differential: hepatic encephalopathy versus
   metastatic disease vs meningitis/encephalitis vs TTP vs delirium of
   underlying infection vs acute vascular event.  Most likely is hepatic
   encephalopathy given recent deterioration of hepatic function versus
   metastasis as per report appears to have recent omental metastasis.
   -For possibility of hepatic encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and
   rifaximin
   -For possibility of mening/encephalitis: LP today (ordered already
   under fluoroscopy given body habitus)
   -For possibility of TTP: heme consult to review smear given falling
   platelets, slowly rising coags, t-bili, schistos on smear, fevers, MS
   changes, renal failure.
   -MRI for evaluation of acute vasc event vs metastasis
   -Review OSH obtained from colorectal surgeon and from outpatient
   Hematologist-oncologist
   .
   #   Fevers: No leukocytosis.  Suspect infectious etiology: UTI given
   +UA versus sinusitis (per CT read) versus bacteremia vs biliary
   disease.  SBP less likely given minimal ascites and PNA less likely
   given absense of consolidation/infilatrate on CXR.
   -   Hold Abx for now
   -   repancultured yesterday; follow cultures
   -   fluid from biliary drain does not show any white cells, and gram
   stain negative; pending abdominal CT read, would pull biliary tube
   -   follow up abdominal CT read
   .
   #.  Respiratory Failure: On trach w/ FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5; barrier
   to extubation is mental status.
   -As long as mental status remains poor, would continue protected airway
   .
   #.  Cirrhosis: Biopsy proven, cryptogenic, considered due to fatty
   infiltration and chemo effects. No etoh history. No documentation of
   extent of workup.
   - Viral and autoimmune serologies
   - Liver recs for possibility of transplant.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaximin
   #.  Thrombocytopenia: Slight fall from 55 -> 47, has been relatively
   stable between 50 and 100.  Differential is portal HTN/hypersplenism
   related destruction versus consumption from possibility of TTP.
   - follow daily
   -F/u heme evaluation of smear
   #.  Coagulopathy: INR 1.6. likely complication of cirrhosis vs DIC. No
   evidence of active bleeding.
   -f/u FDP
   -follow heme evaluation of smear
   #.  Acute Renal Failure: Cr stable at 1.2, down from 1.4.  Likely ATN
   from sustained hypotension, resolving.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes, colon cancer in remission, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. She was admitted to the hospital for persistent altered mental status. The patient's medical history includes a long hospital stay at another hospital and recent deterioration in hepatic function. She has been transferred to the ICU for further evaluation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing persistent altered mental status, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, metastatic disease, meningitis/encephalitis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), delirium caused by underlying infection, or an acute vascular event. An MRI is recommended for evaluation of acute vascular events or metastasis. A lumbar puncture (LP) is planned under fluoroscopy to rule out meningitis/encephalitis. 
2. Fevers: The patient has fevers without leukocytosis, suggesting an infectious etiology. Possible sources of infection include urinary tract infection (UTI), sinusitis, bacteremia, or biliary disease. Cultures are pending, and the biliary drain fluid does not show any white cells or positive gram stain. 
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube. The main barrier to extubation is her mental status. 
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo F with h/o diabetes, colon cancer in remission, cryptogenic
   cirrhosis, s/p long hospital course at [**Hospital3 4838**] now
   transferred for evaluation of persistant altered mental status.
   #.  Altered Mental Status: Differential: hepatic encephalopathy versus
   metastatic disease vs meningitis/encephalitis vs TTP vs delirium of
   underlying infection vs acute vascular event.  Most likely is hepatic
   encephalopathy given recent deterioration of hepatic function versus
   metastasis as per report appears to have recent omental metastasis.
   -For possibility of hepatic encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and
   rifaximin
   -For possibility of mening/encephalitis: LP today; platelets and coags
   prior to procedure
   -For possibility of TTP: heme consult to review smear given falling
   platelets, slowly rising coags, t-bili, schistos on smear, fevers, MS
   changes, renal failure.
   -MRI for evaluation of acute vasc event vs metastasis
   -Review OSH obtained from colorectal surgeon and from outpatient
   Hematologist-oncologist
   .
   #   Fevers: No leukocytosis.  Suspect infectious etiology: UTI given
   +UA versus sinusitis (per CT read) versus bacteremia vs biliary
   disease.  SBP less likely given minimal ascites and PNA less likely
   given absense of consolidation/infilatrate on CXR.
   -   Hold Abx for now
   -   repancultured yesterday; follow cultures
   -   fluid from biliary drain does not show any white cells, and gram
   stain negative; keep drain in place for now
   -   follow up abdominal CT read
   .
   #.  Respiratory Failure: On trach w/ FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5; barrier
   to extubation is mental status.
   -As long as mental status remains poor, would continue protected airway
   .
   #.  Cirrhosis: Biopsy proven, cryptogenic, considered due to fatty
   infiltration and chemo effects. No etoh history. No documentation of
   extent of workup.
   - Viral and autoimmune serologies
   - Liver recs for possibility of transplant.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaximin
   #.  Thrombocytopenia: Slight fall from 55 -> 47, has been relatively
   stable between 50 and 100.  Differential is portal HTN/hypersplenism
   related destruction versus consumption from possibility of TTP.
   - follow daily
   -F/u heme evaluation of smear
   #.  Coagulopathy: INR 1.6. likely complication of cirrhosis vs DIC. No
   evidence of active bleeding.
   -f/u FDP
   -follow heme evaluation of smear
   #.  Acute Renal Failure: Cr stable at 1.2, down from 1.4.  Likely ATN
   from sustained hypotension, resolving.
   -Renal u/s
   -Continue to trend creatinines
   -Avoid nephrotoxic agents, hypoperfusion
   #.  Sacral decub ulcers
   -Wound consult
   #.  Diabetes: On ISS + lantus: sugars controlled from 100 - 200.
   #. FEN: Tube feeds with nutrition assistance, surgical consult re PEG
   in future. Lytes prn. No IVF

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes, colon cancer in remission, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. She was admitted to the ICU for persistent altered mental status. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C (101.4°F), blood pressure ranging from 117/33-136/55 mmHg, heart rate of 90 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is intubated and receiving supplemental oxygen.

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including possible hepatic encephalopathy, meningitis/encephalitis, TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura), delirium of underlying infection, and acute vascular event. She also has fevers with no leukocytosis, suggesting an infectious etiology such as UTI, sinusitis, bacteremia, or biliary disease. Additionally, the patient has respiratory failure, cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, acute renal failure, sacral decub ulcers, diabetes, and fecal incontinence.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, platelet count, liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, electrolytes, and coagulation profile. Imaging studies reveal no acute intracranial process and paranasal sinus disease."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with cirrhosis of unknown etiology, who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and encephalopathy/delirium. She has a history of chronic thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus type I, decubitus ulcers, electrolyte & fluid disorder, and altered mental status. The patient's condition includes resolving ARDS, tracheostomy, persistent encephalopathy/delirium, fevers, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. She has been sedated and unable to provide a history. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy/Delirium: The patient's ongoing encephalopathy/delirium requires further investigation and management. A head CT has been performed, but no acute process was found. A lumbar puncture (LP) is planned, and a head MRI will be ordered. Lactulose and rifaximin will continue to be administered.
2. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis needs to be addressed by hepatology. Further studies are pending, and the status of her colon cancer remains unclear. There is a suggestion of omental metastasis, and the oncology team will be consulted.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires continued ventilator support. Tracheostomy trials can be attempted given her tolerance at OSH.

   #.  Altered Mental Status: Differential: hepatic encephalopathy versus
   metastatic disease vs meningitis/encephalitis vs delirium of underlying
   infection vs acute vascular event.  Most likely is hepatic
   encephalopathy given recent deterioration of hepatic function versus
   metastasis as per report appears to have recent omental metastasis.
   -For possibility of hepatic encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and
   rifaximin
   -For possibility of mening/encephalitis:LP bland, f/u on LP cx;
   platelets and coags prior to procedure
   -For possibility of TTP: no schistocytes observed on smear
   -MRI for evaluation of acute vasc event vs metastasis - final read
   pending
   -Review OSH obtained from colorectal surgeon and from outpatient
   Hematologist-oncologist
   #   Fevers: No leukocytosis.  Suspect infectious etiology: UTI given
   +UA versus sinusitis (per CT read) vs biliary disease.  SBP less likely
   given minimal ascites and PNA less likely given absense of
   consolidation/infilatrate on CXR.  She could have a central process
   causing her fevers, but she developed a WBC to 11.5 yesterday around
   the time of her fever.
   -   Hold Abx for now
   -   repancultured yesterday; follow cultures
   -   fluid from biliary drain does not show any white cells, and gram
   stain negative; keep drain in place for now
   -   CT abdomen shows no signs of infection/malignancy
   - f/u MRI read
   #  Respiratory Failure: On trach w/ FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5; barrier
   to extubation is mental status.
   - sedation was increased due to patient agitation
   - attempt to wean sedation today with goal of weaning
   #.  Cirrhosis: Biopsy proven, cryptogenic, considered due to fatty
   infiltration and chemo effects. No etoh history. No documentation of
   extent of workup.
   - Viral and autoimmune serologies pending
   - Liver recs for possibility of transplant- not a candidate
   - Continue lactulose, rifaximin
   #.  Thrombocytopenia: Slight fall from 55 -> 47, has been relatively
   stable between 50 and 100.  Differential is portal HTN/hypersplenism
   related destruction versus consumption from possibility of TTP.
   - follow daily, transfusion goal < 10
   #.  Coagulopathy: INR 1.6. likely complication of cirrhosis. No
   evidence of active bleeding.
   -follow heme evaluation of smear shows no schistocytes
   #.  Acute Renal Failure: Cr stable at 1.0, down from 1.4.  Likely ATN
   from sustained hypotension, resolving.
   - follow UOP, maintain SBP > 90, give IVF as needed to maintain UOP
   -Continue to trend creatinines

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes, colon cancer in remission, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. She was admitted for evaluation of persistent altered mental status. The patient has a long hospital course at another hospital and is now being transferred. She has multiple medical complications including fever, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered mental status, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and sacral decubitus ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has had persistent fevers, but no clear source of infection has been identified yet. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the fever.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on a ventilator with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5. There are concerns about extubation due to the patient's mental status. Weaning of sedation will be attempted today.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is stable at 1.0, down from 1.4. It is likely due to acute tubular necrosis from sustained hypotension, which is resolving.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has a history of altered mental status, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, metastatic disease, meningitis/encephalitis, delirium caused by an underlying infection, or an acute vascular event. An MRI is"

   transferred for evaluation of persistant altered mental status.
   #.  Altered Mental Status: Differential: hepatic encephalopathy versus
   metastatic disease vs meningitis/encephalitis vs delirium of underlying
   infection vs acute vascular event.  Most likely is hepatic
   encephalopathy given recent deterioration of hepatic function.
   -For possibility of hepatic encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and
   rifaximin
   -For possibility of mening/encephalitis:LP bland, f/u on LP cx;
   platelets and coags prior to procedure
   -For possibility of TTP: no schistocytes observed on smear
   -MRI for evaluation of acute vasc event vs metastasis - final read
   pending
   #   Fevers: Not developed significant leukocytosis.  Concern that this
   infection may be related to her acute mental status changes.  Suspect
   infectious etiology:  ddx includes  UTI given +UA , sinusitis (per CT
   read) , SBP,  pneumonia.  No strong evidence to support any of the
   above.
   -   Hold Abx for now
   -   repancultured yesterday, blood, urine, sputum, and percutaneous
   fluid.
   -   fluid from biliary drain does not show any white cells, and gram
   stain negative; keep drain in place for now
   -   CT abdomen shows no signs of infection/malignancy
   -    f/u MRI read
   #  Respiratory Failure: On trach w/ FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5; barrier
   to extubation is mental status.
   - sedation was increased due to patient agitation, try to decrease
   sedation and extubate today.
   #.  Cirrhosis: Biopsy proven, cryptogenic, considered due to fatty
   infiltration and chemo effects. No etoh history. No documentation of
   extent of workup.
   - Viral and autoimmune serologies pending
   - Talk to liver about repeating bx
   - Continue lactulose, rifaximin
   #.  Thrombocytopenia: stable between 50 and 100.  Also likely due to
   underlying cirrhosis
   - follow daily, transfusion goal < 10
   #.  Coagulopathy: INR 1.6. likely complication of cirrhosis. No
   evidence of active bleeding.
   - follow daily coags
   #.  Acute Renal Failure: Cr stable at 1.0, down from 1.4.  Likely ATN
   from sustained hypotension, resolving.
   - follow UOP, maintain SBP > 90, avoid fluids given weaning vent
   - Continue to trend creatinines
   -Avoid nephrotoxic agents, hypoperfusion
   #Hypernatremia - from volume resucitation and inability to take po
   - Continue giving NS for volume

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes, colon cancer in remission, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. She was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of persistent altered mental status. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, hypernatremia, sacral decub ulcers, and diabetes. She is currently on various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, antivirals, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's persistent altered mental status could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, meningitis/encephalitis, delirium caused by an underlying infection, prolonged clearance of sedation, metastasis, or an acute vascular event. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on a ventilator with a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). She requires tracheal intubation for airway protection but was previously doing well with mask trials. Weaning off the ventilator may be attempted today.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient has biopsy-proven cryptogenic cirrhosis, likely due to fatty infiltration and chemotherapy effects. She is not a candidate for liver transplantation due to a history of metastatic colon cancer within the past five years.

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes, colon cancer in remission, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. She has been admitted to the ICU for evaluation of persistent altered mental status. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, hypernatremia, sacral decub ulcers, diabetes, and potential complications from her medical history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, meningitis/encephalitis, delirium caused by an underlying infection, prolonged clearance of sedation, metastasis, or an acute vascular event. Further evaluation and testing are needed to determine the exact cause.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation support with a tracheostomy tube. There is a need to attempt mask trials and further wean the ventilator settings.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has biopsy-proven cryptogenic cirrhosis, which may lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy. Management includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin and evaluating viral and autoimmune serologies.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes, colon cancer in remission, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. She was admitted for persistent altered mental status. The patient has been improving over the last several days, showing more alertness and openness of eyes. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on tracheostomy ventilation with FiO2 of 40% and PSV of 10/5. There have been attempts to discontinue ventilation and trial a vent mask.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated levels of creatinine and BUN.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is showing improvement but still has altered mental status. Differential diagnosis includes hepatic encephalopathy, meningitis/encephalitis, prolonged clearance of sedation, metastasis, or acute vascular event.
4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has hypernatremia due to volume resuscitation and inability to take oral fluids.
5. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has three stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcers.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, likely due to underlying cirrhosis.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, likely a complication of cirrhosis.

   #.  Altered Mental Status: Patient
s mental status has been improving.
   Likely multifactorial due to hepatic encephalopathy and prolonged
   clearance of sedation.  However, still considering
   meningitis/encephalitis vs metastasis/carcinomatous meningitis.
   However, no clear infectious cause has been found.
   - Given rash on face and positive serum antibody to HSV2, on acyclovir
   day 5 of 7.
   - possible role of poor nutritional status considering recent lap band,
   though folate and B12 normal.  Will start thiamine.
   - hepatic encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - mening/encephalitis: LP bland.  HSV PCR neg, EEE and West [**Doctor First Name **]
   negative.
   - All cultures negative to date.
   #. Cirrhosis: Continues to have active liver inflammation and rising
   bilirubin.  Perc chole drain pulled yesterday, but trend started
   before.  Unclear source of continued inflammation or acute change.
   Underlying process is biopsy proven, cryptogenic, considered due to
   fatty infiltration and chemo effects.
   - Hemolysis labs were positive, but her hematocrit has been stable.
   Haptoglobin level more likely due to decreased liver production.  Will
   continue to tren hematocrit.
   - Will talk to liver team about cause for worsening liver function.
   Maybe another biopsy would be helpful.
   - Hep B non-immune, Hep C neg, Hep A IgG +ve, IgM pending. [**Doctor First Name **] and
   antiTPO negative.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - Not a transplant candidate given metastatic colon cancer history w/ <
   5 yrs from colectomy and diagnosis
   #  Respiratory Failure: On trach w/ FiO2 of 50% , PSV 10/5.  Yesterday
   she did well with trach mask for most of the day, and only went back on
   pressure support to go for a procedure.  Diuresis seems to have helped.
   - Continue diuresis with lasix boluses with goal I/O of -1 to 1.5L
   today.  We will check [**Hospital1 **] lytes.
   - Continue trach mask trials as much as possible.
   #.  Diabetes: On ISS + lantus: sugars controlled from 100 - 200.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes, colon cancer in remission, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. She was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of persistent altered mental status. The patient's mental status has been improving but may be due to hepatic encephalopathy and prolonged clearance of sedation. Other potential causes such as meningitis/encephalitis or metastasis/carcinomatous meningitis are still being considered. The patient is on acyclovir for a rash on her face and positive serum antibody to HSV2. She also has poor nutritional status, which may be contributing to her condition. Thiamine supplementation is being started. The patient's liver function continues to worsen despite the removal of the percutaneous cholecystostomy tube. Active liver inflammation and rising bilirubin levels indicate ongoing liver issues. Hemolysis labs were positive, but her hematocrit has been stable. Haptoglobin levels are likely decreased due to decreased liver production. A repeat liver biopsy may be helpful in determining the underlying cause. The patient has stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcers and is receiving wound care and flexiseal for stool. She is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics for potential infections, including DVT and VAP. The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with a tracheostomy and pressure support ventilation (PSV). Her diabetes is well-controlled with insulin. Thromboc"

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes, colon cancer in remission, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and a prolonged hospital stay at another hospital. She was transferred for evaluation of persistent altered mental status. The patient has shown some improvement but still requires further evaluation to determine the cause of her altered mental status, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged sedation, meningitis/encephalitis, or metastasis/carcinomatous meningitis. 

She has several medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, altered nutrition, decubitus ulcer, diabetes mellitus type I, electrolyte & fluid disorder, and thrombocytopenia. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 114/35 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's plan of care includes continuing lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, performing a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis/encephalitis, following up on blood cultures, blood, urine, sputum cultures, and serologies. 

She will also continue to have trials of the tracheostomy"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes, colon cancer in remission, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. She was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of persistent altered mental status.

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, alteration in nutrition, altered mental status (not delirium), decubitus ulcer, diabetes mellitus (type I), electrolyte & fluid disorder, and thrombocytopenia. These conditions are summarized below:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on a tracheostomy with a FiO2 of 50% and PSV 10/5. Trials of the trach mask have been done.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output.

3. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient requires nutritional support due to her altered mental status and decreased oral intake.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has moderate encephalopathy on EEG, likely multifactorial due to hepatic encephalopathy and prolonged clearance of sedation. Meningitis/encephalitis vs metastasis/carcinomatous meningitis is still being considered.

5. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a stage II ulcer on the right gluteal area. Wound care and flexiseal for stool are recommended.

   cirrhosis, s/p long hospital course at [**Hospital3 4838**] now
   transferred for evaluation of persistant altered mental status.
   #.  Altered Mental Status: Patient
s mental status has been improving.
   Likely multifactorial due to hepatic encephalopathy and prolonged
   clearance of sedation.  Unlikely meningitis/encephalitis given no clear
   infectious cause has been found.  CSF cytology negative making
   metastasis/carcinomatous meningitis unlikely.
   - Given rash on face and positive serum antibody to HSV2, on acyclovir
   day 7 of 7?
   - possible role of poor nutritional status considering recent lap band,
   though folate and B12 normal, thiamine started
   - hepatic encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - mening/encephalitis: LP bland.  HSV PCR neg, EEE and West [**Doctor First Name **]
   negative.
   - All cultures negative to date.
   #. Cirrhosis: Continues to have active liver inflammation and rising
   bilirubin.  Perc chole drain pulled.  Per liver progression of
   underlying disease.  Underlying process is biopsy proven, cryptogenic,
   considered due to fatty infiltration and chemo effects. -Hep B
   non-immune, Hep C neg, Hep A IgG +ve, IgM pending. [**Doctor First Name **] and antiTPO
   negative.

   - Continue trach mask trials as much as possible.
   #.  Diabetes: On ISS + lantus: sugars controlled from 100 - 200.
   #. Thrombocytopenia: stable between 50 and 100.  Likely due to
   underlying cirrhosis
   - follow daily, transfusion goal < 10
   #. Coagulopathy: Stable.  Likely complication of cirrhosis.
   -  follow daily
   #. Anemia - Hemolysis labs were positive, but her hematocrit has been
   stable.  Haptoglobin level more likely due to decreased liver
   production.
   - Trend hematocrit
   #Hypernatremia - from volume resucitation and inability to take po, Na
   stable at 145 today, deficit ~2L
   - received 1L free water bolus this morning.

   #. Cirrhosis: Continues to have active liver inflammation and rising
   bilirubin.  Perc chole drain pulled.  Per liver progression of
   underlying disease.  Underlying process is biopsy proven, cryptogenic,
   considered due to fatty infiltration and chemo effects. -Hep B

   evaluation

   #.  Diabetes: On ISS + lantus: sugars controlled from 100 - 200.
   #. Thrombocytopenia: stable between 50 and 100.  Likely due to
   underlying cirrhosis
   - follow daily, transfusion goal < 10
   #. Coagulopathy: Stable.  Likely complication of cirrhosis.
   -  follow daily
   #. Anemia - Hemolysis labs were positive, but her hematocrit has been
   stable.  Haptoglobin level more likely due to decreased liver
   production.
   - Trend hematocrit

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes, colon cancer in remission, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. She was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of persistent altered mental status. The patient's mental status has been improving, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy and prolonged clearance of sedation. Infectious causes have been ruled out, including meningitis/encephalitis and metastasis/carcinomatous meningitis.

The patient also has cirrhosis with ongoing liver inflammation and rising bilirubin levels. The percutaneous chole drain was removed, and she is not a candidate for liver transplantation due to a history of metastatic colon cancer within the past five years.

She experienced respiratory failure but did well with a tracheostomy mask. Diuresis seems to have helped, and she should continue with tracheostomy mask trials as much as possible.

The patient's urine output has decreased, and her creatinine levels are stable. She has significant peripheral edema, so fluid administration needs to be carefully managed to avoid pulmonary congestion.

She has RUQ pain at the site of a previous percutaneous chole drain, which could be related to trauma from pulling the drain. Imaging is needed for further evaluation.

Her diabetes is controlled with insulin, and her thrombocytopenia is likely due to underlying cirrhosis. She has coagulopathy, anemia with hemolysis,"

   transferred for evaluation of persistant altered mental status.
   #.  Altered Mental Status: Patient
s mental status was improving but
   appears to have plateaued despite aggressive management of
   encephalopathy.  While she is responsive and can perform simple
   commands, she is not interactive.  Likely primarily due to hepatic
   encephalopathy at this point, but unclear why her initial onset of
   encephalopathy would be so refractory.  All other work-up negative to
   date, including negative urine benzos and barbiturates.  EEG consistent
   w/ hepatic encephalopathy and neurology has signed off.
   - hepatic encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Given rash on face and positive serum antibody to HSV2, completed
   7-day course of acyclovir.
   - On thiamine because of recent lap band and possible malnutrition.
   #. Cirrhosis: Continues to have active liver inflammation and rising
   bilirubin.  Perc chole drain pulled.  Per liver this represents
   progression of underlying cryptogenic cirrhosis due to fatty
   infiltration and chemo effects.  HAV IgM negative.  Family considering
   moving towards hospice care vs. more aggressive rehab.  Will be back
   today.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaximin and nadolol.
   - Not a transplant candidate given metastatic colon cancer history w/ <
   5 yrs from colectomy and diagnosis
   #. Oliguria: UOP dropped to 20-30cc/hr with stable creatinine and
   slowly rising BUN.  Did not respond to two boluses of 50mg of albumin.
   Clinically intravascularly dry but want to avoid giving fluids as the
   benefit will likely be transitory.  Most fluid going to peritoneum.
   #. RUQ pain: Grimaces with palpation of RUQ at site of previous perc
   chole drain likely due to trauma from pulling drain.  RUQ ultrasound
   did not show any changes and abdominal CT is unlikely to contribute
   more information.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Now stabilized with trach mask.  Diuresis seems
   to have helped.
   #.  Diabetes: Sugars poorly controlled yesterday on ISS + lantus.
   - Increase QHS lantus dose to 43 units
   #. Thrombocytopenia, anemia and coagulopathy: all stable.  Likely due
   to cirrhosis.
   - Continue to trend and transfuse as needed.
   #.  Hypernatremia - from volume resucitation and inability to take po,
   Na stable at 145 for several days with 150ml free water boluses Q6hrs.
   Will continue to monitor.
   #.  Sacral decub ulcers

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes, colon cancer in remission, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. She was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of persistent altered mental status. The patient's mental status was initially improving but has plateaued despite aggressive management of encephalopathy. She is responsive and can perform simple commands but is not interactive. This is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, although the initial onset of encephalopathy is unclear. Other work-up has been negative, including negative urine benzos and barbiturates. EEG is consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, and neurology has signed off.

The patient's liver condition continues to worsen, with active liver inflammation and rising bilirubin. The percutaneous cholecystitis drain was removed, and the family is considering moving towards hospice care instead of more aggressive rehabilitation. The patient is not a candidate for liver transplantation due to a history of metastatic colon cancer within the past five years.

The patient also has oliguria with a urine output of 20-30cc/hr, stable creatinine, and slowly rising BUN. She did not respond to two boluses of albumin. Clinically, she is intravascularly dry but wants to avoid giving fluids as the benefit will likely be transient. Most fluid is going to the peritoneum.

   55 yo F with h/o diabetes, colon cancer in remission, cryptogenic
   cirrhosis, s/p long hospital course at [**Hospital3 4838**] now
   transferred for evaluation of persistant altered mental status.
   #.  Altered Mental Status: Patient
s mental status was improving but
   appears to have plateaued despite aggressive management of
   encephalopathy.  While she is responsive and can perform simple
   commands, she is not interactive.  Likely primarily due to hepatic
   encephalopathy at this point, but unclear why her initial onset of
   encephalopathy would be so refractory.  All other work-up negative to
   date, including negative urine benzos and barbiturates.  EEG consistent
   w/ hepatic encephalopathy and neurology has signed off.
   - hepatic encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Given rash on face and positive serum antibody to HSV2, completed
   7-day course of acyclovir.
   - On thiamine because of recent lap band and possible malnutrition.
   #. Cirrhosis: Continues to have active liver inflammation and rising
   bilirubin.  Perc chole drain pulled.  Per liver this represents
   progression of underlying cryptogenic cirrhosis due to fatty
   infiltration and chemo effects.  HAV IgM negative.  Family considering
   moving towards hospice care vs. more aggressive rehab.  Will be back
   today.
   - Continue lactulose, rifaximin and nadolol.
   - Not a transplant candidate given metastatic colon cancer history w/ <
   5 yrs from colectomy and diagnosis
   #. Oliguria: UOP dropped to 20-30cc/hr with stable creatinine and
   slowly rising BUN.  Did not respond to two boluses of 50mg of albumin.
   Clinically intravascularly dry but want to avoid giving fluids as the
   benefit will likely be transitory.  Most fluid going to peritoneum.
   #. RUQ pain: Grimaces with palpation of RUQ at site of previous perc
   chole drain likely due to trauma from pulling drain.  RUQ ultrasound
   did not show any changes and abdominal CT is unlikely to contribute
   more information.
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure: Now stabilized with trach mask.  Diuresis seems
   to have helped.
   #.  Diabetes: Sugars poorly controlled yesterday on ISS + lantus.
   - Increase QHS lantus dose to 43 units
   #. Thrombocytopenia, anemia and coagulopathy: all stable.  Likely due
   to cirrhosis.
   - Continue to trend and transfuse as needed.
   #.  Hypernatremia - from volume resucitation and inability to take po,
   Na stable at 145 for several days with 150ml free water boluses Q6hrs.
   Will continue to monitor.
   #.  Sacral decub ulcers
 has Stage II ulcer on right gluteal. Wound
   consult following.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes, colon cancer in remission, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. She was admitted for evaluation of persistent altered mental status. The patient's mental status initially improved but has plateaued despite aggressive management of encephalopathy. She is responsive and can perform simple commands, but is not interactive. The work-up has been negative, including negative urine benzos and barbiturates, with an EEG consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. 

The patient continues to have active liver inflammation and rising bilirubin, indicating progression of underlying cryptogenic cirrhosis due to fatty infiltration and chemo effects. Hepatitis A IgM negative. The family is considering moving towards hospice care vs. more aggressive rehab. 

The patient's oliguria did not respond to two boluses of albumin. She has respiratory failure now stabilized with a tracheostomy. Her diabetes is poorly controlled. She has thrombocytopenia, anemia, and coagulopathy likely due to cirrhosis. 

The patient has hypernatremia from volume resuscitation and inability to take oral fluids. She has sacral decubitus ulcers, stage II on the right gluteal region. A wound consult has been ordered.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of diabetes, colon cancer in remission, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. She has been admitted to the ICU for evaluation of persistent altered mental status. The patient's mental status has plateaued and is likely primarily due to hepatic encephalopathy. Other work-up has been negative, including negative urine benzos and barbiturates. She has completed a course of acyclovir for possible HSV2 infection. Her nutritional status is poor, considering recent lap band placement, although folate and B12 levels are normal. Thiamine has been started. The patient's cirrhosis continues with active liver inflammation and rising bilirubin. Her percutaneous chole drain was pulled, and she is not a transplant candidate due to metastatic colon cancer history. The patient is oliguric with a urine output of 20-30cc/hr despite stable creatinine and slowly rising BUN. She exhibits RUQ pain likely due to trauma from pulling the drain, and her respiratory failure is now stabilized with a tracheostomy. Her diabetes is well-controlled on ISS and lantus. Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy are stable, likely due to underlying cirrhosis. Anemia and hypernatremia are also present. She has sacral decubitus ulcers, and a wound consult has been ordered. She is on broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis"

   55 yo F with h/o diabetes, colon cancer in remission, cryptogenic
   cirrhosis, s/p long hospital course at [**Hospital3 4838**] now
   transferred for evaluation of persistant altered mental status.
   #.  Altered Mental Status: Patient
s mental status has been improving.
   Likely multifactorial due to hepatic encephalopathy and prolonged
   clearance of sedation.  Unlikely meningitis/encephalitis given no clear
   infectious cause has been found.  CSF cytology negative making
   metastasis/carcinomatous meningitis unlikely. All cultures negative to
   date.
   - Given rash on face and positive serum antibody to HSV2, on acyclovir
   day 7 of 7?
   - possible role of poor nutritional status considering recent lap band,
   though folate and B12 normal, thiamine started
   - hepatic encephalopathy: Continue lactulose and rifaximin
   - Check urine benzos to eval if meds are contributing to mental status
   #. Cirrhosis: Continues to have active liver inflammation and rising
   bilirubin.  Perc chole drain pulled.  Per liver progression of
   underlying disease.  Underlying process is biopsy proven, cryptogenic,
   considered due to fatty infiltration and chemo effects. -Hep B
   non-immune, Hep C neg, Hep A IgG +ve, IgM pending. [**Doctor First Name **] and antiTPO
   negative.
   - Nadalol started
   - Continue lactulose, rifaximin
   - Not a transplant candidate given metastatic colon cancer history w/ <
   5 yrs from colectomy and diagnosis
   #. Respiratory Failure: Did well with trach mask for most of the day.
   Diuresis seems to have helped.
   - Continue trach mask trials as much as possible.
   #. Oliguria: UOP dropped to 30cc/hr.  Cr stable.  Clinically
   intravascularly dry but want to avoid excessive fluids as she has
   significant peripheral edema and want to avoid pulmonary congestion.
   - Albumin 50mg and eval UOP
   #. RUQ pain: Appeared to be in pain on physical exam.  At site of
   previous perc chole drain, could be related to trauma from pulling
   drain.  LFTs have been stable making worsening hepatitis or
   cholecystitis less likely, however will need imaging for further
   evaluation
   - RUQ
   #.  Diabetes: On ISS + lantus: sugars controlled from 100 - 200.
   #. Thrombocytopenia: stable between 50 and 100.  Likely due to
   underlying cirrhosis
   - follow daily, transfusion goal < 10
   #. Coagulopathy: Stable.  Likely complication of cirrhosis.
   -  follow daily
   #. Anemia - Hemolysis labs were positive, but her hematocrit has been
   stable.  Haptoglobin level more likely due to decreased liver
   production.
   - Trend hematocrit
   #.  Hypernatremia - from volume resucitation and inability to take po,
   Na stable at 145 today, deficit ~2L
   - received 1L free water bolus this morning.
   #.  Sacral decub ulcers
 has Stage II ulcer on right gluteal. Wound
   consult recommends wound care and flexiseal for stool.
   #. FEN:  Dobhoff placed by IR yesterday, now getting TF
   - Lytes prn.
   #. PPX:
   -   DVT ppx with SC Heparin
   -   Bowel regimen Lactulose, Rifaximin
   -   Pain management with Tylenol
