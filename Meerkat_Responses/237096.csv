   CXR: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The double-lumen right
   central venous line tip is in mid SVC. There is interval improvement in
   the right lower lobe linear opacity consistent with partial resolution
   of atelectasis.  Still present is right pleural effusion. No
   pneumothorax is demonstrated.
   CT-ABD: (PRELIM) 1. No evidence of mesenteric ischemia.  2. Evidence of
   third spacing, including total body wall edema. Bilateral  right
   greater than left pleural effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  55yo woman with ESRD and h/o C diff admitted with hypotension in
   the setting of diarrhea.
   # Hypotension: Was initially fluid responsive, then continued to have
   SBPs in the 70-80s and was started on low dose Levophed. Likely
   secondary to combination of vomiting, diarrhea, and dialysis and
   possibly infection/sepsis.  Pt [**Name (NI) 1016**] POS, though should also consider
   line infection, pneumonia, SBP.  She did have a fever recently and a
   leukocytosis on presentation, so will continue with empiric broad
   coverage antibiotics overnight.
   - attempt to wean off of Levo
   - cautious IV fluids to maintain MAP > 65 and assist weaning pressors
   - f/u blood Cx, stool Cx, PD fluid cell count and Cx
   - Continue IV vanc and flagyl
   - Given age, hypotension requiring pressors, ICU level of care and
   repeat C-diff (i.e failure of therapy) will initiate PO VANC
   # Abdominal pain: Given her hypotension and risk factors for vascular
   disease, would be concerned for bowel ischemia. Also possible SBP or PD
   fluid infection. Prelim read of CT reassuring.
   - monitor serial lactates overnight
   - monitor abdominal exam closely
   - low threshold for CT abdomen
   # Diarrhea: Has persisted over 3 months. Given POS C-diff, likely has
   had chronic infection w/ exacerbations. Will treat as above.
   # Cyanotic fingers:
   Most likely Raynaud's given history.  Has questionnable h/o lupus in
   the past, which would increase chance of Raynaud's.
   - recommend rheum f/u as outpatient
   - OT consult
   - treatment for Raynaud's (calcium channel blockers), which would be
   contraindicated given her current hypotension
   # s/p fall:
   Most likely secondary to dizziness from hypotension.
   - PT consult
   - no evidence of knee injury on exam
   # ESRD on HD and PD:
   Last HD on Monday.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold phos binder given low calcium and phos
   # Coagulopathy:
   On warfarin for h/o SVC syndrome, currently supratherapeutic.  Note
   that she has h/o bleed into gluteal muscle while on heparin IV and that
   RP bleed might explain her abdominal pain and hypotension.
   - type and screen
   - follow coags and Hct overnight
   - no indication for vitamin K or FFP at present
   - hold coumadin for now, restart when back in therapeutic range.
   # HTN:  Holding meds given low BP
   # h/o SVC syndrome:
   - elevated INR at present
   - monitor coags and exam
   # Right hip pain and left shoulder pain:  Chronic
   - tylenol 1000 TID
   - oxycodone for breakthrough pain
   # Left renal cyst:
   Identified during hospital stay in [**7-/2128**], MRI recommended for further
   follow-up.
   - discussed with patient's nephrologist; he is aware of need for MRI
   # Asthma:  albuterol PRN
   # Anemia: baseline hct 25-31, current Hct 30
   Most likely due to ESRD, but reportedly also has h/o iron deficiency
   anemia.
   - follow Hct as discussed above
   - pt signed blood consent
   # OSA: continue CPAP
   # Depression and anxiety:
   - continue home celexa and ativan.
   # FEN:  hold phos binder for now given low Ca and Phos
   # PPx: on warfarin; famotidine while in ICU
   # Access:  Left femoral placed in ED [**8-25**], right subclavian HD
   catheter, left PIV.
   # Code:  confirmed FULL
   # Comm:  with [**Name2 (NI) 5738**] [**Name (NI) 112**] [**Name (NI) 5739**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5740**]; [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5741**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5243**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5742**] is secondary contact
   # Dispo:  anticipate to floor if hemodynamically stable in AM

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for hypotension in the setting of diarrhea. She is currently on low-dose norepinephrine for persistent hypotension, which is not responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient has a positive stool culture for C. diff and has been experiencing diarrhea for the past three months. Her abdominal pain is likely secondary to vomiting, diarrhea, dialysis, possible infection/sepsis, and potentially bowel ischemia. She has a history of lupus, which increases the likelihood of Raynaud's disease, and her fingers are cyanotic. The patient also has a history of bleeding while on heparin IV and warfarin, indicating a coagulopathy. Her INR is currently supratherapeutic, and she is on warfarin for a history of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 67 beats per minute, blood pressure of 81/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. She is on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient's laboratory results show"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  55yo woman with ESRD and h/o C diff admitted with hypotension in
   the setting of diarrhea.
   # Cyanotic fingers:
   Most likely Raynaud's given history.  Has questionnable h/o lupus in
   the past, which would increase chance of Raynaud's.
   - recommend rheum f/u as outpatient
   - OT consult
   - treatment for Raynaud's (calcium channel blockers)
   # Hypotension:
   Has been fluid responsive.  Suspect this is secondary to combination of
   vomiting, diarrhea, and dialysis.  Most likely source is C diff, but
   would also consider line infection, pneumonia, SBP.  She did have a
   fever recently and a leukocytosis on presentation, so will continue
   with empiric broad coverage antibiotics overnight.
   - IV fluids to maintain MAP > 60
   - blood Cx, stool Cx, C diff, PA/lat CXR, cell count and Cx on
   peritoneal fluid
   - broad spectrum Abx with zosyn/vanc for now and flagyl for possible C
   diff.
   # Abdominal pain:
   Given her hypotension and risk factors for vascular disease, would be
   concerned for bowel ischemia.
   - monitor serial lactates overnight
   - monitor abdominal exam closely
   - low threshold for CT abdomen
   # Diarrhea:
   Has persisted over 3 months.  Will pursue infectious work-up for now,
   but if that is negative, she made need stool studies and GI consult.
   # s/p fall:
   Most likely secondary to dizziness from hypotension.
   - PT consult
   - no evidence of knee injury on exam
   # ESRD on HD and PD:
   Last HD on Monday.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold phos binder given low calcium and phos
   # Coagulopathy:
   On warfarin for h/o SVC syndrome, currently supratherapeutic.  Note
   that she has h/o bleed into gluteal muscle while on heparin IV and that
   RP bleed might explain her abdominal pain and hypotension.
   - type and screen
   - follow coags and Hct overnight
   - no indication for vitamin K or FFP at present
   # HTN:  Holding meds given low BP
   # h/o SVC syndrome:
   - elevated INR at present
   - monitor coags and exam
   # Right hip pain and left shoulder pain:  Chronic
   - tylenol 1000 TID
   - oxycodone for breakthrough pain
   # Left renal cyst:
   Identified during hospital stay in [**7-/2128**], MRI recommended for further
   follow-up.
   - discussed with patient's nephrologist; he is aware of need for MRI
   # Asthma:  albuterol PRN
   # Anemia: baseline hct 25-31, current Hct 30
   Most likely due to ESRD, but reportedly also has h/o iron deficiency
   anemia.
   - follow Hct as discussed above
   - pt signed blood consent
   # OSA: continue CPAP
   # Depression and anxiety:
   - continue home celexa and ativan.
   # FEN:  hold phos binder for now given low Ca and Phos
   # PPx: on warfarin; famotidine while in ICU
   # Access:  Left femoral placed in ED [**8-25**], right subclavian HD
   catheter, left PIV.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection admitted to the MICU-6 with hypotension. She was started on Levophed for persistent hypotension not responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF). Stool culture was positive for C. diff. The patient also has a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, and depression.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 81/53 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg, central venous pressure (CVP) of 5 mmHg, and urine output of 305 mL in the past 24 hours.

Physical examination reveals diffuse abdominal tenderness, especially in the right lower quadrant, without rebound tenderness or peritoneal signs. The patient has external hemorrhoids and a small amount of liquid brown stool, which is guaiac-negative. She has trace lower extremity edema and cyanotic fingers, likely due to Raynaud's phenomenon. Her radial and dorsalis pedis pulses are trace bilaterally. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), presenting with hypotension and abdominal pain. The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and is currently on IV Flagyl and oral Vancomycin. He also has chronic anemia and a history of superior vena cava syndrome (SVC). The patient's vital signs are stable, but he requires low-dose levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60. The patient's blood cultures have been obtained, and further investigations are planned to rule out any infectious sources, including peritoneal dialysis infection. The patient's coagulopathy is being managed by holding Coumadin and providing vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for active bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to a combination of factors such as severe diarrhea from C. diff, aggressive PD, and HD. Monitoring for fluid responsiveness and maintaining MAP of 60 with levophed are crucial. Lactate levels should be trended to assess tissue perfusion, and infectious sources should be ruled out, including PD infection.
2. C. diff colitis: The patient is already on IV Flagyl and oral Vancomycin, which are appropriate treatments for C. diff."

","The patient is a 55-year-old with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), presenting with hypotension and abdominal pain. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors:

1. Hypotension: The patient initially responded to fluid resuscitation but required low-dose Levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60. The plan is to wean off Levophed and trend lactate levels to rule out any infectious sources, including peritoneal dialysis infection.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient was started on IV Flagyl and PO Vancomycin. The abdominal examination remains stable, and a final read of the abdominal CT will be done. A surgical consult will be obtained if the patient deteriorates.

3. ESRD: PD will be resumed today.

4. Coagulopathy: Coumadin is being held, and there are no signs of active bleeding at present. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) is stable, and the INR will be trended. IV vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) will be administered for active bleeding. A non-contrast abdominal CT will be done to look for retroperitoneal bleed or other causes of bleeding.

5. Remaining issues will be addressed according to the housestaff notes.

1. Infection: The patient's history of C. difficile infection and the presence of fever suggest a possible ongoing infection. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate potential kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  55yo woman with ESRD and h/o C diff admitted with hypotension in
   the setting of diarrhea.
   # Hypotension: Levophed decreased from 0.06 to 0.04mcg/kg/min with MAP
   maintaining >65 since. Initial low BP likely secondary to combination
   of vomiting, diarrhea, and dialysis and possibly infection/sepsis.  Pt
   [**Name (NI) 1016**] POS, though should also consider line infection, pneumonia,
   SBP.  Afebrile ON.
   - continue to wean off of Levo
   - cautious IV fluids to maintain MAP > 65 and assist weaning pressors
   - f/u blood Cx, stool Cx, PD fluid cell count and Cx
   - Continue IV vanc and flagyl
   - Given age, hypotension requiring pressors, ICU level of care and
   repeat C-diff (i.e failure of therapy) will initiate PO VANC
   # Abdominal pain: Given her hypotension and risk factors for vascular
   disease, would be concerned for bowel ischemia, CT negative for
   mesenteric ischemia. Also possible SBP or PD fluid infection.
   - monitor serial lactates overnight
   - monitor abdominal exam closely
   # Diarrhea: Has persisted over 3 months. Given POS C-diff, likely has
   had chronic infection w/ exacerbations. Will treat as above.  2
   episodes last night.
   # Cyanotic fingers:
   Most likely Raynaud's given history.  Has questionnable h/o lupus in
   the past, which would increase chance of Raynaud's.
   - recommend rheum f/u as outpatient
   - OT consult
   - treatment for Raynaud's (calcium channel blockers), which would be
   contraindicated given her current hypotension
   # s/p fall:
   Most likely secondary to dizziness from hypotension.
   - PT consult
   - no evidence of knee injury on exam
   # ESRD on HD and PD:
   Last HD on Monday.
   -Possible HD today
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold phos binder given low calcium and phos
   # Coagulopathy:
   On warfarin for h/o SVC syndrome, currently supratherapeutic at.  Note
   that she has h/o bleed into gluteal muscle while on heparin IV and that
   RP bleed might explain her abdominal pain and hypotension.
   - type and screen
   - follow coags and Hct overnight
   - no indication for vitamin K or FFP at present
   - hold coumadin for now, restart when back in therapeutic range.
   # HTN:  Holding meds given low BP
   # h/o SVC syndrome:
   - elevated INR at present
   - monitor coags and exam
   # Right hip pain and left shoulder pain:  Chronic; Right hip pain
   related to prior hematoma, resolving,
   - tylenol 1000 TID
   - oxycodone for breakthrough pain
   # Left renal cyst:
   Identified during hospital stay in [**7-/2128**], MRI recommended for further
   follow-up.
   - discussed with patient's nephrologist; he is aware of need for MRI
   # Asthma:  albuterol PRN
   # Anemia: baseline hct 25-31, current Hct 30
   Most likely due to ESRD, but reportedly also has h/o iron deficiency
   anemia.
   - follow Hct as discussed above
   - pt signed blood consent
   # OSA: continue CPAP
   # Depression and anxiety:
   - continue home celexa and ativan.
   # FEN:  hold phos binder for now given low Ca and Phos
   # PPx: on warfarin; famotidine while in ICU
   # Access:  Left femoral placed in ED [**8-25**], right subclavian HD
   catheter, left PIV.
   # Code:  confirmed FULL
   # Comm:  with [**Name2 (NI) 5738**] [**Name (NI) 112**] [**Name (NI) 5739**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5740**]; [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5741**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5243**]
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5742**] is secondary contact
   # Dispo:  anticipate to floor if hemodynamically stable in AM
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a history of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She was admitted with hypotension and diarrhea. The patient is currently receiving norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65. She has been weaned off of levophed, and her vital signs are stable. The patient has a history of chronic infection with exacerbations, possibly chronic C. diff. She also has abdominal pain, which could be related to bowel ischemia or peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluid infection. The patient's cyanotic fingers are likely due to Raynaud's phenomenon. She has a history of possible lupus, which increases the chance of Raynaud's. The patient's coagulopathy is related to warfarin therapy for superior vena cava syndrome (SVC). She has a history of bleeding while on heparin IV. The patient's hypertension is being managed by holding antihypertensive medications due to low blood pressure. She has chronic hip and shoulder pain, and a left renal cyst has been identified. The patient also has asthma, anemia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and depression/anxiety. She is currently on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and has had both PD catheter and hemodialysis (HD) access. The patient's code status is full"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  55yo woman with ESRD and h/o C diff admitted with hypotension in
   the setting of diarrhea.
   # Hypotension: Levophed d/c
ed with MAP maintaining >65. Initial low BP
   likely secondary to combination of vomiting, diarrhea, and dialysis and
   possibly infection/sepsis.  Pt [**Name (NI) 1016**] POS, though should also consider
   line infection, pneumonia, SBP.  Afebrile ON.
   - cautious IV fluids to maintain MAP > 65
   - f/u blood Cx, stool Cx, PD fluid cell count and Cx
   - Continue Vanco 125mg PO q6hr and Flagyl 500mg IV q8
   # Abdominal pain: Given her hypotension and risk factors for vascular
   disease, concerned for bowel ischemia, CT negative for mesenteric
   ischemia. Also possible SBP or PD fluid infection. Lactate WNL yest.
   - follow cultures.
   - monitor abdominal exam closely
   # Diarrhea: Has persisted over 3 months. Given POS C-diff, likely has
   had chronic infection w/ exacerbations. 2 episodes last night.
   - Will treat as above.
   # Cyanotic fingers:
   Most likely Raynaud's given history.  Has questionnable h/o lupus in
   the past, which would increase chance of Raynaud's. Appreciate OT c/s
   with recs to f/u with outpt rheum
   - recommend rheum f/u as outpatient
   - treatment for Raynaud's (calcium channel blockers), which would be
   contraindicated given her current hypotension
   # s/p fall:
   Most likely secondary to dizziness from hypotension.
   - PT consult pending
   - no evidence of knee injury on exam
   # ESRD on HD and PD:
   Last HD on Monday.
   -Possible HD today per Renal
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold phos binder given low calcium and phos
   # Coagulopathy:
   On warfarin for h/o SVC syndrome, currently supratherapeutic at 5.0.
   h/o bleed into gluteal muscle while on heparin IV
   - follow coags and Hct overnight
   - no indication for vitamin K or FFP at present
   - hold coumadin for now, restart when back in therapeutic range.
   # HTN:  Holding meds given low BP
   # h/o SVC syndrome:
   - elevated INR at present
   - monitor coags and exam
   # Right hip pain and left shoulder pain:  Chronic; Right hip pain
   related to prior hematoma, continuing pain
   - tylenol 1000 TID
   - oxycodone for breakthrough pain
   # Left renal cyst:
   Identified during hospital stay in [**7-/2128**], MRI recommended for further
   follow-up.
   - discussed with patient's nephrologist; he is aware of need for MRI
   # Asthma:  albuterol PRN
   # Anemia: baseline hct 25-31, current Hct 31.8
   Most likely due to ESRD, but reportedly also has h/o iron deficiency
   anemia.
   - follow Hct as discussed above
   - pt signed blood consent
   # OSA: continue CPAP
   # Depression and anxiety:
   - continue home celexa and ativan.
   # FEN:  hold phos binder for now given low Ca and Phos
   # PPx: holding warfarin; supratherapeutic INR; famotidine while in ICU
   # Access:  Left femoral placed in ED [**8-25**] (if pt

","The patient is a 55-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with hypotension in the setting of diarrhea. She has a history of Clostridium difficile infection and was found to have non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) on the evening of the previous day. Her medical history also includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, depression, anxiety, iron deficiency anemia, and a history of systemic venous congestion (SVC) syndrome.

During her hospital stay, she has experienced several complications, including hypotension, abdominal pain, diarrhea, cyanotic fingers (likely Raynaud's phenomenon), a fall, and coagulopathy. She is currently on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis for her ESRD. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 121/64 mmHg, heart rate of 90 bpm, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is elevated, creatinine is within normal range, and potassium is slightly elevated. Other lab values, including glucose, liver enzymes, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include cautious IV fluids to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP"

","The patient is a 55-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a history of Clostridium difficile infection admitted with hypotension in the setting of diarrhea. She has been experiencing non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), which is an abnormal heart rhythm. The electrocardiogram (EKG) shows inverted T-waves in the inferior leads, suggesting SVT with aberrancy. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no wall abnormalities and preserved biventricular function.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/64 to 128/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. Fluid balance is within normal limits.

The patient has a history of chronic diarrhea, which has persisted for three months. Given her positive stool culture for C. difficile, it is likely that she has had a chronic infection with exacerbations. She also has abdominal pain, but a computed tomography (CT) scan did not show mesenteric ischemia. The possibility of small bowel perforation or peritonitis should be considered. Additionally, the patient has pain over the site of peritoneal dialysis (PD) insertion,"

   ischemia.
   -          Continue to monitor on tele.
   -          Replete lytes
   # Hypotension: Levophed d/c
ed with MAP maintaining >65. Initial low BP
   likely secondary to combination of vomiting, diarrhea, and dialysis and
   possibly infection/sepsis.  Pt [**Name (NI) 1016**] POS.  Afebrile ON.
   - BCx and peritoneal Cx NGTD
   - cautious IV fluids to maintain MAP > 65 (pt is anuric)
   - Continue Vanco 125mg PO q6hr and Flagyl 500mg IV q8
   # Abdominal pain: Given her hypotension and risk factors for vascular
   disease, concerned for bowel ischemia, CT negative for mesenteric
   ischemia. Also possible SBP or PD fluid infection. Lactate WNL yest.
   - follow cultures.
   - monitor abdominal exam closely
   # Diarrhea: Has persisted over 3 months. Given POS C-diff, likely has
   had chronic infection w/ exacerbations. 2 episodes last night.
   - Will treat as above.
   # Cyanotic fingers:
   Most likely Raynaud's given history.  Has questionnable h/o lupus in
   the past, which would increase chance of Raynaud's. Appreciate OT c/s
   with recs to f/u with outpt rheum
   - recommend rheum f/u as outpatient
   - treatment for Raynaud's (calcium channel blockers), which would be
   contraindicated given her current hypotension
   # s/p fall:
   Most likely secondary to dizziness from hypotension.
   - PT consult pending
   - no evidence of knee injury on exam
   # ESRD on HD and PD:
   Last HD on Monday.
   -Possible HD today per Renal
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold phos binder given low calcium and phos
   # Coagulopathy:
   On warfarin for h/o SVC syndrome, currently supratherapeutic at 5.0.
   h/o bleed into gluteal muscle while on heparin IV
   - follow coags and Hct overnight
   - no indication for vitamin K or FFP at present
   - hold coumadin for now, restart when back in therapeutic range.
   # HTN:  Holding meds given low BP
   # h/o SVC syndrome:
   - elevated INR at present
   - monitor coags and exam
   # Right hip pain and left shoulder pain:  Chronic; Right hip pain
   related to prior hematoma, continuing pain
   - tylenol 1000 TID
   - oxycodone for breakthrough pain
   # Left renal cyst:
   Identified during hospital stay in [**7-/2128**], MRI recommended for further
   follow-up.
   - discussed with patient's nephrologist; he is aware of need for MRI
   # Asthma:  albuterol PRN
   # Anemia: baseline hct 25-31, current Hct 31.8
   Most likely due to ESRD, but reportedly also has h/o iron deficiency
   anemia.
   - follow Hct as discussed above

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted for hypotension and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She experienced an episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) without symptoms, and her EKG showed inverted T-waves in the inferior leads, suggesting SVT with aberrancy. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no evidence of wall motion abnormalities and preserved biventricular function.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 90 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 121/64 mmHg to 128/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her rhythm is currently sinus.

The patient's laboratory results show hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, hematocrit of 31.8%, leukocyte count of 11.0 K/uL, platelet count of 369 K/uL, creatinine of 8.2 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 114 mg/dL.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 55-year-old individual with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) presenting with hypotension.
- The patient has been experiencing severe diarrhea due to Clostridium difficile (C diff) infection.
- The patient required low-dose levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 and is currently being weaned off it.
- The patient's lactate levels are being monitored, and infectious sources are being ruled out.
- The patient is responding well to IV Flagyl for C diff, but surgical consultation may be necessary if the patient deteriorates.
- Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been resumed.
- The patient has a history of coagulopathy and is on Coumadin, which has been temporarily held. There are no signs of active bleeding, but the patient's INR is being trended. IV Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are available for active bleeding.
- The patient's remaining issues will be addressed according to the housestaff notes.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. C diff infection: The patient is at risk of complications related to the C diff infection, such as severe diarrhea, colitis, sepsis, and potentially toxic megacolon.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old ESRD (end-stage renal disease) patient presenting with hypotension due to dehydration and Clostridium difficile (C diff) infection. The patient initially responded to fluid resuscitation but required low-dose levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60. The patient's lactate levels are being trended.

The patient also experienced a new episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which was stable with normal electrolytes. An echocardiogram will be performed to evaluate the situation. If the patient's blood pressures remain stable, a low-dose beta-blocker may be considered.

The patient is being treated for C diff with IV Flagyl and oral Vancomycin. The patient's abdomen exam is stable. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) was resumed yesterday, and hemodialysis (HD) is planned for today.

Regarding coagulopathy, Coumadin has been held, and there are no signs of active bleeding. However, if any bleeding occurs, IV vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) will be administered.

The remaining issues are as per the housestaff notes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be a result of dehydration due to severe diarrhea from C diff, aggressive PD, and HD. If not properly managed, this could lead to shock and further"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old ESRD (end-stage renal disease) patient presenting with hypotension, shock, abdominal pain, diarrhea, renal failure, anemia, and a history of superior vena cava syndrome (SVC). The patient has been experiencing severe diarrhea from C. diff and required low-dose levophed to maintain a MAP of 60. They were initially fluid-responsive but now require assistance in maintaining blood pressure. Lactate trends will be monitored for infectious sources, and PD infection will also be ruled out by checking cell count follow-up CXR and blood CX. 

The patient also had a new episode of SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), which was stable with normal electrolytes. An Echo will be performed to assess the situation. Stopping levophed should help, and if BPs remain stable, a low-dose beta-blocker may be considered.

The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff and is currently on IV Flagyl and PO Vancomycin. The abdominal exam is stable, and a final read of the abdominal CT will be done. If the patient deteriorates, a surgical consult may be sought.

Resuming PD (peritoneal dialysis) today is planned for the patient's ESRD management. The coagulopathy is being managed by holding Coumadin, and there are no signs of active bleeding at present. The INR will be trended, and IV"
