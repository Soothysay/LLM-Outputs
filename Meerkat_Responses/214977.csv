   hematemesis.
   24 Hour Events:
 SPUTUM CULTURE - At [**2198-3-11**] 04:00 PM
 CALLED OUT
   - Was called out, but given increasing O2 requirement was kept in the
   ICU. (was on a 50% shovel mask to get humidified air, was able to be
   weaned down to 3 L).
   - Hct stable all day in the 29's to 30's, however her 11 pm Hct showed
   a drop to 25.6 (from 30).  No recent evidence of clinical bleeding,
   SBPs stable.  Tube feeds held.  A few hours later, am labs showed
   further decrease in her Hct to 23.8 so she is being transfused 1 unit
   of PRBC.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of dementia, DM2, chronic UTIs, and recent admission for UTI and PNA presenting with hematemesis. The patient experienced an aspiration event followed by increasing O2 requirements. Her Hct dropped from 30 to 25.6, indicating significant blood loss, and she is being transfused 1 unit of PRBC. The patient has a history of chronic UTIs, with a recent UTI at Hospital1 678. She also has a history of CVA, CHF, and is currently on medications for these conditions. The patient is also diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) and has worsening chest X-ray showing new consolidations on the left and worsened consolidation on the right, likely due to repeat aspiration events.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient presented with hematemesis, indicating bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Possible causes include gastritis, duodenal ulcers, gastric ulcers, or esophageal pathology such as varices. The patient is being treated with PPI IV BID and large bore PIVs to manage the bleeding.

2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has worsening chest X-ray findings suggestive of pneumonia. The patient is being treated with antibiotics including vancomycin, cef"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 87 year-old female with a history of dementia, CVA, DM2, CHF,
   chronic UTIs who presents with hematemesis and likely aspiration PNA
    # Hematemesis: Initial hematemesis/hematochezia presumed due to
   gastritis/duodenitis with UGIB presentation.  Continues to have no
   signs of continued bleeding and now Hct stable.  GI evaluated and
   decided not to scope given general morbidity of patient with severe
   dementia and overall stability.
   - PPI IV BID
   - 2 large bore PIVs
   - transfuse to keep HCT >25
   -[**Hospital1 7**] Hematocrit checks.
   # PNA- Patient with worsened CXR on [**2198-3-12**] with new and worsened
   consolidations on left and worsened consolidation on right.  Most
   likely due to repeat aspiration event yesterday.  O2  sats are stable
   and no other signs of distress.
   - vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole (anticipate 10 day course for
   HAP/aspiration)
   - sputum cx pending
   - blood cx pending
   # Chronic UTIs: Had recent UTI at [**Hospital1 678**] per report but UA here with
   pyuria but no LE.  Culture ultimately negative thus do not believe that
   a UTI contributed to this presentation.
   # DM: Patient with some hypoglycemia requiring dextrose *2.  Most
   likely this is because even half dose of glargine is too much while
   NPO.
   -Restart tube feeds as Hct stable
   -Establish on half dose of glargine
    # Dementia: MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1123**] per daughter, no acute management
   #. chronic heart failure: Unclear if this is systolic or diastolic
   failure as no echocardiograms here.  Appearance of CXR mildly improved
   with diuresis yesterday (less hilar fullness).   Will continue to
   diurese given stable Cr and continued appearance of some pulmonary
   edema.
   - convert isosorbide and ACEi to daily preparations, continue
   metoprolol
   -Furosemide 20 mg IV *1
   - does not tolerate ASA (allergy)
   # FEN: NPO for now
   - Restart tube feeds per previous nutrition reccs
   -Speech and swallow once stable

   This is a 87 year-old female with a history of dementia, CVA, DM2, CHF,
   chronic UTIs who presents with hematemesis and likely aspiration PNA
   # Hematemesis: In ED Peg lavage with coffee ground; cleared after 500
   cc.  Was guiac positive in ED but guiac negative in one stool yesterday
   and no stools today.  No hematemesis in unit.  Presumed UGIB
   considering ce gastritis vs duodenol vs gastric ulcer vs esophageal
   pathology([**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **], varices).   GI evaluated and reluctant to
   scope given general morbidity and severe dementia.
   - PPI IV BID
   - 2 large bore PIVs
   - transfuse to keep HCT >25
   -Recheck PM Hct
   # PNA- Patient with worsened CXR on [**2198-3-12**] with new and worsened
   consolidations on left and worsened consolidation on right.  Most
   likely due to repeat aspiration event yesterday.  O2  sats are stable
   and no other signs of distress.
   - vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole (anticipate 10 day course for
   HAP/aspiration)
   - sputum cx pending

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of dementia, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). She presents with hematemesis, likely due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient also has worsening chest X-ray findings consistent with pneumonia aspiration. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/71 to 178/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the lungs, tender abdomen around the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) site, and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's worsening chest X-ray findings indicate pneumonia aspiration, which can lead to respiratory distress and sepsis.
2. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient's presentation with hematemesis suggests UGIB, which can result in significant blood loss and shock.
3. Chronic UTIs: The patient has a history of chronic UTIs, which can lead to urinary tract infection-related complications such as pyelonephritis or urosepsis.
4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's history of CH"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old female admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is currently stable with reasonable hematocrit (HCT) levels after transfusion. She experienced mild volume overload yesterday, which responded well to Lasix given intravenously. There have been no further signs of hematemesis. The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is being treated with vancomycin, metronidazole, and cefepime for 10 days. Clinical evidence of pneumonia is based on residual infiltrates and improvement in respiratory status following diuresis. The patient's goal is to maintain a HCT level above 25% with stability.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient initially presented with GIB, which is a significant medical complication that can lead to anemia, hypotension, and shock if not managed appropriately.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is currently being treated with antibiotics. Pneumonia can complicate the clinical course, especially in an elderly patient with multiple comorbidities.
3. Volume Overload: The patient experienced mild volume overload yesterday, which responded to Lasix treatment. Close monitoring of fluid balance is essential to prevent further complications related to fluid overload.
4. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), particularly due to immobility"
