   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving invasive ventilation since 12:00 AM on [**2130-11-11**]. The patient also has multi-lumen access and an indwelling port (PortaCath) placed since 12:30 AM on the same day. Blood cultures were drawn at 03:00 AM, urine culture at 03:00 AM, and sputum culture at 04:10 AM.

The patient has allergies to Nafcillin and renal toxicity. The last dose of antibiotics was given. Infusions of Midazolam (Versed) at 2 mg/hour and Fentanyl at 50 mcg/hour are ongoing. Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis was started at 02:00 AM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for pneumonia. The vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 124 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 108/55 to 122/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation.

The patient has a central venous pressure of 9 mmHg, fluid balance showing an input of 8,492 mL and output of 3,002 mL, with a positive balance of 6,532 mL. The respiratory support indicates an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and RSBI of 27.

Physical examination findings are not available due to limitations in assessing peripheral vascular status, skin condition, neurologic function, and other parameters.

Laboratory results show white blood cell count of 11.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, platelet count of 108 K/uL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose of 83 mg/dL, sodium of 148 mEq/L, potassium of 3.4 mEq/L, chloride of 96 mEq/L, calcium of 6.3 mg/dL, magnesium of 1.4 mg/dL, and phosphate of 1.7 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate elevated PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, and slightly elevated LDH.

The assessment and plan include pneumonia, cirrhosis of the liver, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and various prophylactic measures."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, who is on the transplant list. He was transferred to the hospital with obtundation and hepatic encephalopathy, along with leukocytosis and bandemia. The patient was found to have multifocal pneumonia on chest CT and was treated with moxifloxacin. He experienced hypotension that responded to fluids and subsequently developed respiratory failure leading to intubation. Legionella was negative, and leukocytosis improved with antibiotics. The patient's current conditions include pneumonia, hepatic encephalopathy, acute renal failure (ARF), cirrhosis with esophageal varices, and hypernatremia. He also has depression with psychotic features and PTSD. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient already has pneumonia, and there is a risk of worsening or developing new infections due to his immunocompromised state and mechanical ventilation.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition may continue to worsen if the underlying infection is not controlled or if there are other factors contributing to increased ammonia levels.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): Although the patient's ARF is currently improving, it can easily deteriorate if there is inadequate fluid management or if the underlying cause is not addressed.
4. Cirrhosis with esophageal varices: There is a risk of"

s blood pressure has responded to fluids, but he continues to
   be tachycardic and drops his pressure with sedation.  Still has
   moderate oxygen requirement.; PEEP increased to 8.  Creatinine
   improving.
   On exam, patient intubated and sedated. PEERR. No scleral icterus.
   Chest clear with good air movement over the anterior and lateral
   fields. Heart sounds distant. I-II/VI systolic murmur throughout the
   precordium. Abdomen with active bowel sounds. Soft, no guarding. Non
   tender. Extremities warm and well perfused.
   Chest CT reviewed: RLL and LLL infiltrates with air bronchograms. Small
   bilateral pleural effusions.

   Patient appears to be volume depleted clinically. Will give additional
   fluids. With hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (likely in part due to
   NS fluid resuscitation), would give next liter as D5W with 2 amps of
   bicarbonate. Patient cannot get lactated Ringers because of cirrhosis.
   [**Month (only) 8**] need to periodically use D5 with bicarb in addition to NS for
   future fluid needs.
   Oxygenation a bit better. Patient continues on antibiotics for possible
   aspiration pneumonia.
   Renal function improving with fluid resuscitation. Continue as above.
   Hct at 30. No evidence of bleeding. Not at transfusion threshold. INR
   at 2.3 . If we continue to have problems with volume resuscitation,

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis and multiple medical complications. He was transferred to the ICU due to obtundation and hepatic encephalopathy, and found to have multifocal pneumonia on chest CT. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated with moxifloxacin and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been adjusted based on Legionella negativity. The respiratory support will be continued with weaning of oxygen as tolerated.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is experiencing worsening hepatic encephalopathy due to ongoing infection. Treatment includes lactulose and rifaximin.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has prerenal acute renal failure. Fluid resuscitation is being continued, and renal function is improving.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis with esophageal varices. Propanolol has been held due to hypotension, and further liver recommendations will be followed.

5. GI/FEN: The patient is being treated for GERD with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and is starting total parenteral nutrition (TF).

6. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, possibly due to aggressive normal saline (NS) resuscitation. Free water flushes are being given.

7. Depression with psychotic features"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. He also has hepatic encephalopathy, constipation, potential aspiration pneumonia, hypernatremia, fever, renal failure, depression with psychotic features, and GERD. The patient is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, PPI, lactulose, and antipsychotics. He has an indwelling port, multi-lumen catheter, and is receiving IV fluids, pressors, and nutritional support. The patient's condition remains unstable, and he is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's obtundation and recent encephalopathy suggest the possibility of aspiration pneumonia. This is supported by his hypotension requiring aggressive IV fluid resuscitation. He is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the ongoing infection needs to be closely monitored.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy has worsened due to ongoing infection and severe constipation. Treatment includes continuing lactulose, rifaximin, and addressing constipation with disimpaction and warm water enemas.
3. Constipation: The patient is suffering from severe constipation, which is contributing to his worsening hepatic encephalopathy. Disimpaction, lactulose, and warm water enemas are planned to relieve the constipation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver and impaired skin integrity. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and an increased respiratory rate. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and prophylactic heparin. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and liver enzyme levels. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and impaired skin integrity. The patient's nutritional status and glycemic control are being monitored. The patient has an indwelling port and multiple IV lines. Prophylactic measures are in place for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever suggest an ongoing infection. This could potentially lead to sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.
2. Liver dysfunction: The patient's history of cirrhosis and elevated liver enzyme levels indicate potential liver dysfunction. This can increase the risk of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy.
3. Kidney dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level suggests impaired kidney function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and appropriate management are necessary to prevent"

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis who is on the transplant list. He was transferred to the ICU with obtundation and was found to have multifocal pneumonia. The patient required aggressive IVF resuscitation for hypotension and ultimately needed intubation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's current medical complications include pneumonia, hepatic encephalopathy, cirrhosis with esophageal varices, depression with psychotic features/PTSD, and GERD. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are as follows:
1. Pneumonia: The patient already has multifocal pneumonia, which can worsen and lead to sepsis or respiratory distress.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition can continue to worsen due to ongoing infection and may lead to further cognitive impairment or coma.
3. Cirrhosis with esophageal varices: There is a risk of variceal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
4. Depression with psychotic features/PTSD: Without appropriate management, the patient's mental health condition can lead to worsening symptoms and potential self-harm or harm to others.
5. GERD: If not properly managed, GERD can lead to aspiration pneumonia or worsening respiratory symptoms.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory function, hepatic function, mental status, and infection status. Appropriate treatment and management strategies"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a history of cirrhosis of the liver and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs indicate sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, and an elevated respiratory rate. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, sedatives, pain management, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's lab results show abnormal levels in white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, glucose, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and other parameters.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient. These include:

1. Organ Failure: The patient's critically ill condition and history of cirrhosis of the liver increase the risk of organ failure, particularly liver and kidney dysfunction.

2. Infection: The presence of pneumonia indicates an ongoing respiratory infection. The patient's compromised immune system due to cirrhosis and ICU stay increases the risk of additional infections, such as bloodstream infections or catheter-related infections.

3. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and prolonged PTT/INR suggest an increased risk of bleeding. This could be exacerbated by the use of anticoagulant medications for DVT prophylaxis.

4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows a significant intake-output discrepancy, indicating a potential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis, on the transplant list, who was transferred to the ICU with obtundation/hepatic encephalopathy, leukocytosis with 21% bandemia, and multifocal pneumonia on chest CT likely due to aspiration. He experienced hypotension that responded to fluids and required intubation for respiratory failure. He is currently febrile, showing signs of ongoing infection despite antibiotic treatment. His hepatic encephalopathy has worsened due to infection and constipation. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely prerenal, which is rapidly improving. He has a history of cirrhosis with esophageal varices and no clear evidence for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient's gastrointestinal issues include GERD, and he is being treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and started on total parenteral nutrition (TF). He also has hypernatremia, possibly iatrogenic from aggressive normal saline (NS) resuscitation. The patient has depression with psychotic features/PTSD and is being treated with quetiapine. Other issues are noted in the resident's note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia, likely due to aspiration, and is already showing signs of infection despite antibiotic treatment. Close monitoring for worsening respiratory symptoms and consideration of changing antibiotics may be necessary.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis who is on the transplant list. He was transferred to the ICU with obtundation/hepatic encephalopathy, leukocytosis with 21% bandemia, and multifocal pneumonia on chest CT likely due to aspiration. The patient also experienced hypotension which responded to fluids, respiratory failure leading to intubation, and persistently febrile condition.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia on chest CT, which is likely due to aspiration. The ongoing infection and constipation may worsen his hepatic encephalopathy. There is a possibility of worsening pneumonia if not properly managed.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy has worsened due to ongoing infection and constipation. It is important to continue lactulose and rifaximin therapy, and disimpact the patient as needed.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient likely has prerenal ARF. Continued monitoring of hydration status and adjustment of medication dosing for creatinine clearance are necessary.

4. Cirrhosis with esophageal varices: The patient has cirrhosis with esophageal varices. Close follow-up with liver recommendations is needed. Propanalol should be held due to hypotension.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and diagnosed with pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, and cirrhosis of the liver. The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/54 to 109/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 13,490 mL, with 6,596 mL given intravenously and 2,926 mL through total parenteral nutrition. The total output includes 3,900 mL of urine and 1,015 mL of drainage from the nasogastric tube. The respiratory support indicates the use of an endotracheal tube, continuous mandatory ventilation mode with assist and autoflow, set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen at 40%, and respiratory system compliance index of 59.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 11.2 to 15.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level between 10.4 and 12.1 g/dL, platelet count between 108 and 134 K/uL, creatinine level between 0.8 and 1.3 mg/dL, glucose level between 83 and 102 mg/dL, and various electrolyte imbalances.

The patient has multiple lines in place, including a PortaCath placed on [**2130-11-11**] at 12:30 AM, a 20-gauge line placed on [**2130-11-11**] at 02:54 PM, and a multi-lumen line placed on [**2130-11-11**] at 04:32 PM. The patient is receiving prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pneumonia, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, infections related to the indwelling lines, hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis of the liver, renal dysfunction due to inadequate fluid balance or medication toxicity, and pressure injuries from impaired skin integrity."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis and a history of hepatic encephalopathy. He was admitted to the ICU with obtundation, leukocytosis, and pneumonia. He required aggressive IV fluid resuscitation for hypotension and was subsequently intubated due to respiratory failure. His leukocytosis improved with antibiotic therapy. The patient also has a history of depression with psychotic features/PTSD and is currently being treated with quetiapine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with multifocal pneumonia, which required antibiotic therapy. It is important to monitor for any worsening of respiratory symptoms or new infiltrates on chest imaging.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, which can be exacerbated by ongoing infection. Monitoring for changes in mental status and ensuring proper management with lactulose and rifaximin is crucial.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is currently improving, but close monitoring of serum creatinine and urine output is necessary. Continued hydration should help maintain renal perfusion.
4. Cirrhosis and Esophageal Varices: The patient has cirrhosis with esophageal varices, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding. Regular monitoring for signs of bleeding and following liver recommendations are important.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatrem"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failulre from multifocal pneumonia, now with persistent fevers.
   ## Hypoxemic respiratory failure
   Peristent infiltrate on CXR, increased secretions, likely PNA. Plan abx
   as below. Would wean Fi02 and increase PEEP if needed. Unlikely to
   extubate in next 24hrs, so would favor low tidal volume strategy. If
   needed can add propofol for sedation.
   ## Hypotension:
   ## Fevers: likely due to pneumonia, though persistence of fevers raises
   suspicion for additional source
   - f/u cultures; culture Port
   - abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for ascites; consider diagnostic
   para to r/o SBP if remains febrile
   ## Cirrhosis:
   - cont rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy
   - liver input appreciated
   -currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - cont to trend platelets
   ## Acute renal failure; resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient has persistent fevers, hypotension, and delirium. He has a history of cirrhosis and is currently delisted from transplant due to an acute infection. The patient also has acute renal failure, which has resolved. He is receiving various treatments including antibiotics, sedation, and supportive care. Potential complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, acute kidney injury, and thromboembolic events.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, which can worsen if there is a progression of pneumonia or if ventilator settings are not optimized.
2. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers and hypotension raise suspicion for sepsis, especially considering his immunocompromised state due to cirrhosis and recent infection.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, he is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, especially if his liver function deteriorates further.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient previously experienced acute renal failure, which may recur if there is inadequate perfusion or ongoing renal insult.

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failulre from multifocal pneumonia, now with persistent fevers.
   ## Hypoxemic respiratory failure
   Peristent infiltrate on CXR, increased secretions, likely PNA. Plan abx
   as below. Would wean Fi02 and increase PEEP if needed. Unlikely to
   extubate in next 24hrs, so would favor low tidal volume strategy. If
   needed can add propofol for sedation.
   ## Fevers: likely due to pneumonia, though persistence of fevers raises
   suspicion for additional source
   - f/u cultures; culture Port
   - abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for ascites; consider diagnostic
   para to r/o SBP if remains febrile
   ## Cirrhosis:
   - cont rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy
   - liver input appreciated
   -currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - cont to trend platelets
   ## Acute renal failure; resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. He is experiencing persistent fevers, likely secondary to pneumonia, but further evaluation is needed to identify any additional sources. The patient also has cirrhosis and acute renal failure, which has resolved. He is on mechanical ventilation and receiving antibiotics for pneumonia treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory condition may worsen if the pneumonia does not improve or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Fevers: The persistent fevers indicate an ongoing infection, which could be due to the pneumonia or another underlying cause. Further investigation is required to identify the source of the fevers and provide appropriate treatment.
3. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis may progress, leading to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, or hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Acute renal failure: Although the patient's acute renal failure has resolved, there is a risk of recurrence, especially if there is inadequate fluid resuscitation or if the underlying cause of the renal failure returns.
5. Line-related infections: The patient has multiple lines and catheters, increasing the risk of line-related bloodstream infections.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): P"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis who is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure from multifocal pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to pneumonia, which may worsen if not appropriately managed. The patient requires continuous oxygen supplementation and adjustments in ventilator settings.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely multifactorial, caused by hypovolemia from stool losses, insensible losses from fevers, and possible sepsis. Intravenous fluid boluses and vasopressor support may be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

3. Fevers: The patient's persistent fevers raise suspicion for additional sources of infection. Cultures should be followed up, and an abdominal ultrasound should be performed to evaluate for ascites and consider a diagnostic paracentesis to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

4. Acute renal failure: The patient had acute renal failure, which has since resolved. It was likely prerenal due to hypovolemic/septic shock. Monitoring kidney function and ensuring adequate fluid resuscitation will be important.

5. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, which needs to be managed with ongoing lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis who is currently in the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure from multifocal pneumonia. He has persistent fevers, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient also has anemia and is being treated for encephalopathy related to cirrhosis. He is on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines and tubes inserted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to pneumonia and pleural effusions. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of FiO2 and PEEP are necessary. Cultures should be followed up to identify the causative organism.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely caused by hypovolemia from stool losses, insensible losses from fevers, and possible sepsis. Boluses of LR should be given to increase CVP, and if ineffective, albumin may be considered. Vasopressor support might be required if the above measures are inadequate.

3. Fevers: The patient's fevers are likely due to pneumonia, but persistence raises suspicion for additional sources. Cultures should be monitored, and an abdominal ultrasound should be done to evaluate for ascites and consider a diagnostic paracentesis to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis who is currently in the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure from multifocal pneumonia. He now has a gram-positive bacteremia. The patient has been experiencing hypotension likely due to hypovolemia from stool losses, insensible losses from fevers, and possible sepsis. He is being supported with vasopressors and albumin boluses. Cultures have been taken, and his lines are being changed. The patient has acute renal failure, which has resolved, and he also has grade 2 esophageal varices. He is delisted from the transplant list due to acute infection and is being treated for encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing this condition and requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a gram-positive bacteremia, which indicates an ongoing infection. There is a risk of progression to sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient is being treated for encephalopathy associated with cirrhosis. There is a risk of further deterioration in mental status and the development of complications such as asterixis or altered levels of consciousness.
4. Acute kidney injury: Although the patient's renal failure has resolved"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure from multifocal pneumonia.
- He now has a gram-positive bacteremia.
- The patient is critically ill and requires ongoing intensive care support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory system is compromised, leading to inadequate oxygenation of the blood. This can be due to pneumonia and may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Bacteremia: The presence of gram-positive bacteria in the bloodstream indicates an infection that can spread to other organs, leading to sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to hypovolemia (fluid loss through stool), insensible losses (fever), and possible sepsis.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient had signs of renal dysfunction, but it has resolved likely due to prerenal causes such as hypovolemia and septic shock.
5. Variceal bleeding: The patient has known grade 2 varices, which are dilated blood vessels that can rupture and cause bleeding. This is a potential complication that needs monitoring.
6. Encephalopathy: The patient is being treated for hepatic encephalopathy, a condition where liver dysfunction leads to cognitive impairment.
7. Infection control: The patient has multiple lines and tubes, which can increase the risk of infection. Proper line management and"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failulre from multifocal pneumonia, now with persistent fevers.
   ## Hypoxemic respiratory failure; seems to be due to pneumonia, though
   pleural effusions may also be contributing
   - f/u sputum culture which is growing rare GNRs
   - cont empiric vancomycin, aztreonam, levofloxacin; check vanco trough
   - wean FiO2 and increase PEEP
   ## Hypotension: likely multifactorial from hypovolemia from stool
   losses as well as insensible losses from fevers as well as possible
   sepsis
   - LR boluses to increase CVP; low threshhold to switch to albumin if
   crystalloid is ineffective
   - consider vasopressor support if above is inadequate
   ## Fevers: likely due to pneumonia, though persistence of fevers raises
   suspicion for additional source
   - f/u cultures; culture Port
   - abdominal ultrasound to evaluate for ascites; consider diagnostic
   para to r/o SBP if remains febrile
   ## Cirrhosis:
   - cont rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy
   - liver input appreciated
   -currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - cont to trend platelets
   ## Acute renal failure; resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock
   ## Anemia; source unclear; cont to trend

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis who is currently in the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. He has persistent fevers, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient also has cirrhosis and is being treated with rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy. He is delisted from transplant due to acute infection. The patient's platelet count is trending down, and he has anemia with an unclear source.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's condition can worsen if he does not improve with current treatment and respiratory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers and hypotension suggest possible sepsis, which can lead to organ failure if not managed promptly.
3. Acute renal failure: Although the patient's renal function has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrent renal failure if he becomes hypotensive or septic again.
4. Cirrhosis complications: The patient's underlying cirrhosis puts him at risk for complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and hepatorenal syndrome.
5. Anemia: Identifying and treating the source of the patient's anemia is important to optimize oxygen delivery and prevent further complications.
6. Delisting from transplant: If the patient's acute infection does not improve, it may impact his eligibility"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failulre from multifocal pneumonia, now with persistent fevers.
   1. Bacteremia: concerned due to worsening hemodynamics, growing GPCs
   - change lines
   - reculture
   - redose vanc
   2 Hypoxemic respiratory failure; seems to be due to pneumonia, though
   pleural effusions may also be contributing
   - f/u sputum culture which is growing rare GNRs which is pan-sensitive
   klebsiella.
   - cont empiric vancomycin, aztreonam, levofloxacin
   - redose vanc to trough goal 15-20, and recheck thurs am
   - wean FiO2 and increase PEEP
   - change lines
   - ARDS volume
 decreased tidal volumes and increase rate for MV target
   of 10 L/min
   3.  Hypotension: likely multifactorial from hypovolemia from stool
   losses as well as insensible losses from fevers as well as possible
   sepsis
   - CVP low, so will bolus with normal saline, and will given albumin for
   goal CVP 8-12.
   - continue levophed
   4.  Fevers: likely due to pneumonia, though persistence of fevers
   raises suspicion for additional source. No abdominal fluid.
   - remove Port, change lines
   - continue to trend fever curves
   5. Cirrhosis: grade II varices
   - cont rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy
   - liver input appreciated
   - currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - cont to trend platelets
   6.Acute renal failure; resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   7. Anemia; source unclear; cont to trend
   - transfuse HCT <21
   8 Bloody return NG tube: appear to be trauma related, has INR 2
   - vitamin K 10 mg * 3 days
   - FFP if continues
   - hold tube feeds
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Tube feeds: fibersource
 on hold due to small amount blood
   from NG tube
   Glycemic Control:  start HISS

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers and is now showing signs of bacteremia with growing Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) in the blood cultures. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bacteremia: The patient's worsening hemodynamics and the presence of GPCs in the blood cultures indicate a concern for bacteremia. It is recommended to change the lines, reculture, and redose vancomycin to target a trough level of 15-20.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure seems to be primarily caused by pneumonia, but pleural effusions may also be contributing. It is advised to follow up with sputum culture results, which are growing rare Gram-negative rods (GNRs) that are pan-sensitive Klebsiella. Empiric antibiotics should be continued, including vancomycin, aztreonam, and levofloxacin. FiO2 should be weaned and PEEP increased.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, resulting from hypovolemia due to stool losses, insensible losses from fevers, and possible sepsis. The CVP is low, so bolus administration of normal saline and albumin should be given"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is admitted with respiratory failure and ongoing difficulties in meeting their oxygen needs.
- The patient has been febrile, with a temperature of 101.1°F (2130-11-14 04:00 AM).
- Blood cultures were taken on 2130-11-13 at 09:08 AM, an ultrasound was performed on the same day at 10:03 AM, and an arterial line was started at 05:26 PM.
- The patient continues to stool and has had their NG tube backed off due to increased residuals; a trial of increasing the NG tube overnight is being considered.
- Sedation has been changed from versed to propofol.
- ABGs overnight showed evolving acidosis, and the worsening chest X-ray appears to show diffuse PNA (pneumonia) versus additional fluid overload.
- The patient is unable to provide history as they are sedated and encephalopathic.
- Allergies include nafcillin, renal toxicity, and last doses of antibiotics were given on 2130-11-13 at 06:09 PM (levofloxacin), 09:08 PM (vancomycin), and 10:00 PM (aztreonam).
- Infusions include norepinephrine at 0.08 mcg/kg/min and fentanyl at 175 mcg/hour.
- Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), midazolam (versed), fentanyl, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and changes to medical and family history.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.
- Vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring show tachycardia, ongoing but basically stable levophed requirement, fever, and changes in blood pressure and heart rate.
- Fluid balance indicates a total input of 9,655 mL with 791 mL output through TF, PO, IVF, blood products, and NG, resulting in a balance of 7,765 mL.
- Respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set Vt of 630 mL, PS of 8 cmH2O, RR of 14, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and ABG results.
- Physical examination shows pinpoint pupils, normocephalic endotracheal tube, symmetric chest expansion, crackles and bronchial breath sounds at bases, warm skin, and sedated neurologic status.
- Labs indicate leukocytosis, elevated lactate, elevated Troponin-T, and other abnormal values.
- Assessment and plan include respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, cirrhosis of the liver, and others.
- ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (including arterial line), prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
- Code status is full code, and disposition is pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing difficulties in meeting oxygen needs indicate a potential complication related to respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The worsening chest X-ray showing diffuse PNA versus additional fluid overload suggests a potential complication of pneumonia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure readings indicate a potential complication of hypotension.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's warm skin and presence of impaired skin integrity suggest a potential complication related to pressure ulcers or bedsores.
5. Liver Cirrhosis: The patient's history of cirrhosis of the liver indicates a potential complication related to liver dysfunction or decompensation.
6. Renal Toxicity: The presence of renal toxicity in the patient's allergies and abnormal lab values suggests a potential complication related to kidney dysfunction.
7. Infection: The fever and leukocytosis indicate a potential complication related to infection, possibly leading to sepsis.
8. Acidosis: The evolving acidosis seen in the ABGs suggests a potential complication related to metabolic or respiratory acidosis."

   pleural effusions may also be contributing
   - f/u sputum culture which is growing rare GNRs which is pan-sensitive
   klebsiella.
   - cont empiric vancomycin, aztreonam, levofloxacin
   - redose vanc to trough goal 15-20, and recheck thurs am
   - wean FiO2 and increase PEEP
   - change lines
   - ARDS volume
 decreased tidal volumes and increase rate for MV target
   of 10 L/min
   # Hypotension: likely multifactorial from hypovolemia from stool losses
   as well as insensible losses from fevers as well as possible sepsis
   - CVP low, so will bolus with normal saline, and will given albumin for
   goal CVP 8-12.
   - continue levophed
   # Fevers: likely due to pneumonia, though persistence of fevers raises
   suspicion for additional source. No abdominal fluid.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with HCV cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient has persistent fevers, hypotension, and worsening hemodynamics. The patient also has acute renal failure, anemia, and bloody return of NG tube. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 12 cmH2O. Lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.1 K/uL, elevated lactate level of 2.1 mmol/L, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.2 C (99%), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 101/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator.

Potential Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's current condition of requiring mechanical ventilation indicates a severe respiratory compromise. The ongoing presence of pneumonia and potential pleural effusions may contribute to continued respiratory distress.
2. Sepsis: The patient's worsening hemodynamics, persistent fevers, and bacteremia suggest an ongoing infection leading to sepsis. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
3. Acute renal failure: Although the patient's renal failure has resolved, there is a risk of recurrence due to ongoing hyp"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers and septic shock, likely caused by pneumonia and possibly a central line infection. The blood cultures showed growth of pan-sensitive Klebsiella from the sputum and GPC in pairs/chains from the left internal jugular (IJ) catheter, but subsequent cultures have remained negative.

The patient has been treated with vancomycin and levofloxacin, and aztreonam has been discontinued. Vasopressin will be started to attempt to wean norepinephrine. The central venous O2 will be checked, and further fluids will be held.

The patient also has hypoxemic respiratory failure due to acute lung injury from pneumonia, with a contribution of pleural effusions. Levofloxacin will be continued, and attempts will be made to wean PEEP.

The patient's cirrhosis is complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices, with a small amount of ascites. Rifaximin and lactulose will continue for encephalopathy, and the liver will be followed. The patient is currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection, and platelet trends will be monitored.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis due to pneumonia and possibly a central line infection. The blood cultures from the left internal jugular (IJ) vein grew Gram-positive cocci in pairs/chains, which could indicate a central line-associated bloodstream infection. The patient's shock is not responsive to fluids, suggesting septic shock.

2. Acute lung injury: The patient has acute lung injury secondary to pneumonia, which is contributing to his hypoxemic respiratory failure. Pleural effusions may also be contributing to his respiratory distress.

3. Cirrhosis complications: The patient's cirrhosis is complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices. He has a small amount of ascites and is currently delisted from transplant due to an acute infection. The patient is being treated with rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy.

4. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a stage 2 decubitus ulcer without signs of infection. It will be monitored closely, and appropriate wound care will be provided.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient had acute renal failure that has resolved, likely due to hypovolemic/septic shock. His renal function will be monitored"

","The patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. He has persistent fevers and is bacteremic, with growing Gram-positive cocci (GPCs). The patient is also experiencing hypotension, likely from hypovolemia, insensible losses, and possible sepsis. He has grade II varices related to cirrhosis and acute renal failure, which has since resolved. The patient is currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. worsening bacteremia and sepsis due to the presence of GPCs in the blood.
2. further respiratory failure due to pneumonia and possible pleural effusions.
3. worsening of hypotension and potential organ failure if sepsis progresses.
4. exacerbation of encephalopathy due to increased stool losses and ongoing infection.
5. potential development of hepatic encephalopathy.
6. worsening of anemia and the need for further transfusion.
7. the possibility of recurrent acute renal failure if fluid balance and renal perfusion are not carefully managed.
8. the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility and central venous catheters.
9. the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
10. the potential need for an urgent liver"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure, which is not ARDS. The patient also has hypotension that is not in shock state, pneumonia caused by E. coli, and a history of cirrhosis of the liver. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, pain management, and blood pressure regulation. The patient has several lines inserted, including an arterial line and multi-lumen catheter. Prophylactic measures have been taken for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, although the blood pressure is on the lower side. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, slightly low sodium levels, and normal glucose levels. The patient's condition remains critical. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. This condition requires close monitoring and appropriate management to maintain adequate blood pressure and prevent organ damage.

3. Pneumonia: The presence of pneumonia, specifically caused by E. coli, increases the risk of complications related to"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan, written by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
   [**Location (un) 3012**]. I would emphasize and add the following points: 52M ESLD, E.
   Coli PNA c/b respiratory failure, ARDS. BCX + x2 GPCs; CVL replaced.

   12K, HCT 26, K+ 3.4, Cr 0.6. CXR with unchanged B ASD c/w PNA/ARDS.
   Agree with plan to continue vanco/levo/aztreonam and ongoing fluid
   resuscitation in attempt to wean pressors in the setting of septic
   shock. Will add vasopressin if unable to reduce levophed today. Will
   wean PEEP and follow ABGs while continuing ARDS vent approach. Although
   +BCX may have been due to prior CVL, I remain concerned that his
   Port-A-Cath is infected and will check cultures from that line today as
   well as discussing with PEVA team. Will continue supportive care for
   ESLD and check iron studies. OSH physician has been updated by the
   team. Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 50 min
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, acute pneumonia caused by E. coli, hypotension, cirrhosis of the liver, and potential infections in his central venous lines.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with respiratory failure not due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 480 mL, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) set at 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 39 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 220.

The patient has hypotension that is not in shock state, and the medical team is maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg with the use of norepinephrine. Vasopressin may be considered if the patient does not respond to norepinephrine.

The patient also has acute pneumonia caused by E. coli, and additional cultures are pending. The patient's liver condition, ESLD, requires supportive care, and the medical"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure from multifocal pneumonia. He is currently experiencing septic shock due to pneumonia, as evidenced by the need for vasopressin and increasing norepinephrine. The patient's respiratory failure is also attributed to acute lung injury from pneumonia and the contribution of pleural effusions. Other medical conditions include cirrhosis with encephalopathy and grade II varices, stage 2 decubitus ulcer, acute renal failure (resolved), anemia, and bloody return from NG tube (resolved).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's shock is likely due to pneumonia and may progress if not adequately managed.
2. Acute lung injury: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of acute lung injury from pneumonia, which can lead to further deterioration of lung function.
3. Pleural effusions: The contribution of pleural effusions to the patient's respiratory failure increases the risk of complications such as infection or tension pneumothorax.
4. Encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy can worsen if not properly managed, leading to altered mental status and increased risk of falls or other complications.
5. Variceal bleeding: The patient's grade II varices pose a risk of bleeding, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
6. Decubitus ulcer"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of pneumonia. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has been experiencing hypotension and requires vasopressin and norepinephrine infusions for hemodynamic support. His mixed venous oxygen saturation (CvO2) is 85%, indicating potential tissue hypoxia.

The patient's blood cultures were drawn on 11/15/2130 at 01:00 PM. Tube feeds were stopped due to high residuals and decreased free water flushes. An attempt to decrease PEEP resulted in decreased PaO2, and the patient was returned to PEEP 12.

The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver and impaired skin integrity. His respiratory status is stable on the ventilator with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 12 cmH2O. His ABG shows a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 228, indicating acceptable gas exchange.

The patient's renal function is slightly impaired, as evidenced by an elevated BUN of 25.1 mg/dL and creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL. His electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level of 7.3 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 12."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. They have been experiencing respiratory failure, septic shock, and require multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient's blood culture shows CNS (possibly concomitant but persistent), indicating a possible infection. The patient is sedated and not responsive, with limited neurological assessment. They are on mechanical ventilation with a Vt of 480 mL, RR set at 26, PEEP at 12 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and SpO2 of 94%. The patient's hemodynamics show a CVP of 12 mmHg, mixed venous O2% sat at 85%, and a total fluid balance of 4,102 mL in and 3,510 mL out. Lab results indicate leukocytosis with WBC at 12.1 K/uL, hyponatremia with Na+ at 135 mg/dL, elevated creatinine at 1.35 mg/dL, and low albumin at 2.5 g/dL. The patient is on multiple medications including vasopressin, norepinephrine, fentanyl, propofol, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, and there is a risk of worsening respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or acute respiratory distress syndrome ("

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, septic shock, and potential complications. The patient has been receiving multiple pressors and antibiotics due to septic shock. There are concerns about impaired right heart function and the need for further evaluation of baseline right heart function through a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient's blood culture shows contamination, suggesting a potential source of infection. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and low mixed venous oxygen saturation. The patient is also receiving respiratory support through mechanical ventilation, with a current FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 12 cmH2O.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of septic shock leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), cardiac dysfunction due to impaired right heart function, and the risk of bloodstream infection from the contaminated blood culture.

Further assessment and management should focus on optimizing respiratory support, controlling blood glucose levels, monitoring fluid balance, administering appropriate antibiotics, and closely monitoring hemodynamic parameters. The patient's response to treatment and the resolution of the current issues will determine their prognosis."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is in the ICU due to respiratory failure, hypotension, and pneumonia.
- The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver and impaired skin integrity.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/63 to 118/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- The patient is sedated and responds to commands, with normal breath sounds but crackles and wheezes on auscultation.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Fluid balance indicates a total intake of 4,209 mL and total output of 2,505 mL since 12 AM.
- The patient is receiving vasopressin, fentanyl, norepinephrine, and propofol infusions.
- Respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation, and supplemental oxygen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and changes in sputum color or quantity, is necessary.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows"

   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.
   # Septic shock, now SIRS: Patient initially presented with septic shock
   attributed to his pan [**Last Name (un) 46**] E coli pneumonia.  Shock not responsive to
   fluids, central venous O2 85%.  Blood cultures did grow
 coag neg
   staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ was removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.
   Serial cultures no growth to date. Stopped aztreonam.  Patient now felt
   to have SIRS perhaps from lung injury vs partially treated pna
   concern for ESBL. On both vasopressin, and decreasing norepinephrine.
   - Continue vancomycin at current level, recheck  vanc trough monday

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE / ARDS - still poor oxygenation. Has
   increasing b/l effusion but still with some pressor requirement. Will
   try to lighten sedation and asses true hemodynamics with eye toward
   diuresis in order to improve oxygenation. Need to balance need to
   lighten sedation with desire to maintain low tidal volumes.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK) - To some extent related to sedation and
   baseline liver disease. will try to lighten propofol and titrate
   pressors down for MAP > 60.
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER - e. coli from [**11-12**] sputum, on levo. Gram negative
   rods growing from more recent sputum. Will add meropenem out of concern
   for resitant gram negative (ESBL Kleb in particular).

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several ongoing medical conditions. The patient has respiratory failure, specifically acute or ARDS, with poor oxygenation. They also have hypotension unrelated to shock, which may be due to sedation and liver disease. The patient has pneumonia caused by e. coli and other gram-negative rods. They have a history of cirrhosis of the liver and impaired skin integrity. The patient is receiving various treatments, including nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure, possibly due to ARDS, is associated with poor oxygenation. This condition can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in respiratory arrest.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension, unrelated to shock, requires careful management to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion. If not appropriately managed, it could lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of pneumonia caused by e. coli and other gram-negative rods indicates an active infection. If not promptly treated, this can worsen the patient's respiratory status and potentially lead to sepsis and septic shock.
4. Cirrhosis of the Liver: The patient's history of cirrhosis increases the risk of complications such as hepatic en"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
   ARDS - still poor oxygenation. Has increasing b/l effusion but still
   with some pressor requirement. Will try to lighten sedation and asses
   true hemodynamics with eye toward diuresis in order to improve
   oxygenation. Need to balance need to lighten sedation with desire to
   maintain low tidal volumes.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   To some extent related to sedation and baseline liver disease. will try
   to lighten propofol and titrate pressors down for MAP > 60.
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   e. coli from [**11-12**] sputum, on levo. Gram negative rods growing from
   more recent sputum. Will add meropenem out of concern for resitant gram

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have respiratory failure due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia caused by e. coli, impaired skin integrity, and cirrhosis of the liver. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 480 mL, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 at 40%. They are receiving vasopressin, norepinephrine, fentanyl, and propofol infusions. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/47-122/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 10.1 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin at 8.4 g/dL, elevated potassium at 6.4 mEq/L, and slightly low bicarbonate level at 23.0%. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Progressive respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS is not improving, as indicated by poor oxygenation and increasing bilateral effusion. There is a need to lighten sedation and assess true hemodynamics while considering diuresis to improve oxygenation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is"

   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory

   # Septic shock: Still febrile requiring NE and vasopressin. Patient
   initially presented with septic shock attributed to his pan [**Last Name (un) 46**] E coli
   pneumonia.  Shock not responsive to fluids, central venous O2 85%.
   Blood cultures did grow
 coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ
   was removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date.
   Stopped aztreonam.  Meropenem added yesterday for possible ESBL or
   klebsiella.  Having high volume liquid stool so cdiff possible.
   - Continue vancomycin/ meropenem/levofloxacin for empiric coverage
   - re-check vanc trough monday
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - send stool cx, consider adding empiric flagyl if BP drops again
   - wean propofol to help with pressor requirement
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: No resolving.  Now mental status is
   one of the primary causes of inability to wean.
   - Continue levofloxacin/vancomycin/meropenem as above
   - wean PEEP as able
   # Cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices.  Small
   amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor cr
   # Anemia: Stable.  Macrocytic.  Stools guac neg.  Hct 20 today from 23.
   - check B12/Folate
   - transfuse 2 U PRBC

   # Bloody return from NG tube: Resolved.  Appeared to have been related
   to trauma in setting of INR 2. Got vitamin K 10 mg PO x 3 days.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable. likely from cirrhosis.
   - trend for now
   # Leukopenia: unclear etiology. WBC ct 3.6 today from 6 yesterday and
   22 on admission.  ? from addition of meropenem vs bone marrow

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with HCV cirrhosis admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. He initially presented with septic shock attributed to pan E. coli pneumonia but now has an infection with coag-negative staph, likely a contaminant. The patient is still febrile and requires norepinephrine and vasopressin. Blood cultures did grow coag-negative staph, but subsequent cultures have shown no growth. Aztreonam was stopped, and meropenem was added for possible ESBL or klebsiella. The patient also has high-volume liquid stool, which raises the possibility of Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumonia, cirrhosis of the liver, impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated INR. He is currently receiving multiple medications including vancomycin, meropenem, levofloxacin, rifaximin, lactulose, and various other treatments.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening septic shock, progression of respiratory failure, development of Clostridium difficile infection, worsening liver function, development of pressure ulcers, and further deterioration of renal function. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to manage these conditions."

   # Septic shock: Still febrile requiring vasopressin. Patient initially
   presented with septic shock attributed to his pan [**Last Name (un) 46**] E coli
   pneumonia.  Shock not responsive to fluids, central venous O2 85%.
   Blood cultures did grow
 coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ
   was removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date.
   Stopped aztreonam.  Meropenem added yesterday for possible ESBL or
   klebsiella.  Having high volume liquid stool so cdiff possible.
   - Continue vancomycin/ meropenem/levofloxacin for empiric coverage
   - re-check vanc trough monday
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - send stool cx, consider adding empiric flagyl if BP drops again
   - wean propofol to help with pressor requirement
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: No resolving.  Now mental status is
   one of the primary causes of inability to wean.
   - Continue levofloxacin/vancomycin/meropenem as above
   - wean PEEP as able
   # Cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices.  Small
   amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor cr
   # Anemia: Stable.  Macrocytic.  Stools guac neg.  Hct 20 today from 23.
   - check B12/Folate

   # Bloody return from NG tube: Resolved.  Appeared to have been related
   to trauma in setting of INR 2. Got vitamin K 10 mg PO x 3 days.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable. likely from cirrhosis.
   - trend for now
   # Leukopenia: unclear etiology. WBC ct 3.6 today from 6 yesterday and
   22 on admission.  ? from addition of meropenem vs bone marrow

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and is currently experiencing mental status changes, which are likely due to hepatic encephalopathy.

2. Septic shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to pan E. coli pneumonia. Although the blood cultures grew coag negative staph, it is considered a contaminant, and the patient is being treated empirically for possible ESBL or klebsiella infection with meropenem.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure from multifocal pneumonia. Despite receiving appropriate antibiotics, the patient's respiratory failure has not resolved, and mental status is a primary cause of the inability to wean from mechanical ventilation.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices. Small amounts of ascites are present. The patient is currently delisted from liver transplantation due to an acute infection.

5. Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: The patient has a stage 2 decubitus ulcer without current signs of infection at the site. The patient is on wound care bed.

6. Acute renal failure: The patient had resolved acute renal failure, likely prerenal due to hypovolemic/septic shock. Monitoring of creatinine levels is ongoing.

   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.
   # Septic shock: Still febrile requiring vasopressin. Patient initially
   presented with septic shock attributed to his pan [**Last Name (un) 46**] E coli
   pneumonia.  Shock not responsive to fluids, central venous O2 85%.
   Blood cultures did grow
 coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ
   was removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date.
   Stopped aztreonam.  Meropenem added yesterday for possible ESBL or
   klebsiella.  Having high volume liquid stool so cdiff possible.
   - Continue vancomycin/ meropenem/levofloxacin for empiric coverage
   - re-check vanc trough monday
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - send stool cx, consider adding empiric flagyl if BP drops again
   - wean propofol to help with pressor requirement
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: No resolving.  Now mental status is
   one of the primary causes of inability to wean.
   - Continue levofloxacin/vancomycin/meropenem as above
   - wean PEEP as able
   # Cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices.  Small
   amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor cr
   # Anemia: Stable.  Macrocytic.  Stools guac neg.  Hct 20 today from 23.
   - check B12/Folate
   - transfuse 2 U PRBC
   - pm hct
   # Bloody return from NG tube: Resolved.  Appeared to have been related
   to trauma in setting of INR 2. Got vitamin K 10 mg PO x 3 days.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable. likely from cirrhosis.
   - trend for now
   # Leukopenia: unclear etiology. WBC ct 3.6 today from 6 yesterday and
   22 on admission.  ? from addition of meropenem vs bone marrow
   supression in the setting of infection.
   - trend for now
   # Elevated INR: ? from poor nutritional status vs cirrhosis.  S/p Vit K
   10 mg po X 3 days ([**Date range (1) 3107**]) w/ some improvement.
   - trend for now

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis. He presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient initially had septic shock attributed to E. coli pneumonia, but blood cultures grew coag-negative staph, which is likely a contaminant. The patient was started on meropenem for possible ESBL or klebsiella infection. 

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is not resolving, and mental status is one of the primary causes of the inability to wean. 
2. Septic Shock: The patient is still febrile and requires vasopressin. 
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by E. coli, but the blood cultures did not grow any organisms except for coag-negative staph, which is considered a contaminant. 
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices. There is a small amount of ascites present. 
5. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a stage 2 decubitus ulcer without signs of infection. 
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient had acute renal failure, but it has resolved. 
7. Anemia: The patient has stable macrocytic anemia. 
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient"

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to pan E. coli pneumonia. He required vasopressin for persistent hypotension, indicating possible septic shock. Blood cultures did grow coag-negative Staphylococcus, which is likely a contaminant. The patient has been receiving meropenem, vancomycin, and levofloxacin for empiric coverage.

The patient's mental status has worsened, making it difficult to wean him off mechanical ventilation. He is also experiencing high-volume liquid stools, raising the possibility of Clostridium difficile infection. The patient has a history of cirrhosis with encephalopathy and grade II varices. He also has small ascites and is currently delisted from liver transplant due to acute infection.

The patient has a stage 2 decubitus ulcer but no signs of infection at the site. He has resolved acute renal failure, which was likely prerenal due to hypovolemic/septic shock. His anemia is stable and macrocytic, with a decrease in hemoglobin from 23 to 20 today. The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to cirrhosis, and his leukopenia has unclear etiology, possibly related to the addition of meropenem or bone marrow suppression in the setting of infection.

The patient's elevated INR may be attributed to poor nutritional status or cirrhosis. He received vitamin K 10 mg PO x 3 days, resulting in some improvement. The patient had a bloody return from the NG tube, which resolved after administering vitamin K.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving fibrous HN (full) nutrition through a feeding tube at 60 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being maintained using regular insulin sliding scale. The patient has multiple lines including an indwelling port, arterial line, and multi-lumen line. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with subcutaneous UF heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and VAP prevention with elevation of the head of bed, mouth care, and daily wake-up.

Overall, the patient's main medical complications include hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, possible C. difficile infection, cirrhosis with encephalopathy and varices, stage 2 decubitus ulcer, resolved acute renal failure, stable macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, elevated INR, and bloody return from the NG tube."

   septic shock attributed to his pan [**Last Name (un) 46**] E coli pneumonia.  Shock not
   responsive to fluids, central venous O2 85%.  Blood cultures did grow
   coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ was removed [**11-14**] as a
   precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date. Stopped aztreonam.
   Meropenem added yesterday for possible ESBL.
   - Continue vancomycin/ meropenem/levofloxacin for empiric coverage

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains with acute lung injury and treatment for pneumonia is ongoing. The worsening fluid balance is likely affecting the ability to wean the patient off mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is due to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) from liver disease and sedation. Vasopressin has been changed to levophed to allow for diuresis with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >60. The patient is no longer considered to have septic physiology from infection.

3. Leukopenia: The cause of leukopenia is unclear, with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 3.2 today, which has been at or below 4 for several days. The WBC on admission was 22. The possible causes include addition of meropenem or bone marrow suppression in the setting of infection. The trend will be monitored for now.

4. Septic Shock from PNA: The patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to his pan E. coli pneumonia. However, the shock was not responsive to fluids, and the central venous oxygen saturation was 85%. Blood cultures did grow coag-negative Staphylococcus, likely a contaminant, but the line infection was removed on [**11-14**]. Serial cultures have shown no growth to date, and aztreonam has been stopped. Meropenem has been added for possible extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production. Empiric coverage with vancomycin, meropenem, and levofloxacin will continue, and vanc levels are pending for today. Sputum cultures will be followed up, and stool cultures for Clostridium difficile will be sent.

5. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices. A small amount of ascites is present. Treatment with rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy will continue, as well as monitoring of liver function tests. The patient is currently delisted from transplantation due to acute infection, and platelet trends will be monitored.

6. Stage 2 Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a stage 2 decubitus ulcer without current signs of infection. Wound care will be continued, and the ulcer will be monitored closely.

7. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure has resolved and is likely prerenal due to hypovolemic/septic shock. Monitoring of creatinine levels will continue.

8. Anemia: The patient has stable macrocytic anemia with a hemat"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. They have been experiencing respiratory failure and are currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has liver disease and is showing signs of shock, although it has largely resolved. They have been aggressively diuresed today with the aim of reaching a negative fluid balance of 1-2 liters. Propofol has been used for sedation, but oxygenation is still not sufficient for extubation, so a low tidal volume ventilation strategy is being maintained. The patient also has cirrhosis and is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Measures such as head-of-bed elevation and oral care have been implemented to reduce this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylaxis with boots and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin has been initiated.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms. Treatment with lactulose and rifaximin aims to reduce ammonia levels in the blood.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure (BP) indicates potential hypotension. Close"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, currently admitted to the MICU for pneumonia and sepsis. He was listed for a liver transplant but is now experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has shown improvement in terms of fever and decreased pressor requirements. However, he still requires aggressive diuresis and is unable to be weaned off the ventilator due to baseline low SVR in the setting of liver disease. His condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure and is dependent on mechanical ventilation. The inability to wean him off the ventilator suggests a potential complication related to his respiratory function.
2. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis secondary to pneumonia. Although he has improved with antibiotic therapy, there is still a risk of recurrent or worsening sepsis.
3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's underlying liver disease (HCV cirrhosis) can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and renal dysfunction.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure at presentation but resolved with volume resuscitation. There is a risk of developing renal failure again due to the ongoing critical illness and potential nephrotoxic effects of certain medications.
5. Bleeding: Due to the patient's liver disease and the use of"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.
   # Respiratory Failure: Remains with acute lung injury. Continues
   treatment for pneumonia. Worsening fluid balance likely affecting
   ability to wean.
   - Continue levo/vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - Diuresis with lasix, goal -1L
   - Continue sedation with propofol with fentanyl as needed for pain
   - Wean PEEP if able
   - Check vancomycin level
   # Hypotension: Due to decreased SVR from liver disease, sedation.  Feel
   patient no longer with septic physiology from infection.
   - Patient off pressors
   - Continue to monitor MAPs with A-line
   # Leukopenia: Unclear etiology. WBC ct 3.2 today, at or under 4 for
   several days, WBC 22 on admission.  Question from addition of meropenem
   vs bone marrow supression in the setting of infection.
   - Continue to trend
   # Septic shock from PNA: resolved.  Patient initially presented with
   septic shock attributed to his pan [**Last Name (un) 46**] E coli pneumonia.  Shock not
   responsive to fluids, central venous O2 85%.  Blood cultures did grow
   coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ was removed [**11-14**] as a
   precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date. Stopped aztreonam.
   Meropenem added yesterday for possible ESBL.
   - Continue vancomycin/meropenem/levofloxacin for empiric coverage
   - vanc level pending for today - f/u sputum cultures
   - C. difficile negative x 3
   # Cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices.  Small
   amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatitine
   # Anemia: Stable.  Macrocytic.  Stools guaiac negative.  Due to liver
   disease with B12/folate within normal limits.
   - Monitor daily
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable. Due to cirrhosis.
   - Monitor daily
   # Coagulopathy: Multifactorial in the setting of cirrhosis, poor
   nutrition, and antibiotic use.  S/p Vit K 10 mg po X 3 days ([**Date range (1) 3107**])
   w/ some improvement.
   - Monitor daily
   # Bloody return from NG tube: Resolved.  Appeared to have been related
   to trauma in setting of INR 2. Got vitamin K 10 mg PO x 3 days.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. He has acute lung injury, worsening fluid balance, and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient is hypotensive but off pressors, and his leukocyte count is low. He was initially septic from E. coli pneumonia but has resolved. The patient has cirrhosis with encephalopathy and grade II varices, as well as a stage 2 decubitus ulcer. His acute renal failure has resolved, and he has anemia and thrombocytopenia likely due to cirrhosis. He also has coagulopathy, which is multifactorial. The patient's bloody return from the NG tube has resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains with acute lung injury and continues treatment for pneumonia. Worsening fluid balance may affect his ability to wean from mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive due to decreased systemic vascular resistance from liver disease and sedation. He is no longer believed to be in septic shock.
3. Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count is low, possibly due to bone marrow suppression from antibiotics or another etiology. It should be monitored.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count likely due to cirrhosis."

","Summary:
- The patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure from multifocal pneumonia.
- He has acute lung injury, worsening fluid balance, and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation.
- The patient also has hypotension due to decreased SVR from liver disease and sedation, but no longer has septic physiology from infection.
- He has leukopenia with a WBC count below 4 for several days, which may be due to bone marrow suppression or addition of meropenem.
- The patient previously experienced septic shock from pneumonia, but it has resolved.
- He has cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices, small amount of ascites, and a stage 2 decubitus ulcer.
- The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, and he has stable anemia and thrombocytopenia due to cirrhosis.
- He has a coagulopathy that is multifactorial in the setting of cirrhosis, poor nutrition, and antibiotic use.
- The bloody return from the NG tube has resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains with acute lung injury and worsening fluid balance, making it difficult to wean off mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension due to decreased SVR from liver disease and sedation. Continuous monitoring and management are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Leukopenia: The patient has leukopenia with a WBC count below 4 for several days. It is important to monitor the trend and determine the underlying cause, which may be bone marrow suppression or the addition of meropenem.
4. Septic Shock: Although the patient's septic shock from pneumonia has resolved, it is essential to continue monitoring for any signs of recurrence.
5. Cirrhosis Complications: The patient has cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices, small amount of ascites, and a stage 2 decubitus ulcer. These complications require ongoing management and monitoring.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable thrombocytopenia due to cirrhosis. Close monitoring of platelet counts is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy that is multifactorial in the setting of cirrhosis, poor nutrition, and antibiotic use. Regular monitoring of coagulation parameters is essential.
8. Acute Renal Failure: Although the patient's acute renal failure has resolved, monitoring renal function remains important to detect any potential deterioration.
9. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia due to liver disease. Daily monitoring is required to assess the need for intervention.
10. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a stage 2 decubitus ulcer. Regular turning, wound care, and pressure relief measures"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.
   # Respiratory Failure: remains with acute lung injury. Continues
   treatment for pneumonia. Worsening fluid balance likely affecting
   ability to wean
   - levo/vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
   - diuresis with lasix, I/O neg 1 liter
   - cont sedation as not able to extubate from vent or mental status
   standpoint: use propofol sedation, fentanyl pain
   - wean PEEP if able
   - vanc level pending for today
   # Hypotension: due to decreased SVR from liver disease, sedation.
   Change vasopressin to levophed to allow for diuresis with MAP goal >60.
   Feel patient no longer with septic physiology from infection.
   - levophed, off vasopressin
   - continue to monitor MAPs with a-line
   # Leukopenia: unclear etiology. WBC ct 3.2 today, at or under 4 for
   several days, WBC 22 on admission.  ? from addition of meropenem vs
   bone marrow supression in the setting of infection.
   - trend for now
   # Septic shock from PNA: resolved.  Patient initially presented with
   septic shock attributed to his pan [**Last Name (un) 46**] E coli pneumonia.  Shock not
   responsive to fluids, central venous O2 85%.  Blood cultures did grow
   coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ was removed [**11-14**] as a
   precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date. Stopped aztreonam.
   Meropenem added yesterday for possible ESBL.
   - Continue vancomycin/ meropenem/levofloxacin for empiric coverage
   - vanc level pending for today - f/u sputum cultures
   - send stool cx, and c. diff cultures
   # Cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices.  Small
   amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor cr
   # Anemia: Stable.  Macrocytic.  Stools guac neg.  Hct 20 today from 23.
   - check B12/Folate
   - pm hct
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable. likely from cirrhosis.
   - trend for now
   # Coagulopathy: Multifactorial in the setting of cirrhosis, poor
   nutrition, and antibiotic use.  S/p Vit K 10 mg po X 3 days ([**Date range (1) 3107**])
   w/ some improvement.
   - trend for now
   # Bloody return from NG tube: Resolved.  Appeared to have been related
   to trauma in setting of INR 2. Got vitamin K 10 mg PO x 3 days.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to multifocal pneumonia. He remains in acute lung injury and continues treatment for pneumonia. The patient also has worsening fluid balance, which is likely affecting his ability to wean off mechanical ventilation.

The patient's hypotension is attributed to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) from liver disease and sedation. Vasopressin has been changed to levophed to allow for diuresis with a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >60. The patient is no longer believed to have septic physiology from infection.

Leukopenia is present, with a white blood cell count of 3.2 today, at or below 4 for several days, and 22 on admission. The etiology is unclear, with possible causes including the addition of meropenem or bone marrow suppression in the setting of infection. Trending for now is advised.

The patient previously experienced septic shock from pneumonia, initially attributed to his pan E. coli pneumonia. Shock was not responsive to fluids, and central venous O2 saturation was 85%. Blood cultures did grow coag-negative staphylococci, which are likely contaminants. The line infection was removed on 11/14. Serial cultures have shown no growth to date. Aztreonam has been stopped, and meropenem has been added for possible"

   failure from multifocal pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure: Remains with acute lung injury. Continues
   treatment for pneumonia. Worsening fluid balance likely affecting
   ability to wean.
   - Continue levofloxacin/meropenem to complete a seven-day course;
   discontinuing vancomycin given absence of gram positives
   - Diuresis with lasix, goal -2L today
   - Continue sedation with propofol with fentanyl as needed for agitation
 increasing seroquel to attempt to decrease agitation
   - Wean PEEP if able
   # Hypotension/Tachycardia: Due to decreased SVR from liver disease,
   sedation.  Feel patient no longer with septic physiology from
   infection.  Tachycardia likely due to pressors, agitation.
   - Change levophed to neosynephrine for tachycardia during diuresis
   - Continue sedation with propofol with fentanyl as needed for agitation
 increasing seroquel to attempt to decrease agitation
   - Continue to monitor MAPs with A-line
   # Leukopenia: Unclear etiology.  Question medication effect vs bone
   marrow supression in the setting of infection.
   - Discontinue vancomycin today
   - Continue to trend
   # Septic shock from PNA: Resolved.  Patient initially presented with
   septic shock attributed to his pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Blood
   cultures did grow
 coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ was
   removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date.
   Stopped aztreonam.  Meropenem added for possible ESBL.
   - Continue levofloxacin/meropenem to complete a seven-day course;
   discontinuing vancomycin given absence of gram positives
   - C. difficile negative x 3
   # Dirty urinalysis: Yeast grew from culture.
   - Change Foley and repeat UA
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices.  Small amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatitine
   # Anemia: Stable.  Macrocytic.  Stools guaiac negative.  Due to liver
   disease with B12/folate within normal limits.
   - Monitor daily
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable. Due to cirrhosis.
   - Monitor daily
   # Coagulopathy: Multifactorial in the setting of cirrhosis, poor
   nutrition, and antibiotic use.  S/p Vit K 10 mg po X 3 days ([**Date range (1) 3107**])

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with HCV cirrhosis presenting with hypoxemic respiratory failure from multifocal pneumonia. The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, hypotension/tachycardia, leukopenia, septic shock from pneumonia (resolved), dirty urinalysis, hepatitis C cirrhosis, stage 2 decubitus ulcer, acute renal failure (resolved), anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient was weaned off levophed and back on low dose for diuresis.
- Diuresed to lasix 20 mg IV x 3, last dose given this morning.
- Fentanyl was temporarily stopped but the patient became restless and restarted on a low dose, continued on propofol.
- Vancomycin trough was 28.4 this morning and decreased dose.
- Allergies include Nafcillin.
- The patient has renal toxicity and received antibiotics such as levofloxacin, vancomycin, and meropenem.
- Infusions include norepinephrine, fentanyl, and propofol.
- Other ICU medications include heparin sodium (prophylaxis) and furosemide (Lasix).
- The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 76/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.
- Physical examination reveals sacral decubiti, warm skin, and normal bowel sounds.
- Laboratory results indicate leukopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and altered coagulation profile.
- The patient's condition remains stable with ongoing treatment for pneumonia and management of other complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute lung injury may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia could be due to decreased systemic vascular resistance from liver disease and ongoing sepsis. If not managed appropriately, it could lead to shock.
3. Leukopenia: The cause of leukopenia needs further investigation. If it is due to medication effect or bone marrow suppression, appropriate measures should be taken to address it.
4. Septic Shock: Although the patient's septic shock from pneumonia has resolved, there is a risk of recurrence if the infection is not completely treated.
5. Dirty Urinalysis: The presence of yeast in the urine suggests a possible urinary tract infection. This should be closely monitored and treated if necessary.
6. Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: The patient's underlying liver disease can lead to complications such as encephalopathy and varices. These should be managed appropriately.
7. Stage 2 Decubitus Ulcer: The patient's stage 2 decubitus"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.
   # Respiratory Failure: Remains with acute lung injury. Continues
   treatment for pneumonia. Worsening fluid balance likely affecting
   ability to wean.
   - Continue levofloxacin/meropenem to complete a seven-day course;
   discontinuing vancomycin given absence of gram positives
   - Diuresis with lasix, goal -2L today
   - Continue sedation with propofol with fentanyl as needed for agitation
   - Wean PEEP if able
   # Hypotension/Tachycardia: Due to decreased SVR from liver disease,
   sedation.  Feel patient no longer with septic physiology from
   infection.  Tachycardia likely due to pressors, agitation.
   - Change levophed to neosynephrine for tachycardia during diuresis
   - Continue sedation with propofol with fentanyl as needed for agitation
   - Continue to monitor MAPs with A-line
   # Leukopenia: Unclear etiology.  Question medication effect vs bone
   marrow supression in the setting of infection.
   - Discontinue vancomycin today
   - Continue to trend
   # Septic shock from PNA: Resolved.  Patient initially presented with
   septic shock attributed to his pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Blood
   cultures did grow
 coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ was
   removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date.
   Stopped aztreonam.  Meropenem added for possible ESBL.
   - Continue levofloxacin/meropenem to complete a seven-day course;
   discontinuing vancomycin given absence of gram positives
   - C. difficile negative x 3
   # Cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices.  Small
   amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatitine
   # Anemia: Stable.  Macrocytic.  Stools guaiac negative.  Due to liver
   disease with B12/folate within normal limits.
   - Monitor daily
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable. Due to cirrhosis.
   - Monitor daily
   # Coagulopathy: Multifactorial in the setting of cirrhosis, poor
   nutrition, and antibiotic use.  S/p Vit K 10 mg po X 3 days ([**Date range (1) 3107**])
   w/ some improvement.
   - Monitor daily
   # Bloody return from NG tube: Resolved.  Appeared to have been related
   to trauma in setting of INR 2. Got vitamin K 10 mg PO x 3 days.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. He remains in acute lung injury and is being treated for pneumonia. The patient's fluid balance is worsening, which is affecting his ability to wean from mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute lung injury may lead to further respiratory failure if not properly managed. Treatment for pneumonia should be continued, and the goal is to improve fluid balance to aid in weaning from mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient is experiencing hypotension and tachycardia, likely due to decreased systemic vascular resistance from liver disease and sedation. It is important to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status closely and adjust pressor support as needed.

3. Leukopenia: The patient has leukopenia, but the etiology is unclear. Medication effects or bone marrow suppression in the setting of infection should be considered. Monitoring of white blood cell counts is necessary.

4. Septic Shock from PNA: Although the patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to pan-sensitive E. coli pneumonia, it is now resolved. However, coag-negative Staphylococcus was grown in blood cultures, which may be a contaminant. Serial cultures have shown no growth to date. Appropriate antibiotics should be continued to"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.
   # Respiratory Failure: Remains with acute lung injury. Continues
   treatment for pneumonia. Worsening fluid balance likely affecting
   ability to wean.
   - Continue levo/vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]
 decreased dose of vancomycin
   - Diuresis with lasix, goal -1L
   - Continue sedation with propofol with fentanyl as needed for pain
   - Wean PEEP if able
   # Hypotension: Due to decreased SVR from liver disease, sedation.  Feel
   patient no longer with septic physiology from infection.
   - Levophed PRN during diuresis
   - Continue to monitor MAPs with A-line
   # Leukopenia: Unclear etiology. WBC ct 3.2 today, at or under 4 for
   several days, WBC 22 on admission.  Question from addition of meropenem
   vs bone marrow supression in the setting of infection.
   - Continue to trend
   # Septic shock from PNA: resolved.  Patient initially presented with
   septic shock attributed to his pan [**Last Name (un) 46**] E coli pneumonia.  Shock not
   responsive to fluids, central venous O2 85%.  Blood cultures did grow
   coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ was removed [**11-14**] as a
   precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date. Stopped aztreonam.
   Meropenem added yesterday for possible ESBL.
   - Continue vancomycin/meropenem/levofloxacin for empiric coverage
   - vanc level pending for today - f/u sputum cultures
   - C. difficile negative x 3
   # Cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices.  Small
   amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatitine
   # Anemia: Stable.  Macrocytic.  Stools guaiac negative.  Due to liver
   disease with B12/folate within normal limits.
   - Monitor daily
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable. Due to cirrhosis.
   - Monitor daily
   # Coagulopathy: Multifactorial in the setting of cirrhosis, poor
   nutrition, and antibiotic use.  S/p Vit K 10 mg po X 3 days ([**Date range (1) 3107**])
   w/ some improvement.
   - Monitor daily
   # Bloody return from NG tube: Resolved.  Appeared to have been related
   to trauma in setting of INR 2. Got vitamin K 10 mg PO x 3 days.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis who was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains with acute lung injury and continues treatment for pneumonia. His worsening fluid balance is likely affecting his ability to wean from mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is due to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) from liver disease and sedation. It is believed that the patient no longer has septic physiology from infection.

3. Leukopenia: The patient's leukopenia (low white blood cell count) has an unclear etiology. His WBC count has been consistently below normal for several days, and there is a question regarding the addition of meropenem versus bone marrow suppression in the setting of infection.

4. Septic Shock from Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to his pan E. coli pneumonia. The shock was not responsive to fluids, and the central venous O2 saturation was 85%. Blood cultures did grow coag-negative staph, which is likely a contaminant. Serial cultures have shown no growth to date, and the aztreonam was stopped. Meropenem was added yesterday for possible extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of pulmonary hemorrhage and renal failure. The patient was weaned off propofol but showed signs of restlessness, tachycardia, and hypertension, so propofol was restarted at a low dose. The patient's hematocrit dropped from 25.5 to 22.3, and there was an increase in pulmonary bloody secretions, leading to the discontinuation of heparin. The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and two units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP).

The patient's medications were converted to oral form since the gut is working, and captopril was started to control blood pressure. Nitro drip was stopped, and sodium levels fell, prompting an increase in fluid intake and plans for early morning hemodialysis (HD) to remove excess fluid.

The last arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 155.

The patient has a history of allergies to nafcillin and renal toxicity. The last doses of antibiotics administered were levofloxacin at 06:24 PM on 11/20, vancomycin at 08:00 PM on 11/20, and meropenem at 12:00 AM on 11/21.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of norepinephrine, fentanyl, and propofol. Heparin sodium was given as prophylaxis from 04:00 PM on 11/20. Furosemide (Lasix) was administered at 07:22 AM on 11/21.

Review of systems shows agitation with lightened sedation, now increased sedation. The patient has an orogastric (OG) tube and is receiving tube feeds. There is also a mention of psychiatric/sleep issues.

Flowsheet data indicates vital signs such as temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range, with an intake-output balance showing a negative fluid balance.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with settings including tidal volume (Vt), respiratory rate (RR), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), plateau pressure, compliance, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI).

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, and neurologic assessment, which were not performed due to the patient being sedated. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine (Cr) and potassium (K+), along with low hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), and albumin levels.

The patient has several problems, including respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypotension (not"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and Hepatitis C. He was admitted with sepsis, respiratory failure, and pneumonia. His current condition shows normalized hemodynamics and weaning vent settings. The patient started aggressive diuresis yesterday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal toxicity: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored due to the use of nephrotoxic medications such as vancomycin and meropenem. Regular assessment of serum creatinine levels and urine output is necessary to detect any early signs of renal impairment.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's ESLD, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring for changes in mental status, such as confusion or altered level of consciousness, is essential. Liver function tests should also be regularly checked to assess the patient's hepatic status.

3. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently stable, there is still a risk of sepsis due to his immunocompromised state. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, particularly temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate, is crucial. Frequent assessment of laboratory parameters, including white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin, can aid in early detection of infection.

4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): As the patient is still receiving mechanical ventilation, the risk of developing V"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was admitted with sepsis and respiratory failure due to pneumonia. He has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently showing signs of improvement, with normalized hemodynamics and the ability to wean off vent settings. The patient started an aggressive diuresis yesterday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient was admitted with sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not adequately treated.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension in the setting of diuresis and propofol infusion. Close monitoring and appropriate adjustments in fluid and medication administration are necessary to maintain stable blood pressure.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which requires appropriate antibiotic therapy. There is a risk of treatment failure or development of antibiotic resistance if the correct antibiotics are not administered.
5. Liver disease: The patient's ESLD puts him at higher risk for complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and impaired metabolism of drugs.
6. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored due to the use of nephrotoxic medications and potential effects of sepsis"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.
   # Leukopenia and Bandemia: Unclear etiology.  Question medication
   effect vs bone marrow supression in the setting of infection and/or
   Hepatitis C. Bandemia may be recovery after discontinuation of
   vancomycin
   - Discontinue levofloxacin
   - Pan culture
   -U/s at bedside to assess for fluid to tap
   - Continue to trend
   # Respiratory failure: Remains with acute lung injury vs. fluid
   overload. Continues treatment for pneumonia.
   - Meropenem day [**4-20**]
   - Start LASIX drip for goal -2L today
   - Continue sedation with propofol with fentanyl as needed for agitation
 increasing seroquel to attempt to decrease agitation
   - Hold on weaning PEEP and sedation until clinical improvement
   # Hypotension/Tachycardia: Due to decreased SVR from liver disease,
   sedation.  Feel patient no longer with septic physiology from
   infection.  Tachycardia likely due to pressors, agitation.
   - On neosynephrine during diuresis
   - Continue seroquel
   - Continue sedation with propofol with fentanyl as needed for agitation
   - Continue to monitor MAPs with A-line
   # Septic shock from PNA: Resolved.  Patient initially presented with
   septic shock attributed to his pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Blood
   cultures did grow
 coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ was
   removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date.
   Stopped aztreonam.  Meropenem added for possible ESBL.  C. difficile
   negative x 3
   -Meropenem day [**4-20**]
   # Dirty urinalysis: Yeast grew from culture.
   - Change Foley and repeat UA
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices.  Small amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatitine
   # Anemia: Stable.  Macrocytic.  Stools guaiac negative.  Due to liver
   disease with B12/folate within normal limits.
   - Monitor daily
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable. Due to cirrhosis.
   - Monitor daily
   # Coagulopathy: Multifactorial in the setting of cirrhosis, poor
   nutrition, and antibiotic use.  S/p Vit K 10 mg po X 3 days ([**Date range (1) 3107**])
   w/ some improvement.
   -          Monitor daily
   -
   # Bloody return from NG tube: Resolved.  Appeared to have been related
   to trauma in setting of INR 2. Got vitamin K 10 mg PO x 3 days. INR
   improved.

","The patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. He has a history of encephalopathy, grade II varices, and small amount of ascites related to his liver disease. The patient also has anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy, all of which are complications of cirrhosis.

During his ICU stay, the patient has had several medical complications. He initially presented with septic shock attributed to his pan-sensitive E. coli pneumonia, but subsequent blood cultures grew coag-negative staph, likely a contaminant. The patient was placed on meropenem for possible ESBL-producing bacteria. He also had a urinary tract infection with yeast growth from the culture.

The patient's respiratory failure remains unresolved, and he continues treatment for pneumonia. There is concern for acute lung injury versus fluid overload. The patient's hypotension and tachycardia are likely due to decreased systemic vascular resistance from liver disease and sedation. The weaning of PEEP and sedation has been held off until clinical improvement is seen.

The patient's dirty urinalysis showed yeast growth, so a Foley catheter change and repeat urine analysis were ordered. His Hepatitis C cirrhosis is complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices. He has a small amount of ascites and continues on rifaximin and lactulose for enceph"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis presenting with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains with acute lung injury and treatment for pneumonia continues. The worsening fluid balance is likely affecting the ability to wean the patient off mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient has hypotension and tachycardia due to decreased systemic vascular resistance from liver disease, sedation, and possibly pressors. The change in medication from levophed to neosynephrine is aimed at addressing the tachycardia during diuresis.

3. Leukopenia: The etiology of leukopenia is unclear, with possibilities including medication effect or bone marrow suppression in the setting of infection. Discontinuation of vancomycin has been planned.

4. Septic shock from PNA: The patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to pan-sensitive E. coli pneumonia. Blood cultures grew coag-negative Staphylococcus, likely a contaminant, but the line infection was removed on [**11-14**]. Serial cultures have shown no growth to date, and aztreonam has been stopped. Meropenem has been added for possible extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production.

5. Dirty urinalysis: Yeast grew from the culture, and the Foley catheter has been changed with a repeat urinalysis planned.

6. Hepatitis C cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices. There is also a small amount of ascites present. Treatment with rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy continues, although lactulose is being held due to liquid stools.

7. Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: The patient has a stage 2 decubitus ulcer without current signs of infection at the site. The patient is on wound care bed, and appropriate wound care is being monitored.

8. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, likely due to hypovolemic/septic shock. Monitoring of creatinine levels will continue.

9. Anemia: The patient has stable macrocytic anemia, likely due to liver disease with normal vitamin B12/folate levels. Monitoring of anemia will continue.

10. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable thrombocytopenia due to cirrhosis. Daily monitoring of platelet levels will be continued.

11. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy multifactorial in the setting of cirrhosis, poor nutrition, and antibiotic use. Vitamin K supplementation has been given, resulting in some improvement.

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and end-stage liver disease. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis of the liver. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 105/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,096 mL and output of 4,460 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,364 mL. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including fentanyl, propofol, pantoprazole, heparin, and lasix. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, elevated total bilirubin, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may worsen due to underlying conditions such as pneumonia or ARDS. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate interventions, including weaning off mechanical ventilation, will be necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to sepsis or inadequate fluid resuscitation. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate hemodynamic support, such as vasopressors,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). He is experiencing respiratory failure and multi-focal pneumonia. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is being aggressively diuresed. His urine culture showed a positive result for [Name2 (NI)].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of respiratory failure poses a significant risk. His ARDS and multi-focal pneumonia may lead to further deterioration in lung function, potentially resulting in decreased oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination.
2. Infection: The positive urine culture for [Name2 (NI)] suggests a possible infection. This could indicate a urinary tract infection or a bloodstream infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the patient may still be at risk of developing sepsis or experiencing worsening of his current infections.
3. Volume Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive net fluid intake of 1,364 mL over 24 hours, indicating potential volume overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory function.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings consistently show low values, indicating hypotension. This could be due to his ESLD, sepsis, or the effects of medications. Maintaining adequate blood pressure is crucial to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
5. Weaning from Vent"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has persistent low-grade fevers, leukopenia, and a positive culture for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). He is receiving aggressive diuresis and has been weaned off the ventilator. His vital signs are stable, but he is still sedated and unresponsive. The patient's abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender, distended abdomen. He has a history of allergies to nafcillin and renal toxicity. The patient's recent lab results show elevated liver enzymes and low albumin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, which is a common complication in patients who are mechanically ventilated for an extended period. The presence of leukopenia and positive cultures indicate an ongoing infection. There is a higher suspicion for a medication effect rather than a new infection, so broad-spectrum antibiotics will be continued, and cultures will be recultured.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's ESLD puts him at risk for complications related to liver dysfunction. This includes hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and increased susceptibility to infections.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient is experiencing volume"

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis who is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Leukopenia and bandemia: The patient has low white blood cell count and the presence of bands (immature white blood cells), which could indicate a bone marrow suppression or infection. The etiology is unclear, and further investigation is needed.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient remains with acute lung injury or fluid overload. Treatment for pneumonia continues, including the use of meropenem, and the goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of -2L today.

3. Hypotension/tachycardia: The patient has hypotension and tachycardia, likely due to decreased systemic vascular resistance from liver disease and sedation. The patient is no longer considered to be in septic physiology from infection, and the tachycardia may be attributed to pressors and agitation.

4. Septic shock from pneumonia: The patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to pan-sensitive E. coli pneumonia. However, subsequent blood cultures grew coag-negative staph, which was likely a contaminant. Serial cultures have shown no growth to date, and the patient is no longer considered to have septic shock.

5. Dirty urinalysis: Yeast grew from the urinalysis culture, indicating a fungal infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure: Remains with acute lung injury vs. fluid
   overload. Continues treatment for pneumonia.
   - Meropenem day [**5-21**]
   - Hold lasix, given contraction alkalosis to preserve  negative 2
   liters
   - Continue sedation with propofol with fentanyl as needed for agitation
 increasing seroquel to attempt to decrease agitation
   - Wean PEEP and sedation given clinical improvement
   - SBT tomorrow
   - check pm ABG
 may need acetazolamide
   # Leukopenia and Bandemia: Improving off vancomycin and levofloxacin.
   Question medication effect vs bone marrow supression in the setting of
   infection and/or Hepatitis C. Bandemia from several days ago likely may
   be  recovery. s/p paracentesis with transudative effusion.
   - F/U Pan culture
 all results negative to date
   - Continue to trend
   # Hypotension/Tachycardia: Due to decreased SVR from liver disease,
   sedation.  Feel patient no longer with septic physiology from
   infection.  Tachycardia likely due to pressors, agitation.
   - On neosynephrine during diuresis
   - Continue seroquel
   - Wean sedation with propofol with fentanyl as needed for agitation
   - Continue to monitor MAPs with A-line
   # Septic shock from PNA: Resolved.  Patient initially presented with
   septic shock attributed to his pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Blood
   cultures did grow
 coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ was
   removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date.
   Stopped aztreonam.  Meropenem added for possible ESBL.  C. difficile
   negative x 3
   -Meropenem day [**4-20**]
   # Dirty urinalysis: Yeast grew from culture.
   - Change Foley and repeat urine culture pending
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices.  Small amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatitine
   # Anemia: Stable.  Macrocytic.  Stools guaiac negative.  Due to liver
   disease with B12/folate within normal limits.
   - Monitor daily
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable. Due to cirrhosis.
   - Monitor daily
   # Coagulopathy: Multifactorial in the setting of cirrhosis, poor
   nutrition, and antibiotic use.  S/p Vit K 10 mg po X 3 days ([**Date range (1) 3107**])
   w/ some improvement.
   -          Monitor daily
   # Bloody return from NG tube: Resolved.  Appeared to have been related
   to trauma in setting of INR 2. Got vitamin K 10 mg PO x 3 days. INR
   improved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia.
- The patient has been treated for pneumonia with meropenem, and lasix has been held due to contraction alkalosis.
- He is sedated with propofol and fentanyl as needed for agitation, and seroquel has been increased to decrease agitation.
- The patient's clinical improvement has led to a plan to wean PEEP and sedation, with a scheduled spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) tomorrow.
- His leukopenia and bandemia are improving off vancomycin and levofloxacin, but the cause is still being evaluated.
- The patient's hypotension and tachycardia are attributed to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) from liver disease and sedation.
- His septic shock from pneumonia has resolved, and he has been on neosynephrine during diuresis.
- The patient has a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, encephalopathy, grade II varices, small amount of ascites, and a stage 2 decubitus ulcer.
- His acute renal failure has resolved, and he has stable anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy due to cirrhosis.
- A bloody return from the NG tube has resolved, and the patient received vitamin K for improvement of IN"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and Hepatitis C. He was admitted with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and multifocal pneumonia. The patient's current condition indicates respiratory failure.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Meropenem), diuretics, sedatives (Fentanyl and Propofol), vasopressors (Phenylephrine), and other ICU medications.

The vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate between 86-127 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 67/41 mmHg to 99/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube with supplemental oxygen.

The physical examination reveals anasarca (generalized swelling), clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and distended extremities. Neurologic assessment is not available due to sedation.

Laboratory results indicate low white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated potassium levels, low albumin, and elevated liver enzymes. Blood cultures were negative.

Assessment and plan include managing respiratory failure with continued use of meropenem and stopping furosemide to avoid metabolic alkalosis. Sedation will be managed by bolus fentanyl prior to care and discontinuing propofol for spontaneous"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 52-year-old man with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and Hepatitis C, admitted with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and multifocal pneumonia. He has a history of allergies to nafcillin and renal toxicity. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics including vancomycin, levofloxacin, and meropenem.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/50 mmHg to 131/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His rhythm is sinus tachycardia. The patient's weight is currently 85 kg, and his height is 65 inches.

The patient has been receiving several infusions, including fentanyl, furosemide (Lasix), propofol, and phenylephrine. He is also on pantoprazole (Protonix) for prophylaxis and heparin sodium for thrombosis prophylaxis.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of -4,001 mL since 12 AM, with total input of 2,994 mL and total output of 6,995 mL. His respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set Vt (tidal volume) of 480 mL, RR (respiratory rate) set at 26 breaths per minute, PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) of 40%, and SpO2 (oxygen saturation) of 98%. The patient's ABG (arterial blood gas) shows pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, and PaO2 of 220 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, a soft and non-tender abdomen, and distended extremities. His neurologic assessment indicates that he is sedated and not fully assessed.

The patient's labs show a white blood cell count of 2.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, platelet count of 152 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels ranging from 110-137 mg/dL. Other lab values are also provided.

The patient's assessment and plan include management of respiratory failure with meropenem, sedation with bolus fentanyl and discontinuation of propofol for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), shock with neo for mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60, leukopenia with negative cultures, and further plans as per resident note. The ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and various lines and prophylaxis measures.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer bleeding, and infections due to the use of central lines and arterial lines. The patient's critically ill condition requires close monitoring and prompt management of any potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure: [**Doctor Last Name 76**] resolved, but remains sensitive to turns.
   Feel a component of the failure due to fluid overload. Continues
   treatment for pneumonia.  Patient transitioned to CPAP O/N with
   success.
   - Meropenem day [**6-20**]
   - I/O even
   - d/c fentanyl drip and use bolus fentanyl for turns
   - continue CPAP 10/5
   # Hypotension/Tachycardia: Due to decreased SVR from liver disease,
   sedation. Need to consider if patient with diuresis to improve lung
   function is intravascularly dry.
   -          trial albumin 75 gm *1
   -          I/O even
   -          Cont neosynephine for MAP goal 55
   # Leukopenia/Low grade Fever: Leukopenia resolved off vancomycin and
   levofloxacin.  Question medication effect vs bone marrow supression in
   the setting of infection and/or Hepatitis C. Bandemia from several days
   ago likely may be  recovery. s/p paracentesis with transudative
   effusion. Low grade fever raises possibility of infection, given
   overall improvement will pan culture and monitor
   - F/U Pan culture, CIS > 100.5
 all results negative to date
   - Continue to trend
   # Septic shock from PNA: Resolved.  Patient initially presented with
   septic shock attributed to his pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Blood
   cultures did grow
 coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ was
   removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date.
   Stopped aztreonam.  Meropenem added for possible ESBL.  C. difficile
   negative x 3
   -Meropenem day [**6-20**]
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices.  Small amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatitine
   # Anemia: Stable.  Macrocytic.  Stools guaiac negative.  Due to liver
   disease with B12/folate within normal limits.
   - Monitor daily
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable. Due to cirrhosis
   - Monitor daily
   # Coagulopathy: Multifactorial in the setting of cirrhosis, poor
   nutrition, and antibiotic use.  S/p Vit K 10 mg po X 3 days ([**Date range (1) 3107**])
   w/ some improvement.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient has been treated for septic shock, resolved but remains sensitive to turns, and fluid overload. He has been transitioned to CPAP successfully.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate further if not properly managed, leading to worsening hypoxemia and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: Due to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) from liver disease, the patient is at risk of persistent hypotension and tachycardia. This can be exacerbated by fluid overload and requires careful monitoring and management.

3. Leukopenia/Low-grade fever: The patient's leukopenia has resolved off vancomycin and levofloxacin, but there is a possibility of medication effect or bone marrow suppression. Additionally, the low-grade fever raises the possibility of infection, especially in the setting of Hepatitis C. Monitoring of blood cultures and close observation for signs of infection is necessary.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low due to cirrhosis. Close monitoring and management of platelet levels are essential to prevent bleeding complications.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulation disorder"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. He has been diagnosed with several medical complications including respiratory failure, leukopenia, bandemia, hypotension, tachycardia, septic shock from pneumonia, dirty urinalysis, hepatitis C cirrhosis, stage 2 decubitus ulcer, acute renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and bloody return from NG tube. The patient's condition has been improving, but he still requires ongoing treatment and monitoring for these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute lung injury vs. fluid overload needs to be managed appropriately. Treatment for pneumonia should continue.

2. Leukopenia and Bandemia: These conditions are improving off vancomycin and levofloxacin. It is important to monitor for bone marrow suppression in the setting of infection and/or Hepatitis C.

3. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's decreased SVR from liver disease, sedation, and likely pressor use needs to be managed carefully. Weaning sedation and monitoring MAPs with an arterial line is recommended.

4. Septic Shock from PNA: The patient's initial presentation of septic shock attributed to pan-sensitive E. coli pneumonia has resolved. However, coag-negative staph"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and Hepatitis C admitted to the ICU with sepsis and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and showing signs of improvement but still has some labile vital signs.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Sepsis: The patient was admitted with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. It is crucial to monitor the patient's vital signs, fluid balance, and infection parameters closely.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): ARDS is a severe lung condition that can occur as a result of pneumonia or other infections. It leads to difficulty in breathing and requires close monitoring of respiratory function, oxygenation, and ventilation parameters.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: As the patient has ESLD and Hepatitis C, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy developing. This condition causes confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms due to the buildup of toxins in the blood that the liver cannot adequately process.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which is characterized by an increase in blood pH above the normal range. This can lead to symptoms such as weakness, muscle cramps, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection who was admitted to the MICU (medical intensive care unit) due to sepsis and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) secondary to multifocal pneumonia. The patient is currently on minimal ventilator support and off vasopressors, showing steady progress. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and multifocal pneumonia. There is a potential for recurrent respiratory failure or worsening of the existing condition.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently stable with stable hemodynamics, there is still a risk of sepsis recurrence due to the underlying ESLD and HCV infection.
3. GPC (Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase) Deficiency: The patient has a positive blood glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase test, indicating a possible G6PD deficiency. This condition can lead to hemolysis when exposed to certain medications or triggers.
4. Heme Abnormalities: The patient's blood cell lines are down, indicating possible heme abnormalities. Further investigation through repeating the CBC (complete blood count) is recommended.
5. ESLD: The patient has end-stage liver disease, which puts him at risk for liver-related complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome. Close monitoring of liver function and appropriate management are crucial.
6. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer, which requires regular wound care and pressure relief measures to prevent further complications.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 52-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and HCV (hepatitis C virus) who presented with sepsis and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to multifocal pneumonia. The organism causing the pneumonia has not been isolated.
- The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation but is showing improvement, with decreasing sedation and increasing responsiveness. The plan is to extubate the patient tomorrow.
- The patient's blood culture shows GPC (Gram-positive cocci), which is likely a contaminant. However, vancomycin has been started for coverage, and further surveillance cultures are planned.
- The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, and a repeat CBC (complete blood count) is planned.
- The patient's liver function remains stable, and he continues to receive lactulose and rifaximin for ESLD. He is currently inactive on the transplant list.
- The patient's fluid balance and renal function are being monitored closely, and he is continuing with TF (total parenteral nutrition).
- The patient has a stage II sacral decubitus ulcer, which requires wound care.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with ARDS and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure or worsening lung function if not managed properly.
2. Infection: Despite completing an"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) due to Hepatitis C. He was admitted with sepsis and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) caused by multifocal pneumonia. The patient is currently on ventilator support and is being weaned off. 

The patient has allergies to Nafcillin and renal toxicity. His last doses of antibiotics were Meropenem and Vancomycin. He is also receiving Pantoprazole, Heparin sodium, and other ICU medications as needed.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F), heart rate of 110 bpm (range: 91-126 bpm), blood pressure of 118/56 mmHg (range: 75-87/40-57 mmHg), respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute (range: 0-33 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,420 mL (912 mL since 12 AM) and a total output of 2,985 mL (1,090 mL since 12 AM). The patient has received a total of 300 mL of blood products, with urine output of 1,885 mL (740 mL since 12 AM) and stool output of 1,100 mL (350 mL since 12 AM). 

The patient's laboratory results show hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dL, white blood cell count of 174 K/uL, platelet count of 113 mg/dL, sodium level of 0.5 mg/dL, potassium level of 26 mEq/L, chloride level of 3.7 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 14 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen level of 110 mEq/L, creatinine level of 140 mEq/L, glucose level of 22.5%, and lactate level of 2.1 K/uL. Other lab results are also provided.

The patient's physical examination findings include a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 of 40%, and ABG results showing pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, HCO3- of 109 mEq/L, SaO2 of 100%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 273. The patient's neurologic examination findings are not assessed.

The assessment and plan mention that the patient is making steady progress on the vent but still appears to be significantly volume overloaded. Metabolic alkalosis with high neo dose is likely intravascular depletion and total body overload. Albumin will be given today and the neo dosage will be titrated for mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 55. F"

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and HCV (hepatitis C virus) who presented with sepsis and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) secondary to multifocal pneumonia. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has completed an 8-day course of meropenem. He is now showing signs of improvement, with good oxygenation and ventilation while being weaned off the ventilator. The patient's hemodynamics are stable, and he is expected to be extubated tomorrow.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with ARDS and respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. Although he is currently improving, there is still a risk of further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or worsening hypoxemia.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has ESLD, which puts him at an increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. This can be exacerbated by medications like anticoagulants or by the presence of portal hypertension.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: ESLD can also lead to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition characterized by altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction. The patient's sedation may need to be carefully managed to prevent this complication.
4. Infection: As the patient has an immunocompromised state due to ESLD, he is at an increased risk of developing infections, including bacterial, viral, or fungal."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with end-stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C virus infection. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to multifocal pneumonia. 

The patient has completed an 8-day course of meropenem, an antibiotic, and is now on minimal ventilator support with good oxygenation and ventilation. However, his respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) remains high, indicating potential respiratory failure. 

The patient is showing signs of improvement as he is becoming more responsive, diuresis has been achieved, and there is a potential for extubation tomorrow. 

Other medical complications mentioned in the note include:

1. Gastrointestinal: The patient has ESLD (end-stage liver disease), which requires ongoing management with lactulose and rifaximin to prevent hepatic encephalopathy and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.

2. Hematologic: The patient has a low white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (Plt), indicating possible bone marrow suppression or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

3. Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is relatively stable, but he has a high heart rate (tachycardia).

4. Renal: The patient's renal function needs to be monitored due to the use of nephrotoxic medications and potential renal toxicity from sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of Hepatitis C and end-stage liver disease. He was admitted with sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to multifocal pneumonia. He is currently being treated in the ICU and is making steady progress on the ventilator. However, he appears to be significantly volume overloaded, and there is a concern for metabolic alkalosis due to high neo dosage, suggesting intravascular depletion and total body overload. The plan is to administer albumin today and titrate neo for mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 55. Fentanyl has been discontinued, and efforts will continue to minimize sedation with the aim of performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) in the morning. The patient is also completing a course of meropenem for pneumonia. Overall, the patient seems to be improving but remains labile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Volume overload: The patient's fluid balance data shows an input-output discrepancy, indicating potential volume overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening of ARDS.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's high neo dosage may have caused metabolic alkalosis, which can be associated with electrolyte imbalances and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Infection: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient may still be at risk for further infections due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient"

   Feel a component of the failure due to fluid overload. Continues
   treatment for pneumonia.  Patient transitioned to CPAP O/N with
   success.
   - Meropenem day [**6-20**]
   - I/O even
   - d/c fentanyl drip and use bolus fentanyl for turns
   - continue CPAP 10/5
   # Hypotension/Tachycardia: Due to decreased SVR from liver disease,
   sedation. Need to consider if patient with diuresis to improve lung
   function is intravascularly dry.
   -          trial albumin 75 gm *1
   -          I/O even
   -          Cont neosynephine for MAP goal 55
   # Leukopenia/Low grade Fever: Leukopenia resolved off vancomycin and
   levofloxacin.  Question medication effect vs bone marrow supression in
   the setting of infection and/or Hepatitis C. Bandemia from several days
   ago likely may be  recovery. s/p paracentesis with transudative
   effusion. Low grade fever raises possibility of infection, given
   overall improvement will pan culture and monitor
   - F/U Pan culture, CIS > 100.5
 all results negative to date
   - Continue to trend
   # Septic shock from PNA: Resolved.  Patient initially presented with
   septic shock attributed to his pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Blood
   cultures did grow
 coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ was
   removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date.
   Stopped aztreonam.  Meropenem added for possible ESBL.  C. difficile
   negative x 3
   -Meropenem day [**6-20**]
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices.  Small amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatitine
   # Anemia: Stable.  Macrocytic.  Stools guaiac negative.  Due to liver
   disease with B12/folate within normal limits.
   - Monitor daily
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable. Due to cirrhosis
   - Monitor daily
   # Coagulopathy: Multifactorial in the setting of cirrhosis, poor

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. 

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure but has shown improvement since transitioning to CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) overnight. However, he remains sensitive to turns.

2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia are likely due to decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) from liver disease. The patient is currently on neosynephrine for maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal of 55.

3. Leukopenia/Low-grade fever: The patient has leukopenia that resolved off vancomycin and levofloxacin. There is a question regarding medication effect versus bone marrow suppression in the setting of infection and/or hepatitis C. A bandemia from several days ago may be a sign of recovery.

4. Septic shock from PNA: The patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to his pan-sensitive E. coli pneumonia. Blood cultures did grow coag-negative staph, likely a contaminant, but the central line was removed as a precaution. Serial cultures have shown no growth to date, and aztreonam has been stopped. Meropenem has been added for possible extended-spectrum"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of liver failure and a history of multifocal pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 116. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/56 to 87/118 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient has undergone various diagnostic tests, including blood cultures, urine culture, stool culture, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid culture. Blood culture from November 23rd was positive for gram-positive cocci (GPC), prompting the initiation of vancomycin therapy. The patient is also receiving meropenem and heparin sodium.

The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis of the liver, and they have allergies to nafcillin. The patient's current medications include tube feeds, nutritional support, and ICU medications.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 17.4 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) at 26.7%, elevated platelet count (Plt) at 240, and normal creatinine (Cr) at 0.5 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges or show no significant abnormalities.

The patient's abdominal examination reveals a soft abdomen with present bowel sounds but distention. The extremities are edematous, and the skin is warm without rash or jaundice. Neurologically, the patient is unresponsive with non-purposeful movements and has not been assessed for tone.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory failure (other than ARDS), hypotension, pneumonia (other than ARDS), impaired skin integrity, and liver cirrhosis. These complications should be closely monitored and managed accordingly."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure from multifocal pneumonia. The potential medical complications that can arise are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had acute respiratory failure, but it seems to be resolving with pressure support. However, fluid overload may still pose a risk for further respiratory compromise.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension due to decreased systemic vascular resistance from liver disease. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis, which is complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices. Continued monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

4. Pneumonia: The patient initially had multifocal pneumonia, but there are currently no signs of ongoing infection. However, the risk of developing new infections should be monitored.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has stage 2 decubitus ulcers, which require close monitoring and appropriate wound care to prevent infection and further complications.

6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient previously had acute renal failure, which has resolved. However, ongoing monitoring of renal function is important.

7. Anemia: The patient has stable macrocytic anemia likely due to liver disease. Regular monitoring is necessary.

   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure: [**Doctor Last Name 76**] resolving; P/F = 273. Likely partly due to
   fluid overload, no sign of ongoing pneumonia at this point. He is doing
   well on pressure support and clearly is improving.
   - Meropenem day [**7-21**]
 d/c at end of day
   - I/O even
   - d/c fentanyl drip and use bolus fentanyl for turns
   # Hypotension/Tachycardia: stable after backing off from more
   aggressive diuresis.
   -          MAP goal 55
   -          Gentler diuresis today, goal 1L negative.
   -          Off pressors now, remaining stable.
   # Pancytopenia/Low grade Fever: Appears to have returned to low-grade
   fever and leucopenia as well as low Hct and Plts; this is immediately
   after starting vancomycin but actually probably too quick from start of
   med to drop in counts to attribute directly to vanco. [**Month (only) 8**] be artifact
   of dilution from fluid shifts given rapid change in setting of albumin
   administration, stopping diuresis yesterday, etc.
   - F/U Pan culture, CIS > 100.5
 all results negative to date
   - Continue to trend
   - Repeat check CBC today, retics as measure of production
   - Transfuse for <25
   - If continued decline consider replacing vancomycin despite time
   course not matching well
   # Septic shock from PNA: Resolved.  Patient initially presented with
   septic shock attributed to his pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Blood
   cultures did grow
 coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ was
   removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date.
   Stopped aztreonam.  Meropenem added for possible ESBL.  C. difficile
   negative x 3
   -Meropenem day [**7-21**]
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices.  Small amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatitine
   # Anemia: Drop in Hct along with other cells (see above in
   pancytopenia); fluid shift artifact vs global production deficit.
   Macrocytic.  Stools guaiac negative.  Due to liver disease with
   B12/folate within normal limits.
   - Monitor daily
   # Thrombocytopenia: Generally has been stable; see above re
   pancytopenia. In the past have attributed this to cirrhosis which
   remains his most chronic issue.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis. He was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient's current conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has resolving respiratory failure, likely partly due to fluid overload. He is improving on pressure support.
2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia are stable after reducing aggressive diuresis. The goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 55, and the target negative fluid balance is 1 liter per day. The patient is no longer on pressors and remains stable.
3. Pancytopenia/Low-grade fever: The patient has returned to a low-grade fever and leukopenia along with low hematocrit (Hct) and platelets. This could be related to the recent administration of vancomycin, but it may also be an artifact of dilution from fluid shifts. Further monitoring and evaluation are needed.
4. Septic shock from PNA: The patient's initial presentation of septic shock attributed to his pan-sensitive E. coli pneumonia has resolved. Blood cultures did grow coag-negative staph, which is likely a contaminant, but as a precaution, the LiJ was removed on [11-14]. Serial cultures have shown no growth to date. The patient is no longer on aztreonam, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, who was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. He has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumonia, hepatic encephalopathy, impaired skin integrity, anemia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and interventions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure from multifocal pneumonia. Although his condition is improving, close monitoring is necessary to prevent further respiratory complications.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis and is currently experiencing hepatic encephalopathy. Proper management of liver function and medication adjustments will be crucial to prevent the progression of encephalopathy.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has stage 2 decubitus ulcers, which require close monitoring for signs of infection. Appropriate wound care and pressure relief measures should be implemented to prevent further skin breakdown.

4. Thrombocytopenia and Coagulopathy: The patient has stable thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy likely due to cirrhosis and poor nutrition. Close monitoring of platelet counts and coagulation parameters is necessary, and vitamin K supplementation should be continued"

   fluid overload, no sign of ongoing pneumonia at this point. He is doing
   well on pressure support and clearly is improving.

   -          Gentler diuresis today, goal 1L negative.
   -          Off pressors now, remaining stable.
   # Pancytopenia/Low grade Fever: Appears to have returned to low-grade
   fever and leucopenia as well as low Hct and Plts; this is immediately
   after starting vancomycin but actually probably too quick from start of
   med to drop in counts to attribute directly to vanco. [**Month (only) 8**] be artifact
   of dilution from fluid shifts given rapid change in setting of albumin
   administration, stopping diuresis yesterday, etc.
   - F/U Pan culture, CIS > 100.5

   - Continue to trend
   - Repeat check CBC today, retics as measure of production
   - Transfuse for <25
   - If continued decline consider replacing vancomycin despite time
   course not matching well

   septic shock attributed to his pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Blood
   cultures did grow

   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis and is currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure, but it appears to be resolving with pressure support and clear signs of improvement.

2. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate have stabilized after backing off from aggressive diuresis. The goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55.

3. Pancytopenia/Low-grade Fever: The patient exhibits signs of pancytopenia, including low white blood cell count, low platelet count, and low hematocrit. This could be attributed to recent medication administration, specifically vancomycin, or fluid shifts due to rapid changes in the setting of albumin administration and stopping diuresis.

4. Septic Shock from PNA: The patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to his pan-sensitive E. coli pneumonia. However, subsequent blood cultures showed growth of coag-negative Staphylococcus, which is likely a contaminant. Serial cultures have shown no growth to date.

5. Hepatitis C Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices. He is"

   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure: [**Doctor Last Name 76**] resolving; P/F = 273. Likely partly due to
   fluid overload, no sign of ongoing pneumonia at this point. He is doing
   well on pressure support and clearly is improving.Patient completed an
   8 day course of Meropenem. Patient is off fentanyl drip and on bolus
   fentanyl for turns to decrease sedation.
   - I/O even
   - daily [**Last Name (un) **]
   # Hypotension/Tachycardia: stable after backing off from more
   aggressive diuresis.
   -          MAP goal 55
   -          Gentler diuresis today, goal 1L negative.
   -          Off pressors now, remaining stable.
   # Pancytopenia/Low grade Fever: Appears to have returned to low-grade
   fever and leucopenia as well as low Hct and Plts; this is immediately
   after starting vancomycin but actually probably too quick from start of
   med to drop in counts to attribute directly to vanco. [**Month (only) 8**] be artifact
   of dilution from fluid shifts given rapid change in setting of albumin
   administration, stopping diuresis yesterday, etc.
   - F/U Pan culture, CIS > 100.5
 all results negative to date
   - Continue to trend
   - Repeat check CBC today, retics as measure of production
   - Transfuse for <25
   - If continued decline consider replacing vancomycin despite time
   course not matching well
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices.  Small amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatitine
   # Anemia: Drop in Hct along with other cells (see above in
   pancytopenia); fluid shift artifact vs global production deficit.
   Macrocytic.  Stools guaiac negative.  Due to liver disease with
   B12/folate within normal limits.
   - Monitor daily
   # Thrombocytopenia: Generally has been stable; see above re
   pancytopenia. In the past have attributed this to cirrhosis which
   remains his most chronic issue.
   - Monitor daily
   # Septic shock from PNA: Resolved.  Patient initially presented with
   septic shock attributed to his pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Blood
   cultures did grow
 coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ was
   removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. He has since improved and is now on pressure support. The patient completed an 8-day course of meropenem and is off the fentanyl drip. His current issues include hypotension/tachycardia, pancytopenia/low-grade fever, hepatitis C cirrhosis with encephalopathy and grade II varices, stage 2 decubitus ulcer, acute renal failure (resolved), anemia, thrombocytopenia, and septic shock from pneumonia (resolved).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Tachycardia: The patient is stable after backing off from aggressive diuresis. The MAP goal is set at 55, and gentler diuresis is planned to achieve a goal of 1L negative. The patient is off pressors now and remaining stable.
2. Pancytopenia/Low-grade Fever: The patient appears to have returned to low-grade fever and leucopenia along with low Hct and Plts. This may be a result of starting vancomycin, but it is too quick to directly attribute it to vancomycin. The patient's PAN culture and CIS are negative to date. Repeat CBC today and retics should be checked as a measure of production. Transfuse for <"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis, currently admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. He has been treated with an 8-day course of meropenem and is showing improvement on pressure support ventilation. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/56 mmHg to 137/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure from multifocal pneumonia. Although he is currently improving on pressure support ventilation, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if the pneumonia worsens or if there are complications related to extubation.
2. Hypotension/tachycardia: The patient has been stable after backing off from aggressive diuresis, but there is still a risk of hypotension and tachycardia due to ongoing fluid overload or other factors.
3. Pancytopenia/low-grade fever: The patient has a history of pancytopenia and low-grade fever, which could be attributed to various causes such as bone marrow suppression, sepsis, or liver disease. Further investigation and monitoring are necessary to determine"

   Assessment and Plan
   52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure: [**Doctor Last Name 76**] resolving; P/F = 273. Likely partly due to
   fluid overload, no sign of ongoing pneumonia at this point. He is doing
   well on pressure support and clearly is improving.Patient completed an
   8 day course of Meropenem. Patient is off fentanyl drip and on bolus
   fentanyl for turns to decrease sedation.
   - I/O even
   - daily [**Last Name (un) **], today 95
   - trial SBT 0/5, if does by ABG will extubate
   # Hypotension/Tachycardia: stable after backing off from more
   aggressive diuresis.  A-line GPCs on one culture
   -          Pull a-line
   -          On vancomycin pending speciation, if coag neg staph and
   other cx neg, will stop vanc
   -          MAP goal 55
   -          Responded well to lasix 40iv *1 will not diurese further
   today
   -          Off pressors now, remaining stable.
   # Pancytopenia/Low grade Fever: Appears to have returned to low-grade
   fever and leucopenia as well as low Hct and Plts; this is immediately
   after starting vancomycin but actually probably too quick from start of
   med to drop in counts to attribute directly to vanco. [**Month (only) 8**] be artifact
   of dilution from fluid shifts given rapid change in setting of albumin
   administration, stopping diuresis yesterday, etc.
   - F/U Pan culture, CIS > 100.5
 all results negative to date
   - Continue to trend
   - Repeat check CBC w/diff out of concern for neutropenia
   - Transfuse for <21
   - If continued decline consider replacing vancomycin despite time
   course not matching well
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices.  Small amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatitine
   # Anemia: Drop in Hct along with other cells (see above in
   pancytopenia); fluid shift artifact vs global production deficit.
   Macrocytic.  Stools guaiac negative.  Due to liver disease with
   B12/folate within normal limits.
   - Monitor daily
   - Transfuse HCT <21
   # Thrombocytopenia: Generally has been stable; see above re
   pancytopenia. In the past have attributed this to cirrhosis which
   remains his most chronic issue.
   - Monitor daily
   # Septic shock from PNA: Resolved.  Patient initially presented with
   septic shock attributed to his pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Blood
   cultures did grow
 coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ was
   removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date.
   Stopped aztreonam.  Meropenem added for possible ESBL and patient
   completed 8 day course.  C. difficile negative x 3

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old male with HCV cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. He is currently improving and has completed an 8-day course of Meropenem. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 118/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 2.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, platelet count of 174 K/uL, creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, blood glucose of 119 mg/dL, and sodium of 135 mEq/L. The patient also has a history of pancytopenia, low-grade fever, hepatitis C cirrhosis, stage 2 decubitus ulcer, acute renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and septic shock from pneumonia.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing pressure support ventilation, monitoring intake and output, performing a trial spontaneous breathing test with ABG, and considering extubation if successful. The patient's blood cultures are negative, and he is off fentanyl drip. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and a history of HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection. He was admitted to the ICU with sepsis and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) secondary to multifocal pneumonia. The patient has completed an 8-day course of meropenem antibiotics and is currently on minimal ventilator support with good oxygenation and ventilation. He is off sedation and able to follow commands.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of ARDS and pneumonia puts him at risk for continued respiratory failure. Monitoring his oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently off pressors with stable hemodynamics, there is still a risk of sepsis due to his immunocompromised state. Fever should be closely monitored and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be continued.
3. GPC (gram-positive cocci) in clusters from blood: Although likely a contaminant, further investigation is needed to rule out any bacterial infection. Continuing vancomycin for now and following up with speciation and surveillance cultures is recommended.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has chronic thrombocytopenia due to liver disease, along with anemia. Leucopenia may also be present. Monitoring blood counts and managing accordingly is important.
5. ESLD: The patient's liver function is stable"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and end-stage liver disease who is currently in the ICU due to sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is now making steady progress by requiring minimal vent support and good oxygenation and ventilation. The patient's responsiveness is also improving, and there are plans to extubate him tomorrow.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/56 to 137/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 7 mmHg, and his fluid balance shows an intake of 2,604 mL, output of 3,245 mL, and a negative balance of 641 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a tidal volume (Vt) of 507 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 95, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, and partial pressure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and HCV (hepatitis C virus) who is recovering from sepsis and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on minimal ventilator support with good oxygenation and ventilation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. Although he is showing improvement with ventilation, there is still a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if not properly managed.

2. Sepsis: The patient had sepsis, which has improved with appropriate antibiotic treatment. However, there is still a risk of sepsis recurrence if the patient becomes infected again.

3. GPC (gram-positive cocci) in the blood: Although the presence of GPC in the blood may be a contaminant, it is important to continue monitoring and following up with further investigation and surveillance cultures to rule out any potential bacterial infection.

4. Heme pathology: The patient's white blood cell count is low, indicating potential heme pathology. Further evaluation and repeat CBC (complete blood count) are necessary to determine the cause.

5. ESLD: The patient has ESLD, and his liver function remains stable. However, he is still at risk for complications related to liver dysfunction, such as hepatic encephalopathy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) secondary to HCV (hepatitis C virus) infection. He is currently in the ICU (intensive care unit) for sepsis and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) caused by multifocal pneumonia. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation but is now weaning off it successfully. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/56 to 137/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has been extubated and is awake, attentive, and following commands.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had severe respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. Although he is currently showing improvement by successfully weaning off the ventilator, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if he experiences complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or has difficulty maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation after extubation.

2. Sepsis: The patient presented with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. Although he is currently off pressors (medications that maintain blood pressure) and has stable hemodynamics, there is still a risk of recurrent sepsis if he develops new infections or if his immune system becomes compromised.

3. GPC (Gram-positive cocci) in clusters from blood: The patient's blood cultures have shown GPC in clusters, which could indicate a bloodstream infection. Although the source of infection is likely a contaminant, the patient is being treated with vancomycin, an antibiotic effective against Gram-positive bacteria. Close monitoring of the blood cultures is necessary to ensure that the infection does not progress.

4. Pancytopenia: The patient has chronic thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), anemia (low hemoglobin concentration), and leukopenia (low white blood cell count). These conditions may be related to his liver disease and require further investigation and management.

5. ESLD: The patient's liver disease is stable, but there is still a risk of liver decompensation or worsening liver function. He is being monitored closely with liver function tests, and appropriate measures are being taken to manage his condition, including the use of lactulose and rifaximin.

6. Stage II sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has developed a pressure ulcer at the sacral region. Proper wound care is essential to prevent further complications such as infection.

Overall, the patient's progress in the ICU has been steady, with improvement in respiratory function and hemodynamics. However, there are still potential complications that need to be closely monitored and managed."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis here with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure: Extubated. Patient completed an 8 day course of
   Meropenem. Patient is off fentanyl drip and on bolus fentanyl for turns
   to decrease sedation.
   - I/O even
   # Hypotension/Tachycardia: stable after backing off from more
   aggressive diuresis.  A-line GPCs on one culture
   -  Pull a-line
   -  On vancomycin pending speciation, if coag neg staph and other cx
   neg, will stop vanc
   -  MAP goal 55
   -  Responded well to lasix 40iv *1 will not diurese further today
   - Off pressors now, remaining stable.
   # Pancytopenia/Low grade Fever: Appears to have returned to low-grade
   fever and leucopenia as well as low Hct and Plts; this is immediately
   after starting vancomycin but actually probably too quick from start of
   med to drop in counts to attribute directly to vanco. [**Month (only) 8**] be artifact
   of dilution from fluid shifts given rapid change in setting of albumin
   administration, stopping diuresis yesterday, etc.
   - F/U Pan culture, CIS > 100.5
 all results negative to date
   - Continue to trend
   - Repeat check CBC w/diff out of concern for neutropenia
   - Transfuse for <21
   - If continued decline consider replacing vancomycin despite time
   course not matching well
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices.  Small amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatitine
   # Anemia: Drop in Hct along with other cells (see above in
   pancytopenia); fluid shift artifact vs global production deficit.
   Macrocytic.  Stools guaiac negative.  Due to liver disease with
   B12/folate within normal limits.
   - Monitor daily
   - Transfuse HCT <21
   # Thrombocytopenia: Generally has been stable; see above re
   pancytopenia. In the past have attributed this to cirrhosis which
   remains his most chronic issue.
   - Monitor daily
   # Septic shock from PNA: Resolved.  Patient initially presented with
   septic shock attributed to his pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Blood
   cultures did grow
 coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ was
   removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date.
   Stopped aztreonam.  Meropenem added for possible ESBL and patient
   completed 8 day course.  C. difficile negative x 3

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis who was admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure from multifocal pneumonia.
- The patient completed an 8-day course of Meropenem and is no longer on a fentanyl drip.
- The patient's respiratory failure has resolved, and he has been extubated.
- The patient's hypotension and tachycardia are stable after reducing aggressive diuresis.
- The patient's pancytopenia, characterized by low-grade fever, leucopenia, low Hct, and Plts, has returned. This may be a reaction to vancomycin or an artifact due to fluid shifts.
- The patient's hepatitis C cirrhosis is complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices.
- The patient has a stage 2 decubitus ulcer but shows no signs of infection.
- The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, likely due to hypovolemic/septic shock.
- The patient's anemia is macrocytic and related to liver disease.
- The patient's thrombocytopenia is stable but may be attributed to cirrhosis.
- The patient experienced septic shock from pneumonia but has since recovered.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure from multifocal pneumonia. The patient has been extubated after completing an 8-day course of meropenem. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. Although the patient is currently extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if the underlying infection worsens or if the patient develops any new respiratory issues.

2. Hypotension/tachycardia: The patient had hypotension and tachycardia, which have stabilized after backing off from aggressive diuresis. Close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is necessary to ensure the patient remains hemodynamically stable.

3. Pancytopenia/low-grade fever: The patient has shown signs of pancytopenia (low white blood cell count, low platelet count, and low hemoglobin) and low-grade fever. This could indicate an ongoing infection or a complication of the patient's underlying liver disease. Further investigation and close monitoring of blood counts are required.

4. Hepatitis C cirrhosis: The patient has a history of HCV cirrhosis, which is complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices. Management of this condition involves continuing rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy"

   52 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.  Extubated [**11-26**].
   # Pancytopenia: Patient has neutropenia that may be due to infection
   versus his underlying cirrhosis versus medication effect . Currently
   afebrile > 48 hours.  Macrocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia attributed
   to liver failure.  Stools guaiac negative and B12/folate normal.
   - Monitor CBC, ANC closely
   - Continue vancomycin for coagulase negative Staph bacteremia as below;
   pull central line
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   - Transfuse platelets < 10 or active bleeding
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Coagulase negative Staph bacteremia: 2 out of 2 bottle from [**11-12**] and
   2 out of 4 bottles from [**11-23**] positive.  Likely a contaminant but will
   continue to treat with vancomycin for now.  LIJ removed [**11-14**]; will
   remove RIJ today.  Stable off pressors since [**11-24**].

   current signs of infection at the site.  On wound care bed.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Septic shock from pneumonia: Resolved.  Stable off pressors since
   [**11-24**].  Patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to his
   pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Completed eight-day course of
   meropenem; was on levofloxacin for synergy but discontinued.  Blood
   cultures grew coagulase negative Staph bacteremia, likely a
   contaminant, but LIJ was removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Coagulase
   negative Staph bacteremia in [**1-16**] bottles from [**11-23**]

   52 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.  Extubated [**11-26**].
   # Pancytopenia: Patient has neutropenia that may be due to his
   underlying cirrhosis versus medication effect . [**Month (only) 8**] be artifact of
   dilution from fluid shifts given rapid change in setting of albumin
   administration, stopping diuresis yesterday, etc.
   - F/U Pan culture, CIS > 100.5
 all results negative to date
   - Continue to trend
   - Repeat check CBC w/diff out of concern for neutropenia
   - Transfuse for <21
   - If continued decline consider replacing vancomycin despite time
   course not matching well
   # Hypotension/Tachycardia: stable after backing off from more
   aggressive diuresis.  A-line GPCs on one culture
   -  Pull a-line
   -  On vancomycin pending speciation, if coag neg staph and other cx
   neg, will stop vanc
   -  MAP goal 55
   -  Responded well to lasix 40iv *1 will not diurese further today
   - Off pressors now, remaining stable.
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices.  Small amount of ascites.
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy (no being held
   given liquid stools)
   - Liver following; appreciate recs
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   - Continue to trend platelets
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: No current signs of infection at the site.
   On wound care bed. Was admitted sacral decubiti.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatitine
   # Anemia: Drop in Hct along with other cells (see above in
   pancytopenia); fluid shift artifact vs global production deficit.
   Macrocytic.  Stools guaiac negative.  Due to liver disease with
   B12/folate within normal limits.
   - Monitor daily
   - Transfuse HCT <21
   # Thrombocytopenia: Generally has been stable; see above re
   pancytopenia. In the past have attributed this to cirrhosis which
   remains his most chronic issue.
   - Monitor daily
   # Septic shock from PNA: Resolved.  Patient initially presented with
   septic shock attributed to his pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Blood
   cultures did grow
 coag neg staph, likely contaminant, but LIJ was
   removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Serial cultures no growth to date.
   Stopped aztreonam.  Meropenem added for possible ESBL and patient
   completed 8 day course.  C. difficile negative x 3

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. He has been extubated and is currently receiving respiratory support with PSV/SBT mode, FiO2 of 40%, and SpO2 of 95%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 111/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient has shown improvement in terms of hemodynamic stability, as he is no longer on pressors and is maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal of 55. However, he still requires aggressive diuresis to manage fluid balance.

The patient's laboratory results indicate pancytopenia, which may be due to his underlying cirrhosis or medication effect. There is also evidence of acute renal failure, which has resolved, and anemia, likely caused by liver disease with B12/folate within normal limits.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hepatitis C cirrhosis with encephalopathy and grade II varices, stage 2 decubitus ulcer, acute renal failure (resolved), anemia, thrombocytopenia, and septic shock from pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.  Extubated [**11-26**].
   # Dysphagia- like due to prolonged intubation. Given slow progress and
   need for meds to prevent encephalopathy, will place NG tube.
   - place NG tube
   # Pancytopenia: Patient infection versus his underlying cirrhosis
   versus medication effect . Currently afebrile > 48 hours.  Macrocytic
   anemia and thrombocytopenia attributed to liver failure.  Stools guaiac
   negative and B12/folate normal.
   - Monitor CBC, ANC closely
   - Continue vancomycin for coagulase negative Staph bacteremia as below
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   - Transfuse platelets < 10 or active bleeding
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Coagulase negative Staph bacteremia:2 out of 2 from [**11-12**] and 2 out
   of 4 bottles from [**11-23**] positive.  Likely a contaminant but will given
   growth will treat for 14 day course.  LIJ removed [**11-14**]; RIJ(replacement
   for LIJ) [**11-27**], A-line removed [**11-26**].  Stable off pressors since [**11-24**].
   - Monitor surveillance blood cultures
 NGTD
   - Vancomycin for 14 day course
   - Continue to draw surveilance off PORT-a- CATH
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices.  Small amount of ascites
 negative for SBP [**11-22**].
   Pancytopenia as above.
   - Liver following; appreciate
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy
   - Holding propanolol for now
 can consider restarting tomorrow
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: Decubitus ulcer noted on admission.  No
   current signs of infection at the site.  On wound care bed.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Septic shock from pneumonia: Resolved.  Stable off pressors since
   [**11-24**].  Patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to his
   pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Completed eight-day course of
   meropenem; was on levofloxacin for synergy but discontinued.  Blood
   cultures grew coagulase negative Staph bacteremia, likely a
   contaminant, but LIJ was removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Coagulase
   negative Staph bacteremia see above
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatinine

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old male with HCV cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. The patient has been extubated but experiences dysphagia-like symptoms due to prolonged intubation. He has been placed on an NG tube for nutrition and to prevent encephalopathy.

The patient also has pancytopenia, which is attributed to liver failure, medication effect, or infection. His blood counts and platelet levels will be closely monitored. The patient is being treated for coagulase-negative Staph bacteremia, likely a contaminant from a central line infection. Surveillance blood cultures will continue to be monitored.

The patient has a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis, complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices. He has a small amount of ascites that is negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. He is currently delisted from transplant due to an acute infection.

Additionally, the patient has a stage 2 decubitus ulcer, which is being managed with appropriate wound care. He previously experienced septic shock from pneumonia, but it has resolved. The patient completed an eight-day course of meropenem and was on levofloxacin for synergy but discontinued. Blood cultures grew coagulase-negative Staph bacteremia, likely a contaminant.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of Hepatitis C and cirrhosis who was admitted to the MICU with septic shock, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and ARDS. He is now off pressors, extubated, and successfully weaned off the ventilator. The patient has ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and has been treated for CNS bacteremia secondary to TLC (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt), which has been removed. He has also experienced a new fever and witnessed seizure today, with negative CT and LP results, pending MRI and EEG. The patient's pancytopenia is improving, and he will continue to be monitored. He is currently on RA (regular insulin sliding scale) for glycemic control and is NPO (nothing by mouth) with an NG tube. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatitis C: This viral infection affects the liver and can lead to cirrhosis and ESLD.
2. Cirrhosis: Advanced scarring of the liver that can result in liver failure.
3. Septic Shock: A life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection leading to low blood pressure and inadequate organ function.
4. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): A condition characterized by severe lung inflammation and damage, leading to difficulty breathing.
5. CNS Bacteremia: A bloodstream infection affecting the central nervous system, which can cause sepsis"

   # Seizure event- EEG, MRI, CT all negative so far though final reads
   are pending. Unclear reason; ?perisepsis given fever afterwards,
   started ceftaz/flagyl/vanco regimen which will hopefully be able to be
   pulled off soon. Await cultures to define course, aim is to peel away
   antibiotics quickly if clinical status is good. Follow up all studies.
   # Dysphagia- like due to prolonged intubation. Given slow progress and
   need for meds to prevent encephalopathy, will place NG tube.
   - place NG tube
   # Pancytopenia: Patient infection versus his underlying cirrhosis
   versus medication effect . Currently afebrile > 48 hours.  Macrocytic
   anemia and thrombocytopenia attributed to liver failure.  Stools guaiac
   negative and B12/folate normal.
   - Monitor CBC, ANC closely
   - Continue vancomycin for coagulase negative Staph bacteremia as below
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   - Transfuse platelets < 10 or active bleeding
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Coagulase negative Staph bacteremia:2 out of 2 from [**11-12**] and 2 out
   of 4 bottles from [**11-23**] positive.  Likely a contaminant but will given
   growth will treat for 14 day course.  LIJ removed [**11-14**]; RIJ(replacement
   for LIJ) [**11-27**], A-line removed [**11-26**].  Stable off pressors since [**11-24**].
   - Monitor surveillance blood cultures
 NGTD
   - Vancomycin for 14 day course
   - Continue to draw surveilance off PORT-a- CATH
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices.  Small amount of ascites
 negative for SBP [**11-22**].
   Pancytopenia as above.
   - Liver following; appreciate
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy
   - Holding propanolol for now
 can consider restarting tomorrow
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: Decubitus ulcer noted on admission.  No
   current signs of infection at the site.  On wound care bed.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Septic shock from pneumonia: Resolved.  Stable off pressors since
   [**11-24**].  Patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to his
   pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Completed eight-day course of
   meropenem; was on levofloxacin for synergy but discontinued.  Blood
   cultures grew coagulase negative Staph bacteremia, likely a
   contaminant, but LIJ was removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Coagulase
   negative Staph bacteremia see above
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of HCV cirrhosis admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. He has been extubated since November 26th. The patient experienced a seizure event, with EEG, MRI, and CT scans all negative, although final readings are pending. He was given Ativan for excessive movement during an MRI and continued to be encephalopathic and sedated. The patient attempted to remove his NG tube twice and required restraints. He was started on vancomycin, ceftazidime, and flagyl due to fever. His allergies include nafcillin, and he has renal toxicity. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 106/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's general appearance is well-nourished, with PERRL eyes, symmetric chest expansion, and clear breath sounds. His abdomen is soft and distended, and he has impaired balance, cough, muscle performance, and respiration/gas exchange. The patient also has neutropenia, hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypotension (not shock), pneumonia, cirrhosis of the liver, impaired skin integrity, and pancytopenia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is likely multifocal PNA (pneumonia) leading to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) in the setting of advanced hep C cirrhosis. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture and MRI, during which they received Ativan for excessive movement. The patient also experienced a seizure event and was given another dose of Ativan. An EEG was performed but the results are pending. The patient has been encephalopathic and sedated but interactive. They required restraints twice for attempting to remove the NG tube. 

The patient has allergies to nafcillin and renal toxicity. Antibiotics were administered including vancomycin, ceftazidime, metronidazole, and rifampin. The patient is receiving infusions of lorazepam (Ativan) and heparin sodium. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F, blood pressure ranging from 92/49 mmHg to 106/58 mmHg, heart rate between 72-139 bpm, respiratory rate of 20-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. 

The patient's weight is 82 kg, and their height is 65 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,090 mL and output of 2,085 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -995 mL. Respiratory support includes an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device, with an SpO2 of 95% and ABG results of pH 7.47, PaCO2 33 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 293, and HCO3- 23 mEq/L. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished but has symmetric chest expansion and clear breath sounds. The abdomen is described as soft and distended. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to encephalopathy. 

Laboratory results show leukocyte count of 23 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.7 g/dL, platelet count of 190,000/mm3, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, TCO2 of 25, glucose levels between 93-118 mg/dL, and various other lab values. 

The patient's assessment and plan include a diagnosis of seizure without status epilepticus, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired balance, impaired cough, impaired muscle performance, impaired respiration/gas exchange, risk for aspiration due to inability to protect the airway, neutropenia, hepatic encephalopathy, respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypotension (not shock), pneumonia, cirrhosis of the liver, impaired skin integrity, and other issues. 

ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.  Extubated [**11-26**].
   # Seizure event- EEG, MRI, CT all negative so far though final reads
   are pending. Unclear reason; ?perisepsis given fever afterwards,
   started ceftaz /vanco regimen and during rounds pulled flagyl. Await
   cultures to define course, aim is to peel away antibiotics quickly if
   clinical status is good. Follow up all studies.
   - Neurology consult
   - Follow up final formal reads on EEG, CT, MRI, etc
   - Observe closely
   - Follow tremor; unlikely to be directly related to seizure unless (as
   is probably most likely) both are the result of metabolic
   encephalopathy
   - Follow up infectious w/u; multiple cxs pending
   # Dysphagia- like due to prolonged intubation. Given slow progress and
   need for meds to prevent encephalopathy, need to replace the NG tube
   that he pulled
   - place Dobhoff tube today
   - repeat S+S evals as mental status improves
   # Pancytopenia: Chronic and stable at this point. [**Month (only) 8**] be medication
   effect but all medications are useful enough to follow along as long as
   he is not frankly neutropenic; he is not today. Stools guaiac negative
   and B12/folate normal.
   - Monitor CBC, ANC closely
   - Covering infection as above
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   - Transfuse platelets < 10 or active bleeding
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Coagulase negative Staph bacteremia:
   - Vancomycin for 14 day course to treat this; may need revised course
   given new fever treatment/seizure/infectious workup as described above
   - Continue to draw surveilance off PORT-a- CATH
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices.  Small amount of ascites
 negative for SBP [**11-22**].
   Pancytopenia as above.
   - Liver following; appreciate
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy
   - Holding propanolol for now
 can consider restarting propranolol or
   nadolol tomorrow
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: Decubitus ulcer noted on admission.  No
   current signs of infection at the site.  On wound care bed.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Septic shock from pneumonia: Resolved.  Stable off pressors since
   [**11-24**].  Patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to his
   pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Completed eight-day course of
   meropenem; was on levofloxacin for synergy but discontinued.  Blood
   cultures grew coagulase negative Staph bacteremia, likely a
   contaminant, but LIJ was removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Coagulase
   negative Staph bacteremia see above
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatinine

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis who was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. He has been in the ICU since November 25th and has had several medical complications during his stay.

1. Seizure event: The patient experienced a seizure event on November 28th, for which he received lorazepam. An MRI, CT scan, and EEG were performed, all of which were negative, although final reads are pending. The reason for the seizure is unclear, and it is possible that it could be related to sepsis given the fever afterwards. Antibiotics were started, and cultures are being monitored to determine the course of treatment.

2. Dysphagia: The patient developed dysphagia due to prolonged intubation. A nasogastric (NG) tube was placed, but the patient pulled it out. A Dobhoff tube will be placed today.

3. Pancytopenia: The patient has chronic and stable pancytopenia. This may be a result of medication side effects, but it is being closely monitored as the patient is not neutropenic at present. Blood transfusions may be required if the hematocrit drops below 21 or if there is active bleeding.

4. Coagulase-negative Staph bacteremia: The patient has a bacteremia caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. He is receiving a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and Hepatitis C. He was admitted with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock, which have since been resolved. The patient is currently extubated and off pressors. However, he experienced a witnessed seizure and fever yesterday. His head CT, lumbar puncture (LP), and preliminary MRI results were negative. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is pending, and he is awaiting neurology input. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/54 mmHg to 123/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His recent laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances. The patient's blood cultures are pending as part of the fever workup, and he is currently on vancomycin and ceftazidime. He had a seizure yesterday, which was likely due to a toxic-metabolic process, but further neurologic evaluation is planned. If the patient remains stable, he may be able to move to the floor soon. Further plans will be determined based on the resident's note."

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and Hepatitis C. He was admitted with septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) pneumonia.

If stable, the patient may be transferred to the floor in the morning. Further plans are outlined in the resident's note.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure, which could be due to a toxic-metabolic process or potential neurological issues. Further evaluation of the EEG results is needed to determine the cause of the seizure.
2. Fever: The patient has been febrile since yesterday. Cultures are pending to identify the source of infection. Appropriate antibiotics should be continued until the infection is resolved.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, and although he has improved, close monitoring of his respiratory status is necessary to prevent any further deterioration.
4. Hepatitis C: The patient has Hepatitis C, which may contribute to his overall condition and increase the risk of complications such as liver"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.  Extubated [**11-26**].
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices. Confusion this AM c/w encephalopathy. Small amount of ascites
 negative for SBP [**11-22**]; not tappable by ultrasound yesterday.  MELD =
   15 today.
   - Liver following; he will be called out to the liver floor today
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy
   - Nadolol for prophylaxis for varices
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection; daily MELD
   labs
   # Seizure event- EEG, MRI, CT all negative so far for seizure source.
   MRI shows atrophy; see below. In terms of seizure event on [**11-28**],
   neurology consultants unsure re seizure vs myoclonus; ICU team
   observations are that the event was distinct and quite seizure-like
   when compared to his baseline tremor. The precipitant is unclear; he
   did have fever afterwards, LP was negative, antibiotics were started
   and are continuing. See below.
   - Appreciate neuro consult and ongoing involvement
   - Follow up final formal read on EEG
   - Observe closely
   - Follow up infectious w/u; multiple cxs pending
   # Dysphagia- like due to prolonged intubation. Has pulled tubes x2.
   Video speech and swallow during rounds: cleared for ground solids and
   thick nectar liquids, close supervision, crushed meds. Follow closely.
   # Pancytopenia: Chronic and stable at this point. [**Month (only) 8**] be medication
   effect (e.g., ongoing vancomycin) but all medications are useful enough
   to follow along as long as he is not frankly neutropenic; he is not
   today. Stools guaiac negative and B12/folate normal.
   - Monitor CBC, ANC
   - Covering infection as above
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   - Transfuse platelets < 10 or active bleeding
   - Guaiac stools
   # Fever. Fever post-seizure on [**11-28**]. Had already been treating with
   vanco for coagulase negative Staph bacteremia, with defined 14 day
   course ending [**12-8**]. Added ceftaz and continuing this currently.
   - Follow up cultures; will be 48 hours this evening at which time
   withdrawal of ceftaz would likely be appropriate
   - Continue to draw surveillance off PORT-a- CATH
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: Decubitus ulcer noted on admission.  No
   current signs of infection at the site.  On wound care bed.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Septic shock from pneumonia: Resolved.  Stable off pressors since
   [**11-24**].  Patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to his
   pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Completed eight-day course of
   meropenem; was on levofloxacin for synergy but discontinued.  Blood
   cultures grew coagulase negative Staph bacteremia, likely a
   contaminant, but LIJ was removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Coagulase
   negative Staph bacteremia: see above
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolemic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatinine

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia. He has since been extubated.

The patient's current conditions include encephalopathy, grade II varices, confusion, small amount of ascites negative for SBP, and a MELD score of 15. He is being treated with rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy, nadolol for varices prophylaxis, and daily MELD labs.

The patient also experienced a seizure event, but EEG, MRI, and CT were negative for seizure source. The neurology consultants are unsure if it was a seizure or myoclonus. The ICU team observed that the event was distinct and seizure-like compared to his baseline tremor. The precipitant is unclear, but he had a fever afterward, and antibiotics were started and are continuing.

The patient has dysphagia due to prolonged intubation and has pulled tubes twice. A video speech and swallow test showed that he can have ground solids and thick nectar liquids with close supervision and crushed medications.

The patient has pancytopenia, which is chronic and stable at this point. It could be medication-related, but all medications are useful to follow along as long as he is not frankly neutropenic. He is not neutropenic today. Stools guai"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of hep c cirrhosis and a recent history of pneumonia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 110/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time but confused about the current location. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and trace peripheral edema. Neurologic examination shows attentive behavior, responsive to verbal cues, and oriented to month and year but not place. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 228 K/uL, low hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, normal platelet count of 228 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL, low sodium level of 122 mEq/L, normal potassium level of 4.0 mg/dL, high chloride level of 116 mEq/L, normal bicarbonate level of 22 mEq/L, and elevated blood urea nitrogen level of 27 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal evidence of liver atrophy and no evidence of ascites.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.  Extubated [**11-26**].
   # Seizure event- EEG, MRI, CT all negative so far though final reads
   are pending. Unclear reason; ?perisepsis given fever afterwards,
   started ceftaz /vanco regimen and during rounds pulled flagyl. Await
   cultures to define course, aim is to peel away antibiotics quickly if
   clinical status is good. Follow up all studies.
   - Neurology consult
   - Follow up final formal reads on EEG, CT, MRI, etc
   - Observe closely
   - Follow tremor; unlikely to be directly related to seizure unless (as
   is probably most likely) both are the result of metabolic
   encephalopathy
   - Follow up infectious w/u; multiple cxs pending
   # Dysphagia- like due to prolonged intubation. Given slow progress and
   need for meds to prevent encephalopathy, need to replace the NG tube
   that he pulled
   - place Dobhoff tube today
   - repeat S+S evals as mental status improves
   # Pancytopenia: Chronic and stable at this point. [**Month (only) 8**] be medication
   effect but all medications are useful enough to follow along as long as
   he is not frankly neutropenic; he is not today. Stools guaiac negative
   and B12/folate normal.
   - Monitor CBC, ANC closely
   - Covering infection as above
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   - Transfuse platelets < 10 or active bleeding
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Coagulase negative Staph bacteremia:
   - Vancomycin for 14 day course to treat this; may need revised course
   given new fever treatment/seizure/infectious workup as described above
   - Continue to draw surveilance off PORT-a- CATH
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices.  Small amount of ascites
 negative for SBP [**11-22**].
   Pancytopenia as above.
   - Liver following; appreciate
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy
   - Holding propanolol for now
 can consider restarting propranolol or
   nadolol tomorrow
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: Decubitus ulcer noted on admission.  No
   current signs of infection at the site.  On wound care bed.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Septic shock from pneumonia: Resolved.  Stable off pressors since
   [**11-24**].  Patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to his
   pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Completed eight-day course of
   meropenem; was on levofloxacin for synergy but discontinued.  Blood
   cultures grew coagulase negative Staph bacteremia, likely a
   contaminant, but LIJ was removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Coagulase
   negative Staph bacteremia see above
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolmic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatinine

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old man with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and Hepatitis C, who presented with septic shock and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The patient's condition has improved, with both septic shock and ARDS being resolved. He experienced a witnessed seizure two days ago, but all tests conducted for the workup were negative. The patient is currently on an empiric regimen of vancomycin and ceftazidime. If the cultures come back negative at 48 hours, the ceftazidime can be discontinued. The patient will complete a 14-day course of vancomycin for previous coag-negative staph bacteremia. The patient is okay to be transferred to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: Despite being on appropriate antibiotic therapy, there is still a risk of infection due to the patient's compromised immune system. Regular monitoring of vital signs, blood counts, and culture results should be done.

2. Neurological Complications: The patient experienced a witnessed seizure, which could indicate a potential neurological complication. Further evaluation with EMG (electromyography) and recommended labs is planned to investigate possible neuropathy.

3. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has ESLD and Hepatitis C, which puts him at risk for liver-related complications. Close monitoring of liver function tests and medication adjustments may be necessary.

4. Respiratory Issues: Although the patient's ARDS"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and Hepatitis C, who was admitted with septic shock and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). He has now resolved from these conditions. The patient experienced a witnessed seizure two days ago, but the workup for it was negative. He is currently on a regimen of vancomycin and ceftazidime. The fever has resolved, and he has passed a video swallow test, allowing him to have nectar-thick liquids. The patient is ready to be transferred to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to ESLD and previous septic shock, there is a risk of developing new infections while in the ICU or on the floor. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, or new onset of respiratory symptoms, is important.

2. Neurological complications: The patient experienced a seizure despite a negative workup. It is essential to monitor for any further neurological symptoms and consider further evaluation, including EMG (electromyography) as recommended, to rule out possible neuropathy or other neurological issues.

3. Bleeding: The patient has been on a prolonged course of antibiotics, including vancomycin, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Monitoring for any signs of bleeding, such as easy bruising or hematuria, is crucial.

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.  Extubated [**11-26**].
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices. Encephalopathy improved this AM: AAOx3.
   - Liver following; called out to the liver floor
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy
   - Nadolol for prophylaxis for varices
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection; daily MELD
   labs
   # Seizure event- EEG, MRI, CT all negative so far for seizure source.
   MRI shows atrophy; see below. In terms of seizure event on [**11-28**],
   neurology consultants unsure re seizure vs myoclonus; ICU team
   observations are that the event was distinct and quite seizure-like
   when compared to his baseline tremor. The precipitant is unclear; he
   did have fever afterwards, LP was negative, antibiotics were started
   and are continuing. See below.
   - Appreciate neuro consult and ongoing involvement
   - Observe closely
   - Follow up infectious w/u; some cxs pending, no positive results yet
   # Dysphagia- like due to prolonged intubation. Has pulled tubes x2.
   Video speech and swallow during rounds: cleared for ground solids and
   thick nectar liquids, close supervision, crushed meds. Follow closely.
   # Pancytopenia: Chronic and stable at this point. [**Month (only) 8**] be medication
   effect (e.g., ongoing vancomycin) but all medications are useful enough
   to follow along as long as he is not frankly neutropenic; he is not
   today. Stools guaiac negative and B12/folate normal.
   - Monitor CBC, ANC
   - Covering infection as above
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   - Transfuse platelets < 10 or active bleeding
   - Guaiac stools
   # Fever. Fever post-seizure on [**11-28**]. Had already been treating with
   vanco for coagulase negative Staph bacteremia, with defined 14 day
   course ending [**12-8**]. Added ceftaz, stopped this in absence of new
   culture data. Afebrile.
   - Continue to draw surveillance off PORT-a- CATH
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: Decubitus ulcer noted on admission.  No
   current signs of infection at the site.  On wound care bed.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Septic shock from pneumonia: Resolved.  Stable off pressors since
   [**11-24**].  Patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to his
   pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Completed eight-day course of
   meropenem; was on levofloxacin for synergy but discontinued.  Blood
   cultures grew coagulase negative Staph bacteremia, likely a
   contaminant, but LIJ was removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Coagulase
   negative Staph bacteremia: see above
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolemic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatinine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure from multifocal pneumonia. He has several medical complications and conditions that require close monitoring and management. 

1. Hepatitis C cirrhosis: The patient's liver disease is complicated by encephalopathy and grade II varices. His encephalopathy has improved, but he requires continued treatment with rifaximin and lactulose. Prophylaxis with nadolol is recommended for varices. The patient is currently delisted from transplant due to an acute infection, and daily MELD labs are being followed.

2. Seizure event: The patient experienced a seizure-like event on [**11-28**]. EEG, MRI, and CT scans were negative for a seizure source. An MRI shows atrophy. Neurology consultants are unsure if it was a seizure or myoclonus, but ICU observations suggest it was distinct and seizure-like compared to his baseline tremor. The cause of the seizure is unclear, and there was a subsequent fever. The lumbar puncture was negative, antibiotics were started, and are continuing. Close neurologic monitoring and follow-up are recommended.

3. Dysphagia: The patient has dysphagia likely due to prolonged intubation. He has pulled out tubes twice. A video speech and swallow evaluation during rounds showed that he is cleared for ground solids and thick nectar"

   Assessment and Plan
   52 year-old man with HCV cirrhosis admitted with hypoxemic respiratory
   failure from multifocal pneumonia.  Extubated [**11-26**].
   # Hepatitis C cirrhosis: Complicated by encephalopathy and grade II
   varices. Confusion this AM c/w encephalopathy. Small amount of ascites
 negative for SBP [**11-22**]; not tappable by ultrasound yesterday.  MELD =
   15 today.
   - Liver following; he will be called out to the liver floor today
   - Continue rifaximin and lactulose for encephalopathy
   - Nadolol for prophylaxis for varices
   - Currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection; daily MELD
   labs
   # Seizure event- EEG, MRI, CT all negative so far for seizure source.
   MRI shows atrophy; see below. In terms of seizure event on [**11-28**],
   neurology consultants unsure re seizure vs myoclonus; ICU team
   observations are that the event was distinct and quite seizure-like
   when compared to his baseline tremor. The precipitant is unclear; he
   did have fever afterwards, LP was negative, antibiotics were started
   and are continuing. See below.
   - Appreciate neuro consult and ongoing involvement
   - Follow up final formal read on EEG
   - Observe closely
   - Follow up infectious w/u; multiple cxs pending
   # Dysphagia- like due to prolonged intubation. Has pulled tubes x2.
   Video speech and swallow during rounds: cleared for ground solids and
   thick nectar liquids, close supervision, crushed meds. Follow closely.
   # Pancytopenia: Chronic and stable at this point. [**Month (only) 8**] be medication
   effect (e.g., ongoing vancomycin) but all medications are useful enough
   to follow along as long as he is not frankly neutropenic; he is not
   today. Stools guaiac negative and B12/folate normal.
   - Monitor CBC, ANC
   - Covering infection as above
   - Transfuse hematocrit < 21 or active bleeding
   - Transfuse platelets < 10 or active bleeding
   - Guaiac stools
   # Fever. Fever post-seizure on [**11-28**]. Had already been treating with
   vanco for coagulase negative Staph bacteremia, with defined 14 day
   course ending [**12-8**]. Added ceftaz and continuing this currently.
   - Follow up cultures; will be 48 hours this evening at which time
   withdrawal of ceftaz would likely be appropriate
   - Continue to draw surveillance off PORT-a- CATH
   # Stage 2 decubitus ulcer: Decubitus ulcer noted on admission.  No
   current signs of infection at the site.  On wound care bed.
   - Monitor closely and appropriate wound care
   # Septic shock from pneumonia: Resolved.  Stable off pressors since
   [**11-24**].  Patient initially presented with septic shock attributed to his
   pan sensitive E. coli pneumonia.  Completed eight-day course of
   meropenem; was on levofloxacin for synergy but discontinued.  Blood
   cultures grew coagulase negative Staph bacteremia, likely a
   contaminant, but LIJ was removed [**11-14**] as a precaution.  Coagulase
   negative Staph bacteremia: see above
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved; likely prerenal due to
   hypovolemic/septic shock.
   - Monitor creatinine

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with HCV cirrhosis who was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure from multifocal pneumonia. He has been extubated since 11/26. His medical history includes encephalopathy, grade II varices, confusion, small amount of ascites negative for SBP, and a MELD score of 15 today. The patient is currently delisted from transplant due to acute infection, with daily MELD labs. Other issues include seizure event, dysphagia, pancytopenia, fever, stage 2 decubitus ulcer, and septic shock from pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatitis C cirrhosis with encephalopathy and grade II varices: This condition can lead to further liver dysfunction, increased risk of bleeding, and potential complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or variceal bleeding.
2. Seizure event: There may be ongoing risk for recurrent seizures, especially if the cause is not identified or if there are underlying neurological issues.
3. Dysphagia: The patient may continue to have difficulties with swallowing, which can increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia or malnutrition.
4. Pancytopenia: Chronic and stable at this point, but monitoring of CBC, ANC, and close observation for signs of infection or bleeding is necessary.
5. Fever: Continued monitoring for potential infections, especially considering the recent seizure and antibiotic"
