","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of community-acquired pneumonia and severe sepsis. He was admitted to the ICU and received fluid resuscitation due to hypotension. A PICC line was started, and he was given antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin). The patient is currently receiving norepinephrine infusion and omeprazole. His vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), blood pressure ranging from 105/58 mmHg to 139/98 mmHg, heart rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an increased total intake of fluids and a positive fluid balance of 4,791 mL. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated glucose levels, prolonged PT/PTT/inr, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's code status is unknown, and his disposition is not mentioned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Organ dysfunction due to severe sepsis.
2. Pneumonia complications, such as respiratory failure or worsening lung infection.
3. Fluid overload or congestive heart failure due to excessive fluid administration.
4. Nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream"

   recurrent resistant infections, here with pneumonia and hypotesion.
   .
   1.  PNA.  Patient has purulent productive cough, leukocytosis and
   radiographic evidence of PNA.  Of note, patient hospitalized
   [**Date range (1) 5437**] for PNA and was treated with 7 day course of levaquin.
   - sputum culture

   - blood cultures
   - mucinex
   - chest pt

   2. Hypotension.  Sepsis +/- hypovolemia in setting of infection.
   Normal lactate is reassuring.
   - IVF boluses for hypotension
   - consider levophed if persistently hypotensively
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  Most likely source is pneumonia, however, will
   evaluate for other sources. Recent UTI, s/p 10 day course of irtapenem,
   however, repeat UA appears unremarkable.  PICC line does not appear
   infected and has only been in for two weeks.
   - vanco/zosyn/levaquin for PNA.
   - follow up sputum, urine, blood cultures
   - follow fever curve, wbc

   4.  ARF.  Patient has baseline cr of 0.2.  Cr of 0.4 on admission.
   - follow Cr, uop
   .
   5.  H/o DVT.  IVF in place since [**2142**].  Suspician for PE currently low
   given PNA is much more likely diagnosis in setting of productive cough,
   infiltrate on CXR and leukocytosis, so will not pursue CTA at this
   point.
   - HSQ prophylaxis

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of paraplegia secondary to a motor vehicle accident (MVA) in [**2142**]. She has been hospitalized multiple times for recurrent resistant infections. Currently, she is being treated for pneumonia and hypotension.

The patient's chief complaints include a purulent productive cough, leukocytosis, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. She also has hypotension, which may be due to sepsis or hypovolemia. The normal lactate levels are reassuring in this case.

The patient has leukocytosis, likely caused by the pneumonia. However, other sources of infection will also be evaluated, such as a recent urinary tract infection (UTI), although the repeat urine analysis appears unremarkable. The patient's peripheral vascular status and skin are not assessed. Her neurologic status is also not assessed.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelets (Plt), creatinine (Cr), and blood glucose levels. Her coagulation profile shows prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR). The differential reveals neutrophils at 91.2%, lymphocytes at 7.2%, monocytes at 1.5%, eosinophils at 0.0%, calcium at 7.7 mg/dL, magnesium at 1.8 mg/dL, and phosphate at 1.9 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment includes pneumonia, hypotension, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury (ARF), history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), anemia, anxiety, chronic pain, hypothyroidism, depression, and constipation. The plan includes treatment for pneumonia with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin. The patient will be monitored for fever curve and WBC count. Her renal function will be followed, and she will be on heparin prophylaxis for DVT.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pneumonia, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), further decline in renal function, thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism (PE), and complications related to the patient's chronic conditions such as pressure ulcers, infections, and muscle atrophy due to paraplegia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old male who presented with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been in the ICU and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications. He has a history of pneumonia, cervical fracture with spinal cord injury, anxiety, and chronic pain. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, pressors, and prophylactic measures for DVT and stress ulcers. His vital signs are stable, but he remains on mechanical ventilation and has required increasing amounts of pressor support. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's condition is described as sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Organ dysfunction: Despite being classified as sepsis without organ dysfunction, the patient's condition can progress to septic shock and subsequent organ failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's history of pneumonia increases the risk of complications related to respiratory infections, such as worsening lung function or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Cervical fracture with spinal cord injury: The patient's history of a cervical fracture with spinal cord injury may lead to complications such as pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, or further neurological deterioration.
4. Anxiety and ineffective coping: The patient's anxiety and ineffective coping mechanisms may contribute to increased stress levels and potentially hinder his recovery process.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of paraplegia secondary to a motor vehicle accident (MVA) in [**2142**], and recurrent resistant infections. She was admitted with pneumonia and hypotension. The patient has purulent productive cough, leukocytosis, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. She was previously hospitalized for pneumonia and treated with a 7-day course of levaquin.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C), heart rate of 83 bpm (with a range of 77-117 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 112/73 mmHg to 82/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (with a range of 11-25 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg, and mixed venous oxygen saturation is between 77-97%.

The patient has received various infusions including norepinephrine and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. She has also been given different medications such as vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and levaquin for her pneumonia.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 16.6 K/u"

   This is a 50 yo f with paraplegia secondonary to MVA in [**2142**], h/o
   recurrent resistant infections, here with pneumonia and hypotesion.
   #  Fever / leukocytosis:
   Persistent fever overnight, but leukocytosis resolving with trend down
   from 16.6 to13.0 this AM. Patient has purulent productive cough and
   radiographic evidence of PNA. HAP is most likely explanation of her
   fever and leukocytosis. She has history of resistant UTI, so that will
   be followed, though negative UA and urine cx thus far. Some
   consideration of PICC as infection source; however, is only 10 days old
   and blood cultures remain negative. Of note, patient hospitalized
   [**Date range (1) 5437**] for PNA and was treated with 7 day course of
   levofloxacin. Legionella urinary antigen was negative yesterday. Two
   sputum cultures submitted and found to be contaminated
   - Repeat sputum culture given likelihood of resistant organisms
   - Continue vanco/zosyn, with Vanc alternating between two PICC lumen
   - Discontinue levofloxacin given Zosyn has good gram neg coverage and
   legionella negative
   - f/u blood cultures from [**4-30**] and [**5-1**] and discontinue PICC if
   positive
   - Continue pulmonary hygiene with mucinex, chest PT, incentive [**Location (un) 2811**],
   and transfer to sit up in chair as tolerated
   # Hypotension:
   Sepsis +/- hypovolemia in setting of infection.  Normal lactate is
   reassuring and UOP of > 200 cc/hr despite hypotension argues against
   sepsis. Some consideration that she has baseline low BP as her SBPs in
   clinic range 90s -90s; however, 70s is atypical.
   - on levophed, attempting to liberate from this as tolerated
   - IVF boluses for hypotension
   - Urine lytes and osmolality to attempt to rule out DI
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Patient has baseline cr of 0.2.  Cr of 0.4 on admission, now resolved
   to Cr of 0.2. Having adequate UOP, up to 300 mL/hr.
   - Follow Cr and UOP
   #  h/o DVT:
   IVC filter in place since [**2142**].  Suspicion for PE currently low given
   PNA is much more likely diagnosis in setting of productive cough,
   infiltrate on CXR, fever, and leukocytosis, so will not pursue CTA at
   this point.
   - HSQ prophylaxis
   #  Anemia:
   Baseline HCT 30-35. Was 27.7 this AM. Most recent anemia studies in
   [**11-10**] consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
   - Trend HCT
   #  Anxiety.

   This is a 50 yo f with paraplegia secondonary to MVA in [**2142**], h/o
   recurrent resistant infections, here with pneumonia and hypotesion.
   #  Fever / leukocytosis:
   Persistent fever overnight, but leukocytosis resolving with trend down
   from 16.6 to13.0 this AM. Patient has purulent productive cough and
   radiographic evidence of PNA. HAP is most likely explanation of her
   fever and leukocytosis. She has history of resistant UTI, so that will
   be followed, though negative UA and urine cx thus far. Some
   consideration of PICC as infection source; however, is only 10 days old
   and blood cultures remain negative. Of note, patient hospitalized
   [**Date range (1) 5437**] for PNA and was treated with 7 day course of
   levofloxacin. Legionella urinary antigen was negative yesterday. Two
   sputum cultures submitted and found to be contaminated
   - Repeat sputum culture given likelihood of resistant organisms
   - Continue vanco/zosyn, with Vanc alternating between two PICC lumen
   - Discontinue levofloxacin given Zosyn has good gram neg coverage and
   legionella negative
   - f/u blood cultures from [**4-30**] and [**5-1**] and discontinue PICC if
   positive
   - Continue pulmonary hygiene with mucinex, chest PT, incentive [**Location (un) 2811**],
   and transfer to sit up in chair as tolerated
   # Hypotension:
   Sepsis +/- hypovolemia in setting of infection.  Normal lactate is
   reassuring and UOP of > 200 cc/hr despite hypotension argues against
   sepsis. Some consideration that she has baseline low BP as her SBPs in
   clinic range 90s -90s; however, 70s is atypical.
   - on levophed, attempting to liberate from this as tolerated
   - IVF boluses for hypotension
   - Urine lytes and osmolality to attempt to rule out DI
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Patient has baseline cr of 0.2.  Cr of 0.4 on admission, now resolved
   to Cr of 0.2. Having adequate UOP, up to 300 mL/hr.
   - Follow Cr and UOP
   #  h/o DVT:
   IVC filter in place since [**2142**].  Suspicion for PE currently low given
   PNA is much more likely diagnosis in setting of productive cough,
   infiltrate on CXR, fever, and leukocytosis, so will not pursue CTA at
   this point.
   - HSQ prophylaxis

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with paraplegia secondary to a motor vehicle accident in 2014. She has a history of recurrent resistant infections and is currently admitted with pneumonia and hypotension. The patient's fever and leukocytosis may indicate hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), considering her productive cough and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Her previous hospitalization for pneumonia was treated with levofloxacin, but the current sputum cultures are contaminated. The patient's blood cultures remain negative, and there is no evidence of a urinary tract infection (UTI) so far.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient's symptoms, such as fever, leukocytosis, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia, suggest HAP as the most likely explanation for her fever and leukocytosis. It is essential to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitor for any worsening respiratory symptoms.

2. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis or hypovolemia in the setting of infection. Normal lactate levels and a urine output of more than 200 cc/hr argue against sepsis, but the patient should be closely monitored for any signs of septic shock.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine (Cr) level is 0.2, which has now resolved to 0.2 from a higher level on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis secondary to pneumonia. The patient's condition has been unstable with multiple episodes of hypotension requiring vasopressor support. There have been concerns about acute respiratory distress, increased heart rate, decreased oxygen saturation, new crackles in the right lung field, and delirium with hallucinations. The patient's fever has also been persistent. The patient is currently on high-flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and an arterial line.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Organ dysfunction: Given the patient's unstable condition and presence of sepsis, there is a risk of organ dysfunction, particularly in the lungs, kidneys, and liver.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can worsen and lead to further respiratory complications.
4. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be a result of severe illness, medication, or other factors. Delirium can increase the risk of falls, self-extubation, and other complications.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels may require close monitoring and intervention to ensure adequate oxygenation.
6. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension indicates inadequate blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been unstable with multiple episodes of hypotension requiring vasopressors, increasing respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, and new crackles on lung auscultation. The patient also experienced delirium and hallucinations overnight. Blood cultures were obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated.

Vital signs show a fever of 101.1°F, tachycardia with a heart rate in the 140s, and hypotension with a blood pressure of 92/53 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on high-flow nasal cannula. An arterial line was placed, revealing a blood pressure higher than the cuff reading, and levophed was decreased. A chest X-ray showed worsening right lung field, and an ABG revealed a PaO2 of 50, which improved to 148 on high-flow O2 by mask.

Physical examination findings include visibly tired appearance, dry oral mucosa, supple neck, normal heart sounds, bilateral crackles on lung auscultation, mild distended abdomen, bipedal edema with trace bilateral lower extremity edema, altered mental status, and blunted affect. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 yo f with paraplegia secondonary to MVA in [**2142**], h/o
   recurrent resistant infections, here with pneumonia and hypotesion.
   #  Fever / leukocytosis:
   Persistent fever overnight, but leukocytosis resolving with trend down
   from 16.6 to13.0 this AM. Patient has purulent productive cough and
   radiographic evidence of PNA. HAP is most likely explanation of her
   fever and leukocytosis. She has history of resistant UTI, so that will
   be followed, though negative UA and urine cx thus far. Some
   consideration of PICC as infection source; however, is only 10 days old
   and blood cultures remain negative. Of note, patient hospitalized
   [**Date range (1) 5437**] for PNA and was treated with 7 day course of
   levofloxacin. Legionella urinary antigen was negative yesterday. Two
   sputum cultures submitted and found to be contaminated
   - Repeat sputum culture given likelihood of resistant organisms
   - Continue vanco/zosyn, with Vanc alternating between two PICC lumen
   - Discontinue levofloxacin given Zosyn has good gram neg coverage and
   legionella negative
   - f/u blood cultures from [**4-30**] and [**5-1**] and discontinue PICC if
   positive
   - Continue pulmonary hygiene with mucinex, chest PT, incentive [**Location (un) 2811**],
   and transfer to sit up in chair as tolerated
   # Hypotension:
   Sepsis +/- hypovolemia in setting of infection.  Normal lactate is
   reassuring and UOP of > 200 cc/hr despite hypotension argues against
   sepsis. Some consideration that she has baseline low BP as her SBPs in
   clinic range 90s -90s; however, 70s is atypical.
   - on levophed, attempting to liberate from this as tolerated
   - IVF boluses for hypotension
   - Urine lytes and osmolality to attempt to rule out DI
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Patient has baseline cr of 0.2.  Cr of 0.4 on admission, now resolved
   to Cr of 0.2. Having adequate UOP, up to 300 mL/hr.
   - Follow Cr and UOP
   #  h/o DVT:
   IVC filter in place since [**2142**].  Suspicion for PE currently low given
   PNA is much more likely diagnosis in setting of productive cough,
   infiltrate on CXR, fever, and leukocytosis, so will not pursue CTA at
   this point.
   - HSQ prophylaxis
   #  Anemia:
   Baseline HCT 30-35. Was 27.7 this AM. Most recent anemia studies in
   [**11-10**] consistent with anemia of chronic disease.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of paraplegia secondary to motor vehicle accident (MVA) in [**2142**], recurrent resistant infections, and currently admitted with pneumonia and hypotension. The patient has been experiencing fever, leukocytosis, purulent productive cough, and radiographic evidence of pneumonia (PNA). Hypotension is also present, which could be due to sepsis or hypovolemia in the setting of infection. The patient's baseline creatinine level is 0.2, and it was elevated on admission but has now resolved. The patient is producing adequate urine output.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of recurrent resistant infections, and her current presentation with pneumonia indicates respiratory involvement. There is a possibility of further respiratory complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or worsening lung function.

2. Infectious complications: Given the patient's history of recurrent resistant infections, there is a risk of developing secondary infections. This could manifest as a urinary tract infection (UTI), bloodstream infection, or wound infection. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but due to her history, there is still a possibility of resistant organisms causing an infection.

3. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension may be indicative of sepsis or hypovolemia. If not appropriately managed, this could"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old female with a chief complaint of delirium and confusion. She has a history of pneumonia, hypoxemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pain control (acute pain, chronic pain), anxiety, and ineffective coping. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. She is currently receiving multiple medications including heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), lorazepam (Ativan), and antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 92/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is tolerating oral intake but has difficulty obtaining peripheral intravenous (PIV) access to disconnect the percutaneous central catheterization (PICC) line. The patient experienced anxiety attacks with associated desaturation and became delirious again around 8 pm, accusing staff of interfering with her and becoming very emotionally labile. The patient has not been assessed for peripheral vascular status, skin, neurologic status, or stool. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 yo f with paraplegia secondonary to MVA in [**2142**], h/o
   recurrent resistant infections, here with pneumonia and hypotesion.
   # Respiratory:
   Has had episodes of anxiety during which desating. Chest x-ray today
   showed increasing pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion. Currently
   satting 100% on face mask with RR of 22 however CO2 on ABG is now high
   60
s. Her baseline does appear high however concerning for volume
   overload now on top of PNA
   - lasix PRN today for diuresis
   - low dose Ativan PRN for anxiety however avoid sedating meds as much
   as possible, decrease trazadone; would leave methadone as this is a
   small dose of 5mg TID.
   - check BNP
   - watch bicarb while getting diuresis
   - replete phos aggressively
   - patient refusing hepSC but will insist on pneumoboots or hepSC as
   risk of PE is increased in acute infection and her IVC filter has been
   in long enough for possible collateralization
   #  Fever / leukocytosis:
   Persistent fever overnight, but leukocytosis resolving with trend down
   from 16.6 to13.0 to 9.6 this AM ([**2147-5-3**]). Patient has purulent
   productive cough and radiographic evidence of PNA. HAP is most likely
   explanation of her fever and leukocytosis. She has history of resistant
   UTI, so that will be followed, though negative UA and urine cx thus
   far. Some consideration of PICC as infection source; however, is only
   11 days old and blood cultures remain negative. Of note, patient
   hospitalized [**Date range (1) 5437**] for PNA and was treated with 7 day course of
   levofloxacin. Legionella urinary antigen was negative.
   - f/u sputum culture given likelihood of resistant organisms
   - Continue vanco/zosyn, with Vanc alternating between two PICC lumen
   - will attempt to obtain sufficient PIV access so PICC can be removed.
   - off levofloxacin given Zosyn has good gram neg coverage and
   legionella negative
   - f/u blood cultures from [**4-30**] and [**5-1**]
   - Continue pulmonary hygiene with mucinex, chest PT, incentive [**Location (un) 2811**],
   and transfer to sit up in chair as tolerated
   # Hypotension:
   Sepsis +/- hypovolemia in setting of infection.  Normal lactate is
   reassuring and UOP of > 200 cc/hr despite hypotension argues against
   sepsis. Now has a-line and this is recording higher pressure around her
   baseline of SBP in 90s.
   - off levophed
   - IVF boluses for hypotension
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Patient has baseline cr of 0.2.  Cr of 0.4 on admission, now resolved
   to Cr of 0.2. Having adequate UOP, up to 300 mL/hr.
   - Follow Cr and UOP
   #  h/o DVT:
   IVC filter in place since [**2142**].  Suspicion for PE currently low given
   PNA is much more likely diagnosis in setting of productive cough,
   infiltrate on CXR, fever, and leukocytosis, so will not pursue CTA at
   this point.
   - HepSC prophylaxis or pneumoboots if continues to refuse heparin
   #  Anemia:
   Baseline HCT 30-35. Was 27.7 this AM. Most recent anemia studies in
   [**11-10**] consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
   - Trend HCT
   - maintain active Type & screen
   - guaiac stool
   #  Anxiety.
   - Klonopin qHS at minimum doses to prevent hypotension
   - will use low-dose ativan during the day for anxiety attacks,
   especially since she tends to desat during these episodes
   #  Chronic pain:
   - methadone, baclofen, lyrica
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   TSH came back at 0.6, cont levothyroxine
   #  Depression:
   - Citalopram 40 mg
   #  Constipation:
   - off sucralfate
   - bowel regimen of Polyethylene Glycol 17 grams daily, Docusate Sodium
   100 mg PO BID, Senna 8.6 mg [**Hospital1 **], add bisacodyl PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of paraplegia secondary to a motor vehicle accident (MVA) in 2142, recurrent resistant infections, and currently admitted for pneumonia and hypotension. She has been experiencing episodes of anxiety with desaturation, delirium, and increased pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion. She is currently satting at 100% on a face mask with a respiratory rate of 22 but has high CO2 levels on ABG. She is being treated with Lasix for diuresis, low-dose Ativan for anxiety, and methadone for pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's increasing pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion indicate potential respiratory complications. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and ABG values is necessary to assess gas exchange and adjust treatment accordingly.

2. Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent resistant infections and is currently admitted for pneumonia. Persistent fever and leukocytosis suggest ongoing infection. Continued surveillance for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy are crucial.

3. Volume Overload: The patient's high central venous pressure (CVP) and fluid balance indicate a possible volume overload. Monitoring fluid intake and output, as well as adjusting diuretic therapy, may be necessary to prevent fluid accumulation and associated complications.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary Embol"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 yo f with paraplegia secondonary to MVA in [**2142**], h/o
   recurrent resistant infections, here with pneumonia and hypotesion.
   # Hypotension:
   Episode of hypotension this morning with MAPs down to 50s by aterial
   and cuff measures. Original hypotension was likely related to septic
   physiology; however, hypotension this AM most likely related to
   over-aggressive diuresis with furosemide yesterday given 4600 mL of UOP
   compounded with 3 large liquid stools this AM. Her hourly UOP declined
   from ~ 100 mL/hr overnight to ~ 50 mL/hr in two hour period of
   hypotension this AM. Was placed back on levophed after fluid bolus this
   AM with good response in BP.
   - IVF bolus for further decline in BP
   - Liberate from levophed quickly given tachycardia two days ago
   # Respiratory distress:
   Her respiratory distress is likely attributable to multiple etiologies.
   Overall improving with patient was liberated from face mask high flow
   O2 and now is on 5L NC. Primary cause of resp distress is pneumonia
   with poor sputum clearance leading to occasional mucus plugging
   associated with desats and tachypnea. Another component is heart
   failure evidenced by slight volume overload per CXR as well as BNP of
   >[**2138**]. Additional complicating factor is patient
s anxiety, which has
   caused period of tachypnea and desats.
   - Continue Vanc and Zosyn
   - Continue pulmonary hygiene with mucinex, chest PT, incentive [**Location (un) 2811**],
   acapella valve, and transfer to sit up in chair as tolerated
   - Attempt mechanical inexsufflator today
   - Hold on further diuresis until hypotension resolves
   - Avoid medications for anxiety and redirect verbally
   - Continue to replete phos aggressively
   #  Fever / leukocytosis:
   Afebrile in last 24 hours and WBC continues to trend down. Was 5.6 this
   AM, down from 8.5 yesterday. Patient has purulent productive cough and
   radiographic evidence of PNA. HAP is most likely explanation of her
   fever and leukocytosis. Sputum culture from [**5-2**] with NGTD.  She has
   history of resistant UTI, so that will be followed, though negative UA
   and urine cx thus far. Some consideration of PICC as infection source;
   however, attempt to gain peripheral access yesterday was unsuccessful.
   Will leave PICC line in at this time given that WBC trending down and
   afebrile. Legionella urinary antigen was negative.
   - Continue vanco/zosyn, with Vanc alternating between two PICC lumen
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u sputum culture given likelihood of resistant organisms
   # Delerium:
   For last two nights, patient has struggled from episodes of delirium
   associated with hallucinations and paranoid behavior. Most likely
   resulting from combination of medication effect from opiates, benozs,
   baclofen, oxybutinin, along with possible component of benzo
   withdrawal, compounded with erratic sleep-wake cycle in the ICU as well
   as line and tube attachment, also compounded with infectious process.
   - Treat infection
   - Continue to hold anticholinergic oxybutinin
   - Attempt to keep awake during day to allow sleep at night
   - untether as much as possible
   #  h/o DVT:
   IVC filter in place since [**2142**].  Suspicion for PE currently low given
   PNA is much more likely diagnosis in setting of productive cough,
   infiltrate on CXR, fever, and leukocytosis, so will not pursue CTA at
   this point.
   - HepSC prophylaxis or pneumoboots if continues to refuse heparin
   #  Anemia:
   Baseline HCT 30-35. Was 23.5 this AM. Most recent anemia studies in
   [**11/2146**] consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
   - Trend HCT
   - Maintain active Type & screen
   - Guaiac stools
   #  Chronic pain:
   Contact [**Name (NI) 12**] pain physicians to discuss regimen and past experience.
   Some of her pain meds may be contributing to her hypotension and
   delirium. Pregabalin is currently at greater than maximum rec dose of
   300 mg/day.
   - Continue methadone, baclofen
   - Reduce pregabalin dose to 75 mg TID
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - TSH came back at 0.6, cont levothyroxine
   #  Depression and Anxiety:
   Episodes of anxiety significantly associated with O2 desaturation
   - Citalopram 40 mg
   - Klonopin QHS at minimum doses to prevent hypotension
   - Consult psychiatry for help in management of anxiety, delirium,
   depression
   #  Constipation:
   Relief today with 3 large volume liquid bowel movements.
   - Continue bowel regimen of Polyethylene Glycol 17 grams daily,
   Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID, Senna 8.6 mg [**Hospital1 **], bisacodyl PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with paraplegia secondary to a motor vehicle accident in [**2142**], history of recurrent resistant infections, currently admitted with pneumonia and hypotension. The patient's respiratory distress is improving, but still requires supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. She is tolerating oral intake but has difficulty with sputum clearance due to poor lung function. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely caused by hospital-acquired pathogens, and is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Her hypotension is thought to be caused by aggressive diuresis and volume loss due to large liquid stools. The patient's fever and leukocytosis are likely due to the pneumonia, and she has purulent productive cough and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Her delirium is likely a result of medication effects, possible medication withdrawal, and the ICU environment. The patient has an IVC filter in place since [**2142**] and there is suspicion for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but it is currently low. The patient also has anemia, chronic pain, hypothyroidism, depression, and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced an episode of hypotension this morning, which was likely related to over-aggressive diuresis with furosemide and subsequent fluid loss. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 yo f with paraplegia secondonary to MVA in [**2142**], h/o
   recurrent resistant infections, here with pneumonia and hypotesion.
   # Respiratory:
   Has had episodes of anxiety during which desating. Chest x-ray today
   showed increasing pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion. Currently
   satting 100% on face mask with RR of 22 however CO2 on ABG is now high
   60
s. Her baseline does appear high however concerning for volume
   overload now on top of PNA
   - lasix PRN today for diuresis
   - low dose Ativan PRN for anxiety however avoid sedating meds as much
   as possible, decrease trazadone; would leave methadone as this is a
   small dose of 5mg TID.
   - check BNP
   - watch bicarb while getting diuresis
   - replete phos aggressively
   - patient refusing hepSC but will insist on pneumoboots or hepSC as
   risk of PE is increased in acute infection and her IVC filter has been
   in long enough for possible collateralization
   #  Fever / leukocytosis:
   Persistent fever overnight, but leukocytosis resolving with trend down
   from 16.6 to13.0 to 9.6 this AM ([**2147-5-3**]). Patient has purulent
   productive cough and radiographic evidence of PNA. HAP is most likely
   explanation of her fever and leukocytosis. She has history of resistant
   UTI, so that will be followed, though negative UA and urine cx thus
   far. Some consideration of PICC as infection source; however, is only
   11 days old and blood cultures remain negative. Of note, patient
   hospitalized [**Date range (1) 5437**] for PNA and was treated with 7 day course of
   levofloxacin. Legionella urinary antigen was negative.
   - f/u sputum culture given likelihood of resistant organisms
   - Continue vanco/zosyn, with Vanc alternating between two PICC lumen
   - will attempt to obtain sufficient PIV access so PICC can be removed.
   - off levofloxacin given Zosyn has good gram neg coverage and
   legionella negative
   - f/u blood cultures from [**4-30**] and [**5-1**]
   - Continue pulmonary hygiene with mucinex, chest PT, incentive [**Location (un) 2811**],
   and transfer to sit up in chair as tolerated
   # Hypotension:
   Sepsis +/- hypovolemia in setting of infection.  Normal lactate is
   reassuring and UOP of > 200 cc/hr despite hypotension argues against
   sepsis. Now has a-line and this is recording higher pressure around her
   baseline of SBP in 90s.
   - off levophed
   - IVF boluses for hypotension
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Patient has baseline cr of 0.2.  Cr of 0.4 on admission, now resolved
   to Cr of 0.2. Having adequate UOP, up to 300 mL/hr.
   - Follow Cr and UOP
   #  h/o DVT:
   IVC filter in place since [**2142**].  Suspicion for PE currently low given
   PNA is much more likely diagnosis in setting of productive cough,
   infiltrate on CXR, fever, and leukocytosis, so will not pursue CTA at
   this point.
   - HepSC prophylaxis or pneumoboots if continues to refuse heparin
   #  Anemia:
   Baseline HCT 30-35. Was 27.7 this AM. Most recent anemia studies in
   [**11-10**] consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
   - Trend HCT
   - maintain active Type & screen
   - guaiac stool
   #  Anxiety.
   - Klonopin qHS at minimum doses to prevent hypotension
   - will use low-dose ativan during the day for anxiety attacks,
   especially since she tends to desat during these episodes
   #  Chronic pain:
   - methadone, baclofen, lyrica
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   TSH came back at 0.6, cont levothyroxine
   #  Depression:
   - Citalopram 40 mg
   #  Constipation:
   - off sucralfate

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 yo f with paraplegia secondonary to MVA in [**2142**], h/o
   recurrent resistant infections, here with pneumonia and hypotesion.
   # Respiratory:
   Has had episodes of anxiety during which desating. Chest x-ray today
   showed increasing pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion. Currently
   satting 100% on face mask with RR of 22 however CO2 on ABG is now high
   60
s. Her baseline does appear high however concerning for volume
   overload now on top of PNA
   - lasix PRN today for diuresis
   - low dose Ativan PRN for anxiety however avoid sedating meds as much
   as possible, decrease trazadone; would leave methadone as this is a
   small dose of 5mg TID.
   - check BNP
   - watch bicarb while getting diuresis
   - replete phos aggressively
   - patient refusing hepSC but will insist on pneumoboots or hepSC as
   risk of PE is increased in acute infection and her IVC filter has been
   in long enough for possible collateralization
   #  Fever / leukocytosis:
   Persistent fever overnight, but leukocytosis resolving with trend down
   from 16.6 to13.0 to 9.6 this AM ([**2147-5-3**]). Patient has purulent
   productive cough and radiographic evidence of PNA. HAP is most likely
   explanation of her fever and leukocytosis. She has history of resistant
   UTI, so that will be followed, though negative UA and urine cx thus
   far. Some consideration of PICC as infection source; however, is only
   11 days old and blood cultures remain negative. Of note, patient
   hospitalized [**Date range (1) 5437**] for PNA and was treated with 7 day course of
   levofloxacin. Legionella urinary antigen was negative.
   - f/u sputum culture given likelihood of resistant organisms
   - Continue vanco/zosyn, with Vanc alternating between two PICC lumen
   - will attempt to obtain sufficient PIV access so PICC can be removed.
   - off levofloxacin given Zosyn has good gram neg coverage and
   legionella negative
   - f/u blood cultures from [**4-30**] and [**5-1**]
   - Continue pulmonary hygiene with mucinex, chest PT, incentive [**Location (un) 2811**],
   and transfer to sit up in chair as tolerated
   # Hypotension:
   Sepsis +/- hypovolemia in setting of infection.  Normal lactate is
   reassuring and UOP of > 200 cc/hr despite hypotension argues against
   sepsis. Now has a-line and this is recording higher pressure around her
   baseline of SBP in 90s.
   - off levophed
   - IVF boluses for hypotension
   #  [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Patient has baseline cr of 0.2.  Cr of 0.4 on admission, now resolved
   to Cr of 0.2. Having adequate UOP, up to 300 mL/hr.
   - Follow Cr and UOP
   #  h/o DVT:
   IVC filter in place since [**2142**].  Suspicion for PE currently low given
   PNA is much more likely diagnosis in setting of productive cough,
   infiltrate on CXR, fever, and leukocytosis, so will not pursue CTA at
   this point.
   - HepSC prophylaxis or pneumoboots if continues to refuse heparin
   #  Anemia:
   Baseline HCT 30-35. Was 27.7 this AM. Most recent anemia studies in
   [**11-10**] consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
   - Trend HCT
   - maintain active Type & screen
   - guaiac stool
   #  Anxiety.
   - Klonopin qHS at minimum doses to prevent hypotension
   - will use low-dose ativan during the day for anxiety attacks,
   especially since she tends to desat during these episodes
   #  Chronic pain:
   - methadone, baclofen, lyrica
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   TSH came back at 0.6, cont levothyroxine
   #  Depression:
   - Citalopram 40 mg
   #  Constipation:
   - off sucralfate
   - bowel regimen of Polyethylene Glycol 17 grams daily, Docusate Sodium
   100 mg PO BID, Senna 8.6 mg [**Hospital1 **], add bisacodyl PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of paraplegia secondary to MVA, recurrent resistant infections, and current presentation of pneumonia and hypotension. She is experiencing episodes of anxiety, delirium, and agitation, and has a history of chronic pain, depression, hypothyroidism, and constipation. She has an IVC filter in place since 2014 and is currently on multiple medications including lasix, heparin sodium, lorazepam, furosemide, methadone, baclofen, lyrica, levothyroxine, citalopram, omeprazole, and various antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has pneumonia and is showing signs of increasing pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion. There is a risk of worsening respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient has a persistent fever and leukocytosis, indicating an ongoing infection. There is a possibility of resistant organisms causing the infection, and further investigation is needed to identify the specific pathogen and initiate appropriate treatment.
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or a combination of both. Close monitoring and management of blood pressure is essential to prevent organ damage.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has a history of renal dysfunction, and her baseline"

","Summary:
The patient was admitted to the MICU with a GI bleed and received NS and NGT lavage. An EGD showed erosion in the antrum and stomach body with one erosion having stigmata of recent bleeding. The patient was transfused with 4u PRBC and 4u FFP. They were also started on PPI IV BID and H. pylori serology was ordered. The patient received antibiotics (Zosyn and Vancomycin) and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential hypotension. This may be due to fluid loss from the GI bleed or other underlying conditions.
2. Delirium/confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which could be caused by various factors such as sepsis, medication side effects, or organ dysfunction.
3. Pneumonia (hospital-acquired, non-ventilator-associated): The patient has developed pneumonia, likely acquired during their hospital stay. This could be due to various reasons including compromised immune system or exposure to pathogens.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels in their blood, indicating potential respiratory issues.
5. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient is showing signs of systemic inflammation (sepsis) due to an infection. However, there is no mention of organ dysfunction at this time.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 yo f with paraplegia secondonary to MVA in [**2142**], h/o
   recurrent resistant infections, here with pneumonia and hypotesion.
   # Hypotension:
   Episode of hypotension this morning with MAPs down to 50s by aterial
   and cuff measures. Original hypotension was likely related to septic
   physiology; however, hypotension this AM most likely related to
   over-aggressive diuresis with furosemide yesterday given 4600 mL of UOP
   compounded with 3 large liquid stools this AM. Her hourly UOP declined
   from ~ 100 mL/hr overnight to ~ 50 mL/hr in two hour period of
   hypotension this AM. Was placed back on levophed after fluid bolus this
   AM with good response in BP.
   - IVF bolus for further decline in BP
   - Liberate from levophed quickly given tachycardia two days ago
   # Respiratory distress:
   Her respiratory distress is likely attributable to multiple etiologies.
   Overall improving with patient was liberated from face mask high flow
   O2 and now is on 5L NC. Primary cause of resp distress is pneumonia
   with poor sputum clearance leading to occasional mucus plugging
   associated with desats and tachypnea. Another component is heart
   failure evidenced by slight volume overload per CXR as well as BNP of
   >[**2138**]. Additional complicating factor is patient
s anxiety, which has
   caused period of tachypnea and desats.
   - Continue Vanc and Zosyn
   - Continue pulmonary hygiene with mucinex, chest PT, incentive [**Location (un) 2811**],
   acapella valve, and transfer to sit up in chair as tolerated
   - Attempt mechanical inexsufflator today
   - Hold on further diuresis until hypotension resolves
   - Avoid medications for anxiety and redirect verbally
   - Continue to replete phos aggressively
   #  Fever / leukocytosis:
   Afebrile in last 24 hours and WBC continues to trend down. Was 5.6 this
   AM, down from 8.5 yesterday. Patient has purulent productive cough and
   radiographic evidence of PNA. HAP is most likely explanation of her
   fever and leukocytosis. Sputum culture from [**5-2**] with NGTD.  She has
   history of resistant UTI, so that will be followed, though negative UA
   and urine cx thus far. Some consideration of PICC as infection source;
   however, attempt to gain peripheral access yesterday was unsuccessful.
   Will leave PICC line in at this time given that WBC trending down and
   afebrile. Legionella urinary antigen was negative.
   - Continue vanco/zosyn, with Vanc alternating between two PICC lumen
   - f/u blood cultures
   - f/u sputum culture given likelihood of resistant organisms
   # Delerium:
   For last two nights, patient has struggled from episodes of delirium
   associated with hallucinations and paranoid behavior. Most likely
   resulting from combination of medication effect from opiates, benozs,
   baclofen, oxybutinin, along with possible component of benzo
   withdrawal, compounded with erratic sleep-wake cycle in the ICU as well
   as line and tube attachment, also compounded with infectious process.
   - Treat infection
   - Continue to hold anticholinergic oxybutinin
   - Attempt to keep awake during day to allow sleep at night
   - untether as much as possible
   #  Depression and Anxiety:
   Episodes of anxiety significantly associated with O2 desaturation.
   Current med regimen is not controlling
   - Citalopram 40 mg
   - Klonopin QHS at minimum doses to prevent hypotension
   - Consult psychiatry for help in management of anxiety, delirium,
   depression
   #  h/o DVT:
   IVC filter in place since [**2142**].  Suspicion for PE currently low given
   PNA is much more likely diagnosis in setting of productive cough,
   infiltrate on CXR, fever, and leukocytosis, so will not pursue CTA at
   this point.
   - HepSC prophylaxis or pneumoboots if continues to refuse heparin
   #  Anemia:
   Baseline HCT 30-35. Was 23.5 this AM. Most recent anemia studies in
   [**11/2146**] consistent with anemia of chronic disease.
   - Trend HCT
   - Maintain active Type & screen
   - Guaiac stools
   #  Chronic pain:
   Contact [**Name (NI) 12**] pain physicians to discuss regimen and past experience.
   Some of her pain meds may be contributing to her hypotension and
   delirium. Pregabalin is currently at greater than maximum rec dose of
   300 mg/day.
   - Continue methadone, baclofen
   - Reduce pregabalin dose to 75 mg TID
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - TSH came back at 0.6, cont levothyroxine
   #  Constipation:
   Relief today with 3 large volume liquid bowel movements.
   - Continue bowel regimen of Polyethylene Glycol 17 grams daily,
   Docusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID, Senna 8.6 mg [**Hospital1 **], bisacodyl PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of paraplegia secondary to a motor vehicle accident, recurrent resistant infections, and currently admitted with pneumonia and hypotension. She has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including hypotension, respiratory distress, fever/leukocytosis, delirium, depression/anxiety, h/o DVT, anemia, chronic pain, hypothyroidism, and constipation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced an episode of hypotension this morning due to over-aggressive diuresis and large liquid stools. She was placed back on levophed after a fluid bolus, with a good response in blood pressure.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to multiple etiologies, including pneumonia with poor sputum clearance, heart failure, and anxiety. She is currently on 5L NC and requires continued pulmonary hygiene measures.
3. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient was febrile with leukocytosis, indicating a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Her sputum culture showed gram-negative bacilli, and she has a history of resistant UTI. Legionella urinary antigen was negative.
4. Delirium: The patient has been struggling with episodes of delirium associated with hallucinations and paranoid behavior. This could be due to medication effects, possible benzo withdrawal"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with paraplegia secondary to a motor vehicle accident in 2014, with a history of recurrent resistant infections. She is currently admitted with pneumonia and hypotension. The patient's hypotension this morning was likely related to over-aggressive diuresis with furosemide yesterday, compounded with large liquid stools. She was placed back on levophed after a fluid bolus, with good response in blood pressure.

The patient's respiratory distress is likely attributable to multiple etiologies, including pneumonia with poor sputum clearance, heart failure evidenced by slight volume overload on chest X-ray, and anxiety. The patient has purulent productive cough and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. She has a history of resistant urinary tract infection, but urine analysis and culture are negative so far. Some consideration of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line infection; however, the patient's white blood cell count is trending down and she is afebrile.

The patient has struggled with episodes of delirium associated with hallucinations and paranoid behavior, most likely resulting from medication effects and possible component of benzodiazepine withdrawal. The patient's anemia is consistent with anemia of chronic disease. She also has chronic pain, hypothyroidism, depression, anxiety, and constipation.

","The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has a history of anxiety and chronic pain. He was started on clonazepam for anxiety, but it was later recommended to discontinue its use due to extreme agitation. The patient also received Asian and trazodone, which were also recommended for discontinuation. Haloperidol was suggested as an alternative for extreme agitation.

The patient's sputum culture showed growth of Gram-negative rods (GNR), Bacillus species negative. The patient received piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin as antibiotics. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 125/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 86% on a nasal cannula.

The patient is receiving various medications in the ICU, including sedatives, analgesics, and antibiotics. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,660 mL, output of 2,180 mL, with a negative balance of 480 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.6 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, slightly elevated glucose level of 102 mg/dL, normal kidney function with creatinine of 0.2 mg"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 yo f with paraplegia secondonary to MVA in [**2142**], h/o
   recurrent resistant infections, here with pneumonia and hypotesion.
   # Respiratory distress:
   Her respiratory distress is likely attributable to multiple etiologies.
   Overall improving with sats in the high 90s on 4 L NC when without
   anxiety. Primary cause of resp distress is pneumonia with poor sputum
   clearance leading to occasional mucus plugging associated with desats
   and tachypnea. Complicating factor is patient
s anxiety, which has
   caused period of tachypnea and desats. Less likely to be contributing
   at this point is heart failure, as patient was diuresed to point of
   hypo tension yesterday and has had no increase in O2 requirement since
   that time.
   - Continue Vanc and Zosyn
   - Continue pulmonary hygiene with mucinex, chest PT, incentive [**Location (un) 2811**],
   acapella valve, in-exsufflator, and transfer to sit up in chair as
   tolerated
   - Hold on further diuresis and maintain even I/O
   #  Fever / leukocytosis:
   Afebrile in last few days and WBC essentially stable at 6.3 this AM.
   Patient has purulent productive cough and radiographic evidence of PNA.
   HAP is most likely explanation of her fever and leukocytosis. Sputum
   culture from [**5-2**] with GNR and no further speciation, thus unable to
   further tailor her therapy.  She has history of resistant UTI, so that
   will be followed, though negative UA and urine cx thus far. Some
   consideration of PICC as infection source; however, attempt to gain
   peripheral access [**2147-5-3**] was unsuccessful. Will leave PICC line in at
   this time given that WBC stable and afebrile. Legionella urinary
   antigen was negative.
   - Continue vanco/zosyn, with Vanc alternating between two PICC lumen
   - f/u blood cultures
   # Delerium:
   Patient has struggled from episodes of delirium associated with
   hallucinations and paranoid behavior overnight. Most likely resulting
   from combination of medication effect from opiates, benozs, baclofen,
   oxybutinin, along with possible component of benzo withdrawal,
   compounded with erratic sleep-wake cycle in the ICU as well as line and
   tube attachment, also compounded with infectious process.
   - Psychiatry consulted and helping with med managment
   - Continue to treat infection
   - Discontinue anticholinergic oxybutinin
   - Attempt to keep awake during day to allow sleep at night
   - Untether as much as possible
   # Hypotension:
   Was quickly liberated from levophed last night and had no further
   hypotensive episodes. Fluid balance was essentially even yesterday.
   Neurology feels unlikely to be autonomic dysfunction contributing given
   patient has been on bedrest.
   - No further diuresis at this time unless increasing repiratory
   difficulty unexplained by anxiety and respiratory secretions.
   #  Depression and Anxiety:
   Episodes of anxiety significantly associated with O2 desaturation.
   Current med regimen is not controlling well.
   - Citalopram 40 mg
   - Appreciate psychiatry input into med management of her anxiety
   without compromising resp status.
   #  h/o DVT:
   IVC filter in place since [**2142**].  Suspicion for PE currently low given
   PNA is much more likely diagnosis in setting of productive cough,
   infiltrate on CXR, fever, and leukocytosis, so will not pursue CTA at
   this point.
   - Pneumoboots for prophylaxis
   #  Anemia:
   Baseline HCT 30-35. Was 23.5 [**2147-5-4**] and has recovered spontaneously
   to 26.1. Most recent anemia studies in [**11/2146**] consistent with anemia
   of chronic disease.
   - Trend HCT
   - Maintain active Type & screen
   - Guaiac stools
   #  Chronic pain:
   Contact [**Name (NI) 12**] pain physicians to discuss regimen and past experience.
   Some of her pain meds may be contributing to her hypotension and
   delirium.
   - Continue methadone, baclofen
   - Continue pregabalin dose at 75 mg TID
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - TSH came back at 0.6, cont levothyroxine

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of paraplegia secondary to a motor vehicle accident (MVA), recurrent resistant infections, and currently admitted with pneumonia and hypotension. She has been experiencing respiratory distress, fever, leukocytosis, delirium, hypotension, depression, anxiety, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's condition requires careful management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to pneumonia with poor sputum clearance leading to occasional mucus plugging. Anxiety may also be contributing to her respiratory issues.
2. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, suggesting a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The sputum culture showed GNR bacteria, making it difficult to tailor antibiotic therapy. There is also a history of resistant urinary tract infection (UTI), which should be monitored.
3. Delirium: The patient has been experiencing episodes of delirium associated with hallucinations and paranoid behavior. This may be due to medication effects, such as opiates, benzodiazepines, baclofen, oxybutinin, and possible benzodiazepine withdrawal.
4. Hypotension: The patient had episodes of hypotension but has been successfully weaned off vasopressor support. Neurological involvement seems unlikely"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and sepsis. They have a history of chronic pain, anxiety, and delirium. The patient continues to exhibit chest pain and has been prescribed clonazepam for anxiety. Neurologic recommendations suggest there is no autonomic instability. Sputum culture results indicate a hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypoxemia, and hypertension. They are receiving IV fluids and antibiotics, and their blood glucose levels are within normal range. The patient's mental status remains unchanged.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: Despite initial improvement, the patient's vital signs indicate ongoing hypotension and hypoxemia, which could suggest progression to sepsis with organ dysfunction.
2. Pneumonia Complications: The hospital-acquired pneumonia may lead to further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or respiratory failure.
3. Delirium: The patient's persistent delirium and confusion could increase the risk of falls, self-extubation, or other safety concerns in the ICU.
4. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion and could lead to organ dysfunction.
5. Ineffective Coping: The patient's ineffective coping mechanisms may contribute to increased anxiety and agitation, potentially leading to more severe complications.
6. Pain Management: The patient's acute and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis and pneumonia. The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuating vital signs and ongoing respiratory distress. He has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, as well as supportive care measures such as O2 delivery through a nasal cannula, morphine sulfate for pain control, and haloperidol for anxiety.

24-hour events include the initiation of a new anxiety regimen with haldol and ativan PRN, discontinuation of trazodone, and discontinuation of oxybutynin. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 78 bpm, hypotension with blood pressure readings ranging from 138/75 mmHg to 93/54 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation remains stable at 99%. The patient's temperature is slightly low at 35.6°C (96°F).

Physical examination findings include general lethargy, slightly diaphoretic, elevated heart sounds with regular rhythm, diffuse rhonchi with coarse crackles in the lungs that clear minimally with cough, soft and mildly distended abdomen with trace bilateral lower extremity edema, and tender right peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line without surrounding erythema.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50 yo f with paraplegia secondonary to MVA in [**2142**], h/o
   recurrent resistant infections, here with pneumonia and hypotesion.
   # Respiratory distress:
   Her respiratory distress is likely attributable to multiple etiologies.
   Overall improving with sats in the high 90s on NC when without anxiety.
   Primary cause of resp distress is pneumonia with poor sputum clearance
   leading to occasional mucus plugging associated with desats and
   tachypnea. Complicating factor is patient
s anxiety, which has caused
   period of tachypnea and desats. Less likely to be contributing at this
   point is heart failure, as patient was diuresed to point of hypo
   tension yesterday and has had no increase in O2 requirement since that
   time.
   - Continue Vanc and Zosyn
   - Continue pulmonary hygiene with mucinex, chest PT, incentive [**Location (un) 2811**],
   acapella valve, in-exsufflator, and transfer to sit up in chair as
   tolerated
   - Hold on further diuresis and maintain even I/O
   #  Fever / leukocytosis:
   Afebrile in last few days and WBC normal this AM. Patient has purulent
   productive cough and radiographic evidence of PNA. HAP is most likely
   explanation of her fever and leukocytosis. Sputum culture from [**5-2**]
   with GNR and no further speciation, thus unable to further tailor her
   therapy.  She has history of resistant UTI, so that will be followed,
   though negative UA and urine cx thus far. Some consideration of PICC as
   infection source; however, attempt to gain peripheral access [**2147-5-3**]
   was unsuccessful. Will leave PICC line in at this time given that WBC
   stable and afebrile. Legionella urinary antigen was negative.
   - Continue vanco/zosyn, with Vanc alternating between two PICC lumen
   - f/u blood cultures
   # Delerium:
   Patient has struggled from episodes of delirium associated with
   hallucinations and paranoid behavior overnight. Most likely resulting
   from combination of medication effect from opiates, benozs, baclofen,
   oxybutynin, along with possible component of benzo withdrawal,
   compounded with erratic sleep-wake cycle in the ICU as well as line and
   tube attachment, also compounded with infectious process.
   - Psychiatry consulted and helping with med management, cont PRN Haldol
   and Ativan
   - Continue to treat infection
   - Discontinue anticholinergic oxybutinin
   - Attempt to keep awake during day to allow sleep at night
   # Hypotension:
   Was quickly liberated from levophed last night and had no further
   hypotensive episodes. Fluid balance was essentially even yesterday.
   Neurology feels unlikely to be autonomic dysfunction contributing given
   patient has been on bedrest.
   - No further diuresis at this time unless increasing repiratory
   difficulty unexplained by anxiety and respiratory secretions.
   #  Depression and Anxiety:
   Episodes of anxiety significantly associated with O2 desaturation.
   Current med regimen is not controlling well.
   - Citalopram 40 mg
   - Appreciate psychiatry input into med management of her anxiety
   without compromising resp status.
   #  h/o DVT:
   IVC filter in place since [**2142**].  Suspicion for PE currently low given
   PNA is much more likely diagnosis in setting of productive cough,
   infiltrate on CXR, fever, and leukocytosis, so will not pursue CTA at
   this point.
   - Pneumoboots for prophylaxis
   #  Anemia:
   Baseline HCT 30-35. Was 23.5 [**2147-5-4**] and has recovered slightly. Most
   recent anemia studies in [**11/2146**] consistent with anemia of chronic
   disease.
   - Trend HCT
   - Maintain active Type & screen
   - Guaiac stools
   #  Chronic pain:
   Contact [**Name (NI) 12**] pain physicians to discuss regimen and past experience.
   Some of her pain meds may be contributing to her hypotension and
   delirium.
   - Continue methadone and baclofen
   - Continue pregabalin dose at 75 mg TID
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - TSH came back at 0.6, cont levothyroxine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with paraplegia secondary to a motor vehicle accident in 2014, with a history of recurrent resistant infections. She was admitted with pneumonia and hypotension. The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to multiple factors, including pneumonia with poor sputum clearance and anxiety. The fever and leukocytosis may be explained by hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient also experienced episodes of delirium associated with hallucinations and paranoid behavior, which could be attributed to medication effects, possible benzodiazepine withdrawal, erratic sleep-wake cycle, and the infectious process. The patient's hypotension was successfully managed without the need for vasopressors. The patient's depression and anxiety are not well-controlled by the current medication regimen. She has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place since 2014. There is suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE), but it is currently low. The patient has anemia, which is consistent with anemia of chronic disease. She also suffers from chronic pain, which may be contributing to her hypotension and delirium. The patient has hypothyroidism, for which she is being treated with levothyroxine. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein throm"

   - Continue vanco/zosyn, with Vanc alternating between two PICC lumen
   - f/u blood cultures
   # Delerium:
   Patient has struggled from episodes of delirium associated with
   hallucinations and paranoid behavior overnight. Most likely resulting
   from combination of medication effect from opiates, benozs, baclofen,
   oxybutinin, along with possible component of benzo withdrawal,
   compounded with erratic sleep-wake cycle in the ICU as well as line and
   tube attachment, also compounded with infectious process.
   - Psychiatry consulted and helping with med managment
   - Continue to treat infection
   - Discontinue anticholinergic oxybutinin
   - Attempt to keep awake during day to allow sleep at night
   - Untether as much as possible
   # Hypotension:
   Was quickly liberated from levophed last night and had no further
   hypotensive episodes. Fluid balance was essentially even yesterday.
   Neurology feels unlikely to be autonomic dysfunction contributing given
   patient has been on bedrest.
   - No further diuresis at this time unless increasing repiratory
   difficulty unexplained by anxiety and respiratory secretions.
   #  Depression and Anxiety:
   Episodes of anxiety significantly associated with O2 desaturation.
   Current med regimen is not controlling well.
   - Citalopram 40 mg
   - Appreciate psychiatry input into med management of her anxiety
   without compromising resp status.
   #  h/o DVT:
   IVC filter in place since [**2142**].  Suspicion for PE currently low given
   PNA is much more likely diagnosis in setting of productive cough,
   infiltrate on CXR, fever, and leukocytosis, so will not pursue CTA at
   this point.
   - Pneumoboots for prophylaxis
   #  Anemia:
   Baseline HCT 30-35. Was 23.5 [**2147-5-4**] and has recovered spontaneously
   to 26.1. Most recent anemia studies in [**11/2146**] consistent with anemia
   of chronic disease.
   - Trend HCT
   - Maintain active Type & screen
   - Guaiac stools
   #  Chronic pain:
   Contact [**Name (NI) 12**] pain physicians to discuss regimen and past experience.
   Some of her pain meds may be contributing to her hypotension and
   delirium.
   - Continue methadone, baclofen
   - Continue pregabalin dose at 75 mg TID
   #  Hypothyroidism:
   - TSH came back at 0.6, cont levothyroxine
