   UA: RBC, moderate bacteria
   Sputum Gram Stain: 3+ GNR
   Chest CT w/ RLL consolidation, Head CT negative for ICH
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, HTN, recent
   subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and
   recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia
   presenting to the ED with respiratory distress and altered mental
   status.
   .
   #1 Shock, likely septic in origin: Patient's blood pressures on a line
   are higher than cuff and we are actively weaning his levophed.
   Currently on 0.03 Given that BPs declined after meds for intubation,
   patient likely volume deplete.  Patient received approximately 5L NS
   between ED and MICU stay. Has central venous access and arterial line
   for close monitoring. Received vanc/zosyn in ED -> switched to
   meropenem in MICU per ID request.  CT w/consolidation RLL and copious
   sputum upon suctioning in ED and in MICU.  Unresolved pna from prior
   admission (acinetobacter= pna source v colonization) vs new pna
   (possibly aspiration due to change in mental status?)
   - transduce a line continuously
   - maintain CVP > or = 10 with NS boluses
   - pressors to maintain MAP > 60 (currently on levophed, weaning down)
   - follow blood, urine, and sputum Cx
   - continue vanc & meropenem as discussed with ID team
   - serial EKGs and enzymes though suspect that elevated troponin and EKG
   changes related to shock/low BP/demand ischemia
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Likely related to underlying infection/shock;
   of note he has had multiple prior similar episodes with recent
   infections (bacteremia, pneumonia). Was also notably hypernatremic,
   likely due to combination of Lasix and poor PO intake after
   extubatoin.  Head CT shows no acute changes and exam at this point is
   nonfocal.  To keep in mind that patient had new embolic CVA on MRI
   during last admission, although neuro commented at that time that the
   area affected should not significantly affect his mental status.
   - monitor mental status
   - consider repeat MRI if focal neurologic deficits develop
   .
   #3 Respiratory failure: Intubated on arrival; had desat to 80s at rehab
   facility with ABG documenting pO2 in the 40s. Could be secondary to new
   pneumonia/infectious process or worsening of prior pneumonia which
   seems unlikely given broad coverage and protracted course with acute
   decompensation. Likely an aspiration event or inability to handle
   secretions with mucous plugging as mental status waned.  Demonstrated
   insufficient cough effort after extubation during prior admission.
   - wean ventilator as tolerates by ABGs
   - treat for possible pulmonary source as above
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Recent creatinine levels here
   1.6-2 with current level now 2.4. Continue to monitor. Suspect that
   slight elevation currently due to hypovolemia/shock.
   - PM electrolytes today after fluid resuscitation.
   - monitor creatinine daily
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely related to hypovolemia due to poor PO intake at
   rehab.
   - volume repletion, including free water flushes in tube feeds
   - once euvolemic, re-evaluate for ? D5w needs versus NG flushes
   .
   # INR elevation: Likely nutritional given protracted ICU stay. One dose
   of vitamin K given for repletion.
   - DIC labs pending
   - Consider additional doses of Vitamin K
   .
   # UGI bleed: small amount of coffee ground like secretions from NG
   tube. INR elevated, in setting of likely septic shock, concern for DIC.
   - DIC labs as above
   - vitamin K given
   - follow coags
   - PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - fingersticks four times daily
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis:
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-21**])
   - follow blood cultures
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Starting tube feeds as per nutrition recs from prior admission.
   Repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], bowel regimen, heparin SC TID
   .
   # ACCESS: R IJ CVL, right A line, PIV

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, recent subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and altered mental status. He presented to the emergency department with respiratory distress and altered mental status. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to the following potential medical complications:

1. Shock, likely septic in origin: The patient's blood pressures are fluctuating, indicating a possible volume depletion. He has received approximately 5 liters of normal saline between the ED and MICU stay. The patient has central venous access and an arterial line for close monitoring. He is currently on levophed, weaning down, and will be maintained with NS boluses, pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60, continuous blood, urine, and sputum cultures, as well as ongoing administration of vancomycin and meropenem as discussed with the ID team.

2. Altered mental status: This is likely related to underlying infection/shock. The patient has had multiple prior similar episodes with recent infections (bacteremia, pneumonia). He was also notably hypernatremic, likely due to the combination of Lasix and poor PO intake after extubation. A head CT shows no acute changes, and the exam at this point is nonfocal.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who presented to the ICU with altered mental status, respiratory failure, shock, and fever. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors, including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiorgan dysfunction. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, multi-lumen catheter, arterial line, and receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, midazolam, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of blood clots in the deep veins.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical condition and use of corticosteroids may increase the risk of stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.
4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's compromised immune system due to sepsis and prolonged hospital stay increases the risk of acquiring infections from healthcare-associated sources.
5. ARDS progression: The patient's lungs may continue to deteriorate, leading to worsening respiratory function and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

   recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia
   presenting to the ED with respiratory distress and altered mental
   status.
   .
   # Shock, likely septic in origin: Patient's blood pressures on a line
   are higher than cuff and we are actively weaning his levophed. Given
   that BPs declined after meds for intubation, patient likely volume
   deplete and we will continue to give volume tonight. Has central venous
   access and arterial line for close monitoring.
   - transduce a line continuously
   - maintain CVP > or = 10 with NS boluses
   - pressors to maintain MAP > 60 (currently on levophed, weaning down)
   - follow culture results --> send sputum culture
   - broad spectrum antiobiotics, vanc & meropenem as discussed with ID
   team
   - consider [**Last Name (un) **] stim test if unable to wean pressors by AM
   - serial EKGs and enzymes though suspect that elevated troponin and EKG
   changes related to shock/low BP/demand ischemia
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely related to underlying infection/shock;
   of note he has had multiple prior similar episodes with recent
   infections (bacteremia, pneumonia). Head CT shows no acute changes and
   exam at this point is nonfocal.
   - monitor mental status
   - consider repeat MRI if focal neurologic deficits develop
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on arrival; had desat to 80s at rehab
   facility with ABG documenting pO2 in the 40s. Could be secondary to new
   pneumonia/infectious process or worsening of prior pneumonia which
   seems unlikely given broad coverage and protracted course with acute
   decompensation. Likely an aspiration event or inability to handle
   secretions with mucous plugging as mental status waned.
   - wean ventilator as tolerates by ABGs
   - treat for possible pulmonary source as above
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs
   .
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Recent creatinine levels here 1.6-2 with
   current level 1.9. Continue to monitor. Suspect that slight elevation
   currently due to hypovolemia/shock.
   - monitor creatinine daily
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely related to hypovolemia due to poor PO intake at
   rehab.
   - volume repletion
   - once euvolemic, re-evaluate for ? D5w needs versus NG flushes
   .
   # INR elevation: Likely nutritional given protracted ICU stay. Consider
   vitamin K for repletion.
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - fingersticks four times daily
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis:
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-21**])

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 66-year-old man with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, recent subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia.
- The patient presented to the ED with respiratory distress and altered mental status.
- The patient's blood pressure is low and requires pressor support.
- The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has a central venous catheter and arterial line for close monitoring.
- The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an infection.
- The patient's creatinine level is elevated, suggesting chronic renal insufficiency.
- The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to poor oral intake.
- The patient has an elevated INR, possibly due to malnutrition.
- The patient has a history of MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis.
- The patient has Parkinson's disease and hypothyroidism.
- The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has a multi-lumen central venous catheter, arterial line, and peripheral IV line.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Septic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated white blood cell count indicate a possible infection leading to septic shock.
2. Acute kidney injury"

   - maintain CVP > or = 10 with NS boluses
   - pressors to maintain MAP > 60 (currently on levophed, weaning down)
   - follow culture results --> send sputum culture
   - broad spectrum antiobiotics, vanc & meropenem as discussed with ID
   team
   - consider [**Last Name (un) **] stim test if unable to wean pressors by AM
   - serial EKGs and enzymes though suspect that elevated troponin and EKG
   changes related to shock/low BP/demand ischemia
   .
   # Altered mental status: Likely related to underlying infection/shock;
   of note he has had multiple prior similar episodes with recent
   infections (bacteremia, pneumonia). Head CT shows no acute changes and
   exam at this point is nonfocal.
   - monitor mental status
   - consider repeat MRI if focal neurologic deficits develop
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated on arrival; had desat to 80s at rehab
   facility with ABG documenting pO2 in the 40s. Could be secondary to new
   pneumonia/infectious process or worsening of prior pneumonia which
   seems unlikely given broad coverage and protracted course with acute
   decompensation. Likely an aspiration event or inability to handle
   secretions with mucous plugging as mental status waned.
   - wean ventilator as tolerates by ABGs
   - treat for possible pulmonary source as above
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs
   .
   # Chronic renal insufficiency: Recent creatinine levels here 1.6-2 with
   current level 1.9. Continue to monitor. Suspect that slight elevation
   currently due to hypovolemia/shock.
   - monitor creatinine daily
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely related to hypovolemia due to poor PO intake at
   rehab.
   - volume repletion
   - once euvolemic, re-evaluate for ? D5w needs versus NG flushes
   .
   # INR elevation: Likely nutritional given protracted ICU stay. Consider
   vitamin K for repletion.
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - fingersticks four times daily

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, recent subdural hematoma, recent streptococcus bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the medical intensive care unit for altered mental status and pneumonia. The patient presented to the emergency department with respiratory distress and altered mental status.

Based on the patient's current condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's blood pressures are low, and he is on vasopressor support, indicating possible septic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs, central venous pressure, and fluid balance is necessary.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator should be done cautiously based on arterial blood gas (ABG) results. Aggressive chest physiotherapy and pulmonary toilet are also recommended.

3. Renal insufficiency: The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, and his recent creatinine levels range from 1.6 to 2. Close monitoring of renal function and daily creatinine levels is essential.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated serum sodium levels, likely due to poor oral intake at the rehabilitation facility. Volume repletion and re-evaluation of fluid needs are necessary.

5. INR elevation: The patient's elevated international normalized ratio (INR)"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, HTN, recent
   subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and
   recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia
   presenting to the ED with respiratory distress and altered mental
   status.
   .
   #1 Shock, likely septic in origin: Patient's blood pressures on a line
   are higher than cuff and we are actively weaning his levophed.
   Currently on 0.03 Given that BPs declined after meds for intubation,
   patient likely volume deplete.  Patient received approximately 5L NS
   between ED and MICU stay. Has central venous access and arterial line
   for close monitoring. Received vanc/zosyn in ED -> switched to
   meropenem in MICU per ID request.  CT w/consolidation RLL and copious
   sputum upon suctioning in ED and in MICU.  Unresolved pna from prior
   admission (acinetobacter= pna source v colonization) vs new pna
   (possibly aspiration due to change in mental status?)
   - transduce a line continuously
   - maintain CVP > or = 10 with NS boluses
   - pressors to maintain MAP > 60 (currently on levophed, weaning down)
   - follow blood, urine, and sputum Cx
   - continue vanc & meropenem as discussed with ID team
   - serial EKGs and enzymes though suspect that elevated troponin and EKG
   changes related to shock/low BP/demand ischemia
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Likely related to underlying infection/shock;
   of note he has had multiple prior similar episodes with recent
   infections (bacteremia, pneumonia). Was also notably hypernatremic,
   likely due to combination of Lasix and poor PO intake after
   extubatoin.  Head CT shows no acute changes and exam at this point is
   nonfocal.  To keep in mind that patient had new embolic CVA on MRI
   during last admission, although neuro commented at that time that the
   area affected should not significantly affect his mental status.
   - monitor mental status
   - consider repeat MRI if focal neurologic deficits develop
   .
   #3 Respiratory failure: Intubated on arrival; had desat to 80s at rehab
   facility with ABG documenting pO2 in the 40s. Could be secondary to new
   pneumonia/infectious process or worsening of prior pneumonia which
   seems unlikely given broad coverage and protracted course with acute
   decompensation. Likely an aspiration event or inability to handle
   secretions with mucous plugging as mental status waned.  Demonstrated
   insufficient cough effort after extubation during prior admission.
   - wean ventilator as tolerates by ABGs
   - treat for possible pulmonary source as above
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Recent creatinine levels here
   1.6-2 with current level now 2.4. Continue to monitor. Suspect that
   slight elevation currently due to hypovolemia/shock.
   - PM electrolytes today after fluid resuscitation.
   - monitor creatinine daily
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Likely related to hypovolemia due to poor PO intake at
   rehab.
   - volume repletion, including free water flushes in tube feeds
   - once euvolemic, re-evaluate for ? D5w needs versus NG flushes
   .
   # INR elevation: Likely nutritional given protracted ICU stay. One dose
   of vitamin K given for repletion.
   - DIC labs pending
   - Consider additional doses of Vitamin K
   .
   # UGI bleed: small amount of coffee ground like secretions from NG
   tube. INR elevated, in setting of likely septic shock, concern for DIC.
   - DIC labs as above
   - vitamin K given
   - follow coags
   - PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - fingersticks four times daily
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis:
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-21**])
   - follow blood cultures
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Starting tube feeds as per nutrition recs from prior admission.
   Repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], bowel regimen, heparin SC TID

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and
   fever.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Intubated on vent. Satting well now w/ PO2 147.
   PO2/FiO2 >300 so likely not ARDS. Likely PNA w/ GNR growing from
   sputum. Also contribution from aspiration likely as he does not clear
   secretions appropriately.
   - wean FiO2 to 30%
   - Vanco/Meropenem empirically for now
   - F/U sputum cultures
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent now but responding
   appropriately to commands. Likely [**2-6**] sepsis as he has presented this
   way before.
   - Follow mental status as he is weaned from sedation after weaning from
   vent.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Muddy brown casts on spun urine
   likely ATN.
   -          monitor creatinine daily
   -          Treat sepsis
   -          Support BP w/ fluid boluses as needed.
   .
   #Shock: Resolved, multifactorial sepsis and dehydration from poor PO
   intake. Cr still elevated likely ATN
   - Monitor BP w/ A line.
   .
   # INR elevation: Likely nutritional given protracted ICU stay. One dose
   of vitamin K given for repletion.
   - DIC labs pending
   - Consider additional doses of Vitamin K
   .
   # UGI bleed: small amount of coffee ground like secretions from NG
   tube. INR elevated, in setting of likely septic shock, concern for DIC.
   - DIC labs as above
   - vitamin K given
   - follow coags
   - PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - fingersticks four times daily
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis:
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-21**])
   - follow blood cultures
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Starting tube feeds as per nutrition recs from prior admission.
   Repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], bowel regimen, heparin SC TID
   .
   # ACCESS: R IJ CVL, right A line, PIV
   .
   # CODE: Full code, confirmed with wife. Consent for ICU in chart.
   .
   # COMM: With patient and family. Wife [**Name (NI) 625**] is HCP. Phone #
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2577**].
   .
   # DISP: ICU care for now.
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old man with several medical conditions and complications. The chief complaint is not specified, but the patient has been admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and Vt set at 500 mL.

The patient has a history of recent subdural hematoma, recent streptococcus bovis bacteremia, MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and endocarditis involving the aortic valve. He also has a known diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, and chronic renal insufficiency.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 38.3°C (101°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/52 to 139/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilaterally, a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, and a small, reducible umbilical hernia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with slightly elevated creatinine and blood glucose levels. Other lab values"

   66 yo male with Strep Bovis endocarditis and MRSA/Enterococcal
   bactermia with recurrent admission with Acinetobacter PNA now with
   readmission from Rehab wtih sepsis and worsening respiratory failure
   concerning for aspiation pneumonitis/pneumonia.  He returns with acute
   respiratory failure and findings consistent with sepsis and concern for
   pulmonary source.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with likely aspiration event upon
   transfer to rehab leading to return to ICU for further care in the
   setting or pre-existing pneumonia with bilateral patchy infiltrates
   noted.
   -Continue with Vanco/[**Last Name (un) 350**] and consider change to Dobirax if ID supports
   that
   -[**Month (only) 8**] be a component of [**Doctor Last Name 76**] in the setting of previous pneumonia and
   will continue with low Vt approach
   -Differential does include alveolar hemorrhage and embolic phenomena
   but this appears less likely
   -Atrovent
   -Move to PSV as possible
   -Follow up cultures given the bilateral patchy infiltrates noted
   -Had completed Tobra/[**Last Name (un) 350**] pior to discharge
   -Move to PSV today
   2)Sepsis-
   -Vanco/Meropenem in place
   -Will need to consider broadening if further fevers/hypotension or
   increased secretions seen
   -IVF needed and pressors D/C
d yesterday which may represent sepsis
   with improvement with fluids

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of Strep Bovis endocarditis and MRSA/Enterococcal bacteremia. He has been admitted multiple times, including this current readmission from rehab with sepsis and worsening respiratory failure. The patient's chief complaints are sepsis, respiratory failure, and aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia.

From the assessment and plan section, the following potential medical complications can arise:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has likely experienced an aspiration event upon transfer to rehab, leading to acute respiratory failure. There is also concern for pre-existing pneumonia with bilateral patchy infiltrates noted. The plan includes continuing with Vancomycin and considering a change to Dobirax if ID supports it. Low Vt approach will be continued, and the patient will be moved to PSV as possible. Atrovent will be used, and follow-up cultures will be given due to the bilateral patchy infiltrates.
2. Sepsis: The patient is currently receiving Vancomycin and Meropenem, which will be continued. Broadening the antibiotic coverage may be necessary if further fevers, hypotension, or increased secretions are observed. IVF and pressors were discontinued yesterday but may need to be restarted.
3. Endocarditis/Bacteremia: Vancomycin will continue with a goal of a 6-week course.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and
   fever.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Intubated on vent. Satting well now w/ PO2 147.
   PO2/FiO2 >300 so likely not ARDS. Likely PNA w/ GNR growing from
   sputum. Also contribution from aspiration likely as he does not clear
   secretions appropriately.
   - wean FiO2 to 30%
   - Vanco/Meropenem empirically for now
   - F/U sputum cultures
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent now but responding
   appropriately to commands. Likely [**2-6**] sepsis as he has presented this
   way before.
   - Follow mental status as he is weaned from sedation after weaning from
   vent.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Muddy brown casts on spun urine
   likely ATN.
   -          monitor creatinine daily
   -          Treat sepsis
   -          Support BP w/ fluid boluses as needed.
   .
   #Shock: Resolved, multifactorial sepsis and dehydration from poor PO
   intake. Cr still elevated likely ATN
   - Monitor BP w/ A line.
   .
   # INR elevation: Likely nutritional given protracted ICU stay. One dose
   of vitamin K given for repletion.
   - DIC labs pending
   - Consider additional doses of Vitamin K
   .
   # UGI bleed: small amount of coffee ground like secretions from NG
   tube. INR elevated, in setting of likely septic shock, concern for DIC.
   - DIC labs as above
   - vitamin K given
   - follow coags
   - PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - fingersticks four times daily
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis:
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-21**])
   - follow blood cultures
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Starting tube feeds as per nutrition recs from prior admission.
   Repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   # PPx: PPI [**Hospital1 **], bowel regimen, heparin SC TID
   .
   # ACCESS: R IJ CVL, right A line, PIV
   .
   # CODE: Full code, confirmed with wife. Consent for ICU in chart.

","The patient is a 66-year-old man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and fever. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PO2/FiO2 ratio greater than 300, indicating no acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has an infection with GNR growing from sputum, likely pneumonia with aspiration also contributing to respiratory failure.

The patient has altered mental status, likely due to sepsis as he has presented this way before. His renal function is compromised, with muddy brown casts on urine analysis suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN). His INR is elevated, possibly due to poor nutrition from a protracted ICU stay. There is concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) given the elevated INR and evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding from the nasogastric tube.

The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, and a history of MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis. He is currently receiving antibiotics, sedation, and other supportive measures. His code status is full code, and he is being provided with ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and
   fever.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Intubated on vent. Satting well now w/ PO2 147.
   PO2/FiO2 >300 so likely not ARDS. Likely PNA w/ GNR growing from
   sputum. Also contribution from aspiration likely as he does not clear
   secretions appropriately.
   - wean FiO2 to 30%
   - Vanco/Meropenem empirically for now
   - F/U sputum cultures
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent now but responding
   appropriately to commands. Likely [**2-6**] sepsis as he has presented this
   way before.
   - Follow mental status as he is weaned from sedation after weaning from
   vent.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Muddy brown casts on spun urine
   likely ATN.
   -          monitor creatinine daily
   -          Treat sepsis
   -          Support BP w/ fluid boluses as needed.
   .
   #Shock: Resolved, multifactorial sepsis and dehydration from poor PO
   intake. Cr still elevated likely ATN
   - Monitor BP w/ A line.
   .
   # INR elevation: Likely nutritional given protracted ICU stay. One dose
   of vitamin K given for repletion.
   - DIC labs pending
   - Consider additional doses of Vitamin K
   .
   # UGI bleed: small amount of coffee ground like secretions from NG
   tube. INR elevated, in setting of likely septic shock, concern for DIC.
   - DIC labs as above
   - vitamin K given
   - follow coags
   - PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - fingersticks four times daily
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis:
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-21**])
   - follow blood cultures
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Starting tube feeds as per nutrition recs from prior admission.
   Repleting electrolytes as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has a fever and is growing GNR (Klebsiella) from sputum cultures. He also has muddy brown casts on urine spun, indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's INR is elevated, and there are concerns for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, and is starting tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).

2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and now has a fever and growth of GNR from sputum cultures. This suggests ongoing infection and potential sepsis.

3. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The presence of muddy brown casts on urine spun indicates ATN,"

","The patient is a 66-year-old man with multiple comorbidities, including recent subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia, and now with respiratory failure and fever. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's fever and muddy brown casts in the urine suggest acute kidney injury (ATN). The patient is also being treated for MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia with vancomycin and meropenem empirically. The patient has a history of altered mental status, likely due to sedation from mechanical ventilation, but is responding appropriately to commands.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine level, elevated prothrombin time (PT), and declining platelet count. The patient also has thrombocytopenia and a prolonged PT/activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ratio. The patient's INR is elevated at 1.4, which may be due to malnutrition from the prolonged ICU stay. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/61 mmHg, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 of 30%. The patient's temperature is 38.7°C (101.6°F). The patient is receiving midazolam, fentanyl, and heparin sodium prophylactically.

The patient has multiple potential medical complications, including respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, altered mental status, acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. The patient's treatment plan includes aggressive chest physical therapy and pulmonary toilet, antibiotics for Klebsiella pneumonia, supportive care for acute kidney injury, close monitoring of coagulation parameters, and management of thrombocytopenia.

In summary, the patient is a 66-year-old man with multiple comorbidities and acute complications, including respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. The patient is receiving aggressive treatment for pneumonia and supportive care for his other conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yo male with recurrent endocarditis and now re-admitted to ICU with
   fever, sepsis and likely aspiraiton pneumonitis/pneumonia following
   discharge to rehab setting.  This would be suggested to be supported by
   findings on sputum with Klebsiella found on initial culture results
   1)Respiratory Failure-In the setting of prominent secretations and need
   to clear what is likley Klebsiella PNA will move to extubation slowly
   and driven primarily but limitations in regards to mental status and
   secretion volume.  He has been able to wean FIO2 and venilation has
   been with reasonable background requirement.  It is important to note
   that patient does have report of difficult airway for intubation noted
   in past.  Patient with peak pressure=28, Pplat=21, PEEP=10 yielding
   favorable pulmonary mechanics.
   -Will continue with pulmonary toilet in the setting of significant
   secretion volume
   -Will move to negative fluid balance if needed in the setting of fever
   resolution
   -Move to PSV today
   -If unable to maintain stable airway post extubation will have to
   consider tracheostomy but given likely rapid improvement if aspiration
   pneumonitis is only source will be able to hopefully maintain
   independent airway.
   2)Sepsis-Patient off pressors and with concerning findings suggesting
   ATN on urine evaluation.  [**Month (only) 8**] well be pulmonary source with GNR
s noted
   on culture results.
   -Continue with Vanco/Meropenem
   -Follow up final culture sensitivities
   -
   3)Endocarditis-
   -Continue with Vanco
   4)Parkinson's Disease-
   requip and Sinemet continuing
   Additional issues to be addressed and managed as defined in the

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with recurrent endocarditis who has been readmitted to the ICU with fever, sepsis, and likely aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. The patient's medical history includes Parkinson's disease and previous episodes of respiratory failure.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, FiO2 of 30%, and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The plateau pressure is 25 cmH2O, and compliance is 33.3 cmH2O/mL. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 403.

The patient has been febrile since 02:00 AM on 12/3, with temperatures ranging from 101.6°F to 38.6°C. Blood cultures have shown growth of GNRs, specifically Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient also has muddy brown casts seen on urinalysis microscopy, suggesting possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN). 

The patient's electrolyte levels are as follows: sodium 136 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 98 mEq/L, bicarbonate 32 mg/dL, BUN 36 mg/dL, glucose 145 mg/dL, creatinine 2.4 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 36 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 21.8 K/uL, and platelet count has decreased to 50% of baseline.

The patient is being treated with vancomycin and meropenem for sepsis and pneumonia. The plan includes continuing with pulmonary toilet, moving to pressure support ventilation (PSV), and considering tracheostomy if necessary. The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Sepsis: The patient is still septic, and there is a risk of progression or development of new organ dysfunctions.
3. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The presence of muddy brown casts and elevated creatinine levels suggest ATN, which can lead to renal dysfunction.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has significantly decreased, indicating thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, particularly the potassium and chloride levels, which can affect cardiac and neuromuscular function.

It is important to closely monitor"

   fever, sepsis and likely aspiraiton pneumonitis/pneumonia following
   discharge to rehab setting.  This would be suggested to be supported by
   findings on sputum with Klebsiella found on initial culture results
   1)Respiratory Failure-In the setting of prominent secretations and need
   to clear what is likley Klebsiella PNA will move to extubation slowly
   and driven primarily but limitations in regards to mental status and
   secretion volume.  He has been able to wean FIO2 and venilation has
   been with reasonable background requirement.  It is important to note
   that patient does have report of difficult airway for intubation noted
   in past.  Patient with peak pressure=28, Pplat=21, PEEP=10 yielding
   favorable pulmonary mechanics.
   -Will continue with pulmonary toilet in the setting of significant
   secretion volume
   -Will move to negative fluid balance if needed in the setting of fever
   resolution
   -Move to PSV today
   -If unable to maintain stable airway post extubation will have to
   consider tracheostomy but given likely rapid improvement if aspiration
   pneumonitis is only source will be able to hopefully maintain
   independent airway.
   2)Sepsis-Patient off pressors and with concerning findings suggesting
   ATN on urine evaluation.  [**Month (only) 8**] well be pulmonary source with GNR
s noted
   on culture results.
   -Continue with Vanco/Meropenem
   -Follow up final culture sensitivities
   -
   3)Endocarditis-
   -Continue with Vanco
   4)Parkinson's Disease-
   requip and Sinemet continuing
   Additional issues to be addressed and managed as defined in the
   housestaff note of this date.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of recurrent endocarditis who has been admitted to the ICU with fever, sepsis, and likely aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, suggesting an ongoing infection. The patient's urine analysis indicates muddy brown casts, which could be indicative of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient is being treated with antibiotics (Vanco/Meropenem) and anticoagulation therapy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may worsen if the aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia does not improve with treatment. Close monitoring and appropriate management of the patient's ventilation settings are necessary.
2. Sepsis: Despite being off pressors, the patient remains at risk for sepsis due to the ongoing infection. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is crucial to detect any deterioration.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI)/ATN: The presence of muddy brown casts in the urine suggests ATN, which can be a complication of sepsis. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are required.
4. Endocarditis: The patient's recurrent endocarditis needs to be addressed and managed appropriately to prevent further complications.
5. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient may develop"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and
   fever.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Likely second to aspiration pneumonia given
   clinical presentation and sputum Cx w/Klebsiella.  Intubated on vent.
   Satting well now w/ PO2 147. PO2/FiO2 >300 so likely not ARDS.  FiO2
   weaned to 30% w/[**Last Name **] problem.
   - Vanco/Meropenem empirically for now
 Meropenem w/Klebsiella coverage
   - F/U sputum culture sensitivities -> can narrow Abx spectrum coverage
   when sensitivities available.
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent now but responding
   appropriately to commands. Patient was not at baseline mental status
   during any portion of his ICU stay before, although his MS improved as
   he improved clinically.
   - Follow mental status as his pna is treated and he is weaned from the
   ventilator
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Muddy brown casts on spun urine
   likely ATN.
   -          monitor creatinine daily
   -          Treat sepsis
   -          Support BP w/ fluid boluses as needed.
   .
   #Shock: Resolved, multifactorial sepsis and dehydration from poor PO
   intake.  Not on pressors any more.  Patient still febrile.  Cr still
   elevated likely ATN given muddy brown casts.
   - follow fever curve w/oral or rectal temps (not axillary)
   - IVF as needed
   - ABx as above
   - Monitor BP w/ A line.
   .
   # INR elevation: Improved
 1.4 today.  Likely nutritional given
   protracted ICU stay. One dose of vitamin K given for repletion.  FDP,
   fibrinogen normal. No bleeding noted.
   - follow coags
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: platelets slowly declining 255 -> 136 over
   48hours.  Hemodillution v HIT-ab associated.
   - d/c heparin sc
   - IJ -> picc (w/no heparin)
   - d/c heparin flushes
   - check HIT antibody
   .
   # UGI bleed: Resolved.  Small amount of coffee ground like secretions
   from NG tube. INR elevated, in setting of likely septic shock, concern
   for DIC.
   - PPI to PO and QD from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - fingersticks four times daily
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis:
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-21**])
   - follow blood cultures
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Tremor may be slightly worse but patient on max
   dose sinemet. Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for now.
   Re-address when patient otherwise more clinically well.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Starting tube feeds as per nutrition recs from prior admission.
   Repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, heparin SC TID
   .
   # ACCESS: R IJ CVL, right A line, PIV
   .
   # CODE: Full code, confirmed with wife. Consent for ICU in chart.
   .
   # COMM: With patient and family. Wife [**Name (NI) 625**] is HCP. Phone #
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2577**].
   .
   # DISP: ICU care for now.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and
   fever.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Likely second to aspiration pneumonia given
   clinical presentation and sputum Cx w/Klebsiella.  Intubated on vent.
   Satting well now w/ PO2 147. PO2/FiO2 >300 so likely not ARDS.  On PSV
   w/good ABG. Klebsiella resistant to all Abx tested except Amikacin
   [**Last Name (un) 350**]/carbapenem not tested yet (pending as per lab).
   - Follow culture sensitivities
   - Vanco/Meropenem empirically for now
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent now but responding
   appropriately to commands. Patient was not at baseline mental status
   during any portion of his ICU stay before, although his MS improved as
   he improved clinically.
   - Follow mental status as his pna is treated and he is weaned from the
   ventilator
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Muddy brown casts on spun urine
   likely ATN. Cr improving. Vanco dosing changed based on renal failure,
   high troughs.
   -          monitor creatinine daily
   -          Treat sepsis
   -          Support BP w/ fluid boluses as needed.
   .
   #Shock: Resolved, multifactorial sepsis and dehydration from poor PO
   intake.  Not on pressors any more.  Patient still febrile.  Cr still
   elevated likely ATN given muddy brown casts.
   - follow fever curve w/oral or rectal temps (not axillary)
   - IVF as needed
   - ABx as above
   - Monitor BP w/ A line.
   .
   # INR elevation: Improved
 1.4 today.  Likely nutritional given
   protracted ICU stay. One dose of vitamin K given for repletion.  FDP,
   fibrinogen normal. No bleeding noted.
   - follow coags
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: platelets slowly declining 255 -> 136 over
   48hours.  Hemodillution v HIT-ab associated.
   - d/c heparin sc
   - IJ -> picc (w/no heparin)
   - d/c heparin flushes
   - check HIT antibody
   .
   # UGI bleed: Resolved.  Small amount of coffee ground like secretions
   from NG tube. INR elevated, in setting of likely septic shock, concern
   for DIC.
   - PPI to PO and QD from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - fingersticks four times daily
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis:
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-21**])
   - follow blood cultures
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Tremor may be slightly worse but patient on max
   dose sinemet. Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for now.
   Re-address when patient otherwise more clinically well.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Starting tube feeds as per nutrition recs from prior admission.
   Repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, heparin SC TID

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is fever. The patient has been experiencing a high fever of 101.9°F. The sputum culture showed the presence of Klebsiella pneumonia, but the sensitivity to carbapenem is pending. The patient's platelet count is trending downwards, and a PF4 antibody test has been ordered. All heparin has been discontinued. The patient's PS (peak inspiratory pressure) and FIO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) have decreased. 

The patient has multiple allergies, including Tagamet (Oral), Ditropan (Oral), penicillins, lisinopril, and vancomycin. The patient is currently receiving midazolam (Versed) at a rate of 1 mg/hour, along with other ICU medications such as heparin sodium, fentanyl, and meropenem.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events mentioned. The vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.8°C (101.9°F), current temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 121/55 mmHg to 165/150 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated on a ventilator due to respiratory failure and fever. Sputum culture showed Klebsiella PNA, with carbapenem sensitivity pending. The patient also has a history of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, and chronic renal insufficiency.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
2. Altered mental status: The patient has been sedated and intubated but is responding appropriately to commands. Monitoring mental status as his pneumonia is treated and he is weaned from the ventilator is crucial.
3. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient has muddy brown casts on spun urine, likely indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Monitoring creatinine daily and treating sepsis are important.
4. Shock: The patient had resolved, multifactorial sepsis and dehydration from poor oral intake. Continued monitoring of blood pressure and fluid status is necessary.
5. INR elevation: The patient's INR has improved"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 24-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. She has a history of allergies to various medications, including penicillins, and is currently on multiple infusions and medications in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show an elevated temperature, stable blood pressure, and normal heart rate. She is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15,000 K/uL, elevated platelet count, and elevated lactate levels. Her renal function tests are within normal limits, but there is evidence of electrolyte imbalances such as hyponatremia (Na+: 32 mEq/L) and hyperkalemia (K+: 5.3 mEq/L).

The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 50 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 403, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. The respiratory system compliance and resistance indices are also within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities except for altered mental status, which is not delirium. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure and fever of unknown origin.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell"

   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and
   fever.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Likely second to aspiration pneumonia given
   clinical presentation and sputum Cx w/Klebsiella.  Intubated on vent.
   On PSV w/good ABG. Tolerating vent weaning well.  Klebsiella sensitive
   to meropenem.
   - continue vanc/meropenem
 vanco to 750mg QD starting at 8pm tonight.
   - re-check vanco trough after 3 doses (7pm on [**12-8**])
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent now but responding
   appropriately to commands. Patient was not at baseline mental status
   during any portion of his ICU stay before, although his MS improved as
   he improved clinically.
   - Follow mental status as his pna is treated and he is weaned from the
   ventilator
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Muddy brown casts on spun urine
   likely ATN. Cr improving. Vanco dosing changed based on renal failure,
   high troughs.
   -          monitor creatinine daily
   -          Treat sepsis
   -          Support BP w/ fluid boluses as needed.
   .
   #Shock: Resolved, multifactorial sepsis and dehydration from poor PO
   intake.  Not on pressors any more.  Patient still febrile.  Cr still
   elevated likely ATN given muddy brown casts.
   - follow fever curve w/oral or rectal temps (not axillary)
   - IVF as needed
   - ABx as above
   - Monitor BP w/ A line.
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: platelets slowly declined 255 -> 136 over 48hours,
   now stable.  Hemodillution v HIT-ab associated.
   Heparin sc d/c. Saline flushes only.
   - HIT antibody pending
   .
   # INR elevation: Improved
 1.3 today.  Likely nutritional given
   protracted ICU stay. One dose of vitamin K given initially for
   repletion in setting of ?UGI bleed.  FDP, fibrinogen normal. No
   bleeding noted.
   - follow coags
   .
   # UGI bleed: Resolved.  Small amount of coffee ground like secretions
   from NG tube. INR elevated, in setting of likely septic shock, concern
   for DIC.
   - PPI to PO and QD from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - fingersticks four times daily
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis:
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-21**])
   - follow blood cultures
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Tremor worse since this admission.  Continue
   carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for now.  Checked dose in MICU v dose
   at home and was started on lower dose in MICU (oversight)
 to increase
   dose Carbodopa/levodopa to home dose today.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Starting tube feeds as per nutrition recs from prior admission.
   Repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, heparin SC TID
   .
   # ACCESS: R IJ CVL, right A line, PIV
   .
   # CODE: Full code, confirmed with wife. Consent for ICU in chart.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of recent subdural hematoma, strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and altered mental status. He was admitted to the MICU for pneumonia and is now experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with good arterial blood gas (ABG) results. His sputum culture revealed Klebsiella pneumonia, which is sensitive to meropenem. The patient is currently receiving meropenem and vancomycin therapy.

The patient's mental status has improved as his clinical condition improves. His acute on chronic renal insufficiency is being monitored, and muddy brown casts indicate acute tubular necrosis (ATN). His creatinine levels are improving, and vancomycin dosing has been adjusted based on renal failure.

The patient had resolved shock due to multifactorial sepsis and dehydration. He is no longer on pressors but remains febrile. His platelet count has declined from 255 to 136 over 48 hours but is currently stable. Heparin subcutaneous administration has been discontinued.

The patient's elevated INR is likely due to malnutrition from his prolonged ICU stay. One dose of vitamin K was given initially, and coagulation will continue to be monitored.

The patient had a resolved upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed with coffee ground-like secretions from the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has a fever with an unknown origin, and there are concerns about potential electrolyte and fluid disorders. The patient has been diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumonia, and sensitivity testing for carbapenem is pending. There are also signs of possible complications such as a small umbilical hernia and a systolic murmur. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.9°F, blood pressure within normal range, heart rate within normal range, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever with an unknown origin, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Klebsiella pneumonia has already been identified, and the sensitivity testing for carbapenem is pending. The patient may be at risk for developing other infections due to the prolonged use of invasive lines and tubes.
2. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's vital signs show a high maximum temperature, and the laboratory results indicate abnormal electrolyte levels (elevated potassium and"

","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of strep bovis endocarditis, enterococcal bacteremia, and Acinetobacter pneumonia who was readmitted from rehab with aspiration pneumonia and sepsis. He is currently in the ICU and is critically ill.

The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and sepsis. He has been febrile with sputum showing ESBL Klebsiella that is sensitive to meropenem. He has a known allergy to penicillins, which may limit the antibiotic options available.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 148/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient is on several medications, including midazolam (Versed) infusion, fentanyl, levoxyl, lipitor, ASA, sinemet, ropinirole, MVI, calcitriol, and prevacide.

The patient's flow sheet data shows that he has received a significant amount of fluids and blood products over the past 24 hours. His respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 30%."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and
   fever.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Sputum culture growing Klebsiella, sensitive to
   meropenem.  Currently on CPAP/PS tolerating well on 10 PEEP.  Will
   continue to treat PNA, and aggressive chest PT given thick secretions.
   - continue vanc/meropenem
 vanco to 750mg IV q24
   - re-check vanco trough tomorrow night
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   Will vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated.
   - Follow mental status as his pna is treated and he is weaned from the
   ventilator
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Muddy brown casts on spun urine
   likely ATN. Cr improving. Vanco dosing changed based on renal failure,
   high troughs.
   -          monitor creatinine
   -          Renally dose medications
   .
   #Shock: Still has some low grade temperatures but is otherwise
   hemodynamically stable.  Actively treating Klebsiella PNA. Yeast on
   urine culture yesterday, foley was replaced.
   - follow fever curve
   - IVF as needed
   - ABx as above
   - RIJ, Aline in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Today platelets slowly recovering. Will send
   off serotonin release assay for confirmation.
   -serotonin release assay f/u
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.4, slightly increased from yesterday.  Likely
   nutritional in nature. Not actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin
   K and follow coags.
   - follow coags
   .
   # UGI bleed: Resolved.  No bloody output from NG today. Monitoring
   coags. On PPI.
   - PPI qd
   .
   # Type 2 DM: slightly elevated FS over last night, will place on
   standing NPH along with SSI.
   - NPH 3U am and pm
   - fingersticks four times daily
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-21**])
   - follow blood cultures
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for
   now.  Dose adjusted yesterday, will continue to monitor for tremor
   improvement.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and
   fever.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Likely second to aspiration pneumonia given
   clinical presentation and sputum Cx w/Klebsiella.  Intubated on vent.
   On PSV w/good ABG. Tolerating vent weaning well.  Klebsiella sensitive
   to meropenem.
   - continue vanc/meropenem
 vanco to 750mg QD starting at 8pm tonight.
   - re-check vanco trough after 3 doses (7pm on [**12-8**])
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent now but responding
   appropriately to commands. Patient was not at baseline mental status
   during any portion of his ICU stay before, although his MS improved as
   he improved clinically.
   - Follow mental status as his pna is treated and he is weaned from the
   ventilator
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Muddy brown casts on spun urine
   likely ATN. Cr improving. Vanco dosing changed based on renal failure,
   high troughs.
   -          monitor creatinine daily
   -          Treat sepsis
   -          Support BP w/ fluid boluses as needed.
   .
   #Shock: Resolved, multifactorial sepsis and dehydration from poor PO
   intake.  Not on pressors any more.  Patient still febrile.  Cr still
   elevated likely ATN given muddy brown casts.
   - follow fever curve w/oral or rectal temps (not axillary)
   - IVF as needed
   - ABx as above
   - Monitor BP w/ A line.
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: platelets slowly declined 255 -> 136 over 48hours,
   now stable.  Hemodillution v HIT-ab associated.
   Heparin sc d/c. Saline flushes only.
   - HIT antibody pending
   .
   # INR elevation: Improved
 1.3 today.  Likely nutritional given
   protracted ICU stay. One dose of vitamin K given initially for
   repletion in setting of ?UGI bleed.  FDP, fibrinogen normal. No
   bleeding noted.
   - follow coags
   .
   # UGI bleed: Resolved.  Small amount of coffee ground like secretions
   from NG tube. INR elevated, in setting of likely septic shock, concern
   for DIC.
   - PPI to PO and QD from [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Type 2 DM:
   - fingersticks four times daily
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis:
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-21**])
   - follow blood cultures
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Tremor worse since this admission.  Continue
   carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for now.  Checked dose in MICU v dose
   at home and was started on lower dose in MICU (oversight)
 to increase

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia. He is now experiencing respiratory failure and fever. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and good arterial blood gas (ABG) results. He is tolerating weaning from the ventilator well.

The patient's mental status has been altered during his ICU stay, but he is responding appropriately to commands. His mental status is expected to improve as his pneumonia is treated and he is weaned from the ventilator.

The patient has acute on chronic renal insufficiency, as indicated by muddy brown casts on spun urine, likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN). His creatinine levels are improving, and vancomycin dosing has been adjusted based on renal failure and high troughs. Daily monitoring of creatinine is recommended, along with treating sepsis, supporting blood pressure with fluid boluses as needed, and following the fever curve with oral or rectal temperatures.

The patient had shock, which has resolved due to multifactorial sepsis and dehydration from poor oral intake. He is no longer on pressors but remains febrile. His creatinine is still elevated, likely due to ATN given the presence of muddy brown casts. IV fluids as needed, antibiotics"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has Parkinson's disease and is experiencing altered mental status, fever of unknown origin, respiratory failure, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and receives continuous midazolam and intermittent fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management.

The patient's vital signs indicate a slightly elevated temperature, normal heart rate, low blood pressure, and within normal range respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation is at 94%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of 3,575 mL total intake and 3,280 mL total output with a net fluid deficit of 295 mL. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antiparkinsonian agents, and others for blood pressure control.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels, including low calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. The coagulation profile indicates a prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time with a normal INR. Other lab results reveal elevated D-dimer levels, normal fibrinogen levels, and normal lactic acid levels.

The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.49, PaCO2 of 43 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 283."

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/66 to 150/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of fever. The physical examination reveals normal findings in the eyes, head, ears, nose, throat, cardiovascular system, and abdomen. However, the respiratory system shows rhonchorous breath sounds with more prominence on the right side. The extremities show decreased pulses on both sides, and the neurologic examination is not fully assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, potassium, magnesium, and blood urea nitrogen levels. The creatinine level is improving. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.49, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 43 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 85 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics (vancomycin and mer"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and
   fever.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Sputum culture growing Klebsiella, sensitive to
   meropenem.  Currently on CPAP/PS tolerating well on 10 PEEP.  Will
   continue to treat PNA, and aggressive chest PT given thick secretions.
   - continue vanc/meropenem
 vanco to 750mg IV q24
   - re-check vanco trough tomorrow night
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   Will vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated.
   - Follow mental status as his pna is treated and he is weaned from the
   ventilator
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Muddy brown casts on spun urine
   likely ATN. Cr improving. Vanco dosing changed based on renal failure,
   high troughs.
   -          monitor creatinine
   -          Renally dose medications
   .
   #Shock: Still has some low grade temperatures but is otherwise
   hemodynamically stable.  Actively treating Klebsiella PNA. Yeast on
   urine culture yesterday, foley was replaced.
   - follow fever curve
   - IVF as needed
   - ABx as above
   - RIJ, Aline in place
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Today platelets slowly recovering. Will send
   off serotonin release assay for confirmation.
   -serotonin release assay f/u
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.4, slightly increased from yesterday.  Likely
   nutritional in nature. Not actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin
   K and follow coags.
   - follow coags
   .
   # UGI bleed: Resolved.  No bloody output from NG today. Monitoring
   coags. On PPI.
   - PPI qd
   .
   # Type 2 DM: slightly elevated FS over last night, will place on
   standing NPH along with SSI.
   - NPH 3U am and pm
   - fingersticks four times daily
   - sliding scale insulin
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-21**])
   - follow blood cultures

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a recent subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and fever. The patient has multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, shock, thrombocytopenia, INR elevation, UGI bleed, type 2 diabetes mellitus, MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, and recent Foley catheter insertion. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation, sedated, and intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia. The sputum culture has grown Klebsiella, which is sensitive to meropenem. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV and will continue to treat pneumonia and perform aggressive chest physiotherapy. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which has improved slightly but is difficult to assess while on sedation. The patient will be weaned off sedation and ventilation as tolerated. The mental status should be followed as the pneumonia is treated and the patient is weaned from the ventilator.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Ins"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and
   fever.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Sputum culture growing Klebsiella, sensitive to
   meropenem.  Tolerating CPAP/PS well on 5 PEEP for long periods.  Will
   continue to treat PNA, and aggressive chest PT given thick secretions.
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**], vanco 750mg IV
   q24 through [**12-16**]
   - re-check vanco trough tonight prior to 4^th 750mg dose
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   -Given multiple failed extubations in past likely will need tach for
   extended weaning and suction ability. Mentioned to family [**12-6**] will
   discuss further today. If family agrees call IP.
   -Appears volume overloaded, give 40mg IV lasix today. With goal of 1L
   negative
   -check pm lytes
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   Will vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated.
   - Follow mental status as his pna is treated and he is weaned from the
   ventilator
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Muddy brown casts on spun urine
   likely ATN. Cr improving. Vanco dosing changed based on renal failure,
   high troughs.
   - monitor creatinine, UOP
   - Renally dose medications
   - diuresis as above.
   .
   # Cards: Decreased ectopy after started metoprolol
   - Increased metoprolol to 25 TID
   .
   #Shock: Still has some low grade temperatures but is otherwise
   hemodynamically stable.  Actively treating Klebsiella PNA. Yeast on
   urine culture [**12-4**], foley was replaced.
   - follow fever curve, steadly decreasing
   - IVF as needed
   - ABx as above
   - RIJ, Aline in place
   - Awaiting PICC placement but will not give until afebrile
   .
   #Metabolic alkalosis: Likely [**2-6**] diuresis and insensible losses,
   continue to monitor.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Today platelets slowly recovering. -Pending
   serotonin release assay for confirmation.
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.4 stable.  Likely nutritional in nature. Not
   actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin K and follow coags.
   - follow coags
   .
   # UGI bleed: Resolved.  No bloody output from NG today. Monitoring
   coags. On PPI.
   - PPI qd
   .
   # Type 2 DM: FS still elevated dispite NPH and ISS
   - changed to 15 glargine and ISS increased
   - fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-16**])
   - follow blood cultures
   - trough goal 15-20 per ID
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for
   now.  Dose adjusted yesterday, will continue to monitor for tremor
   improvement.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Starting tube feeds as per nutrition recs from prior admission.
   Repleting electrolytes as needed. Multivitamin
   .
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, pneumoboots
   .
   # ACCESS: R IJ CVL, right A line, PIV
   - PICC when afebrile
   .
   # CODE: Full code, confirmed with wife. Consent for ICU in chart.
   .
   # COMM: With patient and family. Wife [**Name (NI) 625**] is HCP. Phone #
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2577**].

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

The patient should continue to be treated for pneumonia and aggressive chest physiotherapy should be given due to thick secretions.

2. Altered mental status: The patient is sedated and intubated, making it difficult to assess the improvement in mental status. As the pneumonia is treated and the patient is weaned from the ventilator, it would be important to monitor the mental status.

3. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient has muddy brown casts on spun urine, indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The creatinine level is improving, and vancomycin dosing has been adjusted based on renal failure. It is important to monitor creatinine, urine output, and adjust medications accordingly.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and
   fever.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Sputum culture growing Klebsiella, sensitive to
   meropenem.  Tolerating CPAP/PS well on 5 PEEP for long periods.  Will
   continue to treat PNA, and aggressive chest PT given thick secretions.
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**], vanco 750mg IV
   q24 through [**12-16**]
   - re-check vanco trough tonight prior to 4^th 750mg dose
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   -Given multiple failed extubations in past likely will need tach for
   extended weaning and suction ability. Mentioned to family [**12-6**] will
   discuss further today. If family agrees call IP.
   -Appears volume overloaded, give 40mg IV lasix today. With goal of 1L
   negative
   -check pm lytes
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   Will vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated.
   - Follow mental status as his pna is treated and he is weaned from the
   ventilator
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Muddy brown casts on spun urine
   likely ATN. Cr improving. Vanco dosing changed based on renal failure,
   high troughs.
   - monitor creatinine, UOP
   - Renally dose medications
   - diuresis as above.
   .
   #Shock: Still has some low grade temperatures but is otherwise
   hemodynamically stable.  Actively treating Klebsiella PNA. Yeast on
   urine culture [**12-4**], foley was replaced.
   - follow fever curve, steadly decreasing
   - IVF as needed
   - ABx as above
   - RIJ, Aline in place
   - Awaiting PICC placement but will not give until afebrile
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Today platelets slowly recovering. -Pending
   serotonin release assay for confirmation.
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.4 stable.  Likely nutritional in nature. Not
   actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin K and follow coags.
   - follow coags
   .
   # UGI bleed: Resolved.  No bloody output from NG today. Monitoring
   coags. On PPI.
   - PPI qd
   .
   # Type 2 DM: FS still
   - NPH 3U am and pm
   - fingersticks four times daily
   - sliding scale insulin

   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-21**])
   - follow blood cultures
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for
   now.  Dose adjusted yesterday, will continue to monitor for tremor
   improvement.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. He has a history of recent subdural hematoma, strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, and has been diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumonia. He is tolerating CPAP/PSV well on 5 cmH2O PEEP and will continue to treat pneumonia with meropenem. The patient appears to be volume overloaded, so Lasix will be given to remove excess fluid. Mental status improvement is expected as he is weaned from the ventilator. Renal function is being closely monitored, and medications are being dosed accordingly. The patient has shown signs of shock, but is now hemodynamically stable. A Foley catheter has been replaced, and a PICC line will be placed once the patient is afebrile. The patient has tested positive for HIT antibodies, which have been confirmed through a serotonin release assay. Other medical conditions include type 2 diabetes, MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, and acute kidney injury."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and
   fever.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Sputum culture growing Klebsiella, sensitive to
   meropenem.  Tolerating CPAP/PS well on 5 PEEP for long periods.  Will
   continue to treat PNA, and aggressive chest PT given thick secretions.
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**], vanco 750mg IV
   q24 through [**12-16**]
   - re-check vanco trough tonight prior to 4^th 750mg dose
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   -Given multiple failed extubations in past likely will need tach for
   extended weaning and suction ability. Mentioned to family [**12-6**] will
   discuss further today. If family agrees call IP.
   -Appears volume overloaded, give 40mg IV lasix today. With goal of 1L
   negative
   -check pm lytes
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   Will vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated.
   - Follow mental status as his pna is treated and he is weaned from the
   ventilator
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Muddy brown casts on spun urine
   likely ATN. Cr improving. Vanco dosing changed based on renal failure,
   high troughs.
   - monitor creatinine, UOP
   - Renally dose medications
   - diuresis as above.
   .
   # Cards: Decreased ectopy after started metoprolol
   - Increased metoprolol to 25 TID
   .
   #Shock: Still has some low grade temperatures but is otherwise
   hemodynamically stable.  Actively treating Klebsiella PNA. Yeast on
   urine culture [**12-4**], foley was replaced.
   - follow fever curve, steadly decreasing
   - IVF as needed
   - ABx as above
   - RIJ, Aline in place
   - Awaiting PICC placement but will not give until afebrile
   .
   #Metabolic alkalosis: Likely [**2-6**] diuresis and insensible losses,
   continue to monitor.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Today platelets slowly recovering. -Pending
   serotonin release assay for confirmation.
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.4 stable.  Likely nutritional in nature. Not
   actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin K and follow coags.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of recent subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia. He is currently in respiratory failure and has a fever. The patient has been treated with meropenem for pneumonia, vancomycin for MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis, and lasix for volume overload. He is sedated and intubated, but his mental status has improved slightly. The patient also has acute on chronic renal insufficiency, muddy brown casts on urine indicating ATN, and an elevated creatinine level. His cardiac condition is improving after starting metoprolol. The patient is still at risk for shock, metabolic alkalosis, thrombocytopenia (HIT), elevated INR, UGI bleed, Type 2 DM, Parkinson's disease, and hypothyroidism. He is starting tube feeds and receiving multivitamins. The patient has multiple lines including R IJ CVL, right A line, PIV, and will have a PICC placement when afebrile.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease, respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status, and fever of unknown origin. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates a potential risk for inadequate organ perfusion and possible organ damage. It is crucial to address this issue promptly and monitor the patient closely.
2. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels (e.g., low sodium, potassium, and magnesium) and fluid balance suggest a potential risk for cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other systemic complications. Close monitoring and correction of these imbalances are necessary.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to various factors, including medication side effects, infection, or inadequate oxygenation. Continuous neurologic monitoring and assessment are needed to ensure the patient's well-being.
4. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient's persistent fever indicates an underlying infection or inflammatory process. Further investigations are required to identify the source of infection and initiate appropriate treatment.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure, although previously noted, should still be closely monitored for any deterioration in oxygenation or ventilation parameters. Adequate oxygen delivery and weaning from mechanical ventilation should be considered when clinically appropriate"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and
   fever.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Sputum culture growing Klebsiella, sensitive to
   meropenem.  Tolerating CPAP/PS well on 5 PEEP for long periods.  Fever
   is resolved now and secretions have decreased.  Will continue to treat
   PNA, and aggressive chest PT given thick secretions.  Given multiple
   failed extubations in past complicated w/aspiration and inability to
   clear secretions with cough likely will need tacheostomy for extended
   weaning and suction ability. Mentioned to family [**12-6**] will discuss
   further today. If family agrees will call thoracic surgery to place
   tracheostomy and likely peg at same time. Vanco trough 18.4.
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**], vanco 750mg IV
   q24 through [**12-16**]
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   With vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated
   and follow mental status.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Muddy brown casts on spun urine

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with recent subdural hematoma, streptococcus bovis bacteremia, MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU for altered mental status and respiratory failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV and has tolerated it well with 5 cmH2O PEEP. His fever has resolved, and secretions have decreased. There is a sputum culture growing Klebsiella, which is sensitive to meropenem. The patient will continue to be treated for pneumonia and may require a tracheostomy for extended weaning and suction ability.

The patient's altered mental status has slightly improved but is difficult to assess while on sedation. Sedation will be gradually reduced as tolerated and mental status will be monitored. The patient also has acute on chronic renal insufficiency, with muddy brown casts on spun urine likely indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Creatinine levels are improving, and vancomycin dosing has been adjusted based on renal failure.

The patient experienced hypotension after the third dose of metoprolol and had been diuresed the previous day. Hypotension improved with 1.25 L normal saline. Metoprolol has been decreased to 12.5 TID, diuresis has been held, and IV fluids will be given as needed.

   defervesced.  Because of recurrent aspiration, believe that
   tracheostomy his
   his best chance for starting his rehabilitation and preventing
   recurrent aspiration PNAs.
   Can try and decrease Peep.
   MRSA/enterococcus endocarditis:  On vanco until [**12-16**].
   Fluid overload:  can try and start diuresis again later if BP remains
   stable.
   ectopy:  continue lopressor tid at lower dose.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with aspiration pneumonia who is currently in the ICU. The patient has experienced several medical complications during his stay. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia caused by ESBL Klebsiella. He has defervesced, indicating a decrease in fever, but still requires mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy is recommended to facilitate rehabilitation and prevent recurrent aspiration pneumonia.

2. MRSA/Enterococcus Endocarditis: The patient is being treated with vancomycin until December 16th. This suggests that he has an infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and/or enterococcus bacteria.

3. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload, as indicated by his fluid balance data showing an intake of 4,399 mL and output of only 3,655 mL over 24 hours. Diuretics may be considered to manage this condition, but the patient's blood pressure needs to remain stable.

4. Ectopy: The patient has experienced ectopy, which is an irregular heart rhythm. Lopressor, a medication used to control heart rate, is being continued at a lower dose.

5. Other findings: The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels. His potassium and sodium levels are within normal range. The patient also has elevated liver enzymes (AST"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and
   fever.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Sputum culture growing Klebsiella, sensitive to
   meropenem.  Tolerating CPAP/PS well on 5 PEEP for long periods.  Fever
   is resolved now and secretions have decreased.  Will continue to treat
   PNA, and aggressive chest PT given thick secretions.  Given multiple
   failed extubations in past complicated w/aspiration and inability to
   clear secretions with cough likely will need tacheostomy for extended
   weaning and suction ability. Mentioned to family [**12-6**] will discuss
   further today. If family agrees will call thoracic surgery to place
   tracheostomy and likely peg at same time. Vanco trough 18.4.
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**], vanco 750mg IV
   q24 through [**12-16**]
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   With vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated
   and follow mental status.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Muddy brown casts on spun urine
   likely ATN. Cr improving. Vanco dosing changed based on renal failure,
   high troughs.
   - monitor creatinine, UOP
   - renally dose medications
   - diuresis held because
   .
   #Hypotension: BP down to 70
s systolic after third dose of Metoprolol
   25mg given. Patient had also been diuresed yesterday which likely
   contributed to hypotension. Improved with 1.25 L NS. Was afebrile.
   -          decrease Metoprolol to 12.5 TID
   -          hold diuresis
   -          IVF prn
   .
   # Ectopy: Decreased ectopy after started metoprolol but BP dropped
   severely after Metoprolol increased to TID, so will
   - Increased metoprolol to 25 TID
   .
   #Shock: Fever has resolved. One episode of hypotension but unlikely due
   to sepsis. Now hemodynamically stable.  Actively treating Klebsiella
   PNA. Yeast on urine culture [**12-4**], foley was replaced.
   - follow fever curve
   - IVF as needed
   - ABx as above
   - RIJ, Aline in place
   - PICC placement today?
   .
   #Metabolic alkalosis: Likely [**2-6**] diuresis, insensible loss, and likely
   a relative metabolic alkalosis because of compensation for chronic CO2
   retention and over-ventillation on vent. Improved on repeat ABG.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Today platelets slowly recovering. -Pending
   serotonin release assay for confirmation.
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.4 stable.  Likely nutritional in nature. Not
   actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin K and follow coags.
   - follow coags
   .
   # UGI bleed: Resolved.  No bloody output from NG today. Monitoring
   coags. On PPI.
   - PPI qd
   .
   # Type 2 DM: FS still elevated dispite NPH and ISS
   - changed to 15 glargine and ISS increased
   - fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-16**])
   - follow blood cultures
   - trough goal 15-20 per ID
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for
   now.  Dose adjusted yesterday, will continue to monitor for tremor
   improvement.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Starting tube feeds as per nutrition recs from prior admission.
   Repleting electrolytes as needed. Multivitamin
   .
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, pneumoboots, start fondoperinox.
   .
   # ACCESS: R IJ CVL, right A line, PIV
   - PICC today?
   .
   # CODE: Full code, confirmed with wife. Consent for ICU in chart.
   .
   # COMM: With patient and family. Wife [**Name (NI) 625**] is HCP. Phone #
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2577**].

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of Parkinson's disease, hypertension, and an altered mental status. He has been receiving treatment for respiratory failure, fever, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and hypotension. The patient has allergies to certain medications and is on multiple IV infusions. His vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/55 mmHg to 155/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's temperature is within normal range. He has a history of respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. Lab results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, glucose levels, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient has a code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and dependence on mechanical ventilation puts him at risk for further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has imbalances in various electrolytes, including potassium, sodium, and phosphorus. This can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other systemic disturbances.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. This increases the risk of seps"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and
   fever.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Sputum culture growing Klebsiella, sensitive to
   meropenem.  Tolerating CPAP/PS well on 5 PEEP for long periods.  Fever
   is resolved now and secretions have decreased.  Will continue to treat
   PNA, and aggressive chest PT given thick secretions.  Given multiple
   failed extubations in past complicated w/aspiration and inability to
   clear secretions with cough will need tacheostomy for extended weaning
   and suction ability. Evaluated by thoracics last night, to OR today for
   trach/peg.
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**], vanco 750mg IV
   q24 through [**12-16**]
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   - evaluate fluid status post-op and diurese as is appropriate
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   With vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated
   and follow mental status.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Muddy brown casts on spun urine
   likely ATN. Cr improving. Vanco dosing changed based on renal failure,
   high troughs.
   - monitor creatinine, UOP
   - renally dose medications
   - diuresis held because of Hx of hypotension/renal failure
   .
   #Hypotension: BP down to 70
s systolic 2 days ago after third dose of
   Metoprolol 25mg given. Patient had also been diuresed which likely
   contributed to hypotension. Improved with 1.25 L NS. Was afebrile.  BP
   has been stable since.
   -          Metoprolol low dose 12.5 TID
   -          hold diuresis
   -          IVF prn
   .
   # Ectopy: Decreased ectopy after started metoprolol but BP dropped
   severely after Metoprolol increased to TID, so will keep low dose for
   now.
   .
   #Shock: Fever has resolved. One episode of hypotension but unlikely due
   to sepsis. Now hemodynamically stable.  Actively treating Klebsiella
   PNA. Yeast on urine culture [**12-4**], foley was replaced.
   - follow fever curve
   - IVF as needed
   - ABx as above
   - Aline, picc in place
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-16**])
   - follow blood cultures
   - trough goal 15-20 per ID
   .
   #Metabolic alkalosis: Likely [**2-6**] diuresis, insensible loss, and likely
   a relative metabolic alkalosis because of compensation for chronic CO2
   retention and over-ventillation on vent. Improved on repeat ABG.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Today platelets slowly recovering. Serotonin
   release assay negative but was done 2 days after heparin d/c. Will call
   hematology today to discuss significance/whether patient should or
   should not carry a Dx of HIT.
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.4 stable.  Likely nutritional in nature. Not
   actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin K and follow coags.
   - follow coags
   .
   # UGI bleed: Resolved.  No further bloody output from NG since
   admission.  Likely from oropharyngeal bleeding from difficult
   intubation.  Monitoring coags. On PPI.
   - PPI qd
   .
   # Type 2 DM: FS stabilized with 15 glargine and increased ISS
   - fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for
   now.  Dose adjusted yesterday, will continue to monitor for tremor
   improvement.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Starting tube feeds as per nutrition recs from prior admission.
   Repleting electrolytes as needed. Multivitamin
   .
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, pneumoboots, start fondoperinox.
   .
   # ACCESS: Picc. right A line, PIV
   .
   # CODE: Full code, confirmed with wife. Consent for ICU in chart.
   .
   # COMM: With patient and family. Wife [**Name (NI) 625**] is HCP. Phone #

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with persistent ventilatory failure, likely aspiration-related pneumonia, and plans for a tracheostomy. He has had reasonable stability of hemodynamics but remains with continued poor mental status, persistent secretions, and concern for recurrent respiratory failure. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1) Respiratory Failure due to Klebsiella Pneumonia:
   - The patient has persistent ventilatory failure, which can lead to further respiratory distress.
   - The planned tracheostomy may help improve ventilation and reduce secretions.

2) Thrombocytopenia:
   - The patient has a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
   - A serotonin release assay is negative, suggesting that heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is unlikely.
   - It is important to discuss with the hematology team to determine the cause of the platelet drop and decide on appropriate management.

3) Sepsis/Endocarditis:
   - The patient is receiving continued treatment with vancomycin, likely due to concern for endocarditis.
   - Antibiotics should be continued until [12-16] to ensure adequate treatment.

Other active issues to be managed include Parkinson's disease, electrolyte and fluid disorder, altered mental status (not delirium), fever of unknown origin, nutrition through tube feeds, glycemic control using regular insulin sliding scale, arterial and PICC line management"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure and fever,
   now s/p trach and PEG placement.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Secondary to Klebsiella PNA, sensitive to
   meropenem.  Trach placed yesterday w/o complications, today tolerating
   CPAP/PS well on 5 PEEP.  He continues to have bloody secretions in vent
   tube but they have decreased in quantity.  Will continue to treat PNA,
   and aggressive chest PT given secretions.
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**]
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   With vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated
   and follow mental status.
   -off drip and monitor the requirement for prn boluses, if less than q3
   can d/c drip
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: ATN in setting of sepsis.
   Creatinine continues to improve as well as fluid status.
   - monitor creatinine, UOP
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #Hypotension: One episode of SBP to 70
s systolic 2 days ago after
   third dose of Metoprolol, was responsive to fluid bolus. BP has been
   stable since then.
   -          Metoprolol low dose 12.5 TID
   .
   # Ectopy: Decreased ectopy after started metoprolol but BP dropped
   severely after Metoprolol increased to TID, so will keep low dose for
   now.
   .
   #Shock: Fever has resolved. One episode of hypotension but unlikely due
   to sepsis (as above). Now hemodynamically stable.  Actively treating
   Klebsiella PNA.
   - follow fever curve
   - IVF as needed
   - ABx as above
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vanco 750mg IV q24 through [**12-16**]
   - follow blood cultures
   - trough goal 15-20 per ID
   .
   #Metabolic alkalosis: Likely [**2-6**] diuresis, insensible loss, and likely
   a relative metabolic alkalosis because of compensation for chronic CO2
   retention and over-ventillation on vent. Improved on repeat ABG.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Today platelets slowly recovering. Serotonin
   release assay negative but was done 2 days after heparin d/c. Will call
   hematology today to discuss significance/whether patient should or
   should not carry a Dx of HIT.
   -heme consult recs
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.4 stable.  Likely nutritional in nature. Not
   actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin K and follow coags.
   - follow coags
   .
   # UGI bleed: Resolved.  No further bloody output from NG since
   admission.  Likely from oropharyngeal bleeding from difficult
   intubation.  Monitoring coags. On PPI.
   - PPI qd
   .
   # Type 2 DM: FS stabilized with 15 glargine and increased ISS
   - fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for
   now.  Dose adjusted yesterday, will continue to monitor for tremor
   improvement.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Starting tube feeds once ok
d by IP (post-PEG). Repleting
   electrolytes as needed. Multivitamin
   .
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, pneumoboots.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure or development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is sedated on vent with sedation, and it is difficult to assess his mental status. Weaning off sedation will be necessary, and there is a risk of persistent altered mental status or delirium.
3. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient has a history of renal insufficiency and is currently experiencing acute kidney injury likely due to sepsis. Close monitoring of creatinine and urine output is required, along with adjustment of medications accordingly.
4. Hypotension: The patient had an episode of hypotension with a systolic blood pressure of 70 after receiving metoprolol. This could indicate septic shock or a reaction to the medication. Ongoing monitoring and appropriate fluid management are essential.
5. Ectopy: The patient had decreased ectopy after starting metoprolol, but a severe drop in blood pressure occurred when the dose was increased. It is"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia now with respiratory failure and
   fever.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Sputum culture growing Klebsiella, sensitive to
   meropenem.  Tolerating CPAP/PS well on 5 PEEP for long periods.  Fever
   is resolved now and secretions have decreased.  Will continue to treat
   PNA, and aggressive chest PT given thick secretions.  Given multiple
   failed extubations in past complicated w/aspiration and inability to
   clear secretions with cough will need tacheostomy for extended weaning
   and suction ability. Evaluated by thoracics last night, to OR today for
   trach/peg.
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**], vanco 750mg IV
   q24 through [**12-16**]
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   - evaluate fluid status post-op and diurese as is appropriate
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   With vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated
   and follow mental status.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Muddy brown casts on spun urine
   likely ATN. Cr improving. Vanco dosing changed based on renal failure,
   high troughs.
   - monitor creatinine, UOP
   - renally dose medications
   - diuresis held because of Hx of hypotension/renal failure
   .
   #Hypotension: BP down to 70
s systolic 2 days ago after third dose of
   Metoprolol 25mg given. Patient had also been diuresed which likely
   contributed to hypotension. Improved with 1.25 L NS. Was afebrile.  BP
   has been stable since.
   -          Metoprolol low dose 12.5 TID
   -          hold diuresis
   -          IVF prn
   .
   # Ectopy: Decreased ectopy after started metoprolol but BP dropped
   severely after Metoprolol increased to TID, so will keep low dose for
   now.
   .
   #Shock: Fever has resolved. One episode of hypotension but unlikely due
   to sepsis. Now hemodynamically stable.  Actively treating Klebsiella
   PNA. Yeast on urine culture [**12-4**], foley was replaced.
   - follow fever curve
   - IVF as needed
   - ABx as above
   - Aline, picc in place
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vancomycin (Planned course until [**12-16**])
   - follow blood cultures
   - trough goal 15-20 per ID
   .
   #Metabolic alkalosis: Likely [**2-6**] diuresis, insensible loss, and likely
   a relative metabolic alkalosis because of compensation for chronic CO2
   retention and over-ventillation on vent. Improved on repeat ABG.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Today platelets slowly recovering. Serotonin
   release assay negative but was done 2 days after heparin d/c. Will call
   hematology today to discuss significance/whether patient should or
   should not carry a Dx of HIT.
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.4 stable.  Likely nutritional in nature. Not
   actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin K and follow coags.
   - follow coags

   # UGI bleed: Resolved.  No further bloody output from NG since
   admission.  Likely from oropharyngeal bleeding from difficult
   intubation.  Monitoring coags. On PPI.
   - PPI qd

   # Type 2 DM: FS stabilized with 15 glargine and increased ISS
   - fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for
   now.  Dose adjusted yesterday, will continue to monitor for tremor
   improvement.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Starting tube feeds as per nutrition recs from prior admission.
   Repleting electrolytes as needed. Multivitamin

The patient now has respiratory failure and fever. The patient tolerates CPAP/PSV well on 5 PEEP for long periods. The fever has resolved now and secretions have decreased. The patient will continue to treat PNA and aggressive chest PT given thick secretions. Given multiple failed extubations in the past complicated with aspiration and inability to clear secretions with cough, the patient needs tracheostomy for extended weaning and suction ability. 

The patient's altered mental status has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation. With vent weaning, the patient will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated and follow mental status. 

The patient has acute on chronic renal insufficiency, with muddy brown casts on spun urine likely ATN. Creatinine is improving. Vancomycin dosing was changed based on renal failure, high troughs. 

The patient's blood pressure dropped severely after metoprolol was increased, so it will be kept low dose for now. 

The patient had a recent episode of hypotension but unlikely due to sepsis. Now hemodynamically stable. Actively treating Klebsiella PNA. Yeast on urine culture, foley was replaced.

The patient continues on vancomycin and"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure and fever,
   now s/p trach and PEG placement.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Secondary to Klebsiella PNA, sensitive to
   meropenem.  Trach placed yesterday w/o complications, today tolerating
   CPAP/PS well on 5 PEEP.  He continues to have bloody secretions in vent
   tube but they have decreased in quantity.  Will continue to treat PNA,
   and aggressive chest PT given secretions.
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**]
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   With vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated
   and follow mental status.
   -off drip and monitor the requirement for prn boluses, if less than q3
   can d/c drip
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: ATN in setting of sepsis.
   Creatinine continues to improve as well as fluid status.
   - monitor creatinine, UOP
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #Hypotension: One episode of SBP to 70
s systolic 2 days ago after
   third dose of Metoprolol, was responsive to fluid bolus. BP has been
   stable since then.
   -          Metoprolol low dose 12.5 TID
   .
   # Ectopy: Decreased ectopy after started metoprolol but BP dropped
   severely after Metoprolol increased to TID, so will keep low dose for
   now.
   .
   #Shock: Fever has resolved. One episode of hypotension but unlikely due
   to sepsis (as above). Now hemodynamically stable.  Actively treating
   Klebsiella PNA.
   - follow fever curve
   - IVF as needed
   - ABx as above
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vanco 750mg IV q24 through [**12-16**]
   - follow blood cultures
   - trough goal 15-20 per ID
   .
   #Metabolic alkalosis: Likely [**2-6**] diuresis, insensible loss, and likely
   a relative metabolic alkalosis because of compensation for chronic CO2
   retention and over-ventillation on vent. Improved on repeat ABG.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Today platelets slowly recovering. Serotonin
   release assay negative but was done 2 days after heparin d/c. Will call
   hematology today to discuss significance/whether patient should or
   should not carry a Dx of HIT.
   -heme consult recs
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.4 stable.  Likely nutritional in nature. Not
   actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin K and follow coags.
   - follow coags
   .
   # UGI bleed: Resolved.  No further bloody output from NG since
   admission.  Likely from oropharyngeal bleeding from difficult
   intubation.  Monitoring coags. On PPI.
   - PPI qd
   .
   # Type 2 DM: FS stabilized with 15 glargine and increased ISS
   - fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for
   now.  Dose adjusted yesterday, will continue to monitor for tremor
   improvement.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Starting tube feeds once ok
d by IP (post-PEG). Repleting
   electrolytes as needed. Multivitamin
   .
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, pneumoboots.
   .
   # ACCESS: PICC. right A line, PIV
   .
   # CODE: Full code, confirmed with wife. Consent for ICU in chart.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of recent subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure and fever. The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure secondary to Klebsiella pneumonia, which is sensitive to meropenem. The patient tolerated CPAP/PSV well on 5 cmH2O and continues to have bloody secretions in the vent tube but in decreased quantity. 

The patient also has altered mental status, which has slightly improved but is difficult to assess while on sedation. The patient is being weaned off the ventilator, and sedation will be decreased as tolerated. 

Additionally, the patient has acute on chronic renal insufficiency due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis. Creatinine continues to improve along with fluid status. 

The patient experienced one episode of hypotension to 70 systolic two days ago after the third dose of metoprolol, which was responsive to a fluid bolus. The patient's blood pressure has been stable since then. 

There is a decrease in ectopy after starting metoprolol, but there was severe bradycardia after increasing the dose, so the"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure and fever,
   now s/p trach and PEG placement.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Secondary to Klebsiella PNA, sensitive to
   meropenem.  Trach placed yesterday w/o complications, today tolerating
   CPAP/PS well on 5 PEEP.  He continues to have bloody secretions in vent
   tube but they have decreased in quantity.  Will continue to treat PNA,
   and aggressive chest PT given secretions.
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**]
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   With vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated
   and follow mental status.
   -off drip and monitor the requirement for prn boluses, if less than q3
   can d/c drip
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: ATN in setting of sepsis.
   Creatinine continues to improve as well as fluid status.
   - monitor creatinine, UOP
   - renally dose medications
   .
   #Hypotension: One episode of SBP to 70
s systolic 2 days ago after
   third dose of Metoprolol, was responsive to fluid bolus. BP has been
   stable since then.
   -          Metoprolol low dose 12.5 TID
   .
   # Ectopy: Decreased ectopy after started metoprolol but BP dropped
   severely after Metoprolol increased to TID, so will keep low dose for
   now.
   .
   #Shock: Fever has resolved. One episode of hypotension but unlikely due
   to sepsis (as above). Now hemodynamically stable.  Actively treating
   Klebsiella PNA.
   - follow fever curve
   - IVF as needed
   - ABx as above
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vanco 750mg IV q24 through [**12-16**]
   - follow blood cultures
   - trough goal 15-20 per ID
   .
   #Metabolic alkalosis: Likely [**2-6**] diuresis, insensible loss, and likely
   a relative metabolic alkalosis because of compensation for chronic CO2
   retention and over-ventillation on vent. Improved on repeat ABG.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Today platelets slowly recovering. Serotonin
   release assay negative but was done 2 days after heparin d/c. Will call
   hematology today to discuss significance/whether patient should or
   should not carry a Dx of HIT.
   -heme consult recs
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.4 stable.  Likely nutritional in nature. Not
   actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin K and follow coags.
   - follow coags
   .
   # UGI bleed: Resolved.  No further bloody output from NG since
   admission.  Likely from oropharyngeal bleeding from difficult
   intubation.  Monitoring coags. On PPI.
   - PPI qd
   .
   # Type 2 DM: FS stabilized with 15 glargine and increased ISS
   - fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for
   now.  Dose adjusted yesterday, will continue to monitor for tremor
   improvement.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Starting tube feeds once ok
d by IP (post-PEG). Repleting
   electrolytes as needed. Multivitamin
   .
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, pneumoboots.
   .
   # ACCESS: PICC. right A line, PIV
   .
   # CODE: Full code, confirmed with wife. Consent for ICU in chart.
   .
   # COMM: With patient and family. Wife [**Name (NI) 625**] is HCP. Phone #

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure and fever,
   now s/p trach and PEG placement.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Secondary to Aspiration PNA w/Klebsiella,
   sensitive to meropenem.  Tracheostomy placed due to aspiration in
   setting of recent extubation and copious secretions w/poor cough
   strength. No complications with trachestomy, tolerating CPAP/PS well on
   PEEP of 5.  He continues to have bloody secretions in vent tube but
   they have decreased in quantity.  Treating pneumonia w/meropenem and
   aggressive chest PT.  Also on IV vancomycin, for
   bacteremia/endocarditis.  Now w/sputum gram stain showing G -
   diplococci, although no further speciation has been completed at this
   time.  Unclear whether this could be acinetobacter that has been
   previously grown from patient
s sputum (can appear as diplococci at
   times).
   - follow sputum cultures for speciation/sensitivity
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**]
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   With vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated
   and follow mental status.
   -off drip and monitor the requirement for prn boluses, if less than q3
   can d/c drip
   .
   #3 Fever: Unclear cause. Patient with yeast in urine but unlikely cause
   for fever. Now 48h post-op so unlikely due to recent tracheostomy.
   Sputum gram stain with GNR, but unclear whether this is an infection
   vs. colonization.
   -          follow UCx
   -          follow  BCx
   -          follow Sputum Cx
   -          consult w/ID regarding treating funguria
   .
   #4 UTI: yeast in urine w/WBC. Usually represents colonization, but
   patient has had foley changed once already and still has yeast in
   urine.
   -re-change foley
   -call ID re treating with fluconozole.
   .
   #4 Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: ATN in setting of sepsis.
   Creatinine continues to improve as well as fluid status.
   - monitor creatinine, UOP
   - renally dose medications
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Today platelets slowly recovering. Serotonin
   release assay negative but was done 2 days after heparin d/c. Will call
   hematology today to discuss significance/whether patient should or
   should not carry a Dx of HIT.

   # Ectopy: Decreased ectopy after started metoprolol but BP dropped
   severely after Metoprolol increased to TID, so will keep low dose for
   now.

   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vanco 750mg IV q24 through [**12-16**]
   - follow blood cultures
   - trough goal 15-20 per ID

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of recent subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure. He underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated for pneumonia with meropenem and aggressive chest physiotherapy. He also has bacteremia/endocarditis and is being treated with vancomycin. His sputum gram stain shows G- diplococci, which may be Klebsiella or Acinetobacter. He has fever, UTI with yeast in the urine, thrombocytopenia (HIT), acute on chronic renal insufficiency (ATN), ectopy, MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis, INR elevation, type 2 DM, Parkinson's disease, hypothyroidism, and FEN. He is on various medications and has multiple lines and tubes in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may worsen if he develops further infections or if his pneumonia does not respond to treatment.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status may continue to be altered due to sedation from mechanical ventilation, underlying medical conditions, or sepsis.
3. Fever: The cause of the patient's fever is"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of recent subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure. He has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is currently intubated on CPAP/PSV with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O, receiving oxygen supplementation, and being treated for pneumonia with meropenem. He is also on IV vancomycin for bacteremia/endocarditis. Sputum gram stain shows G- diplococci, and follow-up sputum cultures are pending for speciation/sensitivity.

The patient's mental status has improved slightly but remains difficult to assess due to sedation. Sedation will be weaned as tolerated, and mental status will be monitored. The cause of the patient's fever is unclear, and further evaluation of urine culture, blood cultures, and sputum culture results is pending. The patient has yeast in his urine, which is usually colonization but may require treatment due to the presence of WBC.

The patient has acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency, likely secondary to sepsis and ATN. Creatinine levels are improving along with fluid status. Medications will be monitored for renal dosing. The patient has thrombocytopenia, with"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure and fever,
   now s/p trach and PEG placement.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Secondary to Aspiration PNA w/Klebsiella,
   sensitive to meropenem.  Tracheostomy placed due to aspiration in
   setting of recent extubation and copious secretions w/poor cough
   strength. No complications with trachestomy, tolerating CPAP/PS well on
   PEEP of 5.  Min secretions on suctioning.  Treating pneumonia w/
   meropenem and aggressive chest PT.  Also on IV vancomycin, for
   bacteremia/endocarditis.  Sputum gram stain showing G (-) diplococci,
   cx with gram (-) rods (two strains) Considering acinetobacter based on
   previous growth from patient
s sputum.
   - follow sputum cultures for speciation/sensitivity
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**]
   - starting unasyn for presumptive acinetobacter
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   # Fever: Unclear cause. Patient with yeast in urine but unlikely cause
   for fever. Now 48h post-op so unlikely due to recent tracheostomy.
   Sputum gram stain with GNR, but unclear whether this is an infection
   vs. colonization.
   -          last UA negative for yeast, LE, nitr
   -          follow  BCx
   -          follow Sputum Cx
   -          no need to tx funguria per ID.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   With vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated
   and follow mental status.
   -off drip and monitor the requirement for prn boluses, if less than q3
   can d/c drip
   .
   # UTI: No yeast in last UA. Contaminated with epi
s. Prior yeast may be
   colonization, but patient has had foley changed once already and no
   yeast in urine.
   -re-change foley.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: ATN in setting of sepsis.
   Creatinine improving with fluid status.
   - monitor creatinine, UOP
   - renally dose medications
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Platelets recovering. Serotonin release assay
   negative but was done 2 days after heparin d/c.
   - Heme
 continue Fondaparinux and use for subsequent hospitalizations,
   no direct discussion of HIT
   .
   # Ectopy: Decreased ectopy after started metoprolol but BP dropped
   severely after Metoprolol increased to TID.  Now on low dose metoprolol
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vanco 750mg IV q24 through [**12-16**]
   - follow blood cultures
   - trough goal 15-20 per ID
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.5 stable.  Likely nutritional in nature. Not
   actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin K and follow coags.
   .
   # Type 2 DM: FS stabilized with 15 glargine and increased ISS.  No
   changes.
   - fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for
   now.  Dose adjusted yesterday, will continue to monitor for tremor
   improvement.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Tube feeds via peg. Repleting electrolytes as needed.
   Multivitamin.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, pneumoboots.  Cont  fondoparinux
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with recent subdural hematoma, recent streptococcal bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure. He underwent tracheostomy placement due to aspiration in the setting of recent extubation and copious secretions with poor cough strength. He is currently on IV vancomycin for bacteremia/endocarditis and meropenem for pneumonia. He also has a Foley catheter in place. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains sedated on the ventilator. His mental status has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia with Klebsiella sensitivity to meropenem. He is currently being treated with meropenem and aggressive chest physiotherapy. There are no immediate complications with the tracheostomy.
2. Fever: The cause of the fever is unclear. The patient has yeast in his urine but it is unlikely to be the cause of the fever. Sputum gram stain shows gram-negative rods, but it is unclear whether this is an infection or colonization.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is sedated on the ventilator, which makes it difficult to assess his mental status accurately. As he is weaned off the sedation, his mental status should improve.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure and fever,
   now s/p trach and PEG placement.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Secondary to Aspiration PNA w/Klebsiella,
   sensitive to meropenem.  Tracheostomy placed due to aspiration in
   setting of recent extubation and copious secretions w/poor cough
   strength. No complications with trachestomy, tolerating CPAP/PS well on
   PEEP of 5.  Min secretions on suctioning.  Treating pneumonia w/
   meropenem and aggressive chest PT.  Also on IV vancomycin, for
   bacteremia/endocarditis.  Sputum gram stain showing G (-) diplococci,
   cx with gram (-) rods (two strains) Considering acinetobacter based on
   previous growth from patient
s sputum.
   - follow sputum cultures for speciation/sensitivity
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**]
   - starting unasyn for presumptive acinetobacter
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   # Fever: Unclear cause. Patient with yeast in urine but unlikely cause
   for fever. Now 48h post-op so unlikely due to recent tracheostomy.
   Sputum gram stain with GNR, but unclear whether this is an infection
   vs. colonization.
   -          last UA negative for yeast, LE, nitr
   -          follow  BCx
   -          follow Sputum Cx
   -          no need to tx funguria per ID.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   With vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated
   and follow mental status.
   -off drip and monitor the requirement for prn boluses, if less than q3
   can d/c drip
   .
   # UTI: No yeast in last UA. Contaminated with epi
s. Prior yeast may be
   colonization, but patient has had foley changed once already and no
   yeast in urine.
   -re-change foley.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: ATN in setting of sepsis.
   Creatinine improving with fluid status.
   - monitor creatinine, UOP
   - renally dose medications
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Platelets recovering. Serotonin release assay
   negative but was done 2 days after heparin d/c.
   - Heme
 continue Fondaparinux and use for subsequent hospitalizations,
   no direct discussion of HIT
   .
   # Ectopy: Decreased ectopy after started metoprolol but BP dropped
   severely after Metoprolol increased to TID.  Now on low dose metoprolol
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vanco 750mg IV q24 through [**12-16**]
   - follow blood cultures
   - trough goal 15-20 per ID
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.5 stable.  Likely nutritional in nature. Not
   actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin K and follow coags.
   .
   # Type 2 DM: FS stabilized with 15 glargine and increased ISS.  No
   changes.
   - fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for
   now.  Dose adjusted yesterday, will continue to monitor for tremor
   improvement.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Tube feeds via peg. Repleting electrolytes as needed.
   Multivitamin.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, pneumoboots.  Cont  fondoparinux

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure and fever,
   now s/p trach and PEG placement.
   .
   #1 Respiratory failure: Secondary to Aspiration PNA w/Klebsiella,
   sensitive to meropenem.  Tracheostomy placed due to aspiration in
   setting of recent extubation and copious secretions w/poor cough
   strength. No complications with trachestomy, tolerating CPAP/PS well on
   PEEP of 5.  He continues to have bloody secretions in vent tube but
   they have decreased in quantity.  Treating pneumonia w/meropenem and
   aggressive chest PT.  Also on IV vancomycin, for
   bacteremia/endocarditis.  Now w/sputum gram stain showing G -
   diplococci, although no further speciation has been completed at this
   time.  Unclear whether this could be acinetobacter that has been
   previously grown from patient
s sputum (can appear as diplococci at
   times).
   - follow sputum cultures for speciation/sensitivity
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**]
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   .
   #2 Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   With vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated
   and follow mental status.
   -off drip and monitor the requirement for prn boluses, if less than q3
   can d/c drip
   .
   #3 Fever: Unclear cause. Patient with yeast in urine but unlikely cause
   for fever. Now 48h post-op so unlikely due to recent tracheostomy.
   Sputum gram stain with GNR, but unclear whether this is an infection
   vs. colonization.
   -          follow UCx
   -          follow  BCx
   -          follow Sputum Cx
   -          consult w/ID regarding treating funguria
   .
   #4 UTI: yeast in urine w/WBC. Usually represents colonization, but
   patient has had foley changed once already and still has yeast in
   urine.
   -re-change foley
   -call ID re treating with fluconozole.
   .
   #4 Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: ATN in setting of sepsis.
   Creatinine continues to improve as well as fluid status.
   - monitor creatinine, UOP
   - renally dose medications
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Today platelets slowly recovering. Serotonin
   release assay negative but was done 2 days after heparin d/c. Will call
   hematology today to discuss significance/whether patient should or
   should not carry a Dx of HIT.
   -heme consult recs
   .
   # Ectopy: Decreased ectopy after started metoprolol but BP dropped
   severely after Metoprolol increased to TID, so will keep low dose for
   now.
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vanco 750mg IV q24 through [**12-16**]
   - follow blood cultures
   - trough goal 15-20 per ID
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.4 stable.  Likely nutritional in nature. Not
   actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin K and follow coags.
   - follow coags
   .
   # Type 2 DM: FS stabilized with 15 glargine and increased ISS
   - fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for
   now.  Dose adjusted yesterday, will continue to monitor for tremor
   improvement.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Tube feeds via peg. Repleting electrolytes as needed.
   Multivitamin.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, pneumoboots.  Discuss with hematology RE
   fondoparinux
   .
   # ACCESS: PICC. PIV. Can pull A-line.
   .
   # CODE: Full code, confirmed with wife. Consent for ICU in chart.
   .
   # COMM: With patient and family. Wife [**Name (NI) 625**] is HCP. Phone #
   [**Telephone/Fax (1) 2577**].
   .
   # DISP: call out to floor, ? rehabilitation screening

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure and fever,
   now s/p trach and PEG placement.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Secondary to Aspiration PNA w/Klebsiella,
   sensitive to meropenem.  Tracheostomy placed due to aspiration in
   setting of recent extubation and copious secretions w/poor cough
   strength. No complications with trachestomy, tolerating CPAP/PS well on
   PEEP of 5.  Min secretions on suctioning.  Treating pneumonia w/
   meropenem and aggressive chest PT.  Also on IV vancomycin, for
   bacteremia/endocarditis.  Sputum gram stain showing G (-) diplococci,
   cx with gram (-) rods (two strains) Considering acinetobacter based on
   previous growth from patient
s sputum.
   - follow sputum cultures for speciation/sensitivity
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**]
   - starting unasyn for presumptive acinetobacter
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   # Fever: Unclear cause. Patient with yeast in urine but unlikely cause
   for fever. Now 48h post-op so unlikely due to recent tracheostomy.
   Sputum gram stain with GNR, but unclear whether this is an infection
   vs. colonization.
   -          last UA negative for yeast, LE, nitr
   -          follow  BCx
   -          follow Sputum Cx
   -          no need to tx funguria per ID.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   With vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated
   and follow mental status.
   -off drip and monitor the requirement for prn boluses, if less than q3
   can d/c drip
   .
   # UTI: No yeast in last UA. Contaminated with epi
s. Prior yeast may be
   colonization, but patient has had foley changed once already and no
   yeast in urine.
   -re-change foley.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: ATN in setting of sepsis.
   Creatinine improving with fluid status.
   - monitor creatinine, UOP
   - renally dose medications
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Platelets recovering. Serotonin release assay
   negative but was done 2 days after heparin d/c.
   - Heme
 continue Fondaparinux and use for subsequent hospitalizations,
   no direct discussion of HIT
   .
   # Ectopy: Decreased ectopy after started metoprolol but BP dropped
   severely after Metoprolol increased to TID.  Now on low dose metoprolol
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vanco 750mg IV q24 through [**12-16**]
   - follow blood cultures
   - trough goal 15-20 per ID
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.5 stable.  Likely nutritional in nature. Not
   actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin K and follow coags.
   .
   # Type 2 DM: FS stabilized with 15 glargine and increased ISS.  No
   changes.
   - fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for
   now.  Dose adjusted yesterday, will continue to monitor for tremor
   improvement.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine.
   .
   # FEN: Tube feeds via peg. Repleting electrolytes as needed.
   Multivitamin.
   .
   # PPx: PPI, bowel regimen, pneumoboots.  Cont  fondoparinux
   .
   # ACCESS: PICC. PIV. Pulled A-line.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of subdural hematoma, recent streptococcus bovis bacteremia, MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and endocarditis. He was admitted to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure. The patient has undergone tracheostomy placement due to aspiration and poor cough strength. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and receiving antibiotics for pneumonia (meropenem) and bacteremia/endocarditis (vancomycin). 

The patient's fever is unresolved, and there is uncertainty regarding the cause. He also has a urinary tract infection with yeast present in the urine, but it is unlikely to be the cause of the fever. The sputum gram stain shows Gram-negative rods, which may indicate an Acinetobacter infection.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to sedation from mechanical ventilation. As the sedation is weaned, his mental status should improve. 

The patient's thrombocytopenia is attributed to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). All heparin products have been discontinued, and Fondaparinux has been initiated. 

The patient's renal insufficiency is a result of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of sepsis. Creatinine levels are improving with fluid status management. Renal dosing of medications will be continued.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure and fever,
   now s/p trach and PEG placement.
   .
 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   : Secondary to Aspiration PNA w/Klebsiella, sensitive to meropenem.
   Tracheostomy placed due to aspiration in setting of recent extubation
   and copious secretions w/poor cough strength  Min secretions on
   suctioning.  Treating pneumonia w/ meropenem and aggressive chest PT.
   Also on IV vancomycin, for bacteremia/endocarditis.  [**12-10**]  Sputum grew
   Acineoobacter  similar to  previous growth from patient
s sputum.
   Sensitive to tobramycin and unasyn. Culture also grew GNR
   -f/u sputum GNR ID
   - discontinued  meropenem  after 12 day course
   - started on tobramycin and unasyn. Tobra dose decreased from 240mg [**Hospital1 **]
   to 300 q24h per pharm. Last infection pt was on 300mg q48h.  Checking
   Tobra peak and trough. To discuss dose with ID.
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   -Pt tachypnic on [**10-9**] although oxygenating well. PS increased to 15
   with a decrease in RR.
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   : Likely [**2-6**] to new acinobactor PNA. Fever had previously subsided but
   after trach has had increasing WBC and new fever coinsiding with new
   sputum cult.. Patient with yeast in urine but unlikely cause for fever.
   Finished course for Klebsiella PNA. To finish Vanco for endocarditis on
   [**12-16**]. Med list reviewed no obivious suspect for drug fever.
              -  follow  BCx
   -          follow Sputum Cx
   -          no need to tx funguria per ID.
   .
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   : Had been on vent with sedation. Now off all sedation, mental status
   has improved slightly opening eyes and following commands. However pt
   remains non-verbal and less active compared with last admission.
   Possible new acute change in MS [**2-6**] new infection. Exacerbation of
   parkinsons also possible
   -monitor MS for improvement as treating infection
   .
   # UTI: Many Bac and yeast on  UA. Contaminated with epi
s. Yeast likely
   colonization, patient has had foley changed once already since + yeast.
   Urine cultures NG so far
   -f/u urine cultures
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: ATN in setting of sepsis.
   Creatinine improving down to 1.2
   - monitor creatinine, UOP
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   Platelets recovering. Serotonin release assay negative but was done 2
   days after heparin d/c.
   - Heme
 continue Fondaparinux and use for subsequent hospitalizations,
   no direct discussion of HIT
   .
   # Ectopy: Decreased ectopy after started metoprolol but BP dropped
   severely after Metoprolol increased to TID likely [**2-6**] aggressive
   diuresis that day.  Now on low dose metoprolol
   - SVT to 170s, increased metoprolol to 25mg, monitor BP carefully
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vanco 750mg IV q24 through [**12-16**]
   - follow blood cultures
   - trough goal 15-20 per ID
   -f/u trough
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.5 stable.  Likely nutritional in nature. Not
   actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin K and follow coags.
   .
   # Type 2 DM: FS stabilized with 15 glargine and increased ISS.  No
   changes.
   - fingersticks four times daily
   .
 PARKINSON'S DISEASE
   : Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for now.  Tremor seems to
   be worsening and ? whether Parkinson
s contributing to continued poor
   MS.
   [**Name14 (STitle) 3151**] Carbidopa-Levodopa to 3 Tabs 5x/day given that drug
   absorption may be decreased with protein given in TF.
   - If no improvement in MS with increase plan on consulting neuro

   sensitive to meropenem.  Tracheostomy placed due to aspiration in
   setting of recent extubation and copious secretions w/poor cough
   strength. No complications with trachestomy, tolerating CPAP/PS well on
   PEEP of 5.  Min secretions on suctioning.  Treating pneumonia w/
   meropenem and aggressive chest PT.  Also on IV vancomycin, for
   bacteremia/endocarditis.  Sputum gram stain showing G (-) diplococci,
   cx with gram (-) rods (two strains) Considering acinetobacter based on
   previous growth from patient
s sputum.
   - follow sputum cultures for speciation/sensitivity
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of recent subdural hematoma, streptococcus bovis bacteremia, MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and endocarditis. He has been admitted to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure. He has had a tracheostomy placement due to aspiration and is currently on CPAP/PSV with PEEP of 5. The sputum gram stain showed gram-negative diplococci, and the patient has been treated with meropenem for 14 days, along with vancomycin for bacteremia/endocarditis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to aspiration pneumonia with Klebsiella, which is sensitive to meropenem. He is tolerating CPAP/PSV well on PEEP of 5, but there may be a risk of further respiratory complications if his pneumonia does not improve or if he develops any new infections.
2. Fever: The patient's fever is of unclear origin. While yeast in the urine is unlikely to be the cause, the presence of GNR in the sputum gram stain suggests a possible infection. Monitoring of blood cultures and follow-up sputum cultures are necessary to determine the cause of the fever.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved slightly but is difficult to assess while on sedation. As the sedation"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure and fever,
   now s/p trach and PEG placement.
   .
 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   : Secondary to Aspiration PNA w/Klebsiella, sensitive to meropenem.
   Tracheostomy placed due to aspiration in setting of recent extubation
   and copious secretions w/poor cough strength. No complications with
   trachestomy, tolerating CPAP/PS well on PEEP of 5.  Min secretions on
   suctioning.  Treating pneumonia w/ meropenem and aggressive chest PT.
   Also on IV vancomycin, for bacteremia/endocarditis.  [**12-10**]  Sputum grew
   Acineoobacter  similar to  previous growth from patient
s sputum.
   Sensitive to tobramycin and unasyn
   - follow sputum cultures for speciation/sensitivity
   - continue meropenem  for 14 day course through [**12-14**]
   - starting unasyn for presumptive acinetobacter
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   # Fever: Unclear cause. Patient with yeast in urine but unlikely cause
   for fever. Now 48h post-op so unlikely due to recent tracheostomy.
   Sputum gram stain with GNR, but unclear whether this is an infection
   vs. colonization.
   -          last UA negative for yeast, LE, nitr
   -          follow  BCx
   -          follow Sputum Cx
   -          no need to tx funguria per ID.
   .
   # Altered mental status: Sedated on vent with sedation. Mental status
   has improved slightly but it is difficult to assess while on sedation.
   With vent weaning, will continue to go down on sedation as tolerated
   and follow mental status.
   -off drip and monitor the requirement for prn boluses, if less than q3
   can d/c drip
   .
   # UTI: No yeast in last UA. Contaminated with epi
s. Prior yeast may be
   colonization, but patient has had foley changed once already and no
   yeast in urine.
   -re-change foley.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: ATN in setting of sepsis.
   Creatinine improving with fluid status.
   - monitor creatinine, UOP
   - renally dose medications
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products,
   lines flushed yesterday.  Platelets recovering. Serotonin release assay
   negative but was done 2 days after heparin d/c.
   - Heme
 continue Fondaparinux and use for subsequent hospitalizations,
   no direct discussion of HIT
   .
   # Ectopy: Decreased ectopy after started metoprolol but BP dropped
   severely after Metoprolol increased to TID.  Now on low dose metoprolol
   .
   # MRSA/Enterococcus bacteremia with aortic valve endocarditis: continue
   on vancomycin and following blood cultures.
   - continue vanco 750mg IV q24 through [**12-16**]
   - follow blood cultures
   - trough goal 15-20 per ID
   .
   # INR elevation: INR 1.5 stable.  Likely nutritional in nature. Not
   actively bleeding, will hold off on vitamin K and follow coags.
   .
   # Type 2 DM: FS stabilized with 15 glargine and increased ISS.  No
   changes.
   - fingersticks four times daily
   .
   # Parkinson's disease: Continue carbidopa/levodopa and ropinirole for
   now.  Dose adjusted yesterday, will continue to monitor for tremor
   improvement.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a recent subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure. He underwent tracheostomy placement due to aspiration in the setting of recent extubation and copious secretions with poor cough strength. The patient is currently on aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet. He has been treated with meropenem and vancomycin for suspected pneumonia and bacteremia/endocarditis, respectively. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Fever of Unknown Origin: The patient has a persistent fever, and the cause remains unclear. Sputum gram stain showed GNR, but it is unclear whether this is an infection or colonization. The patient's yeast in the urine may be colonization rather than an infection. The healthcare team should follow up with blood cultures and sputum cultures for speciation/sensitivity.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved slightly but is difficult to assess while on sedation. With vent weaning, the team should continue to monitor the patient's mental status.

3. UTI: There is no yeast in the last UA. The prior yeast may be colonization, but the patient has already had the Foley changed once, and there is no yeast in the urine. However, the patient remains at risk for urinary tract infections, and re-changing the Foley"

   A/P: This is a 66 y/o man with recent subdural hematoma, recent strep
   bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia and recent admission to the MICU for
   altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure and fever,
   now s/p trach and PEG placement.
   .
 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   : Secondary to Aspiration PNA w/Klebsiella, sensitive to meropenem.
   Tracheostomy placed due to aspiration in setting of recent extubation
   and copious secretions w/poor cough strength  Min secretions on
   suctioning.  Treating pneumonia w/ meropenem and aggressive chest PT.
   Also on IV vancomycin, for bacteremia/endocarditis.  [**12-10**]  Sputum grew
   Acineoobacter  similar to  previous growth from patient
s sputum.
   Sensitive to tobramycin and unasyn. Culture also grew GNR
   -f/u sputum GNR ID
   - discontinued  meropenem  after 12 day course
   - started on tobramycin and unasyn. Tobra dose decreased from 240mg [**Hospital1 **]
   to 300 q24h per pharm. Last infection pt was on 300mg q48h.  Checking
   Tobra peak and trough. To discuss dose with ID.
   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   -Pt tachypnic on [**10-9**] although oxygenating well. PS increased to 15
   with a decrease in RR.
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   : Likely [**2-6**] to new acinobactor PNA. Fever had previously subsided but
   after trach has had increasing WBC and new fever coinsiding with new
   sputum cult.. Patient with yeast in urine but unlikely cause for fever.
   Finished course for Klebsiella PNA. To finish Vanco for endocarditis on

   # Altered mental status: Had been on vent with sedation. Now off all
   sedation, mental status has improved slightly opening eyes and
   following commands. However pt remains non-verbal and less active
   compared with last admission. Possible new acute change in MS [**2-6**] new
   infection. Exacerbation of parkinsons also possible
   -monitor MS for improvement as treating infection

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of recent subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure. The patient has been on ventilatory support and has undergone tracheostomy and PEG placement. He is currently being treated for pneumonia with meropenem and aggressive chest physiotherapy, and for bacteremia/endocarditis with vancomycin. The patient's sputum culture grew Acinetobacter, similar to previous growth from the patient's sputum, which is sensitive to tobramycin and unasyn. The patient's recent fever coincides with new sputum culture results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure and is currently on ventilatory support. There is a potential risk of worsening respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia caused by Klebsiella and Acinetobacter.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's fever has persisted despite treatment, and the source remains unknown. This could indicate a new infection or ongoing bacteremia/endocarditis.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient has evidence of acute renal insufficiency and is at risk of further deterioration due to sepsis and potential medication nephrotoxicity.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease, type II diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and previous respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and has been experiencing altered mental status, renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and suspected bacterial endocarditis. The patient's vital signs show elevated temperature, low blood pressure, and stable oxygen saturation. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,462 mL and output of 1,900 mL, with a positive balance of 2,562 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma from high peak inspiratory pressures.
2. Infection: The presence of fever and suspected bacterial endocarditis indicates a risk of systemic infection. Close monitoring for sepsis and septic shock is essential.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute kidney injury requires"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has a fever of 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit, altered mental status, respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, bacterial endocarditis, diabetes mellitus type II, Parkinson's disease, a history of hypothyroidism, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. 

The patient's vital signs show a t-max of 39 degrees Celsius, current temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 84-103 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 96/52 mmHg to 142/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. 

The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 4,462 mL with outputs totaling 1,900 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,562 mL. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated creatinine levels, and various other abnormalities in kidney function tests, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and cardiac markers. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 30%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 93, and the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 21 cmH2O. 

The patient's medical allergies include anaphylaxis to Ditropan, hives from Lisinopril, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. 

The patient's previous antibiotics include meropenem, tobramycin, vancomycin, and ampicillin/sulbactam. 

The patient's current medications include ICU medications and other medications, but specific names are not provided in the note. 

The patient's physical examination findings are largely incomplete due to their inability to assess certain parameters such as peripheral vascular status, skin condition, neurologic responses, and muscle tone. 

In summary, the patient presents with multiple acute medical complications including respiratory failure, fever, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, bacterial endocarditis, altered mental status, diabetes mellitus type II, Parkinson's disease, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires close monitoring and management of their condition."

   now s/p trach and PEG placement.
   .
 .H/O RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   : Secondary to Aspiration PNA w/Klebsiella, sensitive to meropenem.
   Tracheostomy placed due to aspiration in setting of recent extubation
   and copious secretions w/poor cough strength  Min secretions on
   suctioning.  Treating pneumonia w/ meropenem and aggressive chest PT.
   Also on IV vancomycin, for bacteremia/endocarditis.  [**12-10**]  Sputum grew
   Acineoobacter  similar to  previous growth from patient
s sputum.
   Sensitive to tobramycin and unasyn. Culture also grew GNR
   -f/u sputum GNR ID
   - discontinued  meropenem  after 12 day course
   - started on tobramycin and unasyn. Tobra dose decreased from 240mg [**Hospital1 **]
   to 300 q24h per pharm. Last infection pt was on 300mg q48h.  Checking
   Tobra peak and trough.

   - aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet
   - atrovent/albuterol nebs prn
   -Pt tachypnic on [**10-9**] although oxygenating well. PS increased to 12
   with a decrease in RR.
   - attempt to sit pt up to better aerate lungs, will hold off tx
   Klebsiella unless clinical picture changes as this is considered a
   colonizer at this point
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   : Likely [**2-6**] to new acinobactor PNA. Fever had previously subsided but
   after trach has had increasing WBC and new fever coinsiding with new
   sputum cult.. Patient with yeast in urine but unlikely cause for fever.
   Finished course for Klebsiella PNA. To finish Vanco for endocarditis on
   [**12-16**]. Med list reviewed no obivious suspect for drug fever.

   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   : Had been on vent with sedation. Now off all sedation, mental status
   has improved slightly opening eyes and following commands. However pt
   remains non-verbal and less active compared with last admission.
   Possible new acute change in MS [**2-6**] new infection. Exacerbation of
   parkinsons also possible
   -monitor MS for improvement as treating infection
   - Neuro consulted for thoughts about Parkinson

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure and fever. The patient underwent tracheostomy placement due to aspiration in the setting of recent extubation and copious secretions with poor cough strength. He is currently being treated for pneumonia with meropenem and aggressive chest physiotherapy, as well as for bacteremia/endocarditis with vancomycin. The patient also has a history of Parkinson's disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and acute renal failure due to sepsis.

The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure (acute), fever of unknown origin, acute renal failure (ATN in setting of sepsis), thrombocytopenia (HIT antibody positive, off all heparin products, platelets recovering), bacterial endocarditis, altered mental status (not delirium), and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The patient is receiving various treatments including nutrition via fibersource HN (full) at 65 mL/hour, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure. The patient underwent tracheostomy placement due to aspiration in the setting of recent extubation and copious secretions with poor cough strength. He is currently being treated with meropenem and aggressive chest physical therapy (PT) for pneumonia, as well as vancomycin for bacteremia/endocarditis. The patient's fever curve seems to be improving, and cultures are pending but most likely source is pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia with Klebsiella, which was sensitive to meropenem. He underwent tracheostomy placement due to aspiration in the setting of recent extubation and copious secretions with poor cough strength.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had persistent fever despite antibiotic treatment. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the fever.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of acute on chronic renal insufficiency, likely secondary to sepsis. His creatinine levels are improving, but close monitoring is required.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has been diagnosed with HIT ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, bacterial endocarditis, altered mental status, type II diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, and a history of acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently receiving nutrition through Fibersource HN at 65 mL/hour and has a PICC line in place. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/77 mmHg to 136/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on tracheal mask ventilation. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and various electrolyte imbalances. The patient's blood cultures from December 10th onwards have been positive for Gram-positive bacteria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's acute respiratory failure and altered mental status may require prolonged mechanical ventilation, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Sepsis: The positive blood cultures for Gram-positive bacteria indicate a potential bacterial infection, which could lead to sepsis, especially considering the patient's thrombocytopenia and altered mental status.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI):"

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of recent subdural hematoma, recent strep bovis/MRSA/enterococcus bacteremia, and recent admission to the MICU for altered mental status and pneumonia with respiratory failure and fever. He underwent tracheostomy placement due to aspiration in the setting of recent extubation and copious secretions with poor cough strength. The patient is being treated for pneumonia with meropenem and aggressive chest physiotherapy, as well as IV vancomycin for bacteremia/endocarditis. Acinetobacter was grown from sputum cultures, similar to previous growth from the patient's sputum. The organism is sensitive to tobramycin and unasyn, so the patient is being treated with tobramycin and will have follow-up for drug levels. Meropenem was discontinued after a 12-day course, and unasyn will be continued. Aggressive chest PT and pulmonary toilet will continue, along with tracheostomy care and rest in the PM on PS.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has had acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia with Klebsiella, which is sensitive to meropenem. He is currently on meropenem and aggressive chest physiotherapy.
2. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has had a persistent low-grade fever likely secondary to new Acinetobacter pneumonia. Cultures are still pending but"

","Based on the provided information, the patient has a complex medical history and is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia with Klebsiella, which required a tracheostomy placement. There is ongoing treatment for pneumonia and aggressive chest physical therapy.

2. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient had persistent fever despite antibiotic therapy, and it is suspected to be related to a new Acinetobacter pneumonia. Monitoring and follow-up of blood cultures are recommended.

3. Bacteremia and endocarditis: The patient had bacteremia with MRSA and enterococcus, leading to aortic valve endocarditis. He is currently on vancomycin therapy and following blood cultures.

4. Altered mental status: The patient had altered mental status with episodes of agitation. This could be due to underlying infection, undertreated Parkinson's disease, or medication effects. Neurological recommendations have been made, including a potential change in Sinemet dosage and the use of Seroquel instead of Zyprexa.

5. Parkinson's disease: The patient has Parkinson's disease, and there are ongoing recommendations for its management.

6. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI with multiple bacteria and yeast on urine analysis. However, it is likely colonization rather than an active infection, and no treatment is planned at this"
