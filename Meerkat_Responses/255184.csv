","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly individual experiencing septic shock, renal failure with hyperkalemia, bradycardia, hypothermia, and acute respiratory failure. They are currently on mechanical ventilation and have multiple lines inserted, including an arterial line.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/60 mmHg to 89/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Their temperature is within normal limits at 36.3°C (97.3°F). The patient has been receiving vasopressin, norepinephrine, fentanyl, midazolam, and famotidine infusions.

Laboratory results indicate renal failure with elevated serum creatinine levels, hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), and low urine output. Other lab values reveal low glucose levels and abnormal arterial blood gas results.

The patient's physical examination findings include being thin, normocephalic, with clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, cool skin, and no bowel sounds present. Neurological assessment is limited due to sedation.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: Given the patient's septic shock and renal failure, there is a risk of further organ dysfunction, such as liver or cardiovascular system involvement.

2. Nosocomial infections: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patinet is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of hypertension and
   urosepsis presenting with altered mental status, found to be
   hypotensive, bradycardic, and hyperkalemic in the setting of ARF.
   #  Hypotension:  In review of recent events, seems has had hypotension
   in the setting of bradycardia, intubation induction as well as atenolol
   delayed metabolism with ARF, and likely urosepsis.  Current pressor
   requirement most likely due to ongoing sepsis.  Is currently + 11L, had
   required 3 pressors, currently weened to levophed and vasopressin (did
   not tolerate vasopressin being off.
   -- cont levophed with w/ MAP > 65; restart vasopressin as needed.
   -- follow urine output with goal > 30cc/hr
   -- hold atenolol and lisinopril
   .
   # Bradycardia:  Likely secondary to hyperkalemia w/ peaked t waves and
   junctional bradycardia.  Also, may be secondary to atentolol toxicity
   in the setting of ARF.  Wouldn
t be surprised if has underlying sick
   sinus as well given advanced age.  Currently normal sinus w/o EKG
   abnormalities.
   -- hold atenolol
   -- continue potassium manegment as below.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Now reversed with both acute membrane stabilization,
   temporary potassium shift, and resin binding.  Still mildly elevated,
   but improved
   -- Continue to follow closely w/ [**Hospital1 **] lytes, will give for K > 5.5
   -- Manage ARF as below.
   -- hold home potassium
   .
   # Sepsis:  UA w/ frank pus, and UA c/w UTI.  Met SIRS criteria
   hypothermia and bandemia.  Patient with 16% bandemia.  Has a history of
   UTI, resistant to cipro.  + Sputum gram stain but suspect aspiration;
   no other clear source.
   -- f/u urine culture from BIDNH, and [**Hospital1 1**] ED, NGTD
   -- blood cultures NGTD, but sputum cultures with multiple organisms on
   gram stain, f/u culture
   -- cont broad spectrum abx w/ vanc/cefepine
   -- MAPs > 65, UOP > 30cc/hr
   .
   # ARF:  Likely from volume depletion vs. secondary to pyelonephritis
   vs. ATN in the setting of hypotension (although would seem too early to
   develop.)  Encouraging that imrpoved from 3.5 to 2.3 after IVF.  FeNA
   of 0.27
   -- will trend renal function
   -- send off urine lytes
   -- avoid nephrotoxic meds
   -- hold lisinopril
   -- IVF
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Does have anasacuria on exam, but are
   responsive b/l.  Minimally responsive to noxious stimuli, on minimal
   sedation with limited  responsiveness.
   -- ween sedation and reassess
   -- consider NCHCT
   .
   # Elevated Cardiac Markers:  Likely demand iscemia, no changes c/w
   ACS.
   .
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / NPO for now
   # PPX: H2 blocker, heparin SQ, bowel regimen

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions and complications. The patient has been diagnosed with hyperkalemia (high potassium), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure within the normal range, with some fluctuations. The heart rate is within normal limits, and the respiratory rate is also within normal range. The patient's oxygen saturation is consistently above 95%, indicating good oxygenation.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 6,787 mL and output of 1,680 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 5,107 mL. This suggests that the patient may be receiving excessive fluids, which can potentially lead to fluid overload and subsequent complications.

The patient is on multiple medications including vasopressin, fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, famotidine, sodium bicarbonate, and heparin. These medications are being used to manage the patient's blood pressure, pain, sedation, infection, stress ulcers, and prevent blood clots.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood glucose level is significantly low at 67 mg/dL, indicating the need for intervention.

Microbiology reports indicate the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, along with gram-negative rods and budding yeast with pseudohyphae. These findings suggest a possible mixed bacterial infection.

The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU, with specific interventions for glycemic control, stress ulcer prophylaxis, venous thromboembolism prevention, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention.

Overall, the patient presents with multiple medical complications requiring intensive care management. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to address the patient's condition and prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patinet is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of hypertension and
   urosepsis presenting with altered mental status, found to be
   hypotensive, bradycardic, and hyperkalemic in the setting of ARF.
   #  Hypotension:  In review of recent events, seems has had hypotension
   in the setting of bradycardia, intubation induction as well as atenolol
   delayed metabolism with ARF, and likely urosepsis.  Is currently + 11L,
   had required 3 pressors, currently weened to levophed.
   -- cont levophed with w/ MAP > 65; restart vasopressin as needed.
   -- follow urine output with goal > 30cc/hr
   -- hold atenolol and lisinopril
   .
   # Bradycardia:  Likely secondary to hyperkalemia w/ peaked t waves and
   junctional bradycardia.  Also, may be secondary to atentolol toxicity
   in the setting of ARF.  Wouldn
t be surprised if has underlying sick
   sinus as well given advanced age.  Currently normal sinus w/o EKG
   abnormalities.
   -- hold atenolol
   -- continue potassium manegment as below.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Now reversed with both acute membrane stabilization,
   temporary potassium shift, and resin binding.  Still mildly elevated,
   but improved
   -- Continue to follow closely w/ [**Hospital1 **] lytes, will give for K > 5.5
   -- Manage ARF as below.
   -- hold home potassium
   .
   # Sepsis:  UA w/ frank pus, and UA c/w UTI.  Met SIRS criteria
   hypothermia and bandemia.  Patient with 16% bandemia.  Has a history of
   UTI, resistant to cipro.  + Sputum gram stain; no other clear source.
   -- f/u urine culture from BIDNH, and [**Hospital1 1**] ED, NGTD
   -- blood cultures NGTD, but sputum cultures with multiple organisms on
   gram stain, f/u culture
   -- cont broad spectrum abx w/ vanc/cefepine
   -- MAPs > 65, UOP > 30cc/hr
   .
   # ARF:  Likely from volume depletion vs. secondary to pyelonephritis
   vs. ATN in the setting of hypotension (although would seem too early to
   develop.)  Encouraging that imrpoved from 3.5 to 2.3 after IVF.  FeNA
   of 0.27
   -- will trend renal function
   -- send off urine lytes
   -- avoid nephrotoxic meds
   -- hold lisinopril
   -- IVF
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Does have anasacuria on exam, but are
   responsive b/l.  Minimally responsive to noxious stimuli, on minimal
   sedation with limited  responsiveness.
   -- ween sedation and reassess
   -- consider NCHCT
   .
   # Elevated Cardiac Markers:  Likely demand iscemia, no changes c/w
   ACS.
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and urosepsis. She presents with altered mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia in the setting of acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which requires ongoing management with vasopressors. It is important to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg to ensure adequate organ perfusion.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is likely secondary to hyperkalemia and may also be related to atenolol toxicity in the setting of ARF. It is necessary to continue monitoring the patient's heart rate and adjusting medication doses accordingly.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient had significant hyperkalemia that has been managed with acute membrane stabilization, temporary potassium shift, and resin binding. Close monitoring of potassium levels is required, and administration of potassium should be avoided.
4. Sepsis: The patient shows signs of sepsis, including fever, tachycardia, and bandemia. She has a history of urinary tract infection (UTI), which is a potential source of infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued, and cultures should be followed up to identify the causative organism"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill elderly male with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has been in the ICU and requires various interventions and treatments.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 129/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature within normal range. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 24 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal electrolyte levels including hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia. The troponin T level is also elevated, indicating possible cardiac involvement.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including septic shock, renal failure with hyperkalemia, bradycardia, hypothermia, acute respiratory failure, and acute myocardial syndrome. The septic shock is presumed to be caused by a urinary source, and the patient requires ongoing vasopressor support.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening septic shock, further deterioration of renal function, progression of hyperkalemia, development of arrhythmias due to bradycardia and electrolyte imbalances,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is not mentioned in the note. The patient received albumin 25 gm x 1, which improved blood pressure and decreased the need for pressors. The patient's mental status has slightly improved and they are responding to tactile stimuli. Urine culture results are pending, and stool has been ordered for C. diff. 

The patient is allergic to levofloxacin and has an unknown allergy. The last dose of antibiotics was piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) at 04:00 AM on [**2196-1-13**]. The patient is currently receiving vasopressin at 1.5 units/hour and norepinephrine at 0.12 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, started at 12:04 AM on [**2196-1-13**], and fentanyl, also started at 12:45 AM on [**2196-1-13**]. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 96.5 C (205.7 F), current temperature of 35.9 C (96.7 F), heart rate of 80 bpm with a range of 56-96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 54/"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patinet is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of hypertension and
   urosepsis presenting with altered mental status, found to be
   hypotensive, bradycardic, and hyperkalemic in the setting of ARF.
   #  Hypotension:  In review of recent events, seems has had hypotension
   in the setting of bradycardia, intubation induction as well as atenolol
   delayed metabolism with ARF, and likely urosepsis.  Current pressor
   requirement most likely due to ongoing sepsis.  Is currently + 11L, had
   required 3 pressors, currently weened to levophed and vasopressin (did
   not tolerate vasopressin being off.
   -- cont levophed with w/ MAP > 65; restart vasopressin as needed.
   -- follow urine output with goal > 30cc/hr
   -- hold atenolol and lisinopril
   .
   # Bradycardia:  Likely secondary to hyperkalemia w/ peaked t waves and
   junctional bradycardia.  Also, may be secondary to atentolol toxicity
   in the setting of ARF.  Wouldn
t be surprised if has underlying sick
   sinus as well given advanced age.  Currently normal sinus w/o EKG
   abnormalities.
   -- hold atenolol
   -- continue potassium manegment as below.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Now reversed with both acute membrane stabilization,
   temporary potassium shift, and resin binding.  Still mildly elevated,
   but improved
   -- Continue to follow closely w/ [**Hospital1 **] lytes, will give for K > 5.5
   -- Manage ARF as below.
   -- hold home potassium
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and urosepsis. She presented with altered mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia in the setting of acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has been receiving multiple pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. Her current medications include levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, fentanyl, heparin sodium, and vasopressin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing persistent hypotension despite receiving multiple pressors. This could be due to ongoing sepsis or other underlying factors. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure closely.
2. Bradycardia: The patient has bradycardia, which may be secondary to hyperkalemia and/or atenolol toxicity. It is necessary to continue potassium management and hold atenolol.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient had significant hyperkalemia, which has been reversed with acute membrane stabilization, temporary potassium shift, and resin binding. Close monitoring of potassium levels should continue, and the patient should be given potassium-lowering agents as needed.
4. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria and has a history of UTI. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including van"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with sepsis, renal failure with hyperkalemia, bradycardia, hypothermia, and possible acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including vasopressin, norepinephrine, fentanyl, midazolam, piperacillin/tazobactam, and heparin sodium.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of septic shock indicates a severe infection that has spread throughout the body. If not managed appropriately, it can lead to organ failure and even death.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as indicated by the reduced respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) value. This suggests impaired gas exchange and potential ARF. If left untreated, it may result in respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation.

3. Renal Failure: The elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) indicate impaired kidney function. Without proper management, renal failure can progress and lead to further electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's elevated potassium levels pose a risk for cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness. It is crucial to monitor and manage this electrolyte disturbance carefully to prevent complications.

5. Bradycardia: The patient's slow heart"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and urosepsis. She presented with altered mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia in the setting of acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI), respiratory failure requiring intubation, bradycardia, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury (AKI). She also has a history of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) but without significant changes consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition indicates sepsis due to a UTI. It is crucial to monitor vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms closely. Prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics and source control measures are essential.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation for respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator should be considered based on the patient's clinical progress and respiratory status. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
3. Bradycardia: The patient exhibits bradycardia, which may be secondary to hyperkalemia and/or beta-blocker toxicity. Close monitoring of heart rate and electrolyte levels is needed. If the bradycardia persists or worsens, further evaluation and treatment for potential sick sinus syndrome may be required.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and urosepsis presenting with altered mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia in the setting of acute renal failure (ARF). 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given are:

1. Hypotension: The patient has had hypotension in the setting of bradycardia, intubation induction, and delayed metabolism of atenolol. It is likely due to urosepsis as well. The patient is currently on levophed with a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60, and vasopressin is to be restarted as needed. The goal is to maintain adequate urine output (>30 cc/hr).

2. Sepsis: The patient meets the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria for sepsis, which includes hypothermia, bandemia, and suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has a history of UTI, which is resistant to ciprofloxacin. Sputum gram stain shows multiple organisms, but contamination is suspected. Blood cultures from the nasogastric tube (NGTD) and sputum cultures are pending. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) are being continued with MAPs > 60 and urine output > 30 cc/hr.

   presenting with altered mental status, found to be hypotensive,
   bradycardic, and hyperkalemic in the setting of ARF.
   # Sepsis:  UA c/w UTI.  Met SIRS criteria hypothermia and bandemia and
   has cornybacterium in urine.   No other culture data.
   -- f/u urine culture from BIDNH, and [**Hospital1 1**] ED, - corynebacterium in
   urine here but likely contaminant
   -- blood cultures NGTD, but sputum cultures with multiple organisms on
   gram stain, f/u culture
   -- cont broad spectrum abx w/ vanc/zosyn
 will complete course on [**1-17**]
   -- MAPs > 60, UOP > 30cc/hr
   -- wean levophed and transition to neo if needed for MAP>60
   -- follow urine output with goal > 30cc/hr
   -- hold atenolol and Lisinopril
   #Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the setting of sepsis and for
   airway protection.
   - extubated today
   - continue to follow respiratory status
   # Bradycardia:  Likely secondary to hyperkalemia w/ peaked t waves and
   junctional bradycardia.  Also, may be secondary to atentolol toxicity
   in the setting of [**Last Name (un) 2406**].  Wouldn
t be surprised if has underlying sick
   sinus as well given advanced age.  Currently normal sinus w/o EKG
   abnormalities.
   -- hold atenolol
   -- continue potassium management as below.
   # Hyperkalemia: Now reversed with both acute membrane stabilization,
   temporary potassium shift, and resin binding.  Still mildly elevated,
   but improved
   -- Continue to follow closely w/ [**Hospital1 **] lytes, will give for K > 5.5
   -- Manage ARF as below.
   -- hold home potassium
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  Likely from volume depletion vs. secondary to pyelonephritis
   vs. ATN in the setting of hypotension (although would seem too early to
   develop.  FeNA of 0.27.  Continues to improve
   -- renally dose meds
   -- avoid nephrotoxic meds
   -- hold lisinopril
   -- IVF/albumin PRN
   # NSTEMI:  Likely demand iscemia, no changes c/w ACS.
   -- ECHO without any wall motion abnormalities; normal EF

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and urosepsis, presenting with altered mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia in the setting of acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, with symptoms including hypothermia, bandemia, and Corynebacterium in the urine. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) to cover potential infections.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to sepsis and airway protection but was extubated today. Her respiratory status will continue to be monitored.

3. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may be secondary to hyperkalemia with peaked T waves and junctional bradycardia. It is also possible that atenolol toxicity is contributing to the bradycardia. The patient's underlying sick sinus syndrome should also be considered, especially given her advanced age. The atenolol has been held, and potassium management will be continued.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyperkalemia has been reversed with acute membrane stabilization, temporary potassium shift, and resin binding. Close monitoring of potassium levels will be maintained, and she will receive treatment"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and urosepsis. She presented with altered mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia in the setting of acute renal failure (ARF). The patient met the criteria for sepsis, with urine culture showing Corynebacterium, which is likely a contaminant. Blood cultures were negative. The patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. She was intubated for respiratory failure but has since been extubated and maintained good oxygen saturation on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for respiratory failure but has been successfully extubated. However, close monitoring of respiratory status is necessary to prevent further respiratory complications.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB with RVR): The patient developed AFIB with RVR, which was initially managed with diltiazem. It is important to continue monitoring heart rhythm and adjust medication dosages as needed to maintain a stable heart rate.
3. Bradycardia: The patient initially presented with bradycardia, which is likely secondary to hyperkalemia and potential atenolol toxicity. Close monitoring of potassium levels and holding atenolol are recommended.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient presented"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and urosepsis. She presented with altered mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia in the setting of acute renal failure (ARF). The patient had sepsis due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. She also had bradycardia, which may be secondary to hyperkalemia or atenolol toxicity. The patient's hyperkalemia was managed with acute membrane stabilization, temporary potassium shift, and resin binding. Acute renal failure was likely caused by volume depletion or secondary to pyelonephritis or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's NSTEMI was likely due to ischemia without changes consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). An ECHO showed no wall motion abnormalities and a normal ejection fraction. The patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AFIB), altered mental status, respiratory failure, hyperkalemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's ICU care included nutrition, glycemic control, lines (20 gauge, PICC line, arterial line), prophylaxis (DVT, stress ulcer, VAP), and code status (DNR). The patient's disposition was kept in the ICU.

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to a presumed urinary source, and is experiencing renal failure with hyperkalemia. The patient also has bradycardia, hypothermia, and possible UTI. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.2°C (95.4°F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 91/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is well-nourished and alert, with symmetric chest expansion and crackles at the lung bases. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. Neurological examination reveals that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to time, place, and person. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, elevated potassium, and elevated troponin-T levels. Other lab values such as"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications, including atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, hyperkalemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and metabolic acidosis.

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate ranging from 100 to 140 beats per minute. Efforts have been made to control the heart rate using medications such as lopressor and diltiazem, but with limited effect. The patient's heart rhythm remains in AFib.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which is not delirium. The cause of the altered mental status is not specified in the progress note.
3. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient has acute respiratory failure, as indicated by the need for supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and the presence of a respiratory rate between 11 and 24 breaths per minute. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a low oxygen level of 93%.
4. Hyperkalemia (High Potassium, Hyperpotassemia): The patient has high levels of potassium in the blood, as evidenced by a potassium level of 5.6 mEq/L. This condition is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and urosepsis. She presented with altered mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia in the setting of acute renal failure (ARF). The patient met the criteria for sepsis, specifically urinary tract infection (UTI), as evidenced by Corynebacterium in the urine. Blood cultures were negative, but sputum cultures showed multiple organisms on gram stain. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) were initiated and will be completed on 1/17. The patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) needs to be maintained above 60, and urine output should be greater than 30cc/hr. Levophed was weaned off, but the patient required neos to maintain MAP above 60. Atenolol and lisinopril were held due to bradycardia and potential toxicity. Hyperkalemia was reversed with acute membrane stabilization, temporary potassium shift, and resin binding. The patient will continue to be closely monitored for electrolyte imbalances. ARF management includes holding home potassium, avoiding nephrotoxic medications, and using IV fluids and albumin as needed. The patient's NSTEMI is likely due to ischemia, with no changes consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). An ECHO showed no wall motion abnormalities and a"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of hypertension and urosepsis. She presented with altered mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia in the setting of acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, hypothermia, bandemia, and Corynebacterium infection in the urine suggest the possibility of sepsis. Continuous monitoring and prompt management are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure in the setting of sepsis and for airway protection. Since she was extubated today, close monitoring of her respiratory status is essential to detect any signs of respiratory distress or failure.

3. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may be secondary to hyperkalemia with peaked T waves and junctional bradycardia. Holding atenolol and closely managing potassium levels are important to prevent further complications.

4. Hyperkalemia: The patient initially presented with hyperkalemia, which has since been reversed with acute membrane stabilization, temporary potassium shift, and resin binding. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels is crucial to prevent the recurrence of hyperkalemia.

5. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted on 01/10/2196 with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. She was found to have sepsis due to a likely urinary source on 01/13/1613. The patient has been extubated but is still on low-dose phenylephrine in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient has a history of urosepsis and presented with a urinary tract infection. She is currently being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/76 mmHg to 114/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula, and she is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated potassium levels, and decreased platelet count. Her creatinine levels have been fluctuating, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's assessment and plan include improved septic status, unclear microbial cause, but with a history of urosepsis and presentation with a urinary tract infection. She has been successfully extubated and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia, which led to EKG changes. She has been diagnosed with sepsis due to a likely urinary source. The patient is extubated but still requires low-dose phenylephrine in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is 35.1°C (95.1°F), blood pressure is 107/76 mmHg, heart rate is 93 bpm, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula. 

The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities. The neurological examination reveals that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, but movement, tone, and skin assessments are not conducted.

The laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL, leukocyte count of 105 K/uL, platelet count of 123 K/uL, creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 165 mg/dL, sodium level of 135 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L, chloride level of 103 mEq/L, magnesium level of 2.0 mg/dL, phosphate level of 2.7 mg"

   [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of hypertension and urosepsis
   presenting with altered mental status, found to be hypotensive,
   bradycardic, and hyperkalemic in the setting of ARF.
   # Sepsis:  UA c/w UTI.  Met SIRS criteria hypothermia and bandemia and
   has cornybacterium in urine.   No other culture data.
   -- f/u urine culture from BIDNH, and [**Hospital1 1**] ED, - corynebacterium in
   urine here but likely contaminant
   -- blood cultures NGTD, but sputum cultures with multiple organisms on
   gram stain, f/u culture
   -- cont broad spectrum abx w/ vanc/zosyn
 will complete course today
   -- MAPs > 60
   -- wean levophed and transition to neo if needed for MAP>60; has been
   off pressors since MN
   -- hold atenolol and Lisinopril
   #Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the setting of sepsis and for
   airway protection.
   - extubated since wednesday
   - continue to follow respiratory status
   # Bradycardia:  Likely secondary to hyperkalemia w/ peaked t waves and
   junctional bradycardia.  Also, may be secondary to atentolol toxicity
   in the setting of [**Last Name (un) 2406**].  Wouldn
t be surprised if has underlying sick
   sinus as well given advanced age.  Currently normal sinus w/o EKG
   abnormalities.
   -- hold atenolol
   -- continue potassium management as below.
   # Hyperkalemia: Now reversed with both acute membrane stabilization,
   temporary potassium shift, and resin binding.  Still mildly elevated,
   but improved
   -- Continue to follow closely w/ [**Hospital1 **] lytes, will give for K > 5.5
   -- Manage ARF as below.
   -- hold home potassium
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  Likely from volume depletion vs. secondary to pyelonephritis
   vs. ATN in the setting of hypotension (although would seem too early to
   develop.  FeNA of 0.27.  suspect some element of fluid overload vs. new
   baseline.  Will diurese w/ lasix gtt today.
   -- renally dose meds
   -- avoid nephrotoxic meds
   -- hold lisinopril
   -- IVF/albumin PRN
   # Fluid Overload: pulmonary edema and lower extremity swelling on exam;
   lasix  gtt started, with goal of neg 1L with gentle diuresis.
   # C.Diff:  + for c.diff, starting iv flagyl for 14d course
   # NSTEMI:  Likely demand iscemia, no changes c/w ACS.
   -- ECHO without any wall motion abnormalities; normal EF

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and urosepsis. She presented with altered mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia. She was found to have acute renal failure (ARF), sepsis with a urinary tract infection (UTI), respiratory failure requiring intubation, bradycardia, hyperkalemia, and fluid overload. She also tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) toxin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not treated promptly.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's kidney function is impaired, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and reduced urine output. ARF can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation due to respiratory failure. Prolonged mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory complications.
4. Bradycardia: The patient's slow heart rate may be secondary to hyperkalemia, beta-blocker toxicity, or an underlying sick sinus syndrome. Bradycardia can lead to reduced cardiac output and hypotension.
5. Hyperkalem"

The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by several events over the past 24 hours. The patient was initially treated with diltiazem and then loaded with amiodarone, but the medication was discontinued after a few hours. The patient also experienced intermittent hypotension, requiring the use of pressors on and off. Nebulized oxygen was stopped since Monday. The patient was diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection and started on IV Flagyl.

The patient has allergies to levofloxacin and an unknown medication. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and metronidazole.

Infusions currently being given include amiodarone at 0.5 mg/min and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications include amiodarone, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and SQ UF heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/65 mmHg to 85/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula.

   bradycardic, and hyperkalemic in the setting of ARF.
   # Sepsis:  UA c/w UTI.  Met SIRS criteria hypothermia and bandemia and
   has cornybacterium in urine.   No other culture data.
   -- f/u urine culture from BIDNH, and [**Hospital1 1**] ED, - corynebacterium in
   urine here but likely contaminant
   -- blood cultures NGTD, but sputum cultures with multiple organisms on
   gram stain, f/u culture
   -- cont broad spectrum abx w/ vanc/zosyn
 will complete course today
   -- MAPs > 60
   -- wean levophed and transition to neo if needed for MAP>60; has been
   off pressors since MN
   -- hold atenolol and Lisinopril
   #Respiratory failure:  Intubated in the setting of sepsis and for
   airway protection.
   - extubated since wednesday
   - continue to follow respiratory status
   # Bradycardia:  Likely secondary to hyperkalemia w/ peaked t waves and
   junctional bradycardia.  Also, may be secondary to atentolol toxicity
   in the setting of [**Last Name (un) 2406**].  Wouldn
t be surprised if has underlying sick
   sinus as well given advanced age.  Currently normal sinus w/o EKG
   abnormalities.
   -- hold atenolol
   -- continue potassium management as below.
   # Hyperkalemia: Now reversed with both acute membrane stabilization,
   temporary potassium shift, and resin binding.  Still mildly elevated,
   but improved
   -- Continue to follow closely w/ [**Hospital1 **] lytes, will give for K > 5.5
   -- Manage ARF as below.
   -- hold home potassium
   # [**Last Name (un) 2406**]:  Likely from volume depletion vs. secondary to pyelonephritis
   vs. ATN in the setting of hypotension (although would seem too early to
   develop.  FeNA of 0.27.  suspect some element of fluid overload vs. new
   baseline.  Will diurese w/ lasix gtt today.
   -- renally dose meds
   -- avoid nephrotoxic meds
   -- hold lisinopril

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and urosepsis presenting with altered mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia in the setting of acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI) and respiratory failure requiring intubation. She also has bradycardia, likely due to hyperkalemia and/or atenolol toxicity. The patient's hyperkalemia has been managed, and she is currently being followed closely for any changes in electrolyte levels. She is also being managed for ARF, with plans for diuresis with Lasix and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications. The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection and is starting a course of IV Flagyl. She has a history of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), but no significant changes were noted on an ECHO.

Potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has already been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to a UTI. Continued monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate management is crucial to prevent further complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status is necessary to determine if extubation is appropriate and to prevent any further respiratory complications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted with septic shock, requiring three pressors and a presumed urinary source. She has had a complicated hospital course with rapid atrial fibrillation. The patient's current condition includes C. difficile colitis, anemia, acute on chronic renal failure, and potential risks of respiratory pressure overload and right pleural effusion. She is currently receiving treatment for sepsis, C. difficile colitis, and other medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is alert and oriented. Potential complications that can arise include worsening sepsis, acute kidney injury, respiratory distress, and bleeding due to femoral arterial line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening sepsis: The patient's septic shock requires close monitoring for any signs of deterioration. If her condition worsens, she may develop further organ dysfunction or fail to respond to treatment.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and her urine output is low. Monitoring fluid balance and kidney function is crucial to prevent or manage acute kidney injury.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient has crackles at the bases of her lungs and requires supplemental oxygen. Close monitoring of her respiratory status is necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and prevent respiratory failure.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a femoral arterial line, which carries a risk of bleeding, especially if the line becomes dislodged or if the patient experiences throm"

","The patient is a 90-year-old woman who was admitted with septic shock and required three pressors. The presumed urinary source of infection has complicated the hospital course, leading to the development of rapid atrial fibrillation. The patient has also tested positive for C. difficile and is being treated with metronidazole. 

During the 24-hour period, the patient's cough when taking apple sauce led to the decision to keep her NPO (nothing by mouth). The patient's allergies include levofloxacin, with an unknown allergy. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on 01/14/2196 at 12:00 PM, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 01/17/2196 at 04:00 AM, and metronidazole on 01/17/2196 at 06:30 AM.

The patient is currently receiving various medications including Zosyn, RISS, Flagyl 500 IV q8hr, and Neutraphos. The patient has been on a lasix drip at 2 mg/hr to address decreased urine output. 

The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the presence of coughing when taking apple sauce. The flow sheet data as of 01/17/2196 at 08:47 AM shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's heart rhythm is currently"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 103/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient has been receiving various medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, and regular insulin sliding scale.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory support and altered mental status increase the risk of pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hypercoagulability due to the patient's condition increase the risk of DVT.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's pre-existing renal dysfunction and dehydration from hypernatremia can lead to AKI.
4. Wound infections: The patient's altered mental status and immobility increase the risk of developing wound infections.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on respiratory support, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
6. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of medications such as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and urosepsis. She presented with altered mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia in the setting of acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Corynebacterium. She was intubated for respiratory failure but has since been extubated. The patient also has bradycardia, which is likely secondary to hyperkalemia and may be related to atenolol toxicity. Her hyperkalemia has been reversed with acute membrane stabilization, temporary potassium shift, and resin binding. The patient is being managed for ARF, with a focus on avoiding nephrotoxic medications and using renal dosing when necessary. She is also being treated for fluid overload, C. difficile infection, and suspected ischemic heart disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued renal dysfunction: The patient's ARF needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
2. Respiratory failure: Although the patient has been extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to her underlying respiratory condition.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's bradycardia and suspected ischemic heart disease increase her risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
4. Infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of hypertension and urosepsis presenting with altered mental status, hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia in the setting of acute renal failure (ARF). She was intubated due to respiratory failure and has since been extubated. The patient has been treated for sepsis, which was likely secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI), as well as bradycardia, hyperkalemia, and fluid overload. She also tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and has been started on a 14-day course of IV flagyl. The patient has a history of diabetes and is currently on insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) - The patient's elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output indicate possible AKI. This could be due to sepsis, hypotension, or pre-existing chronic kidney disease.
2. Respiratory Failure - The patient was initially intubated due to respiratory failure and may require reintubation if her respiratory status deteriorates.
3. Cardiac Ischemia - The patient has risk factors for coronary artery disease and may be at risk for cardiac ischemia or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
4. C. difficile Infection - The patient has tested positive for C."

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Inubated for airway protection, now
   extubated.  Still on O2 via nasal cannula, persistent O2 requirement
   likely [**2-2**] volume overload.  Diuresing well.
   - Lasix gtt, transition to IV bolus dose lasix
   - Goal I/O -1 to 1.5L as markedly volume up over admission
   - Albumin to facilitate diuresis
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 Likely urosepsis, although
   cultures unrevealing.
   - s/p 8 days of Zosyn
   - Stable off of pressors since Saturday
 Acute kidney injury
 Cr elevated from baseline of 1.0, improved
   somewhat.  Avoiding nephrotoxins, diuresing, follow lytes
   - Trend lytes, volume status
   - Hypernatremia
 Follow for now, may need free water repletion with
   diuresis.
 .H/O ANEMIA
 Stool heme negative, following Hct.
   - Transfuse for Hct ~21
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 Now back in SR, has no prior history so
   will hold off on anticoagulation.
   - Holding home atenolol as bradycardic currently
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Improved
 HYPERKALEMIA
 Now resolved and hypokalemic with diuresis, repleting
 C Diff Colitis
 Will plan for 14 day course of flagyl from last day
   of Zosyn

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is sepsis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions. Here is a summary of the key points from the progress note:

1. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis and is considered to be without organ dysfunction.
2. The patient's respiratory status has improved since being extubated but still requires supplemental oxygen via a nasal cannula. There is a concern for volume overload.
3. The patient is being diuresed with Lasix to manage fluid balance and prevent further fluid accumulation.
4. The patient has acute kidney injury, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level from baseline. Measures are being taken to avoid nephrotoxins, promote diuresis, and monitor electrolyte levels and volume status.
5. The patient has anemia, and a decision will be made regarding transfusion based on the hematocrit level.
6. The patient experienced atrial fibrillation but has now returned to sinus rhythm. Anticoagulation therapy will be held off for now, and the patient's current use of atenolol will be continued.
7. The patient's mental status has improved.
8. The patient had hyperkalemia, which has since resolved due to diuresis. Repletion of potassium is necessary.
9. The patient has Clostridium difficile colitis and will be treated with a 14-day course of Flagyl starting from the last"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE
 Inubated for airway protection, now
   extubated x 2d.  Still on O2 via nasal cannula, persistent O2
   requirement likely [**2-2**] volume overload.  Diuresing well.
   - Lasix gtt, transition to IV bolus dose lasix
   - Goal I/O -1 to 1.5L as markedly volume up over admission
   - Albumin to facilitate diuresis
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 Likely urosepsis, although
   cultures unrevealing.
   - s/p 8 days of Zosyn
   - Stable off of pressors since Saturday
 Acute kidney injury
 Cr elevated from baseline of 1.0, improved
   somewhat.  Avoiding nephrotoxins, diuresing, follow lytes
   - Trend lytes, volume status
   - Hypernatremia
 Follow for now, may need free water repletion with
   diuresis.
 .H/O ANEMIA
 Stool heme negative, following Hct.
   - Transfuse for Hct ~21
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 Now back in SR, has no prior history so
   will hold off on anticoagulation.
   - Holding home atenolol as bradycardic currently
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
 Improved
 HYPERKALEMIA
 Now resolved and hypokalemic with diuresis, repleting
 C Diff Colitis
 Will plan for 14 day course of flagyl from last day
   of Zosyn
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Dysphagia diet with heavily thickened sips, still some
   concern for aspiration, nutrition consult pending

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted with septic shock requiring three pressors and a presumed urinary source. She has been complicated by rapid atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/56 mmHg to 112/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on 3L NC, and temperature of 35.8°C. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.9 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 107 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and normal glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypernatremia, anemia, atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, and Clostridium difficile colitis. She is being managed with diuresis, antibiotics, and close monitoring of her fluid and electrolyte balance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has shown persistent oxygen requirement likely due to volume overload. Continuous monitoring and treatment of respiratory status are essential to prevent further respiratory compromise.
