","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. She presents with hypotension and a critical drop in hemoglobin levels due to a right pulmonary (RP) bleed. The patient's elevated INR may be contributing to the bleed, and she has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). There is no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, and no signs of infection or hemolysis are present.

The patient also has pulmonary edema, likely caused by the transfusion of blood products. She has been given lasix, morphine, and started on nitro drip for hypertension, and her condition is improving.

Additionally, the patient has hyponatremia, which may be related to volume depletion and ongoing normal saline administration. Her urine sodium is low, and her urine osmolarity is high, supporting the hypothesis of volume depletion. The patient's sodium levels are improving with normal saline boluses.

The patient's low back pain may be related to the RP bleed, as her L-spine imaging showed a possible left pelvic mass. Narcotics have been withheld due to the patient's low blood pressure.

The patient has a coagulopathy, possibly due to her use of coumadin. Her INR is elevated, and she has received FFP and oral vitamin K. Monitoring of coagulation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. She presented with hypotension and a critical drop in hemoglobin (Hct) due to a right pubic (RP) bleed. The patient's INR was supratherapeutic, which may have contributed to the bleeding. There is no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding or infection. The patient's neurological, vascular, and renal functions are stable. However, she complains of chronic leg pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. RP Bleed: The patient has a known RP bleed seen on CT scan. Despite the elevated INR, there is no expansion of the hematoma. The patient received a transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and her Hct has improved. It is important to monitor the patient's Hct and transfuse if it falls below 25. The patient's leg pain may be related to the RP bleed.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient developed flash pulmonary edema after receiving blood products. She has bibasilar crackles on examination and decreased oxygen saturation. Lasix and morphine have been given to manage the symptoms. Close monitoring of respiratory status and fluid balance is necessary.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient's AF needs to be managed carefully. Coumadin should be held due to the bleeding and elevated INR. Metoprol"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. She presents with hypotension in the setting of a right pulmonary (RP) bleed and critical drop in hemoglobin. The patient has an elevated INR and a known RP bleed seen on CT scan. Repeat CT-scan with contrast did not show expansion of the hematoma. The patient's Hct is stable after receiving 1U pRBC. No evidence of GI bleed (guaiac negative). No fever or signs of infection. EKG is normal. Neurologically, vascularly stable in her extremities. Renal function is stable. The patient complains of chronic leg pain.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient likely experienced flash pulmonary edema after the transfusion of blood products. She was given lasix and morphine, but her O2 saturation remains decreased (89-93%).
2. Low back pain: The patient's low back pain may have been related to the RP bleed, as her L-spine imaging on admission showed a possible left pelvic mass. Narcotics will be held due to low blood pressure.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR increased on admission and continued to do so after holding her coumadin. She received 2U FFP and 10mg po vit K, and her INR is now 1.2.
4. CAD: The patient's bleeding and hypotension necessitate holding aspirin and Plavix. Statin therapy will be continued.
5. AF: Coumadin will be held in the setting of bleed and elevated INR, as well as holding toprol XL due to hypotension. Metoprolol has been started for rate control.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]F with afib and CAD; admitted with worsening of chronic back pain;
   subsequently devloped hypotension and dropping hematocrit; ultimately
   determined to have RP bleed in setting of supra-therapeutic INR.
   1.  RP Hematoma:  Her HCT is 30 this morning (increased from 23
   yesterday) and her hemodynamics are now stable.  RP bleed likely in
   setting of supratherapeutic INR as well as antiplatelet therapy (just
   recently discontinued plavix).   Unclear history of trauma. Currently
   her UOP is stable and she has an intact neurologic exam in her
   extremities.
   - Follow HCT q6-8h today, transfuse cautiously given difficulties with
   transfusions yesterday
   - Maintain peripheral access
   - Follow neurologic and peripheral vascular exam for evidence of
   expanding RP hematoma
   2.  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: related to transfusion of PRBC,
   improved with diuresis.  Currently 94% on 6L NC.  Exam with bibasilar
   crackles.  Suggestive of CHF, though did not improve substantially with
   diuresis.  Also given her afib and history of diastolic dysfunction on
   TTE, this is most likely.  TRALI a consideration given temporal
   relationship with transfusions and persistent hypoxemia despite
   diuresis.
   - Caution regarding PRBC, use judiciously.
   - Given hemodynamic stability, will aim for diuresis today
   3.  CV: CHF and afib RVR with rate from 110-130
   - Diuresis with goal body balance negative 1L today.
   - Rate control to improve LVEDP and will likely improve pulmonary edema
   - holding plavix, coumadin in setting of bleed
   - Titrate beta blocker, given IV dose of lopressor now
   - Continue statin
   3.  Heme: supratherapeutic INR
 has history of labile INR.  No clear
   source.
   - Hold coumadin, follow INR
   5.  Hyponatremia:  Corrected with improvement in intravascular volume.
   Na 135 today.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. She was admitted with worsening chronic back pain and subsequently developed hypotension and a dropping hematocrit, leading to a diagnosis of retroperitoneal bleed in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR. The patient's hemodynamics are now stable, but she continues to have poor rate control. She also has evidence of volume overload, worsening oxygenation, and hypoxemic respiratory failure potentially related to transfusion or TRALI. There is also a possibility of congestive heart failure (CHF) due to her history of diastolic dysfunction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Expanding retroperitoneal hematoma: The patient's hematocrit has increased from 23 to 30, indicating ongoing bleeding. Close monitoring is required, and transfusion should be done cautiously.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 92% on a nasal cannula, suggesting inadequate oxygenation. Diuretics have been given, but the patient did not improve substantially. TRALI is a consideration given the temporal relationship with transfusions.
3. Congestive heart failure: The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles, and her CXR shows evidence of interstitial edema with worsening overnight. CHF is likely due to her history of diastolic dysfunction.
4. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient has a history of"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **]F with afib and CAD; admitted with worsening of chronic back pain;
   subsequently devloped hypotension and dropping hematocrit; ultimately
   determined to have RP bleed in setting of supra-therapeutic INR.
   1.  RP Hematoma:  Her HCT is 30 this morning (increased from 23
   yesterday) and her hemodynamics are now stable.  RP bleed likely in
   setting of supratherapeutic INR as well as antiplatelet therapy (just
   recently discontinued plavix).   Unclear history of trauma. Currently
   her UOP is stable and she has an intact neurologic exam in her
   extremities.
   - Follow HCT q6-8h today, transfuse cautiously given difficulties with
   transfusions yesterday
   - Maintain peripheral access
   - Follow neurologic and peripheral vascular exam for evidence of
   expanding RP hematoma
   2.  Hypoxemic respiratory failure: related to transfusion of PRBC,
   improved with diuresis.  Currently 94% on 6L NC.  Exam with bibasilar
   crackles.  Suggestive of CHF, though did not improve substantially with
   diuresis.  Also given her afib and history of diastolic dysfunction on
   TTE, this is most likely.  TRALI a consideration given temporal
   relationship with transfusions and persistent hypoxemia despite
   diuresis.
   - Caution regarding PRBC, use judiciously.
   - Given hemodynamic stability, will aim for diuresis today
   3.  CV: CHF and afib RVR with rate from 110-130
   - Diuresis with goal body balance negative 1L today.
   - Rate control to improve LVEDP and will likely improve pulmonary edema
   - holding plavix, coumadin in setting of bleed
   - Titrate beta blocker, given IV dose of lopressor now
   - Continue statin
   3.  Heme: supratherapeutic INR
 has history of labile INR.  No clear
   source.
   - Hold coumadin, follow INR
   5.  Hyponatremia:  Corrected with improvement in intravascular volume.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. She was admitted for worsening chronic back pain and subsequently developed hypotension and a dropping hematocrit. The patient was diagnosed with a retroperitoneal (RP) bleed, which is likely due to a supratherapeutic INR and antiplatelet therapy. Her hemodynamics are now stable, but there is a concern for expanding RP hematoma. The patient also has hypoxemic respiratory failure, which improved with diuresis but could be related to transfusion or CHF. Additionally, the patient has congestive heart failure (CHF) and uncontrolled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Expanding RP hematoma: The patient's HCT is increasing, indicating that the bleeding may have stopped, but it is important to monitor for any signs of expanding hematoma.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is below normal levels, indicating poor oxygenation. This could be due to transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), CHF, or another underlying cause. Diuretics may help improve her condition.
3. Uncontrolled atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rate is elevated and not well-controlled. Rate control measures, such as beta-blockers, should be continued and titrated as needed.
4. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, afib on coumadin with
   supratherapeutic INR presented with hypotension in setting of RP bleed
   and crit drop.
   #. RP Bleed: Seen on CT scan.  Repeat CT-scan w/ contrast did not show
   expansion of the hematoma.  Likely in setting of elevated INR
   trauma by history. Given 2U pRBCs since admission. Hematocrit stable
   over past 24 hours. No evidence of GI bleed (guaiac neg).
   - Trend back hematocrit checks to [**Hospital1 **]; given history of CAD, transfuse
   if hematocrit drops below 25
   - Maintain [**12-31**] PIV
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - In addition to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] give IVF prn for hypotension
 given 250cc
   bolus overnight with good response
   #. Pulmonary edema, now improving: Occurred twice following transfusion
   of [**First Name3 (LF) **] products > causing flash pulmonary edema. Pt again became SOB
   after [**First Name3 (LF) **] products, improved with lasix and morphine. Diuresed very
   well with furosemide yesterday. Chest radiograph with considerable
   improvement
 slightly worse today, possible related to positioning.
   Reason unclear
 may be secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR.
   - Decrease goal for net fluid output given that patient became
   hypotensive yesterday evening after considerable diuresis
   - Closely monitor respiratory status with administration of fluids
   - Awaiting TTE to evaluate heart function, provide more clear answer
   regarding reason for flash pulmonary edema
   # AF: Continues to be tachycardic
   - Metoprolol increased to 50mg PO TID; also given IV beta-blocker 2-3x
   with minimal response
   - As beta-blocker not working well to control rate and BP running low,
   consider switch to calcium-channel blocker or adding on digoxin
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Hold anticoagulation at this time given recent RP bleed
   - Restart ASA tomorrow if hematocrit remains stable
   # Low back pain: no neurologic defecits on exam. Her low back pain may
   have been [**12-30**] this RP bleed as her L spine imaging on admission showed
   a ? left pelvic mass. Has history of chronic low back pain. Will hold
   narcotics given low [**Month/Day (2) **] pressure.
   - tylenol prn
   - oxycodone prn for break thru pain
   -cont lidoderm patch
   -cont tizanidine
   -cont gabapentin
   # Coagulopathy- Patient is on coumadin but unclear why her INR
   increased on admission and continued to do so after holding her
   coumadin. No recent antibiotics or new meds that would interfere with
   coumadin. Pt given 3U FFP and 10mg po vit K.  INR now 1.2
   - monitor coags
   # CAD: Admission EKG wnl. Given bleeding and hypotension, will hold
   asa, plavix and bp meds. Cont statin.
   # HTN: Started metoprolol for rate control.
   # Hypothyroidism: Cont levothyroxine

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. She presented with hypotension in the setting of a retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed) and critical drop in hemoglobin. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) since admission and her hematocrit has been stable over the past 24 hours. There is no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (guaiac negative). 

The patient experienced pulmonary edema twice following transfusion, causing flash pulmonary edema. She also became short of breath after receiving the same products, but improved with lasix and morphine. The patient diuresed well with furosemide yesterday. The chest radiograph showed considerable improvement in pulmonary edema. 

The patient's atrial fibrillation continues to be uncontrolled with an increased heart rate. Metoprolol was increased to 50mg PO TID, and she received IV beta-blockers with minimal response. Considering the lack of response to beta-blockers and low blood pressure, a switch to a calcium-channel blocker or adding on digoxin may be considered. 

The patient's low back pain may have been related to the RP bleed, as her L-spine imaging on admission showed a possible left pelvic mass. She has a history of chronic low back pain.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, afib on coumadin with
   supratherapeutic INR presented with hypotension in setting of RP bleed
   and crit drop.
   #. RP Bleed: Seen on CT scan.  Repeat CT-scan w/ contrast did not show
   expansion of the hematoma.  Likely in setting of elevated INR
   trauma by history. Given 2U pRBCs since admission. Hematocrit stable
   over past 24 hours. No evidence of GI bleed (guaiac neg).
   - Trend back hematocrit checks to [**Hospital1 **]; given history of CAD, transfuse
   if hematocrit drops below 25
   - Maintain [**12-31**] PIV
   - Maintain active type and screen
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - In addition to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] give IVF prn for hypotension
 given 250cc
   bolus overnight with good response
   #. Pulmonary edema, now resolved: Occurred twice following transfusion
   of [**First Name3 (LF) **] products > causing flash pulmonary edema. Pt again became SOB
   after [**First Name3 (LF) **] products, improved with lasix and morphine. Diuresed very
   well with furosemide yesterday. Chest radiograph with considerable
   improvement. Reason unclear
 may be secondary to atrial fibrillation
   with RVR.
   - Decrease goal for net fluid output given that patient became
   hypotensive yesterday evening after considerable diuresis
   - Closely monitor respiratory status with administration of fluids
   - Awaiting TTE to evaluate heart function, provide more clear answer
   regarding reason for flash pulmonary edema
   # AF: Continues to be tachycardic
   - Metoprolol increased to 50mg PO TID; also given IV beta-blocker 2-3x
   with minimal response
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Hold anticoagulation at this time given recent RP bleed
   # Low back pain: no neurologic defecits on exam. Her low back pain may
   have been [**12-30**] this RP bleed as her L spine imaging on admission showed
   a ? left pelvic mass. Has history of chronic low back pain. Will hold
   narcotics given low [**Month/Day (2) **] pressure.
   - tylenol prn
   - oxycodone prn for break thru pain
   -cont lidoderm patch
   -cont tizanidine
   -cont gabapentin
   # Coagulopathy- Patient is on coumadin but unclear why her INR
   increased on admission and continued to do so after holding her
   coumadin. No recent antibiotics or new meds that would interfere with
   coumadin. Pt given 3U FFP and 10mg po vit K.  INR now 1.2
   - monitor coags
   # CAD: EKG wnl. Given bleeding and hypotension, will hold asa, plavix
   and bp meds. Cont statin.
   # HTN: started metoprolol for rate control.  Monitor BP for hyoptension
   # Hypothyroidism: cont levothyroxine
   # FEN: begin cardiac diet, replete lytes prn
   # Access- 3 PIV
   # PPx:  protonix, pneumoboots, bowel regimen
   # Code:  Full Code, confirmed with HCP
   # Dispo: ICU level of care

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. She presented with hypotension in the setting of an RP bleed and critical drop. The patient has been given 2 units of packed red blood cells since admission, and her hematocrit has been stable over the past 24 hours. There is no evidence of GI bleed (guaiac negative).

The patient's pulmonary edema has resolved, but it occurred twice following the transfusion of blood products, causing flash pulmonary edema. She improved with lasix and morphine. Diuresis went well with furosemide yesterday. The chest radiograph showed considerable improvement. The reason for the pulmonary edema is unclear, but it may be secondary to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient continues to be tachycardic. Metoprolol was increased to 50mg PO TID, and she received IV beta-blocker 2-3 times with minimal response. She will continue to be monitored on telemetry.

The patient's low back pain may have been related to the recent RP bleed as her L-spine imaging on admission showed a left pelvic mass. She has a history of chronic low back pain. Narcotics will be held due to low blood pressure.

The patient has a coagulopathy and is on coumadin, but the reason for her increased INR on admission and continued increase after"
