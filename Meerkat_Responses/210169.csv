   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   See [**Hospital Ward Name 51**] MICU Admission/Transfer note per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 272**] [**2144-9-22**].
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient transferred back to MICU for management of A-fib with RVR.
   59 yof obese,mental retardation, lymphoma (Hodgkin's, nodular
   sclerosing) --> chemotherapy, pericardial effusion (s/p drainage, and
   s/p pericardial window [**8-18**]), remote left nephrectomy, initially
   admitted to MICU [**Hospital Ward Name 51**] service this hospitalization [**2144-9-19**] for A-fib
   with RVR.  [**Hospital1 54**] ER evaluation revealed Afib with HR 120-150, SBP= 110
   mmHg,  treatment included iv amiodarone bolus, iv fluid bolus, and
   beta-blocker.  Transferred to MICU service, and noted to be in NSR.
   Following brief observation period, transferred to BMT service.
   This AM,while on  BMT service noted to be in A-fib with HR >150, SBP 95
   mmHg.  Received iv fluid boluses total 1 L, Lopressor 5 mg x3,
   Lopressor 25 mg PO x1 and Amiodarone 200 mg PO x1 without change in
   HR.  Now transferred to MICU service for further evaluation and
   management.
   Recent prolonged [**Hospital1 54**] hospitalization [**Date range (1) 4222**] complicated by
   recurrent A-fibrillation and RVR, treated with Amiodarone and

   Assessment and Plan
   Paroxysmal Atrial-fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
   A-FIB -- Recurrent, paroxysmal.  Likely attributable to local
   irritation (bloody pericardial effusion/inflammation, pericardial
   mass/adenopathy).  Cardiology Consultation.  Plan to resume amiodarone
   load to complete, then resume.  Prior poor control may be related to
   unreliable GI tract and variable absorption of medications (ileus).
   Monitor HR, aim for HR<120 and normotensive BP.  r/o MI protocol.
   Monitor for new infection in context of neutropenia.
   PLEURAL EFFUSIONS -- no evidence for new acute infiltrate.  Possible
   related to pericaridal effusion vs. inflammatory effusions related to
   malignancy.
   HYPOTENSION -- Transient, and resonsive to iv fluid challenges.  Likely
   related to medication administration.  Continue iv fluid boluses to
   maintain MAP >60.
   LYMPHOMA, Hodgkin's -- s/p chemotherapy.  Monitor.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- ?malignant; s/p pericardial window.   No
   evidence for pericardial effusion reaccumulation.
   NEUTROPENIA -- s/p chemotherapy.  Monitor.
   ILEUS -- chronic.  Monitor.
   C. Diff -- completed therapeutic course.  Currently on PO vanco.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old obese male with mental retardation and a history of lymphoma (Hodgkin's nodular sclerosing type), who was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient had previous admissions for the same condition and received treatment with amiodarone and beta-blocker. He also has a history of pericardial effusion, which was drained and a pericardial window was placed. Other medical history includes left nephrectomy and chemotherapy for lymphoma. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation, there is a potential for recurrent arrhythmias.
2. Pericardial effusion and tamponade: Although the patient has had a pericardial window placed, there is still a risk of reaccumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac, which can lead to tamponade.
3. Infection: As the patient is immunocompromised due to chemotherapy, he is at increased risk for infections, including pneumonia and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
4. Hypotension: The patient's transient hypotension may be related to medication administration or sepsis.
5. Neutropenia: The patient's low white blood cell count increases the risk of infections.
6. Ileus: The patient"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 59-year-old male with mental retardation, who was recently diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma and underwent chemotherapy. He is currently admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which was previously responsive to intravenous fluids (IVF) boluses. However, this time it is unclear what precipitated the atrial fibrillation. The patient is afebrile, but there may be a component of dehydration as a precipitant. The plan is to appreciate cardiology input and administer IV amiodarone 150 mg infusion over 20 minutes, watching for hypotension and bradycardia. IVF boluses will be given as needed, and medications such as Lasix, metoprolol, and amiodarone will be held.

The patient also has a history of hemopericardium, which was moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade. An echocardiogram (ECHO) on 9/21 showed a smaller effusion without tamponade physiology. The plan is to continue monitoring vital signs and consider repeat ECHO if the patient's vital signs become deranged.

Other medical issues include neutropenia, a possible left upper lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, lymphoma, urinary tract infection (UTI), anemia, right upper limb deep vein thrombosis ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with mental retardation, who has been diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma and recently underwent chemotherapy. He was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's recent medical history includes neutropenia, a possible left upper lobe infiltrate, hemopericardium, urinary tract infection, anemia, right upper limb deep vein thrombosis, ileus, Clostridium difficile infection, herpes simplex virus oral ulcer, and febrile neutropenia.

Current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 108/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient has mild distention and soft, non-tender bowel sounds. There is mild edema at the ankles and widespread petechiae. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated magnesium, and potassium levels within normal range. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Plan:
1. Atrial fibrillation: The cause of atrial fibrillation is unclear, possibly due to pneumonia. The patient has converted to sinus rhythm overnight with amiodarone. Cardiology input is appreciated. IV amiodarone will"

   Recurrent A-fib with rapid ventricular response.
   A-FIBRILLATION -- recurrent.  Multifactorial.  Improved response to
   current medications.  Await final recommendation per Cardiology for
   continued pharmacological regimen.  Check EKG.  Continue metoprolol.
   LYMPHOMA --  s/p chemotherapy.  Assess plans for additional chemorx.
   NEUTROPENIA -- recent chemotherapy.  Maintain precautions.  Monitor
   WBC.  Continue GM-CSF.
   C. Diff -- continue Vanco PO to complete course.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, mild.  Improved with resussitation over past 24
   hrs.  Follow I/O.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- bloody s/p drainage and pericardial window.  No
   significant reaccumulation by ECHO.
   PLEURAL EFFUSIONS -- possibly related to lymphoma, pericardial disease
   vs. transudative.
   ILEUS -- chronic.  Will influence PO medications to control a-fib.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 24-year-old male with mental retardation, admitted to the ICU for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has a history of lymphoma, which was treated with chemotherapy. He also experienced neutropenia after chemotherapy and is currently on GM-CSF to stimulate white blood cell production. The patient had an episode of Clostridium difficile infection, for which he is receiving vancomycin orally. He is also being treated for hypovolemia and pericardial effusion. Additionally, the patient has chronic ileus.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within the normal range, but slightly elevated due to the ongoing administration of amiodarone. His blood pressure is within normal limits, respiratory rate is stable, and oxygen saturation is good. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress or abnormalities.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly decreased platelet count. His electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, except for a low magnesium level. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, and calcium are within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes continuing metoprolol for rate control, assessing further treatment options for lymphoma, monitoring white blood cell count and maintaining precautions for neutropenia, completing vancomycin course for C. difficile infection, managing fluids"

   Assessment and Plan
   Recurrent A-fib with rapid ventricular response.
   A-FIBRILLATION -- recurrent.  Multifactorial.  Improved response to
   current medications.  Await final recommendation per Cardiology for
   continued pharmacological regimen.  Check EKG.  Continue metoprolol.
   LYMPHOMA --  s/p chemotherapy.  Assess plans for additional chemorx.
   NEUTROPENIA -- recent chemotherapy.  Maintain precautions.  Monitor
   WBC.  Continue GM-CSF.
   C. Diff -- continue Vanco PO to complete course.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, mild.  Improved with resussitation over past 24
   hrs.  Follow I/O.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- bloody s/p drainage and pericardial window.  No
   significant reaccumulation by ECHO.
   PLEURAL EFFUSIONS -- possibly related to lymphoma, pericardial disease
   vs. transudative.
   ILEUS -- chronic.  Will influence PO medications to control a-fib.

","The patient in the ICU is experiencing tachycardia and has a history of mental retardation. They have been diagnosed with recurrent atrial fibrillation, lymphoma, neutropenia, Clostridium difficile infection, hypovolemia, pericardial effusion, pleural effusions, and ileus. The patient is currently on various medications including amiodarone, metoprolol, vancomycin, and GM-CSF. They also have a PICC line inserted for medication administration. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 114/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's lab results show normal levels of hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolytes. However, the patient's lymphocyte count is elevated at 90%, indicating possible immune compromise due to recent chemotherapy for lymphoma. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of recurrent atrial fibrillation and current use of amiodarone suggest a risk for arrhythmias.
2. Infection: The presence of Clostridium difficile infection indicates a risk for further infections, particularly in an immunocompromised patient.
3. Bleeding: The low platelet count and prolonged PTT may increase the risk of bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation who was recently diagnosed with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma and underwent chemotherapy. She was readmitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3 C (97.4 F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/48 to 193/151 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination findings are incomplete, with assessments not performed on peripheral vascular pulses, skin, neurologic status, and others. Lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine levels. The patient is on multiple medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, amiodarone, lasix, metoprolol, cefepime, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and others. The patient has several medical complications, including atrial fibrillation, neutropenia, possible left upper lobe infiltrate, hemopericardium, lymphoma, urinary tract infection (UTI), anemia, right upper limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ileus/abdominal distention, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, herpes simplex virus (HSV) oral ulcer, and others. The patient's care plan includes managing atrial fibrillation, neutropenia, possible left upper lobe infiltrate, hemopericardium, lymphoma, UTI, anemia, DVT, ileus/abdominal distention, C. diff infection, HSV oral ulcer, and nutrition, glycemic control, and line care. The patient's code status is intubate but no compressions, and her disposition is in the ICU."
