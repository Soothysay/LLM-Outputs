   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of paraplegia and chronic bladder dysfunction, who was admitted for elective procedures including stent replacement and lithotripsy. She presented with urosepsis and pyelonephritis, and was found to be febrile, hypotensive, and tachypneic in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (ampicillin and gentamicin) and transferred to the ICU.

In the ICU, her condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in blood pressure and a drop in blood pressure this morning. She received a bolus of normal saline IV fluids, which temporarily improved her condition. She remains hypotensive and tachycardic, with a fever. Her respiratory status is stable on low-flow oxygen via nasal cannula, but she is somnolent and has small volumes of breath sounds.

Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 22.8 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Her blood cultures are pending. Imaging studies are also pending.

The patient's medical history includes paraplegia, chronic bladder dysfunction, an IVC filter, toricollis, neurogenic bladder, and bipolar disorder. She has ongoing pain from kidney stones and chronic CO"

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of motor vehicle accident, who was admitted previously for pyelonephritis and had a urethral stent placed. She was readmitted for an elective cystoscopy and right retrograde ureteroscopy with stent placement. During the procedure, there was frank pus drainage, leading to urosepsis. The patient is currently experiencing low blood pressure, fever, and elevated white blood cell count. She has been treated with antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation, but her blood pressure remains low and the white blood cell count continues to increase.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury due to pyelonephritis and indwelling hardware.
2. Respiratory acidosis and hypercapnea due to CO2 retention.
3. Anemia with a hematocrit level of 29%, which is lower than the baseline of 34%.
4. Potential development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility.
5. Stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of corticosteroids.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Sepsis and septic shock if the infection spreads and becomes systemic.
8. Potential need for dialysis if the kidney injury progresses.
9. Chronic pain and spastic paralysis due to the toricollis.
10. Possibility of kidney stone removal if the current treatment fails."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 29-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for urosepsis. She has a history of a motor vehicle accident, toricollis, recent admission with pyelonephritis, and treatment with ciprofloxacin. The patient was readmitted for elective cystoscopy and right retrograde ureteroscopy with stent placement. During the procedure, she experienced fever, hypotension, and tachycardia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 67/41 mmHg to 137/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress but appears anxious.

Physical examination findings include corneal abrasion, normal cardiovascular examination, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities, and altered mental status with agitation. Neurological examination reveals attentive behavior, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and potassium levels. Urine analysis reveals yellow hazy appearance, pH 5.0, presence of leukocytes and bacteria, and significant growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has urosepsis due to pyelonephritis complicated by an indwelling urethral stent. She is being treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime to cover for Pseudomonas infection. The patient's hypotension and tachycardia require aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. Blood cultures are pending, and antibiotic therapy will be adjusted based on sensitivities.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of urosepsis can progress to sepsis if not adequately managed. Prompt and appropriate antibiotic therapy is crucial to prevent further complications.

2. Organ Dysfunction: Urosepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, particularly in the kidneys, lungs, and liver. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and organ function is necessary to detect any deterioration.

3. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressors may indicate inadequate tissue perfusion or septic shock. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and adjusting the vasopressor infusion rate are important to maintain adequate organ perfusion.

4. Acute Kidney Injury: The presence of pyelonephritis and indwelling hardware increases the risk of acute kidney injury. Regular assessment of renal function and close monitoring of urine output are essential.

5. Pseudomonas Infection: P"

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of paraplegia and chronic bladder dysfunction, who was admitted for an elective procedure to replace a right ureteral stent and undergo lithotripsy. However, the patient developed post-procedure urosepsis.

24-hour events include the placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, initiation of levophed for hypotension, and weaning off eventually. The patient also experienced ectopic beats, specifically nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). A urine culture revealed pseudomonas infection, and blood cultures are pending.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/99 mmHg to 71/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 87%. The patient is receiving norepinephrine infusion at a rate of 0.01 mcg/kg/min.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 5,167 mL, output of 3,365 mL, and a balance of 1,802 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a nasal cannula, with an oxygen saturation of 87%.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished but anxious and torticolis. Her cardiovascular examination is normal, with no"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of paraplegia and chronic bladder dysfunction. She was admitted for an elective procedure to replace a right ureteral stent and undergo lithotripsy. However, she developed post-procedure urosepsis.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include:
1. Urosepsis: The patient has a confirmed growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in her urine culture, which suggests an infection that has spread through her bloodstream. This condition is known as urosepsis.
2. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and an elevated respiratory rate. Additionally, her blood culture is pending, indicating the presence of a suspected infection.
3. Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities: The patient has ectopy, which refers to abnormal heart rhythms. She also experienced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), a type of fast heart rhythm. These findings suggest possible cardiac involvement due to the infection or other factors such as electrolyte imbalances.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an immune response to the infection.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, suggesting anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
6. Respiratory issues: The patient's arterial"

   febrile and hypotensive.
   # Urosepsis: Purulent drainage uring ureteroscopy and stent
   replacement, w/ fever, hypotension, and tachycardia following urologic
   manipulation. Acute urosepsis likely cause from transient bacteremia.
   Treatment geared towards acute pyelonephritis complicated w/ an
   indwelling hardware.  Had required pressor supported with dopamine,
   then levophed once access estabilshed.  Able to ween off pressors
   within 12 hrs.  SBP still marginal yessterday in the low 90s, requiring
   1.5L of fluid boluses.  Have been stable w/ SBP > 100 throughout
   afternoon and evening.  Patient was asx.
   -- f/u urine Cx sensitivities.  Cx showed pseudamonas, ecoli,
   enterococcus.  Cont vac/ceftaz, switch from ceftaz to sozyn if
   clincially worsens.  If enterococcus amp switch to amp/gent.
   -- f/u blood cx and sensitivities
   -- coverage w/ vanc/ceftaz until culture data returns
   -- tylenol for fever
   -- continue to monitor pressures, patient's blood pressure currently
   stable w/ aggressive fluid recessitation and off pressors. Fluid
   boluses PRN hypotension
   #VT/SVT w/ aberancy:  not adequatly captured on EKG, but appears more
   like VT.  Electroytes repleated, PICC in SVC, taken off leophed d/c

   disease.  Likely cardiac irradbility [**12-23**] to hypoxia, pressors, sepsis,
   or lyte abnormality.  Continue to monitor on telemetry.
   # Toricollus:
   -- continue patients outpatient baclofen for spastic paralysis.
   -- continue outpatient gabapentin / methadone for pain
   -- continue tizanidine
   #Anemia:  Iron studies c/w anemia of chronic disease, maybe from
   smolerding pyelonephritis.  Hc down to 24 from baseline of 32.  Will
   check PM Hct and hemolysis labs.
   # Kidney stone: had to abort lithotripsy [**12-23**] to pyenonephritis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 29-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with urosepsis. She underwent a medical procedure for a urinary tract issue and developed fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient required pressor support with dopamine and levophed but was able to wean off within 12 hours. Her blood pressure remained stable with aggressive fluid resuscitation and off pressors. 

The patient has a history of trauma (MVA) and recent admission for pyelonephritis. She also had a previous urinary tract infection that resulted in pus drainage during ureteroscopy and stent replacement. The patient's urine culture showed growth of Enterococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and ceftazidime. 

The patient experienced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) with aberrancy, which resolved with electrolyte repletion and removal of the right internal jugular line. An echocardiogram showed no structural heart disease. The patient is also being treated for anemia, toricollis, and kidney stones. 

The patient's vital signs have been stable, and she is currently on regular diet and insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. She has multiple IV lines, including a PICC line, and is receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein throm"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 29-year-old female with a chief complaint of urosepsis. She has been admitted to the ICU for acute pyelonephritis complicated by indwelling hardware. The patient underwent urethral stent placement and treatment with ciprofloxacin, followed by readmission for elective cystoscopy, right retrograde ureteroscopy, and right stent placement. During the procedure, she experienced frank pus drainage, becoming febrile and hypotensive.

The patient has a history of motor vehicle accident (MVA), toricollis, recent admission with pyelonephritis, and previous treatment with ciprofloxacin. She is currently experiencing urosepsis due to transient bacteremia following urologic manipulation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 81-134 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 100/51 to 125/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, anxiety, and no diaphoresis. Notable findings include toricollis, clear breath sounds, warm skin, and attentive behavior with uncooperative examination.

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for urosepsis. She had a history of pyelonephritis and underwent urethral stent placement. The patient's condition worsened after undergoing elective cystoscopy, right retrograde ureteroscopy, and right stent placement. She presented with fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The patient required pressor support with dopamine and levophed, but was able to wean off pressors within 12 hours. Her blood pressure remained stable throughout the afternoon and evening. The patient's urine culture showed the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus species. She was started on vancomycin, cefazidime, and sozyn, with plans to switch from cefazidime to sozyn if there is clinical worsening. If the Enterococcus is sensitive to ampicillin, vancomycin can be discontinued. The patient's blood culture results are pending. She received Tylenol for fever and continued to be monitored for pressures. The patient's electrolytes were repleted, and she was taken off leophed with resolution of the VT/SVT with these measures. A TTE showed no structural heart disease. The patient's toricollis is likely due to spastic paralysis, and she will continue outpatient baclofen for this condition. She also"

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of paraplegia and chronic bladder dysfunction. She was admitted for an elective procedure to replace a right ureteral stent and undergo lithotripsy. However, she developed post-procedure urosepsis and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient initially presented with urosepsis but has been stable for over 24 hours without the need for pressor support.
2. Kidney Stones: The patient has a history of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) and currently has a stent in place. Urology input is pending regarding the plan of lithotripsy, which will determine the length of her course.
3. Cardiac Ectopy: The patient experienced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) that resolved with the cessation of pressors. There may be irritable myocardium in the setting of infection, hypoxia, and removal of the nasal cannula.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is improving with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, likely due to dilutional effects from intravenous fluids. Iron studies indicate chronic deficiency, possibly related to infection, and will be monitored.
6. Respiratory Issues: The patient has chronic CO2 retention"

","Summary:
The patient is a 29-year-old female with a history of paraplegia and chronic bladder dysfunction. She was admitted for an elective procedure to replace a ureteral stent and undergo lithotripsy. However, she developed post-procedure urosepsis and is currently being treated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient is currently stable off pressor support after more than 24 hours. However, there is a risk of developing sepsis with organ dysfunction if the infection spreads to other organs.
2. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient experienced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) which resolved with the cessation of pressors and supplemental electrolytes. She also had occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) on the monitor. There is a risk of further cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's irritable myocardium, infection, and hypoxia.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which is improving with appropriate antibiotic therapy. Close monitoring of white blood cell counts is necessary to ensure that the infection is being effectively treated.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, likely due to a dilutional component caused by intravenous fluids. There is no evidence of bleeding, but iron studies indicate chronic dysfunction possibly related to infection. Repeat hematologic tests should be conducted today to assess"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P Pt is a 29 y/o female s/p MVA, toricollus, recent admit w/
   pyelonephritis w/ placement of urethral stent and treatment w/
   amp/gent-->cipro, readmitted for elective cystoscopy, right retrograde
   ureteroscopy and right stent placement, w/ frank pus drainage, becoming
   febrile and hypotensive.
   # Urosepsis: Purulent drainage uring ureteroscopy and stent
   replacement, w/ fever, hypotension, and tachycardia following urologic
   manipulation. Acute urosepsis likely cause from transient bacteremia.
   Treatment geared towards acute pyelonephritis complicated w/ an
   indwelling hardware.  Patient was hypotensive yesterday, started on
   dopamine, then switched to levo once access established.  Pressures in
   80s overnight while off pressors, so restarted.  Now off pressors, w/
   SBP in mid 90s, patient asx.
   -- f/u urine Cx showing pseudamononas, ecoli, enterococcus.  Cont
   vanc/ceftaz, switch from ceftaz to zosyn in clinically worsens.  If
   enterococcus amp sensitive, can d/c vanc.
   -- f/u blood cx and sensitivities
   -- tylenol for fever
   -- continue to monitor pressures, patient's blood pressure currently
   stable w/ aggressive fluid recessitation and off  pressors.  [**Month (only) 60**] need
   to add pressors back on if remains < 90 systolic.
   #VT/SVT w/ abarency: not not adequatly captured on EKG, appears more
   like VT.  Electroyletes repleated, PICC in SVC, taken off levophed, CE
   sent.  Resolved w/ these measures.  Patient asx throughout episodes,
   adequate mentation and pulse.  Getting an Echo to evaluate for
   structural heart disease, especially given patients low O2 sats and
   hypercapnea on ABG.
   # Toricollus:
   -- continue patients outpatient baclofen for spastic paralysis.
   -- continue outpatient gabapentin / methadone for pain
   -- continue tizanidine
   # Kidney stone: had to abort lithotripsy [**12-23**] to pyenonephritis.
   continue to monitor to see if needs increased medication for pain

","The patient is a 29-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with urosepsis. She had previously undergone a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and was treated for pyelonephritis with antibiotics. She was readmitted for an elective cystoscopy, right retrograde ureteroscopy, and right stent placement. During the procedure, she experienced frank pus drainage, fever, hypotension, and tachycardia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 108/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. She is in sinus rhythm and has no acute distress.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,740 mL and total output of 3,610 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -870 mL. She is receiving IV fluids, including heparin sodium as prophylaxis, and lorazepam (Ativan) for sedation.

Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 22.8 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, and low platelet count of 92 K/uL. Other lab values include elevated lactate levels, elevated troponin-T levels, and abnormal kidney function tests.
