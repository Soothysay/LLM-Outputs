   100% RCA and w/ cardiogenic shock requiring IABP.
   24 Hour Events:
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2136-11-3**] 09:30 AM:  The left atrium is
   dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
   ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free
   wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve
   stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with moderate global left ventricular
   hypokinesis. The inferior wall is nearly akinetic. Mild mitral and
   aortic regurgitation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old male who presented with a STEMI from OSH and was found to have 90% blockage in the left main artery and 100% blockage in the right coronary artery. He required an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) due to cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent stenting in the left main artery and was deemed a non-operative candidate.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/56 mmHg to 91/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, and he is taking various medications including heparin sodium, captopril, acetaminophen, clopidogrel, allopurinol, donepezil, fexofenadine, citalopram, fluticasone, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, aluminum-magnesium hydroxide-simethicone, atorvastatin, aspirin, and others.

The echocardiogram showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 30-35%, mild dilatation of the left ventricular cavity, and"
