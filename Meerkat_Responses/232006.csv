   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 62M with inclusion body myositis on prednisone who presents
   with altered mental status and was found to have nonconvulsive status
   epilepticus, now resolved as well as pancreatitis and hyperglycemia.
   .
   1. Altered mental status, s/p seizure
   Most likely multifactorial; patient post-ictal, dehydrated, with
   hyperglycemia and acute renal failure. Meningitis seems much less
   likely - no significant fevers, but may be masked with steroids.
   Reassuringly tube4 wbc is <5 (note tap was traumatic). Note that
   antibiotics given in ED may lead to falsely negative CSF cultures. No
   evidence of new CVA on CT head. Multiple possible precipitants for this
   patient's seizure, including acidosis, hyperglycemia, electrolyte
   imbalance.
   - Ok to continue ceftriaxone 2g q12, vancomycin 1g q12, and acyclovir.
   Given age would also add ampicillin 2g q4. Continue abx until CSF
   cultures negative x48 hrs. Continue acyclovir pending HSV PCR.
   - Check urine culture in addition to blood cultures
   - LP when stabilized include HSV PCR
   - MRI head per neuro
   - Continuous EEG
   - Continue home Keppra for now
   - Dilantin level in AM, check Keppra level per neuro recs
   - Neuro recommendations appreciated
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes, ASA daily (no bleed on CT scan), monitor on
   telemetry
   .
   2. Pancreatitis
   [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] score is 3 (Age, Glucose, LDH) predicting 15-20%
   mortality -- however interpretation more complicated as steroids likely
   contributing to hyperglycemia. Prelim CT shows no evidence of abscess
   or significant pancreatic necrosis however. Precipitant uncertain-- No
   history of recent EtoH intake. Calcium within normal limits, no
   evidence of gallstone disease. Thiazides have been associated with
   pancreatitis but seems less compelling. His labs show evidence of
   significant volume depletion with hemoconcentration and acute renal
   failure.
   - volume resuscitation with NS
   - NGT, NPO
   - check triglycerides in AM
   - follow up CT read
   .
   3. Hyperglycemia
   Patient not known to be a diabetic - though given his habitus may well
   have been glucose intolerant and tipped over by recent prednisone.
   Acute pancreatitis could be contributory as well.
   - IVF to maintain good urine output
   - q1hr fingersticks, insulin drip as persistently hyperglycemic post
   IVF
   .
   4. Elevated lactate
   Most likely secondary to volume depletion, but also need to rule out
   infection. [**Month (only) 8**] also relate to recent seizure.
   - Repeat lactate, check ABG
   - Culturing and abx as above
   - IVF as above
   .
   5. Acidosis
   Patient with gap acidosis, most likely secondary to elevated lactate,
   also may have contribution from renal failure.
   - ABG as above
   .
   6. Acute renal failure
   Very likely secondary to pre-renal state from dehydration; his marked
   hyperglycemia would lead to osmotic diuresis. No history of hypotension
   to suggest ATN.
   - Check urine electrolytes
   - Follow Cr
   - Hold home HCTZ
   .
   7. Hypernatremia
   Sodium at admission falsely in normal range 2/2 marked hyperglycemia.
   Free water deficit ~8L at admission.
   - needed initial volume resuscitation with saline as intravascularly
   deplete
   - follow Na q4 hrs
   - will start 1/2NS @250/hr
   .
   8. Hypertension
   Holding home HCTZ in setting of dehydration. Will resume amlodipine if
   hypertensive.
   .
   9. Inclusion body myositis
   Following neuro recs
   - Discuss weaning steroids or alternative to steroids with neurology
   - Stress dose steroids if develops hypotension

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of inclusion body myositis who presented with altered mental status and was found to have nonconvulsive status epilepticus, pancreatitis, and hyperglycemia. The patient's condition is complex and involves several medical complications. 

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is most likely multifactorial, post-ictal, dehydrated, with hyperglycemia and acute renal failure. Meningitis seems less likely without significant fevers, but may be masked with steroids.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis with a Ranson score of 3 predicting a mortality rate of 15-20%. The cause of pancreatitis is uncertain, and steroids may contribute to hyperglycemia.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, possibly due to recent prednisone use and acute pancreatitis. 

4. Elevated lactate: The patient has elevated lactate levels, which could be secondary to volume depletion or infection.

5. Acidosis: The patient has acidosis, likely due to elevated lactate and renal failure.

6. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to pre-renal state from dehydration.

7. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia with a free water deficit of approximately 8 liters at admission.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 62M with inclusion body myositis on prednisone who presents
   with altered mental status and was found to have nonconvulsive status
   epilepticus, now resolved as well as pancreatitis and hyperglycemia.
   .
   1. Altered mental status, s/p seizure
   Most likely multifactorial; patient post-ictal, dehydrated, with
   hyperglycemia and acute renal failure. Meningitis seems much less
   likely - no significant fevers, but may be masked with steroids.
   Reassuringly tube4 wbc is <5 (note tap was traumatic). Note that
   antibiotics given in ED may lead to falsely negative CSF cultures. No
   evidence of new CVA on CT head. Multiple possible precipitants for this
   patient's seizure, including acidosis, hyperglycemia, electrolyte
   imbalance.
   - Ok to continue ceftriaxone 2g q12, vancomycin 1g q12, and acyclovir.
   Given age would also add ampicillin 2g q4. Continue abx until CSF
   cultures negative x48 hrs. Continue acyclovir pending HSV PCR.
   - Check urine culture in addition to blood cultures
   - LP when stabilized include HSV PCR
   - MRI head per neuro scheduled for today
   - Continuous EEG
   - Continue home Keppra
   - continue dilantin today, check Keppra level per neuro recs
   - Neuro recommendations appreciated
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes, ASA daily (no bleed on CT scan), monitor on
   telemetry-of note patient did have elevated troponins in previous
   notes.  This may represent demand ischemia.
   .
   2. Pancreatitis
   [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] score is 3 (Age, Glucose, LDH) predicting 15-20%
   mortality -- however interpretation more complicated as steroids likely
   contributing to hyperglycemia. Prelim CT shows no evidence of abscess
   or significant pancreatic necrosis however. Precipitant uncertain-- No
   history of recent EtoH intake. Calcium within normal limits, no
   evidence of gallstone disease. Thiazides have been associated with
   pancreatitis but seems less compelling. His labs show evidence of
   significant volume depletion with hemoconcentration and acute renal
   failure.  Serum neg for EtOH and ggt negative making EtOH unlikely.
   - volume resuscitation with NS
   - NGT, NPO
   - Triglycerides pending
   - follow up CT read
   -Get RUQ US to evaluate for non-radiopaque stones
   .
   3. Hyperglycemia
   Patient not known to be a diabetic - though given his habitus may well
   have been glucose intolerant and tipped over by recent prednisone.
   Acute pancreatitis could be contributory as well. A1c 9.9, so likely
   undiagnosed diabetes
   - IVF to maintain good urine output
   - q1hr fingersticks, insulin drip as persistently hyperglycemic post
   IVF
   - [**Last Name (un) **] consult
   - will need standing insulin recs when able to come off drip
   .
   4. Elevated lactate
   Most likely secondary to volume depletion, but also need to rule out
   infection. [**Month (only) 8**] also relate to recent seizure.
   - Repeat lactate normal
   - Culturing and abx as above
   - IVF as above
   .
   5. Acidosis
   Patient with gap acidosis, most likely secondary to elevated lactate,
   also may have contribution from renal failure.
   - ABG as above
   .
   6. Acute renal failure
   Very likely secondary to pre-renal state from dehydration; his marked
   hyperglycemia would lead to osmotic diuresis. No history of hypotension
   to suggest ATN.
   - Check urine electrolytes-FENA 2.6, after aggressive rehydration, but
   clinically prerenal
   - Follow Cr-currently at baseline
   - Hold home HCTZ in setting of rehydration
   .
   7. Hypernatremia
   Sodium at admission falsely in normal range 2/2 marked hyperglycemia.
   Free water deficit ~8L at admission.
   - needed initial volume resuscitation with saline as intravascularly
   deplete
   - follow Na q4 hrs
   - continue D5W for another 4 hours, if no change in sodium, will begin
   free water boluses via NG
   .
   8. Hypertension
   Holding home HCTZ in setting of dehydration. Will resume amlodipine if
   hypertensive.
   .
   9. Inclusion body myositis
   Following neuro recs
   - Discuss weaning steroids or alternative to steroids with neurology
   - Stress dose steroids if develops hypotension

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of inclusion body myositis who presented with altered mental status and was found to have nonconvulsive status epilepticus, now resolved. He also has pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, acidosis, and hypertension. The patient's condition is multifactorial, with possible precipitants including dehydration, hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, and possibly masked fever due to steroids. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, acyclovir, and insulin drip. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: Although less likely, it cannot be completely ruled out, especially considering the use of steroids which may mask significant fevers.
2. Rejection of kidney transplant: The patient's acute renal failure requires further evaluation and management to prevent any complications related to kidney function.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Given the patient's undiagnosed diabetes and hyperglycemia, there is a risk of developing DKA, especially if the hyperglycemia persists.
4. Pancreatitis complications: The patient's pancreatitis may lead to complications such as abscess formation or pancreatic necrosis, which should be monitored closely.
5. Seizure recurrence: Although the nonconvulsive status epilepticus has been resolved, the patient is still at risk for future seizures, and continuous EEG monitoring is recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 62M with inclusion body myositis on prednisone who presents
   with altered mental status and was found to have nonconvulsive status
   epilepticus, now resolved as well as pancreatitis and hyperglycemia.
   .
   1. Altered mental status, s/p seizure
   Most likely multifactorial; patient post-ictal, dehydrated, with
   hyperglycemia and acute renal failure. Meningitis seems much less
   likely - no significant fevers, but may be masked with steroids.
   Reassuringly tube4 wbc is <5 (note tap was traumatic). Note that
   antibiotics given in ED may lead to falsely negative CSF cultures. No
   evidence of new CVA on CT head. Multiple possible precipitants for this
   patient's seizure, including acidosis, hyperglycemia, electrolyte
   imbalance.
   - Ok to continue ceftriaxone 2g q12, vancomycin 1g q12, and acyclovir.
   Given age would also add ampicillin 2g q4. Continue abx until CSF
   cultures negative x48 hrs. Continue acyclovir pending HSV PCR.
   - Check urine culture in addition to blood cultures
   - LP when stabilized include HSV PCR
   - MRI head per neuro scheduled for today
   - Continuous EEG
   - Continue home Keppra
   - continue dilantin today, check Keppra level per neuro recs
   - Neuro recommendations appreciated
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes, ASA daily (no bleed on CT scan), monitor on
   telemetry-of note patient did have elevated troponins in previous
   notes.  This may represent demand ischemia.
   .
   2. Pancreatitis
   [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] score is 3 (Age, Glucose, LDH) predicting 15-20%
   mortality -- however interpretation more complicated as steroids likely
   contributing to hyperglycemia. Prelim CT shows no evidence of abscess
   or significant pancreatic necrosis however. Precipitant uncertain-- No
   history of recent EtoH intake. Calcium within normal limits, no
   evidence of gallstone disease. Thiazides have been associated with
   pancreatitis but seems less compelling. His labs show evidence of
   significant volume depletion with hemoconcentration and acute renal
   failure.  Serum neg for EtOH and ggt negative making EtOH unlikely.
   - volume resuscitation with NS
   - NGT, NPO
   - Triglycerides pending
   - follow up CT read
   -Get RUQ US to evaluate for non-radiopaque stones
   .
   3. Hyperglycemia
   Patient not known to be a diabetic - though given his habitus may well
   have been glucose intolerant and tipped over by recent prednisone.
   Acute pancreatitis could be contributory as well. A1c 9.9, so likely
   undiagnosed diabetes
   - IVF to maintain good urine output
   - q1hr fingersticks, insulin drip as persistently hyperglycemic post
   IVF
   - [**Last Name (un) **] consult
   - will need standing insulin recs when able to come off drip
   .
   4. Elevated lactate
   Most likely secondary to volume depletion, but also need to rule out
   infection. [**Month (only) 8**] also relate to recent seizure.
   - Repeat lactate normal
   - Culturing and abx as above
   - IVF as above
   .
   5. Acidosis
   Patient with gap acidosis, most likely secondary to elevated lactate,
   also may have contribution from renal failure.
   - ABG as above
   .
   6. Acute renal failure
   Very likely secondary to pre-renal state from dehydration; his marked
   hyperglycemia would lead to osmotic diuresis. No history of hypotension
   to suggest ATN.
   - Check urine electrolytes-FENA 2.6, after aggressive rehydration, but
   clinically prerenal
   - Follow Cr-currently at baseline
   - Hold home HCTZ in setting of rehydration
   .
   7. Hypernatremia
   Sodium at admission falsely in normal range 2/2 marked hyperglycemia.
   Free water deficit ~8L at admission.
   - needed initial volume resuscitation with saline as intravascularly
   deplete
   - follow Na q4 hrs
   - continue D5W for another 4 hours, if no change in sodium, will begin
   free water boluses via NG
   .
   8. Hypertension
   Holding home HCTZ in setting of dehydration. Will resume amlodipine if
   hypertensive.
   .
   9. Inclusion body myositis
   Following neuro recs
   - Discuss weaning steroids or alternative to steroids with neurology
   - Stress dose steroids if develops hypotension

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of inclusion body myositis, who presented with altered mental status and was found to have nonconvulsive status epilepticus. He also has pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, acidosis, elevated lactate, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and hypertension. The patient is currently in the ICU, where he is receiving various treatments and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to multiple factors such as post-ictal state, dehydration, hyperglycemia, and acute renal failure. Meningitis seems less likely, but may be masked by steroids. The patient may require continuous EEG monitoring, seizure prophylaxis with medications like Kendra or Dilantin, and further investigations like HSV PCR.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis with an Ranson score predicting a 15-20% mortality rate. The cause of pancreatitis is uncertain, but it may be related to volume depletion, hyperglycemia, or other factors. The patient requires volume resuscitation with normal saline, NPO status, and monitoring for complications.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, possibly due to undiagnosed diabetes, acute pancreatitis, or prednisone use. He requires IV fluids for good urine output, fingerstick glucose monitoring, and an insulin drip to"

   Acute pancreatitis could be contributory as well. A1c 9.9, so likely
   undiagnosed diabetes
   - IVF to maintain good urine output
   - q1hr fingersticks, insulin drip as persistently hyperglycemic post
   IVF
   - [**Last Name (un) **] consult-likely insulin resistant in setting of acute
   inflammation and type of diabetes so will hold off on long acting
   insulin until more stable.
   - will need standing insulin recs when able to come off drip

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of inclusion body myositis on prednisone. He presents with altered mental status and was found to have nonconvulsive status epilepticus, which has since resolved. Other conditions include pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, elevated lactate, acidosis, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and hypertension. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of these conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various factors such as post-ictal state following the seizure, dehydration, hyperglycemia, or acute renal failure. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's mental status and provide appropriate care.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has been diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Close monitoring of pancreatic enzymes and fluid balance is necessary. Treatment includes volume resuscitation with normal saline, nasogastric tube (NGT) placement, and maintaining good urine output. Further investigations like triglyceride levels and repeat CT scan may be required.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has significant hyperglycemia, which could be due to undiagnosed diabetes, acute pancreatitis, or the use of prednisone. Continuous insulin infusion is needed to maintain good glycemic control. Long-term management will involve standing insulin recommendations.

4. Elevated lactate: The elevated lactate levels may"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 62M with inclusion body myositis on prednisone who presents
   with altered mental status and was found to have nonconvulsive status
   epilepticus, now resolved as well as pancreatitis and hyperglycemia.
   .
   1. Altered mental status, s/p seizure
   Most likely multifactorial; patient post-ictal, dehydrated, with
   hyperglycemia and acute renal failure. Meningitis seems much less
   likely - no significant fevers, but may be masked with steroids.
   Reassuringly tube4 wbc is <5 (note tap was traumatic). Note that
   antibiotics given in ED may lead to falsely negative CSF cultures. No
   evidence of new CVA on CT head. Multiple possible precipitants for this
   patient's seizure, including acidosis, hyperglycemia, electrolyte
   imbalance.
   - Ok to continue ceftriaxone 2g q12, vancomycin 1g q12, and acyclovir.
   Given age would also add ampicillin 2g q4. Continue abx until CSF
   cultures negative x48 hrs. Continue acyclovir pending HSV PCR.
   - Check urine culture in addition to blood cultures
   - LP when stabilized include HSV PCR
   - MRI head per neuro scheduled for today
   - Continuous EEG
   - Continue home Keppra
   - continue dilantin today, check Keppra level per neuro recs
   - Neuro recommendations appreciated
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes, ASA daily (no bleed on CT scan), monitor on
   telemetry-of note patient did have elevated troponins in previous
   notes.  This may represent demand ischemia.
   .
   2. Pancreatitis
   [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] score is 3 (Age, Glucose, LDH) predicting 15-20%
   mortality -- however interpretation more complicated as steroids likely
   contributing to hyperglycemia. Prelim CT shows no evidence of abscess
   or significant pancreatic necrosis however. Precipitant uncertain-- No
   history of recent EtoH intake. Calcium within normal limits, no
   evidence of gallstone disease. Thiazides have been associated with
   pancreatitis but seems less compelling. His labs show evidence of
   significant volume depletion with hemoconcentration and acute renal
   failure.  Serum neg for EtOH and ggt negative making EtOH unlikely.
   - volume resuscitation with NS
   - NGT, NPO
   - Triglycerides pending
   - follow up CT read
   -Get RUQ US to evaluate for non-radiopaque stones
   .
   3. Hyperglycemia
   Patient not known to be a diabetic - though given his habitus may well
   have been glucose intolerant and tipped over by recent prednisone.
   Acute pancreatitis could be contributory as well. A1c 9.9, so likely
   undiagnosed diabetes
   - IVF to maintain good urine output
   - q1hr fingersticks, insulin drip as persistently hyperglycemic post
   IVF
   - [**Last Name (un) **] consult
   - will need standing insulin recs when able to come off drip
   .
   4. Elevated lactate
   Most likely secondary to volume depletion, but also need to rule out
   infection. [**Month (only) 8**] also relate to recent seizure.
   - Repeat lactate normal
   - Culturing and abx as above
   - IVF as above
   .
   5. Acidosis
   Patient with gap acidosis, most likely secondary to elevated lactate,
   also may have contribution from renal failure.
   - ABG as above
   .
   6. Acute renal failure
   Very likely secondary to pre-renal state from dehydration; his marked
   hyperglycemia would lead to osmotic diuresis. No history of hypotension
   to suggest ATN.
   - Check urine electrolytes-FENA 2.6, after aggressive rehydration, but
   clinically prerenal
   - Follow Cr-currently at baseline
   - Hold home HCTZ in setting of rehydration
   .
   7. Hypernatremia
   Sodium at admission falsely in normal range 2/2 marked hyperglycemia.
   Free water deficit ~8L at admission.
   - needed initial volume resuscitation with saline as intravascularly
   deplete
   - follow Na q4 hrs
   - continue D5W for another 4 hours, if no change in sodium, will begin
   free water boluses via NG
   .
   8. Hypertension
   Holding home HCTZ in setting of dehydration. Will resume amlodipine if
   hypertensive.
   .
   9. Inclusion body myositis
   Following neuro recs
   - Discuss weaning steroids or alternative to steroids with neurology
   - Stress dose steroids if develops hypotension

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of inclusion body myositis who presented with altered mental status and was found to have nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The patient also has pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, elevated lactate, acidosis, hypertension, and a history of inclusion body myositis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:
1. Meningitis: Although the patient does not show significant fevers, the use of steroids could mask the symptoms. It is important to continue with appropriate antibiotic coverage.
2. Worsening of pancreatitis: The patient's labs indicate significant volume depletion and acute renal failure. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels indicate undiagnosed diabetes or glucose intolerance. Insulin therapy will be needed to maintain good glycemic control.
4. Infection: Elevated lactate levels suggest possible infection. Culturing and administering broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended.
5. Acidosis: The patient's acidosis may be secondary to elevated lactate or renal failure. Monitoring ABG levels and addressing underlying causes are essential.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal failure is likely pre-renal due to dehydration. Aggressive rehydration and careful monitoring of renal function are necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute pancreatitis, altered mental status, and hyperglycemia. The patient's condition has been monitored closely, with various interventions and treatments implemented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the presence of invasive lines and tubes, such as the PICC line.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins, which can lead to serious complications if they dislodge and travel to vital organs.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's need for respiratory support, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia, which can be a common complication in mechanically ventilated patients.
4. Pancreatitis complications: Acute pancreatitis can lead to various complications, including pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and systemic inflammation, which can further worsen the patient's condition.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood sugar levels need to be managed carefully to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of inclusion body myositis, recent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and admitted with seizures and hyperglycemia (HONK). The patient's chief complaint is seizure with status.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8Â°C (100.1Â°F), heart rate ranging from 74 to 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/65 to 154/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support but does not require supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is overweight/obese, with normal cervical lymph nodes, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and no neurological deficits assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated platelet count, normal creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels (low sodium, low potassium, normal calcium, low magnesium, and normal phosphate levels).

The patient has been receiving multiple medications including insulin, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and prednisone. He is also on a ketogenic diet (keppra) for his altered mental status and seizures.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated amyl"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of inclusion body myositis, recent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and admitted with seizures and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HONK). The patient has been experiencing altered mental status and seizures, for which he is currently receiving treatment. He also has acute pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, and is being managed for SAH. The patient is critically ill and requires ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure recurrence: The patient's recent history of seizures increases the risk of future seizure episodes.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to prednisone use for inclusion body myositis and critical illness puts him at higher risk for infections.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts.
4. Hyperglycemia/HONK: The patient's high blood glucose levels may result in further complications if not properly managed.
5. SAH: The patient's recent SAH can lead to neurological complications such as cerebral vasospasm or rebleeding.
6. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented to the hospital with altered mental status and was found to have acute pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, and Clostridium difficile colitis. He was admitted to the ICU for further management and monitoring. The patient has been receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and medications for his conditions. His vital signs are stable, but he has been experiencing diarrhea and his laboratory results show elevated amylase levels indicative of pancreatitis. The patient's mental status remains altered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile colitis, which can lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea and potentially severe infections if not managed properly.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase levels suggest acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst formation, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
3. Diabetic Complications: As the patient has a history of diabetes, there is a risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) due to poorly controlled blood glucose levels.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, which can increase the risk of falls, aspiration pneumonia, and other complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 62M with inclusion body myositis on prednisone who presents
   with altered mental status and was found to have nonconvulsive status
   epilepticus, now resolved as well as pancreatitis and hyperglycemia.
   .
   1. Altered mental status, s/p seizure
   Most likely multifactorial; patient post-ictal, dehydrated, with
   hyperglycemia and acute renal failure. Meningitis seems much less
   likely - no significant fevers, but may be masked with steroids.
   Reassuringly tube4 wbc is <5 (note tap was traumatic). Note that
   antibiotics given in ED may lead to falsely negative CSF cultures. No
   evidence of new CVA on CT head. Multiple possible precipitants for this
   patient's seizure, including acidosis, hyperglycemia, electrolyte
   imbalance.
   - Ok to continue ceftriaxone 2g q12, vancomycin 1g q12, and acyclovir.
   Given age would also add ampicillin 2g q4. Continue abx until CSF
   cultures negative x48 hrs. Continue acyclovir pending HSV PCR.
   - Follow up Urine Cx-pending
   - Follow up LP-pending
   - MRI head per neuro scheduled for today
   - Continuous EEG
   - Keppra increased yesterday, Dilantin D/c
   -
   - Neuro recommendations appreciated
   - CE-no further bump.
   .
   2. Pancreatitis
   [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] score is 3 (Age, Glucose, LDH) predicting 15-20%
   mortality -- however interpretation more complicated as steroids likely
   contributing to hyperglycemia. Prelim CT shows no evidence of abscess
   or significant pancreatic necrosis however. Precipitant uncertain-- No
   history of recent EtoH intake. Calcium within normal limits, no
   evidence of gallstone disease. Thiazides have been associated with
   pancreatitis but seems less compelling. His labs show evidence of
   significant volume depletion with hemoconcentration and acute renal
   failure.  Serum neg for EtOH and ggt negative making EtOH unlikely.
   - volume resuscitation with NS
   - NGT, NPO-until patient has hunger and tolerating PO.  Continue
   insulin drip until then.
   - Triglycerides pending
   - follow up CT read
   - Defer RUQ US for now
   .
   3. Hyperglycemia
   Patient not known to be a diabetic - though given his habitus may well
   have been glucose intolerant and tipped over by recent prednisone.
   Acute pancreatitis could be contributory as well. A1c 9.9, so likely
   undiagnosed diabetes
   - IVF to maintain good urine output
   - q1hr fingersticks, insulin drip as persistently hyperglycemic post
   IVF
   - [**Last Name (un) **] consult-likely insulin resistant in setting of acute
   inflammation and type of diabetes so will hold off on long acting
   insulin until more stable.
   - will need standing insulin recs when able to come off drip
   .
   4. Elevated lactate-Resolved
   Most likely secondary to volume depletion, but also need to rule out
   infection. [**Month (only) 8**] also relate to recent seizure.
   - Repeat lactate normal
   - Culturing and abx as above
   - IVF as above
   .
   5. Acidosis-Resolved
   Patient with gap acidosis, most likely secondary to elevated lactate,
   also may have contribution from renal failure.
   - ABG as above
   .
   6. Acute renal failure-Resolved
   Very likely secondary to pre-renal state from dehydration; his marked
   hyperglycemia would lead to osmotic diuresis. No history of hypotension
   to suggest ATN.
   - Check urine electrolytes-FENA 2.6, after aggressive rehydration, but
   clinically prerenal
   - Follow Cr-currently at baseline
   - Hold home HCTZ in setting of rehydration
   .
   7. Hypernatremia-Resolved
   Sodium at admission falsely in normal range 2/2 marked hyperglycemia.
   Free water deficit ~8L at admission.
   - needed initial volume resuscitation with saline as intravascularly
   deplete
   - follow PM lytes
   - start D5
 NS at 75 cc/hour while on drip and NPO
   .
   8. Hypertension
   Holding home HCTZ in setting of dehydration. Will resume amlodipine if
   hypertensive.
   .
   9. Inclusion body myositis
   Following neuro recs
   - Wean prednisone from 20 [**Hospital1 **] by 5 mg every week
   - Stress dose steroids if develops hypotension
   .
   FEN NPO, NGT, D5

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of inclusion body myositis on prednisone, presenting with altered mental status and nonconvulsive status epilepticus, which has since resolved. The patient also has pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, acidosis, elevated lactate, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and hypertension. 

The patient's current condition includes being obese, warm extremities with peripheral edema and serosanguinous drainage from small linear breaks in the skin, as well as erythematous appearance. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated blood pressure. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, glucose levels, creatinine, amylase, lipase, and lactic acid levels. The patient's electrolytes are also imbalanced, with low potassium and magnesium levels, and high calcium and phosphate levels. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status, s/p seizure: The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, including being post-ictal, dehydrated, with hyperglycemia and acute renal failure. Meningitis seems less likely without significant fevers, but may be masked with steroids. Reassuringly, the tube4 WBC is <5 (note tap was traumatic).

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 62M with inclusion body myositis on prednisone who presents
   with altered mental status and was found to have nonconvulsive status
   epilepticus, now resolved as well as pancreatitis and hyperglycemia.
   .
   1. Altered mental status, s/p seizure
   Most likely multifactorial; patient post-ictal, dehydrated, with
   hyperglycemia and acute renal failure. Meningitis seems much less
   likely - no significant fevers, but may be masked with steroids.
   Reassuringly tube4 wbc is <5 (note tap was traumatic). Note that
   antibiotics given in ED may lead to falsely negative CSF cultures. No
   evidence of new CVA on CT head. Multiple possible precipitants for this
   patient's seizure, including acidosis, hyperglycemia, electrolyte
   imbalance. CE-no further bump.
   - D/C all antibiotics
   - Follow up Urine Cx-pending
   - Follow up LP-pending
   - F/U MRI
   - D/C-Continuous EEG
   - Continue Keppra
   - Neuro recommendations appreciated
   .
   2. Pancreatitis
   [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] score is 3 (Age, Glucose, LDH) predicting 15-20%
   mortality -- however interpretation more complicated as steroids likely
   contributing to hyperglycemia. Prelim CT shows no evidence of abscess
   or significant pancreatic necrosis however. Precipitant uncertain-- No
   history of recent EtoH intake. Calcium within normal limits, no
   evidence of gallstone disease. Thiazides have been associated with
   pancreatitis but seems less compelling. His labs show evidence of
   significant volume depletion with hemoconcentration and acute renal
   failure.  Serum neg for EtOH and ggt negative making EtOH unlikely.
   -Currently able to take PO, pass Speech and Swallow
   -No need for IVF while taking PO
   .
   3. Hyperglycemia
   Patient not known to be a diabetic - though given his habitus may well
   have been glucose intolerant and tipped over by recent prednisone.
   Acute pancreatitis could be contributory as well. A1c 9.9, so likely
   undiagnosed diabetes
   -On long acting insulin with ISS, will titrate after inflammation has
   resolved
   -Appreciate [**Last Name (un) **] consult-follow up on recs
   .
   4. Elevated lactate-Resolved
   Most likely secondary to volume depletion, but also need to rule out
   infection. [**Month (only) 8**] also relate to recent seizure.
   - Repeat lactate normal
   - Culturing and abx as above
   - IVF as above
   .
   5. Acidosis-Resolved
   Patient with gap acidosis, most likely secondary to elevated lactate,
   also may have contribution from renal failure.
   - ABG as above
   .
   6. Acute renal failure-Resolved
   Very likely secondary to pre-renal state from dehydration; his marked
   hyperglycemia would lead to osmotic diuresis. No history of hypotension
   to suggest ATN.
   - Check urine electrolytes-FENA 2.6, after aggressive rehydration, but
   clinically prerenal
   - Follow Cr-currently at baseline
   - Hold home HCTZ in setting of rehydration
   .
   7. Hypernatremia-Resolved
   Sodium at admission falsely in normal range 2/2 marked hyperglycemia.
   Free water deficit ~8L at admission.
   - needed initial volume resuscitation with saline as intravascularly
   deplete
   - follow PM lytes
   - start D5
 NS at 75 cc/hour while on drip and NPO
   .
   8. Hypertension
   Holding home HCTZ in setting of dehydration. Will resume amlodipine if
   hypertensive.
   .
   9. Inclusion body myositis
   Following neuro recs
   - Wean prednisone from 20 [**Hospital1 **] by 5 mg every week
   - Stress dose steroids if develops hypotension

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of inclusion body myositis on prednisone. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures, which have since resolved. The patient also has pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, elevated lactate, acidosis, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and hypertension.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is multifactorial, including post-ictal state, dehydration, hyperglycemia, and acute renal failure. Meningitis seems less likely, and antibiotics given in the emergency department may lead to falsely negative CSF cultures.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis with an elevated Ranson score predicting a 15-20% mortality rate. The precipitant is uncertain, and the patient's labs show evidence of significant volume depletion with hemoconcentration and acute renal failure. Serum is negative for EtOH, making alcohol-induced pancreatitis less likely.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, likely undiagnosed diabetes, and acute pancreatitis could be contributory. His A1c level is 9.9, indicating undiagnosed diabetes.

4. Elevated lactate: The elevated lactate is most likely secondary to volume depletion but also needs to rule out infection. The patient's recent seizure may also relate to the elevated lactate levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with seizures, delirium, and hyperglycemia. He has shown improvement since admission. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3Â°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 137/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's general appearance is well-nourished, and his neurological status is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and oriented to time, place, and person. 

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antiepileptic drugs, antibiotics, and insulin for hyperglycemia. His laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, but other values are within normal limits. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of pancreatitis, and although he currently does not have any abdominal pain or nausea, monitoring for signs and symptoms of worsening pancreatitis is essential.
2. Altered Mental Status/Delirium: The patient initially presented with delirium, but his mental status has improved significantly. Continued monitoring for any changes in mental status is necessary.
3. Hyperglycemia/Diabetes: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating hyperglycemia. Close monitoring of glucose levels and adjustment of insulin dosage may be required.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male who was admitted with seizures, delirium, and HONK (hypoglycemia, oliguria, neutropenia, and ketoacidosis). He is currently doing much better. The patient has no known drug allergies. He has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin. He also received acyclovir for suspected meningitis.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4Â°C (97.5Â°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/77 to 150/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is alert and oriented, with no evidence of seizure activity.

Laboratory results show elevated glucose levels, slightly low potassium, and normal creatinine levels. Other lab values, including white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and liver enzymes, are within normal range.

Plan:
The patient's conditions include acute pancreatitis, delirium, hyperglycemia, and status epilepticus. The plan involves continuing ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis prevention and stress ulcer protection. The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been receiving antibiotics for suspected infections. However, there is still a risk of developing healthcare-associated infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
2. Pancreatitis: Although the patient's abdominal pain and nausea have improved, he still has elevated amylase levels. There is a risk of complications related to pancreatitis, such as necrosis or abscess formation.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are significantly elevated. If not managed properly, this can lead to further complications, including diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
4. Delirium: The patient's mental status is still altered, although he is much better than before. Delirium can increase the risk of falls, aspiration pneumonia, and other complications.
5. Seizure recurrence: Although there is no current seizure activity, there is still a risk of recurrence in patients with recent seizures.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional information or further evaluation may be necessary to determine the full range of potential medical complications."
