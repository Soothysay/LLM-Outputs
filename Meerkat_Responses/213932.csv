 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old lady with hypotension and radiographic evidence of
   pneumonia now two days out from rehab after a CABG. She is comfortable
   at this time.
   1. Hypotension: Has not required pressors.  Etiology is likely
   hypovolemia vs sepsis from pneumonia.  Hypovolemia seems most likely at
   this time.  I am reassured that she does not have a PE based on
   indeterminate V/Q scan, negative echo and negative LENI
s, so we can
   stop the heparin.  While ideally we would to a CTA chest, her impaired
   renal function makes that risky.  She appears euvolemic now and
   presumably remains below her baseline blood pressure (on metoprolol and
   lisinopril at home), which may still be due to infection.  However her
   urine output and creatinine have improved, which is reassuring.  We
   will monitor closely through the day.
   - stop heprin
   - continue antibiotics for pneumonia as below
   - Try to correlate non-invasive BPs with arterial line.  If she can be
   monitored with cuff she can have the a-line out and go to the floor.
   - Hold metoprolol and lisinopril.
   2. (HC vs. Hospital Acquired) Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic
   evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated
   left sided pleuritic pain.  She denies cough or fever.  We can treat
   with a seven-day course of antibiotics.  We will try to an induced
   sputum to obtain cultures to narrow coverage.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for 7 day course.  Hopefully we can narrow based
   on sputum culture.  She has been MRSA positive in the past, so she will
   likely need vanco for all 7 days unless we can grow an organism.
   3. Delirium with tremulousness: The patient has developed waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status in the past 24 hours per family report.  She has
   also developed new tremor at this time.  Toxicology attending agrees
   that picture could be due to neurontin toxicity, and her improved exam
   today would support that.
   - Talk to family today about whether she is approaching her baseline.
   - PT consult to assess risk for falls
   - Hold compazine and neurontin
   4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Creatinine improved this morning to
   1.7 from 2.8 on admission.  FENa calculated at 0.2%, supporting simple
   prerenal etiology and not ATN.  We will continue to trend towards
   baseline, with further work-up held unless she does not improve.
   - Euvolemic now, should be able to self-regulate with PO intake.
   - Trend Cr
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Hold Lisinopril and Lasix.  [**Month (only) 51**] require reduced lasix dose on
   discharge.
   5. Anemia: Patient is stably anemic with fluid resuscitation, making
   hemoconcentration unlikely. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or
   hemolysis given normal LFTs. Retic count is depressed.  B12 and folate
   normal.  Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.  No further
   work-up at this time.
   - daily Hct while in hospital with transfusion for Hct<21.
   6. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in
   Sinus. QTc 438.  Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal
   failure; CK elevated from hemolysis
   - Repeat Troponin
   - Hold Amiodarone given hypotension
   - Appreciate CSurg wound care recs
   - Continue ASA, Statin
   8. Arthritis: Patient with chronic pain
   - Tylenol PRN add Tramadol PRN if pain not well controlled
   9. GERD: Continue Omeprazole
   10. Glaucoma: Continue Latanoprost
   FEN: No further IVF, replete lytes PRN, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   Access: peripherals and a-line.  A-line can be pulled if cuff pressures
   correlate.
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   Communication: Patient & Daughter [**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1936**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 11582**])
   Disposition: To floor today early if cuff pressures correlate, later in
   day if pressures are stable.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old lady with several medical conditions and complications. Here is a summary of her health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has mental status changes, tremor, and renal failure.
- She was started on an arterial line, nuclear medicine test, and ultrasound.
- The V/Q scan showed an RLL defect, which was indeterminate and did not match the chest X-ray.
- The echocardiogram showed normal right ventricle function with mild concentric hypertrophy and small left ventricular cavity size.
- The LENI wet read was negative, and kidney ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis or stones.
- The patient was diagnosed with gabapentin toxicity, which can cause delirium and tremor. Gabapentin was stopped, and a blood level test was arranged.
- Allergies include amlodipine and edema.
- The last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin on 10/9/2153 at 10:00 AM.
- The patient is receiving Heparin Sodium infusion at 600 units/hour.
- Other ICU medications include Heparin Sodium.
- The patient has changes in medical and family history, review of systems, and flow sheet data.
- Vital signs include temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.
- Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support are also mentioned.
- Physical examination notes that the patient"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old lady with hypotension and radiographic evidence of
   pneumonia now two days out from rehab after a CABG. She is comfortable
   at this time.
   1. Hypotension: Has not required pressors.  Most likely source seems to
   be hypovolemia.
   - stop heprin
   - continue antibiotics
   Possible etiologies of hypotension include poor PO intake and
   hypovolemia (as supported by history) or sepsis from a Pneumonia as
   supported by elevated WBC and radiographic findings.  Levaquin already
   administed in ED and she is on her 3rd Liter of NS at the time of this
   note.  Non-invasive blood pressures difficult to obtain due to
   tremulousness. She is making ~ 20mL urine per hour.  Other
   possibilities include recent MI or possible PE or obstructing renal
   stone causing pyelonephritis.
   - Broaden antibiotic coverage to Vanc/Cefepime now, renally dosed.
   Cipro to start in 48 hours
   - Rule out Flu with DFA; precautions
   - Sputum cultures
   - Continue NS to urine output and goal SBP >100; MAP>65
   - Monitor BPs this AM, place arterial line (technically challenging
   given tremor) if monitoring becomes difficult or BPs remain low
   - Regular heart healthy diet
   - Hold metoprolol, Lisinopril and Lasix & amiodarone
   - Start heparin gtt, LENIs, VQ Scan
   - Echo
   - Renal U/S
   2. (HC vs. Hospital Acquired) Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic
   evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated
   left sided pleuritic pain.  She denies cough or fever.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro as above
   - ABG to monitor respiratory status although she is satting well and
   not dyspneic
   3. Delirium with tremulousness: The patient has developed waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status in the past 24 hours per family report.  She has
   also developed new tremor at this time.  Her tremulousness can be due
   to new medications (Compazine) or neurontin overdose in the setting
   over worsening renal failure.  A possible neurontin overdose could also
   explain her worsening nausea.
   - Treat underlying infection as above
   - Hold compazine and neurontin
   4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: The patient's Cr is elevated to 2.8
   with a baseline of 1.1-1.2, still elevated based on her size, weight
   and age.  Likely causes include pre-renal from poor PO intake or ATN
   from hypotension.  Worsening renal failure and subsequent neurontin
   overdose could also synergistically cause her renal failure.
   - Fluid rescussitation, PO Intake
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolyte monitoring
   - Repeat U/A with electrolytes and Urea
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold Lisinopril and Lasix
   5. Anemia: A pre-operative baseline, but worriesome for
   hemoconcentration. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or hemolysis
   given normal LFTs, but thrombocytosis concerning. Normal B12 in
   [**Month (only) 539**]
   - Repeat Hct today
   - Smear, Retic count, iron studies, b12 and folate
   - Type and screen; blood consent
   6. Thrombocytosis: The patient's thrombocytosis could be reactive from
   bleeding/anemia as above; essential or hemoconcentrational.
   - Repeat platelet count
   - Investigate anemia as above, monitor for bleeding
   7. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in
   Sinus. QTc 438.  Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal
   failure; CK elevated from hemolysis
   - Repeat Troponin

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old lady with hypotension and radiographic evidence of
   pneumonia now two days out from rehab after a CABG. She is comfortable
   at this time.
   1. Hypotension: Possible etiologies of hypotension include poor PO
   intake and hypovolemia (as supported by history) or sepsis from a
   Pneumonia as supported by elevated WBC and radiographic findings.
   Levaquin already administed in ED and she is on her 3rd Liter of NS at
   the time of this note.  Non-invasive blood pressures difficult to
   obtain due to tremulousness. She is making ~ 20mL urine per hour.
   Other possibilities include recent MI or possible PE or obstructing
   renal stone causing pyelonephritis.
   - Broaden antibiotic coverage to Vanc/Cefepime now, renally dosed.
   Cipro to start in 48 hours
   - Rule out Flu with DFA; precautions
   - Sputum cultures
   - Continue NS to urine output and goal SBP >100; MAP>65
   - Monitor BPs this AM, place arterial line (technically challenging
   given tremor) if monitoring becomes difficult or BPs remain low
   - Regular heart healthy diet
   - Hold metoprolol, Lisinopril and Lasix & amiodarone
   - Start heparin gtt, LENIs, VQ Scan
   - Echo
   - Renal U/S
   2. (HC vs. Hospital Acquired) Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic
   evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated
   left sided pleuritic pain.  She denies cough or fever.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro as above
   - ABG to monitor respiratory status although she is satting well and
   not dyspneic
   3. Delirium with tremulousness: The patient has developed waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status in the past 24 hours per family report.  She has
   also developed new tremor at this time.  Her tremulousness can be due
   to new medications (Compazine) or neurontin overdose in the setting
   over worsening renal failure.  A possible neurontin overdose could also
   explain her worsening nausea.
   - Treat underlying infection as above
   - Hold compazine and neurontin
   4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: The patient's Cr is elevated to 2.8
   with a baseline of 1.1-1.2, still elevated based on her size, weight
   and age.  Likely causes include pre-renal from poor PO intake or ATN
   from hypotension.  Worsening renal failure and subsequent neurontin
   overdose could also synergistically cause her renal failure.
   - Fluid rescussitation, PO Intake
   - [**Hospital1 7**] electrolyte monitoring
   - Repeat U/A with electrolytes and Urea
   - Renally dose meds
   - Hold Lisinopril and Lasix
   5. Anemia: A pre-operative baseline, but worriesome for
   hemoconcentration. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or hemolysis
   given normal LFTs, but thrombocytosis concerning. Normal B12 in
   [**Month (only) 539**]
   - Repeat Hct today
   - Smear, Retic count, iron studies, b12 and folate
   - Type and screen; blood consent
   6. Thrombocytosis: The patient's thrombocytosis could be reactive from
   bleeding/anemia as above; essential or hemoconcentrational.
   - Repeat platelet count
   - Investigate anemia as above, monitor for bleeding
   7. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in
   Sinus. QTc 438.  Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal
   failure; CK elevated from hemolysis
   - Repeat Troponin
   - Hold Amiodarone given hypotension
   - Appreciate CSurg wound care recs
   - Continue ASA, Statin
   8. Arthritis: Patient with chronic pain
   - Tylenol PRN add Tramadol PRN if pain not well controlled
   9. GERD: Continue Omeprazole
   10. Glaucoma: Continue Latanoprost
   FEN: No IVF, Vitamin D, regular diet

","The patient is an 84-year-old lady with multiple medical complications. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing mental status changes, tremor, and renal failure. Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could be due to poor oral intake and hypovolemia, or sepsis from a pneumonia. This requires continuous monitoring, and an arterial line may be necessary if non-invasive blood pressures become difficult to obtain.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and it is important to rule out flu with DFA, obtain sputum cultures, and continue IV fluids to maintain urine output and target systolic blood pressure above 100 mmHg and mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg.

3. Delirium with tremulousness: The patient has developed waxing and waning mental status and new tremor, which could be due to new medications or neurontin overdose in the setting of worsening renal failure. It is important to treat underlying infections, hold Compazine and neurontin, and monitor for signs of delirium.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated from a baseline of 1.1-1.2, indicating worsening renal function. This could be due to pre-renal causes"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old lady with hypotension and radiographic evidence of
   pneumonia now two days out from rehab after a CABG. She is comfortable
   at this time.
   1. Hypotension: Has not required pressors.  Etiology is likely
   hypovolemia vs sepsis from pneumonia.  Hypovolemia seems most likely at
   this time.  I am reassured that she does not have a PE based on
   indeterminate V/Q scan, negative echo and negative LENI
s, so we can
   stop the heparin.  While ideally we would to a CTA chest, her impaired
   renal function makes that risky.  She appears euvolemic now and
   presumably remains below her baseline blood pressure (on metoprolol and
   lisinopril at home), which may still be due to infection.  However her
   urine output and creatinine have improved, which is reassuring.  We
   will monitor closely through the day.
   - stop heprin
   - continue antibiotics for pneumonia as below
   - Try to correlate non-invasive BPs with arterial line.  If she can be
   monitored with cuff she can have the a-line out and go to the floor.
   - Hold metoprolol and lisinopril.
   2. (HC vs. Hospital Acquired) Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic
   evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated
   left sided pleuritic pain.  She denies cough or fever.  We can treat
   with a seven-day course of antibiotics.  We will try to an induced
   sputum to obtain cultures to narrow coverage.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for 7 day course.  Hopefully we can narrow based
   on sputum culture.  She has been MRSA positive in the past, so she will
   likely need vanco for all 7 days unless we can grow an organism.
   3. Delirium with tremulousness: The patient has developed waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status in the past 24 hours per family report.  She has
   also developed new tremor at this time.  Toxicology attending agrees
   that picture could be due to neurontin toxicity, and her improved exam
   today would support that.
   - Talk to family today about whether she is approaching her baseline.
   - PT consult to assess risk for falls
   - Hold compazine and neurontin
   4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Creatinine improved this morning to
   1.7 from 2.8 on admission.  FENa calculated at 0.2%, supporting simple
   prerenal etiology and not ATN.  We will continue to trend towards
   baseline, with further work-up held unless she does not improve.
   - Euvolemic now, should be able to self-regulate with PO intake.
   - Trend Cr
   - Continue to renally dose meds
   - Hold Lisinopril and Lasix.  [**Month (only) 51**] require reduced lasix dose on
   discharge.
   5. Anemia: Patient is stably anemic with fluid resuscitation, making
   hemoconcentration unlikely. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or
   hemolysis given normal LFTs. Retic count is depressed.  B12 and folate
   normal.  Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.  No further
   work-up at this time.
   - daily Hct while in hospital with transfusion for Hct<21.
   6. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in
   Sinus. QTc 438.  Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal
   failure; CK elevated from hemolysis
   - Repeat Troponin
   - Hold Amiodarone given hypotension
   - Appreciate CSurg wound care recs
   - Continue ASA, Statin
   8. Arthritis: Patient with chronic pain
   - Tylenol PRN add Tramadol PRN if pain not well controlled
   9. GERD: Continue Omeprazole
   10. Glaucoma: Continue Latanoprost
   FEN: No further IVF, replete lytes PRN, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   Access: peripherals and a-line.  A-line can be pulled if cuff pressures
   correlate.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. The cause could be hypovolemia or sepsis from pneumonia. Since the patient appears euvolemic and her urine output and creatinine have improved, monitoring her closely through the day is advised.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia, which is either hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). Antibiotic treatment for a seven-day course is recommended, and obtaining sputum cultures will help narrow the coverage.

4. Delirium with tremulousness: The patient has developed altered mental status and tremor. Neurontin toxicity could be a possible cause, and it should be discussed with the family and assessed by a psychiatrist.

5. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved from 2.8 on admission to 1.7, suggesting improvement in renal function. Further work-up is not required unless the patient does not"

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   An 84 year old lady with hypotension and radiographic evidence of
   pneumonia now two days out from rehab after a CABG. She is comfortable
   at this time but is staying in the ICU as there are no hospital beds
   available.
   1. Health-care associated Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic
   evidence of a RLL PNA, HAP versus HCAP given history with associated
   right sided pleuritic pain.  She denies cough or fever.  She will
   require a seven-day course of antibiotics including vancomycin, so she
   will require IV access.
   - Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for 7 day course.  We will increase dosing today
   based on improved renal function and check a vancomycin trough in the
   morning.
   - We will have her assessed for PICC placement so she can possibly go
   to rehab.
   2. Hypotension: Her blood pressures have improved, either because of
   treatment of her pneumonia, clearance of gabapentin or fluid
   resuscitation.  She appears to have difficulty drinking water because
   of her arthritis, but we will encourage PO intake as she has been
   negative for two days and was dehydrated on admission.  She is
   beginning to become hypertensive, but we will hold her home
   antihypertensives until we can be sure she is stable.
   - Continue to hold metoprolol and lisinopril.  Restart short-acting
   metoprolol if she is hypertensive.
   3. Delirium with tremulousness: She continues to improve.  Her symptoms
   were presumably due to acute infection and gabapentin overload.
   - PT consult to assess risk for falls and evaluate whether she should
   go home or to rehab.
   - Hold compazine and neurontin and talk to PCP about these medication
   changes.
   4. Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Creatinine improved this morning to
   1.1 from 2.8 on admission.  Appears to have been pre-renal.  No further
   work-up for now.
   - Encourage PO intake.
   - Take-out foley catheter.
   - Hold Lisinopril and Lasix.  [**Month (only) 51**] require reduced lasix dose on
   discharge.
   5. Anemia: Patient is stably anemic with fluid resuscitation, making
   hemoconcentration unlikely. Guaiac negative, no signs of bleeding or
   hemolysis given normal LFTs. Retic count is depressed.  B12 and folate
   normal.  Iron studies suggest anemia of chronic disease.  No further
   work-up at this time.
   - daily Hct while in hospital with transfusion for Hct<21.
   6. s/p CABG: Complicated by postop atrial fibrillation, currently in
   Sinus. QTc 438.  Elevated Troponin difficult to interpret given renal
   failure.  Had been on amiodarone for peri-operative A-fib.  We will
   restart amiodarone and defer to her out-patient cardiologist to decide
   the course.
   - Restart amiodarone
   - Appreciate CSurg wound care recs
   - Continue ASA, Statin
   8. Arthritis: Patient with chronic pain
   - Tylenol PRN add Tramadol PRN if pain not well controlled
   9. GERD: Continue Omeprazole
   10. Glaucoma: Continue Latanoprost
   FEN: No further IVF, replete lytes PRN, regular diet
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin now that IV heparin stopped.
   Access: PIVs.

   Disposition: Called-out to floor.
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 84-year-old lady with a recent history of pneumonia and CABG surgery.
2. She has radiographic evidence of pneumonia and is currently receiving treatment with antibiotics.
3. The patient's blood pressure has improved, but she is now beginning to become hypertensive.
4. Her tremor and confusion have improved, indicating improvement in her mental status.
5. The patient's renal function has improved, as evidenced by a decrease in creatinine levels from 2.8 to 1.1.
6. She has a history of anemia, but it is stable and not requiring immediate intervention.
7. The patient underwent CABG surgery complicated by postoperative atrial fibrillation, which has since converted to sinus rhythm.
8. The patient has chronic arthritis, GERD, glaucoma, and other medical conditions that require ongoing management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and there is a risk of worsening or complications related to the infection.
2. Hypotension: Although the patient's blood pressure has improved, there is still a risk of further episodes of hypotension.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient had an acute on chronic renal failure, and there is a risk of deterioration in renal function.
4. Delirium: Although the patient's mental"
