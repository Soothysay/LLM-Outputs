   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   69M h/o COPD, dCHF, admitted with SOB, tachycardia, LE erythema.
   .
   # hypoxia - most likely COPD flare given ABG, though ddx also includes
   PE (tachy, LE edema, ?h/o coumadin use), PNA, CHF/MI.  chronically on
   steroids, and on bactrim prophylaxis.
   - restart bipap.
   - continue iv solumedrol 80iv q8, albuterol, atrovent nebs.
   - continue levaquin, would d/c vanco.
   - check sputum cx.  consider pcp, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] cxr not consistent.
   - check DFA to r/o flu.
   - consider heparin gtt empirically for PE if not improving with
   steroids, though feel copd most likely given pulmonary exam.
   - consider CTA in AM if not improving, though currently unable to lie
   flat.
   - check LENIs in AM.
   - cycle CE x 2, once more in AM.
   .
   .
   # cardiac - +SOB, no CP, orthopnea, pnd, has LE edema however.  feel MI
   unlikely.
   ## ischemia:
   - start aspirin.
   - cycle CE x 2 to r/o MI with AM labs.
   .
   ## rythym: sinus tachycardia,  not clearly MAT, not afib.  ddx includes
   hypoxia, dehydration, PE.  given pulmonary exam, feel hypoxia most
   likely.
   - continue telemetry.
   - treat underlying hypoxia/copd.
   - if not improving in AM, consider CTA.
   - repeat EKG in AM.
   .
   .
   ## pump: euvolemic/dry on exam.  EF >55% 11/07, though some evidence of
   diastolic dysfunction, with elevated BNP which could suggest mild
   volume overload.
   - consider gentle lasix if worsening hypoxia, though feel more likely
   is dry.
   .
   ## htn: h/o HTN, with resultant dCHF.
   - continue home BP meds.
   .
   .
   # LE edema/erythema - pt with similar sx during [**10-30**] admission, being
   covered for cellulitis presently with levaquin, received one dose of
   vanco in ED.  no recent trauma.
   - LENIs in AM to r/o DVT.
   - consider broadening abx coverage for cellulitis.
   - mark region.
   .
   .
   #FEN
   - regular diet.
   - encourage po hydration, no need for IVF.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and dyslipidemia. The patient was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB), tachycardia, and lower extremity (LE) erythema. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to initial attempts at improving ventilation by increasing BIPAP resulted in worsened arterial blood gas (ABG) with a carbon dioxide (PCO2) level of 105 and increasing fatigue.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. The primary concern is hypoxia, which is most likely due to a COPD flare-up given the ABG results. However, other differentials include pulmonary embolism (PE), pneumonia (PNA), and CHF/Myocardial Infarction (MI). The patient is on chronic steroid therapy and prophylactic Bactrim.

The plan of care includes restarting bipap, continuing intravenous solumedrol, albuterol, and atrovent nebulizations. Antibiotics have been started, and sputum culture will be checked. DFA testing will be done to rule out influenza. Heparin will be considered empirically for PE if there is no improvement with steroids. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) may be considered in the morning if"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of COPD and congestive heart failure who was admitted with shortness of breath, tachycardia, lower extremity erythema and ulcer, and hypoxia. The patient was intubated overnight due to difficult ventilation and subsequent high PCO2 levels. 

The patient's current condition shows improved ABG with resolution of sinus tachycardia. The assessment indicates hypoxia likely due to a COPD flare, and there is no evidence of fluid overload or pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The plan includes continuing intubation for ventilatory support, administering intravenous solumedrol and frequent albuterol/nebs, continuing levaquin for empiric coverage, checking sputum culture, considering Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) due to negative Legionella testing, and starting bactrim prophylaxis. 

Other assessments include cardiac issues such as +SOB, no chest pain or orthopnea, possible peripheral edema, and sinus tachycardia likely related to hypoxia. The patient's blood pressure dropped during intubation but improved with intravenous fluids. 

The patient has a history of hypertension and resultant dilated cardiomyopathy (dCHF). Blood pressure medications have been withheld since the patient's blood pressure is currently stable and recent hypotension occurred during intubation.

   69 yo m with severe COPD (chronic prednisone, home O2) with chronic
   hypercarbia presents with copd flare/bronchitis and acute on chronic
   hypercarbic and hypoxic resp failure, intubated overnight
   MAIN ISSUES INCLUDE:
   # Respiratory failure, acute on chronic hypercarbic and hypoxemic
   -progressive fatigue and bronshospasm leading to intubation
   - no new infiltrate on cxr, given significant bronchospasm most
   concerned for copd with bronchitis verses early pna (bacterial verses
   viral)  low suspicion for pe (neg lenis, resolution in tachy).  Pt is
   on high dose of chronic steroids so immunosupressed, though on PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 1316**] .
   Sputum cx with ngtd, ruled out for influenze and urine legionella
   pending
   Continue solumedrol 80 Q 8, Q 2 hr albuterol and atrovent Q 6, follow
   abg though ventilation improving and some increased air movement noted
   on exam.
   Would continue antibx with levoflox for 7 day and recheck sputum for ET
   sx, follow LLL on cxr--likely atelectasis
   # LE edema/erythema -now appears more erythematous concerning for
   cellulitis, though af and with nl wbc ct.  Also with R venous stasis
   ulcer on calf, swab ulcer and check blood cx given chronic steroids.
   Resume vanco.
   # diastolic dysfx-does not appear overtly fluid overloaded, has chronic
   LE edema and stasis changes,
        restart ace-i and add back hctz later if bp stable
   # tachycardia-now improved, suspect from copd/resp distress with low
   suspicon of PE given exam and nelenis

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic hypercarbia who presented with a COPD flare and acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient was intubated overnight due to worsening arterial blood gases (ABGs) on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and fatigue. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient already has acute on chronic hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. This condition can worsen if the patient does not respond to treatment or if there are complications such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism.

2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has symptoms of a possible infection, including bronchospasm and fever. There is a concern for early pneumonia, especially given the patient's immunosuppressed state due to chronic steroid use. A sputum culture is pending.

3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the patient's tachycardia has improved, there is still a low suspicion for PE due to the lack of other signs and negative D-dimer results. However, further investigation may be needed if the patient's condition does not improve.

4. Cellulitis: The patient has developed erythema and edema on the lower extremities, which may indicate cellulitis. This could be a result of impaired circulation secondary"

   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo m with severe COPD (chronic prednisone, home O2) with chronic
   hypercarbia presents with copd flare and acute on chronic hypercarbic
   and hypoxic resp failure likely from bronchitis verses pna
   now with evidence of venous stasis ulcer and ? cellulitis, intubated
   overnight
   MAIN ISSUES:
   # hypoxemia
   copd exacerbation remains most likely etiology, with pe (given
   tachycardia) verses chf on ddx, though low suspicon--lenis neagtive and
   given significant bronchospasm
   acute on chronic hypercarbic resp failure, with progressive fatigue and
   bronshospam leading to intubation
        no new infiltrate on cxr, given significant bronchospasm most
   concerned for copd with bronchitis verses early pna (bacterial verses
   viral)  low suspicion for pe, though has b/l le edema.  Pt is on high
   dose of chronic steroids so immunosupressed, though on PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 1316**] which
   we are continuing.
   Sputum cx, blood cx if spikes, ruled out for influenze and urine
   legionella pending
   continue solumedrol 80 Q 8, Q 2 hr mdis and atrovent Q 6, follow abg
   though ventialtion making slow imrpovement
   empiric antibx levoflox for 7 day and recheck sputum for ET sx, follow
   LLL on cxr--likely ateelcatsis as clinically without new evidence of
   infection
   # diastolic dysfx-does not appear overtly fluid overloaded, BNP
   elevated, has chronic LE edema likely from pulm htn
        would restart ace-i and sadd back hctz later if bp stable
   # tachycardia-now improved, suspect from copd/resp distress with low
   suspicon of PE given exam and eng lenis
   # elevated troponin and nonspecific ecg changes--follow enzymes and

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe COPD and chronic hypercarbia. He presents with a COPD flare and acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely due to bronchitis or pneumonia. The patient was intubated overnight and experienced difficult ventilation with evidence of bronchospasm. His ABG values have improved with aggressive MDIs. The patient is on high-dose chronic steroids, which may have immunosuppressed him.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels indicate respiratory distress and the need for immediate intervention.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's severe COPD exacerbation requires close monitoring and management to prevent further respiratory failure.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although low suspicion, the patient's tachycardia and bilateral leg edema raise concerns for a possible PE.
4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's diastolic dysfunction and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels suggest potential CHF.
5. Venous Stasis Ulcer with possible Cellulitis: The patient has a pre-existing venous stasis ulcer on his right medial calf, which is now showing signs of erythema and potential cellulitis.
6. Cardiac Enzymes: The patient's elevated troponin levels indicate possible cardiac injury or stress.
7. Infection: The patient's immunosup"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of COPD and decompensated heart failure, admitted with dyspnea and likely worsening hypoxia due to a COPD flare. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There are two large black, cauliflower-like lesions on the patient's right calf and left thigh, which will require a dermatology consult. The patient has also been started on tube feeds and will need nutrition recommendations. The patient has a history of allergies to augmentin (oral), nausea/vomiting, and was previously on vancomycin for right lower extremity cellulitis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but the respiratory support is ongoing. The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count and elevated lactate level, indicating possible infection or tissue hypoperfusion. The patient's cardiac enzymes are within normal range, suggesting no acute myocardial infarction. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a slightly elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco2) and low oxygen saturation (SpO2). The patient's chest X-ray is unremarkable for fluid overload, but there are bilateral lower extremity edemas noted on physical examination. The patient's condition requires close monitoring in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with hypoxia and respiratory distress. They have two large black, cauliflower-like lesions on their right calf and left thigh, requiring a dermatology consult. The patient has been started on tube feeds but needs nutrition recommendations. They were previously on antibiotics, which were stopped due to an allergy, but restarted for right lower extremity cellulitis. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening respiratory distress: The patient's low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 93%) and the presence of wheezes in their respiratory examination suggest possible worsening respiratory distress.
2. Infection: The presence of black, necrotic lesions on the patient's leg raises concerns about a possible infection, such as necrotizing fasciitis or a severe soft tissue infection.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and the presence of leg lesions may increase their risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of their legs, leading to DVT.
4. Septic shock: If the infection spreads systemically, the patient could develop septic shock, characterized by hypotension and organ dysfunction.
5. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure on certain areas can lead to pressure ulcers, which are at risk in critically ill patients.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted with dyspnea and worsening hypoxia. He is currently intubated due to increasing hypercapnea and increased work of breathing. The patient's ABG has improved on the ventilator. He has black, necrotic lesions on his right calf and left thigh, and there is suspicion of a possible PE. The patient's cardiac history includes symptoms of SOB, orthopnea, PND, and LE edema, but no CP or MI. His hypertension is managed with lisinopril and lasix. He is also on various medications for respiratory distress, including solumedrol, albuterol, atrovent nebs, and levaquin. There are concerns regarding his worsening leg erythema and a fungating necrotic mass on his left ankle, for which a dermatology consult has been requested. The patient's glucose levels are monitored with regular insulin sliding scale.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's worsening hypoxia and COPD flare-up may lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: The presence of black, necrotic lesions on the patient's legs raises concerns for possible infection, such as cellulitis or a skin infection. The worsening leg erythema and fungating necrotic mass on the left ankle also suggest"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents with acute respiratory failure due to a flare-up of COPD/bronchitis and an infection. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has cellulitis on his left lower extremity and suspicious skin lesions on his left thigh and right calf. His blood cultures have been obtained, and he is receiving antibiotics for cellulitis. The patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory failure, cellulitis, and potential skin malignancy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD and acute exacerbation put him at risk for continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his vital signs, arterial blood gases (ABGs), and response to ventilation settings is crucial. If there is no improvement or further deterioration, extrusion may not be possible.
2. Cellulitis: The patient's left lower extremity cellulitis requires ongoing evaluation and treatment. Failure to adequately address this infection may lead to worsening cellulitis, spread of infection, sepsis, or complications such as necrotizing fasciitis.
3. Skin Lesions: The suspicious skin lesions on the patient's left thigh and right calf need further assessment by a dermatologist. These lesions could potentially be indicative of skin malignancy or another condition that requires prompt diagnosis and management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presents with respiratory failure, acute on chronic hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure, and cellulitis. The patient is critically ill and requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is acute on chronic, meaning it is a worsening of his pre-existing condition. This could be due to a COPD flare, bronchitis, or pneumonia. The patient requires mechanical ventilation support through an endotracheal tube.
2. Cellulitis: The patient has developed erythematous lesions on his left thigh and right calf, which are concerning for cellulitis. This could potentially lead to further complications if left untreated.
3. Skin Lesions: The patient has black lesions on his left thigh and right calf. These lesions require evaluation by a dermatologist to determine their nature and potential significance.
4. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient's chest X-ray shows evidence of wet lungs and increased left ventricular edema. This suggests the possibility of diastolic dysfunction, and the patient's ACE inhibitor should be restarted along with diuretics such as lasix.
5. Tachycardia: The patient experienced a resolved episode of tachycardia, which may be related to COPD/ respiratory distress or possibly a pulmonary embolism. Further evaluation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted with dyspnea. The patient's condition worsened, leading to intubation due to increasing hypercapnea and increased work of breathing. The patient's ABG improved on the ventilator, indicating improvement in oxygenation and ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of crackles and wheezing in the respiratory exam, along with an elevated white blood cell count, suggests a possible respiratory infection, such as pneumonia.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has risk factors for DVT, including immobility and advanced age. The presence of erythema and edema in the lower extremities could indicate a possible DVT.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening respiratory status and the presence of bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray raise concern for ARDS, which is a severe form of lung injury.
4. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CHF and current symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema, there is a possibility of cardiac complications such as heart failure exacerbation or myocardial infarction.
5. Delirium: The patient is sedated and may be at risk for delirium,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of COPD, admitted with dyspnea and worsening hypoxia. He was intubated due to increasing hypercapnea and increased work of breathing. The patient's ABGs are closer to baseline on MinVent but serum bicarb is rising at 45, so he was switched back to A/C with increased PCO2. The patient has a negative Legionella antigen and gram stain results are negative for microorganisms. The patient's right PICC line has been removed or pulled back outside of the thorax, and there are atelectatic changes or effusion at the base of the left lung. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation support and is expected to be extubated today/tomorrow. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of COPD flare-up, wheezes on chest exam, and poor air movement suggest an obstructive etiology. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and evidence of CHF on CXR with pleural edema. Restarting diuretics and resuming home lasix dose may help manage these symptoms. However, there is a risk of worsening heart failure or electrolyte imbalances if fluid balance is not carefully monitored.

3. Infection: The patient's ankle shows erythema"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with severe COPD, chronic hypercarbia, diastolic heart failure, and cellulitis. He presents with respiratory failure due to an acute exacerbation of COPD and bronchitis, leading to intubation for acute on chronic hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, bronchodilators, diuretics, and steroids. His vital signs are stable, but he remains critically ill. The main issues include respiratory failure, cellulitis, and potential skin lesions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to further exacerbation of COPD or infection, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential spread of cellulitis or development of new skin infections. The patient's diastolic dysfunction should also be closely monitored.

Overall, the patient requires careful monitoring and management to address his respiratory failure, cellulitis, and potential complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe COPD, chronic prednisone use, and home oxygen dependency. He presented with an acute exacerbation of COPD, bronchitis, and cellulitis. The patient was intubated for respiratory failure due to acute on chronic hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been receiving antibiotics (levofloxacin), corticosteroids (solumedrol), and bronchodilators (albuterol and atrovent). The patient's cellulitis has improved, and there is a plan for outpatient follow-up and biopsy. The patient's skin lesions were evaluated by a dermatologist, and he is expected to be extubated today with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in case of respiratory distress. The patient's diastolic dysfunction was also addressed, and he will be restarted on an ACE inhibitor. The patient's nutritional status is replete. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's condition is critical, and there is a risk of continued respiratory failure, especially if he develops any complications during or after extubation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture is pending, and he may develop pneumonia due to his compromised respiratory status and prolonged intubation.
3. Diastolic heart failure: The patient has diastolic dysfunction, which could worsen if not properly managed.
4. Cellulitis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of COPD, congestive heart failure (CHF), and dyspnea. He was admitted for worsening hypoxia in the setting of a COPD flare and is currently intubated. The patient's ABG improved on ventilator, and he will be tried on pressure support (PS) again today with hopes of extubation. He is receiving a prednisone taper, bactrim prophylaxis, frequent albuterol/atropine nebs, and completed levaquin for empiric coverage. Sputum culture showed no organisms, urine legionella negative, DFA negative, and three consecutive cardiac enzymes (CE) were negative.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: Most likely COPD flare. Presented with wheezes on chest exam with poor air movement consistent with obstructive etiology. Patient with negative leg raise index (LENI), low suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE). Patient was intubated due to increasing hypercapnea and increased work of breathing. Improved ABG on ventilator.
- pCO2 to 105 on PS, switched to assist-control (AC) overnight, will try PS again today with hope of extubation.
- Continue prednisone taper and bactrim prophylaxis.
- Frequent albuterol/atropine nebs, decreased frequency q4.

   #  hypoxia:  most likely COPD flare.  Wheezes on chest exam w/ poor
   pair movement c/w obstructive etiology.  Patient w/ negative LENI, low
   suspicison of PE.  Patient was intubated due to increasing hypercapnea
   and increased work of breathing.  Improved ABG on ventilator.
   --             continue intubation for ventalatory support, now changed
   to PS/AC, likely extubation tomorrow/today
   --             decreased solumedrol to 60mg ivq8, assess decreasing to
   40mg IVq8/60mg prednisone daily
   --             frequent albuterol / atrovent nebs, decreased frequency
   q4
   --             continue levaquin for empiric coverage
   --             sputum CX showed no organisims, urine legonalla negative

   --             Pump: now w/ pleural edema on CXR, hx of [**Last Name (LF) 1343**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**]
   diurese and  resume home lasix dose.
   # HTN:  hx of HTN.  Restarted lisinopril, will restart HCTZ today,
   lasix as tolerated given evidence of CHF on CXR with goal of negative
   .5-1L.
   #LE edema/erythema:  LE erythema slightly improved.  Cellulitis vs.
   changes from LE edema.  Noted that  no WBC, no fever.  Startarted on

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of COPD who was admitted with dyspnea and worsening hypoxia. He is currently intubated due to increasing hypercapnea and increased work of breathing. The patient's ABG has improved on ventilator support. He is receiving frequent albuterol/atropine nebs, decreased frequency q4. The patient's sputum culture showed no organisms, and his urine Legionella test was negative. DFA and CE tests were also negative. The patient's CXR showed pleural edema, and he has a history of being on home Lasix, which he was not taking. The goal is to diuresse with 1L. The patient has signs of cardiac issues, including SOB, no CP, orthopnea, PND, and LE edema. There is a low suspicion for MI. The patient's rhythm is now sinus tachycardia. Telemetry is being continued. The patient's blood pressure is controlled, and he is restarted on lisinopril, with plans to restart HCTZ today and Lasix as tolerated. The patient has erythema in the lower extremities, which may be cellulitis or changes from LE edema. He is started on vancomycin due to notably angry appearance. A follow-up biopsy of the ankle mass is planned. The patient is on regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. He has an arterial line"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with severe COPD, chronic prednisone use, and home oxygen dependency. The patient presented with an acute exacerbation of chronic hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. The main issues include respiratory failure due to COPD flare/bronchitis/pneumonia, cellulitis of the left leg, diastolic dysfunction, and elevated BUN levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe COPD and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute-on-chronic hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. There is a risk of prolonged ventilation or extubation failure.
2. Cellulitis: The patient has improved but still has le cellulitis, which requires ongoing monitoring for worsening infection or spread of infection.
3. Diastolic dysfunction: The patient has diastolic heart failure, and there is a risk of fluid overload or worsening heart failure symptoms.
4. Elevated BUN levels: The patient's BUN levels are elevated, which may indicate renal impairment or dehydration. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
5. Skin lesions: The patient has skin lesions that require further evaluation and management.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, infection parameters, fluid balance, and renal function. Appropriate interventions such as weaning from mechanical ventilation, managing cellulitis, optimizing heart failure management, addressing elevated BUN"

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of COPD who was admitted with dyspnea, likely worsening hypoxia in the setting of a COPD flare. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: he has an orogastric (OG) tube, is receiving tube feeds, and has peripheral edema. 

On examination, the patient appears to be in no acute distress, with normal cardiovascular findings including regular heart rhythm, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and no murmurs. His respiratory status shows wheezes on chest examination with poor air movement, consistent with an obstructive etiology. There are no signs of infection or fever, and his extremities are warm and improved in appearance.

Laboratory results show a WBC count within normal limits, with slightly elevated levels of glucose and lactic acid. Other lab values are within normal ranges. ABG results indicate a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, possibly due to hypoxia and hypercapnia.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypoxia: Most likely due to a COPD flare. Wheezes on chest exam with poor air movement are consistent with an obstructive etiology.
2. Infectious etiology: Low suspicion of PE. Negative LEVINE, DFA negative, sputum CX negative, urine Legionella negative. Started on empirical coverage with levo"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of COPD who was admitted with dyspnea and worsening hypoxia. The patient was intubated due to increasing hypercapnea and increased work of breathing. The patient's ABG improved on the ventilator. The patient will continue to receive intubation for ventilatory support and is likely to be extubated today. The patient was started on 80mg PO prednisone, which will be tapered to 60mg tomorrow. The patient received frequent albuterol/atropine nebs, decreased frequency q4. The patient also received levofloxacin for empiric coverage. The sputum CX showed no organisms, urine Legionella negative, DFA negative, and CE negative x3. The patient had some component of fluid overload on CE and LE edema during hospitalization, which has been diuresed with significant improvement on clinical exam. The patient will try running -0.5 to even out cardiac issues. The patient's cardiac assessment revealed SOB, no CP, orthopnea, PND, and LE edema. There is a low suspicion for MI. The patient's rhythm was sinus tachycardia, now resolved. The patient felt it was likely due to hypoxia and distress from BIPAP. EKG was unrevealing, so continuous telemetry will be continued.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with severe COPD, chronic prednisone use, and home oxygen dependency. He presented with a COPD flare/bronchitis and was intubated for acute on chronic hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated and is currently on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV).

The main issues include respiratory failure due to COPD flare/bronchitis/pneumonia. The patient is wheezy and anxious, and there is a low threshold for reintubation. Treatment involves using nebulizers, ativan, and morphine to manage anxiety and bronchospasm. Follow-up ABGs will be monitored.

Other issues include cellulitis of the lower extremities, diastolic dysfunction, elevated BUN levels, and skin lesions. The patient is currently on antibiotics, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors for management. The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and intervention are necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o male w/ hx of COPD, [**Year (4 digits) 1343**], admitted w/ dyspnea, likely worsening
   hypoxia in setting of COPD flaire, now intubated.
   #  hypoxia:  most likely COPD flare.  Wheezes on chest exam w/ poor
   pair movement c/w obstructive etiology.  Patient w/ negative LENI, low
   suspicison of PE.  Patient was intubated due to increasing hypercapnea
   and increased work of breathing.  Improved ABG on ventilator.  Patient
   was extubated yesterday, ABG w/ acidemia, started on CPAP.  Patient
   hyperventilating w/ anxiety.
   --             started on 80mg PO predniosone, still wheezy on exam,
   will likely maintain at current dose, and taper slowly
   --             frequent albuterol / atrovent nebs, decreased frequency
   q4
   --             s/p levaquin for empiric coverage
   --             sputum CX showed no organisims, urine legonalla negative
   --             DFA negative
   --             CE negative x 3
   --             some component of [**Year (4 digits) 1343**] w/ fluid overoloand on CE and LE
   edema during hospitalization.  Has been diureeded w/ significant
   improvoemnton exam.  Will try to run even and maintain on home lasix
   dose.
   #Anxiety:  Patient notably anxious, w/ htn, tachycarida,
   hyperventilation.  Somewhat improved on anxietylitics.
   - continue ativan/morphine
   -patinent does not want to be re-intubated, and after family meeting,
   patinet now DNR/DNI w/ planned d/c to hospice
   #cardiac:  + SOB, no CP, orthopnea, PND, has LE edema however.  Low
   suspision for MI
   --             Ischemia: ROMI negative, was started on ASA, now d/c
   --             Rhythem: sinus tach, now resolved.  Felt was likely [**1-24**]
   to hypoxa,distress from BIPAP, EKG unrevealing, cont telemetry
   --             Pump: now w/ pleural edema on CXR, hx of [**Last Name (LF) 1343**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**]
   diurese and  resume home lasix dose.
   # HTN:  hx of HTN.  continue home lisinopril/HCTZ, BP Well controlled
   #LE edema/erythema:  LE erythema slightly improved.  Cellulitis vs.
   changes from LE edema.  Noted that  no WBC, no fever.  Startarted on
   vanc b/c looked notably angre. Follow up bcx, wound cx.  Low suspicisn
   for MRSA cellultiis, feel adequate treatment on levofloxacin.

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o male w/ hx of COPD, [**Year (4 digits) 1343**], admitted w/ dyspnea, likely worsening
   hypoxia in setting of COPD flaire, now intubated.
   #  hypoxia:  most likely COPD flare.  Wheezes on chest exam w/ poor
   pair movement c/w obstructive etiology.  Patient w/ negative LENI, low
   suspicison of PE.  Patient was intubated due to increasing hypercapnea
   and increased work of breathing.  Improved ABG on ventilator.  Patient
   was extubated yesterday, ABG w/ acidemia, started on CPAP.  Patient
   hyperventilating w/ anxiety.
   --             started on 80mg PO predniosone, still wheezy on exam,
   will likely maintain at current dose, and taper when possible
   --             frequent albuterol / atrovent nebs, decreased frequency

   --             CE negative x 3
   --             some component of [**Year (4 digits) 1343**] w/ fluid overoloand on CE and LE
   edema during hospitalization.  Has been diureeded w/ significant
   improvoemnton exam.  Will try to run even and maintain on home lasix
   dose.
   #Anxiety:  Patient notably anxious, w/ htn, tachycarida,
   hyperventilation.  Somewhat improved on anxietylitics.
   - continue ativan/morphine
   -patinent does not want to be re-intubated, and after family meeting,
   patinet now DNR/DNI w/ planned d/c to hospice
   #cardiac:  + SOB, no CP, orthopnea, PND, has LE edema however.  Low
   suspision for MI
   --             Ischemia: ROMI negative, was started on ASA, now d/c
   --             Rhythem: sinus tach, now resolved.  Felt was likely [**1-24**]
   to hypoxa,distress from BIPAP, EKG unrevealing, cont telemetry
   --             Pump: now w/ pleural edema on CXR, hx of [**Last Name (LF) 1343**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**]
   diurese and  resume home lasix dose.
   # HTN:  hx of HTN.  continue home lisinopril/HCTZ, BP Well controlled
   #LE edema/erythema:  LE erythema slightly improved.  Cellulitis vs.
   changes from LE edema.  Noted that  no WBC, no fever.  Startarted on

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of COPD who was admitted for dyspnea and worsening hypoxia during a COPD flare. He was intubated due to increasing hypercapnea and increased work of breathing, but his ABG improved on the ventilator. The patient was extubated yesterday and placed on CPAP, but his ABG showed acidemia. He is now on BiPAP and his ABG has improved.

The patient's allergies include Augmentin (oral), and he has nausea/vomiting as a side effect. He received Vancomycin for antibiotics and is currently on morphine sulfate for pain management.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/62 mmHg to 162/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 86%. His weight is 101 kg, and he has received a total of 270 mL of fluids since midnight. His urine output is 2050 mL.

The patient is currently on BiPAP support, with a FiO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His ABG results are as follows: pH 7.35, PaCO2 91, HCO3- 51, SaO2 46%, and Ve 8.6 L/min. His oxygenation has improved, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 128.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished, anxious patient with diaphoresis. He has wheezing on chest examination, shovel mask facies, and bilateral breath sounds. His cardiovascular examination is normal, with no murmurs or signs of heart failure. Peripheral pulses are present and symmetric, and his skin is warm and pinked, with improved lower extremity erythema.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His blood glucose level is elevated at 126 mg/dL, and his liver enzymes are within normal range. Imaging reveals mild pulmonary edema and no evidence of pneumothorax or central venous catheter tip malposition.

The patient's assessment and plan include management for hypoxia due to COPD flare, anxiety, cardiac issues, hypertension, and lower extremity edema. He has been treated with steroids, bronchodilators, antibiotics, and diuretics. His anxiety has improved with the use of anxiety medications, and he has been started on home lasix for fluid overload. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he will be discharged to hospice care."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe COPD and chronic hypercarbia who presented with an acute exacerbation of respiratory failure. The patient was intubated due to acute on chronic hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure. The main issues include respiratory failure, COPD flare/bronchitis/pneumonia, and diastolic heart failure.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe COPD and chronic hypercarbia, leading to acute exacerbations of respiratory failure. He required intubation and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to maintain oxygenation.
2. COPD Flare/Bronchitis/Pneumonia: The patient presented with a COPD flare, bronchitis, and pneumonia, which contributed to his respiratory failure.
3. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has diastolic heart failure, which may be a result of long-term steroid use and chronic hypercarbia.
4. Anxiety: The patient continues to experience anxiety, which appears to be a significant component of his condition and may contribute to bronchospasm.
5. Fluid Management: The patient had fluid overload initially but responded well to diuresis, resulting in improved edema. Close monitoring of fluid balance is essential.
6. Glycemic Control: The patient is diabetic and requires regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.
7. Medication Management: The patient is on multiple medications,"

   hypercarbia, diastolic heart failure, presents with copd
   flare/bronchitis, intubated for acute on chronic hypercarbic and
   hypoxic resp failure, extibated yesterday
   Pt has severe end-stage COPD with tenuous resp status at baseline.
   Extensive discussion with pt and family, after extubation, and pt does
   not want repeat intubation,  wishes to return home with hospice care.

   Continue nebs/mdi
s.    Will eval whether NPPV can be arranged for
   home, as pt reports that he does not have/use biPAP at home and he may
   benefit from comfort and wob standpoint with intermittent use.
   Anxiety remains issue and will continue to treat w/ ativan, morphine.
   Regarding his known diastolic dysfx, he appears well diuresed w/
   improved LE edema, continuing home regimen of ace-I, lasix, and
   thiazide.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic hypercarbia, diastolic heart failure, and acute exacerbation of bronchitis. The patient has been intubated for acute on chronic hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure but was extubated yesterday.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 103/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient is on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and using an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device.

The patient's physical examination reveals wheezing breath sounds, tachypnea, and the use of accessory muscles. The patient's peripheral pulses are diminished in both lower extremities. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and slightly low potassium levels. The patient's imaging shows clear zones with some left lower lobe haziness, which could be due to atelectasis or small effusion.

The patient's assessment and plan include severe end-stage COPD with tenuous respiratory status. The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for retrocardiac pneumonia/bronchitis and wishes to return home with hospice care. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with severe COPD, chronic hypercarbia, diastolic heart failure, and end-stage COPD. He presented with a COPD flare/bronchitis, was intubated for acute on chronic hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure, and was extubated yesterday. The patient has expressed his wish to return home with hospice care and does not want to be intubated again. His code status has been changed to DNR/DNI. The plan is to discharge him to home hospice once a hospital bed is delivered. He has completed his course of antibiotics for retrocardiac pneumonia/bronchitis and will continue with his current medications, including prednisone, nebs/mdi, and BiPAP. Morphine has been ordered for anxiety management. His diastolic dysfunction appears well managed with diuresis and the use of an ACE inhibitor, lasix, and thiazide.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: Given the patient's severe COPD and history of respiratory failure, there is a high risk of recurring respiratory distress, especially if he develops an infection or experiences a COPD exacerbation.
2. Hypercarbia: The patient's chronic hypercarbia may lead to respiratory acidosis and subsequent complications such as confusion, increased work of breathing, and cardiac dysrhythmias.
3. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient's known diastolic dysfunction"
