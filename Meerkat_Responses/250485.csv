","Summary:
The patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of spells. They had a threshold of 0.6 mA and will be paced at 60 bpm. The patient experienced runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on telemetry. There are no other significant changes in the patient's medical or family history. The patient reports pain in their right neck at the site of their right internal jugular vein/temporary pacemaker, but otherwise feels okay. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the new symptom of numbness/tingling in the lower extremities, which is likely due to baseline lower extremity neuropathy. The patient's pain level is minimal, located in the right neck.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4 C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/58-75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is in sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 50-70 mL and output of 1050-610 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1000-540 mL. The patient is not on respiratory support and their ABG results are pending. Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress, with normal heart sounds and peripheral pulses. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, and they have"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after two cardiac rhythm treatments (CRT), neurogenic bladder with frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and hepatitis C. She was admitted to the ICU for seizure evaluation and found to have a sinus pause in the emergency department. During the pause, she had p waves, indicating intermittent atrioventricular (AV) block in the past two weeks resulting in episodes of fatigue. Possible etiologies include ischemia, viral myocarditis, Lyme disease, endocarditis, thyroid disease, or paroxysmal AV block.

The patient has been treated with a temporary wire placed at the bedside, with no events overnight. She is scheduled to undergo several tests including Lyme serology, blood culture and ESR to evaluate for endocarditis, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on Monday, and cardiac marker trending. An electrophysiology (EP) study is also being considered.

The patient has no chest pain or history of angina, but a stress test demonstrated a mild small perfusion defect in the left anterior descending (LAD) region. She is being treated by Dr. [Last Name (Title)] with medical management and will continue outpatient aspirin (ASA). Cardiac markers are being trended.

No signs of heart failure were observed on examination,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) post-critical renal transplant, neurogenic bladder with frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and mild small perfusion defect in the left anterior descending (LAD) region on stress test. The patient presented to the hospital with a seizure and was found to have a sinus pause during evaluation in the emergency department (ED).

The patient's current condition includes an intermittent atrioventricular (AV) block, which is likely causing episodes of fatigue. The possible etiologies include ischemia, viral myocarditis, Lyme disease, endocarditis, thyroid disease, or paroxysmal AV block. Temporary pacing wires have been placed, and the patient is being monitored.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 130/58 mmHg and a heart rate of 90 bpm. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress noted during the physical examination. The peripheral pulses are diminished in both lower extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 6.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.4 g/dL, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 115 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances. Other lab results are within normal limits"

She was admitted to the ICU for an evaluation of seizures and found to have complete heart block with a ventricular pause of 8 seconds in the emergency department. The patient also experienced intermittent AV block in the past few weeks, causing episodes of fatigue. Etiology includes ischemia, viral myocarditis, Lyme disease, endocarditis, thyroid disease, or paroxysmal AV block.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 59 bpm (within normal range), blood pressure ranging from 105/58mmHg to 75/37mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is currently sinus bradycardia.

The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes type 1, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) due to neurogenic bladder, hepatitis C, and a recent small perfusion defect in the left anterior descending (LAD) region on a stress test. She has been treated with medical management by Dr. [Last Name (Title)].

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and neurogenic bladder. She was admitted to the ICU for a seizure evaluation and was found to have complete heart block with ventricular pauses. The patient has been experiencing intermittent atrioventricular (AV) block in the past few weeks, resulting in episodes of fatigue. Etiology of the AV block may include ischemia, viral myocarditis, Lyme disease, endocarditis, thyroid disease, or paroxysmal AV block.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Complete heart block: The patient's current condition of complete heart block with ventricular pauses poses a significant risk for hemodynamic instability and potential cardiac arrest if not appropriately managed.
2. AV block: The intermittent AV block experienced by the patient over the past few weeks can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, and even syncope if left untreated.
3. Ischemia: If the AV block is caused by ischemia, there is a risk of further myocardial damage and potential progression to heart failure.
4. Infection: The presence of fever, chills, and elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection, which could worsen the patient's overall condition.
5. Renal function: The patient's history of ESRD and current elevated creatinine levels require close monitoring of renal function to ensure proper management of immunosuppression and"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post coronary revascularization therapy (CRT) x 2, neurogenic bladder with frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs), and a recent seizure episode.

The patient was admitted to the ICU for evaluation of a ventricular pause in the emergency department (ED). The EKG showed complete heart block with a pause in ventricular beats for 8 seconds, during which the patient had p waves. It is likely that the patient has been experiencing intermittent atrioventricular (AV) block in the past few weeks, resulting in episodes of fatigue. The possible etiologies include ischemia, viral myocarditis, Lyme disease, endocarditis, thyroid disease, or paroxysmal AV block.

The patient underwent a temporal wire placement overnight and had episodes of hypotension correlating with runs of ventricular pacing without native beats. The pacing spikes on the native QRS were dysynchronous. A cardiology fellow adjusted the pacer, increasing sensitivity from 1.5 to 5 and decreasing the pacing rate from 60 to 50. No further episodes of pacing or hypotension occurred.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/58 mmHg to 75/37 mmHg,"

   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2165-10-20**] 09:50 PM
   Patient became hypotensive to BP 70/40s at 2100 --> total 2 L fluid
   boluses followed by 1+L maintenance fluids.  She also c/o headache and
   dizziness at that time.  Review of telemetry showed dyssinchronous
   pacing spikes on native qrs as well as runs of ventricular pacing
   without native beats.  It seemed that her hypotension was correlating
   with runs of V pacing.
   Cardiology fellow came and adjusted pacer, increased sensitivity from
   1.5 to 5 and decreased pacing rate from 60 to 50. No further episodes
   of pacing or hypotension.
   This AM, patient denies HA, dizziness, chest pain or other complaints.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 48-year-old female with diabetes type 1, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) status post coronary revascularization therapy (CRT) x 2, and neurogenic bladder. She was admitted for seizure evaluation and found to have ventricular pause in the emergency department (ED). The patient demonstrated complete heart block with a pause in ventricular beats for 8 seconds in the ED. She likely has been experiencing intermittent atrioventricular (AV) block in the past couple of weeks, resulting in episodes of fatigue. The possible etiologies include ischemia, viral myocarditis, Lyme disease, endocarditis, thyroid disease, or paroxysmal AV block. 

During the night, the patient became hypotensive with a blood pressure of 70/40s. She also complained of headache and dizziness at that time. Review of telemetry showed dyssynchronous pacing spikes on native QRS as well as runs of ventricular pacing without native beats. The hypotension correlated with runs of V pacing. The cardiology fellow adjusted the pacer, increasing sensitivity from 1.5 to 5 and decreasing pacing rate from 60 to 50. No further episodes of pacing or hypotension occurred.

This morning, the patient denies headache, dizziness, chest pain, or other complaints. Her allergies include beta-blockers. She is receiving infusions of Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications.
