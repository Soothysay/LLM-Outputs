","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a 3-week history of severe angina and dyspnea. The patient's medication adjustments involving beta-blockers and lasix were made. Today, the patient experienced somnolence that worsened, leading to admission to the CHF service. Notable labs included creatinine 1.9 and BNP 11K.

On the floor, the patient became unresponsive and had an ABG of 7.29/62/106. The patient was then transferred to the ICU, where the ABG improved to 7.36/54/118. The patient's mental status remains poor, and the patient is unable to provide a history.

The patient has a medical history of CHF, chronic AF, and hypothyroidism. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for severe angina and dyspnea. The flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support.

The physical examination revealed normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat; normal cardiovascular sounds; crackles in the respiratory/chest area; benign abdomen; chronic venous stasis changes in the skin; and unresponsive neurologic examination.

Lab results showed a creatinine level of 1.9, BNP level of 11K, TCO2 of 32, and other labs including CK/CKMB/Troponin-T within normal limits. Fluid analysis and imaging results"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of severe angina, dyspnea, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism. He presented to the emergency room with worsening somnolence and was admitted to the CHF service. Notable labs included creatinine 1.9 and BNP 11K. On the floor, he became unresponsive and was transferred to the ICU. In the ICU, his mental status remains poor, and his ABG shows pH 7.36, PaCO2 54, and PaO2 118. The patient is currently on various medications and infusions in the ICU. His vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing hypoventilation. The assessment and plan include collecting a head CT, following ABG, and using BiPAP if hypoventilation worsens. The patient's CHF is being held on diuresis until kidney dysfunction is resolved.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoventilation: The patient's ABG shows a PaCO2 of 54, indicating hypoventilation. If left untreated, this can lead to respiratory acidosis and further deterioration in mental status.
2. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.9, suggesting impaired kidney function. This can potentially worsen if not properly managed.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a"

Neurologic examination shows no attentiveness, inability to follow simple commands, and no assessed movement or tone. Lab results indicate a TCO2 level of 32 and lactic acid level of 1.9 mmol/L. The patient is currently receiving IV Synthroid and has shown improvement in mental status. Further investigations include an MRI head due to a suspected facial droop and monitoring for hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's CHF will be managed by the CHF service, and diuresis will be held for now. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the"

   2. Multiple simple bilateral renal cysts.
   3. Distal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
   4. Ascites.
   CT Head:
   IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema. No fracture.
   But with apparent post surgical changes in the right mastoid bone.
   CXR:
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is no relevant
   change. Large hiatal hernia, unchanged pulmonary edema, unchanged
   bilateral pleural effusions that distribute in a slightly different
   fashion but are overall unchanged in extent. Unchanged moderate
   cardiomegaly.
   No evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities, no
   pneumothorax.
   ECHO:
   The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. No
   atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is severe
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
   small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
   (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls
   and hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is markedly
   dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is
   moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Mild to moderate ([**2-1**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
   structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: severe biventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction;
   severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with a small cavity

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with CHF, hypothyroidism, afib not on coumadin presents with
   history consistent with unstable angina, and had rapildy worsening of
   her mental status on the Floor prior to transfer to ICU.
   # Altered mental status: Differential is broad, but may be related to
   toxic metabolic process given renal failure, reported LFT
   abnormalities, and hypercarbia. Given history of angina, ACS must be
   evoked as well. However, patient does not reportedly had CAD history.
   Exam concerning given facial droop, but improves when awake. Per report
   patient did have some LEFT sided weakness on Exam in ED prior to mental
   status decline. Additionally, patient is Afib without coumadin, putting
   him at higher CVA risk. Also patient has been inadvertently off of
   synthroid for the last 3 weeks. Finally, CXR might be suspicious for
   recent aspiration event.
   - Synthroid restarted
   - Add on LFTs
   - NPO for now and consider S and S consult if MS improved
   - Hold off on abx for now given patient afebrile
   - Correct electrolytes as appropriate
   - F/u urine, blood and sputum cultures
   - Cycle enzymes
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: CO2 improved from 62 to 54 without
   intervention. Seems that CO2 is likely a side effect of the altered
   mental status, and not vice versa. Likely an acute process given that
   ph corrects to 7.45 with CO2 of 40. AG only 11.
   - Continue to follow respiratory status; if worsens will get ABG
   - Defer BIpap for now
   # CHF: Exam consistent with CHF given edema, elevated JVP, and
   irregular rhythm. Given unknown baseline of CR, will defer diuresis for
   now. Will also defer betablockers and ace-i given history of prior
   sensitivies. Cards consulted, did not have any new recommendations.
   - Will not diurese because he is preload dependent.
   - Monitor of tele
   # A fib: Rate controlled for now. Not on coumadin at baseline despite
   CHADS of at least 2.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Cards recommended not beta-blocking given dCHF and hypothyroidism.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet although poor PO
   intake
   - If continues not taking [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] consider NG tube placement

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation (afib) who presented with unstable angina and rapidly worsening mental status. The patient's current condition is characterized by altered mental status, hypercarbic respiratory failure, CHF, and afib. The patient is not currently taking Coumadin despite having at least two CHADS factors. The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, cyanosis, and cold extremities. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 93/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, BUN, and lactate, as well as low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's ECG shows severe biventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with a small cavity, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. The patient has been restarted on Synthroid, and LFTs are being monitored. The patient is NPO at the moment and will be followed up with urine, blood, and sputum cultures. Electrolytes will be corrected as appropriate, and the patient's respiratory"

   87 yo M with CHF, hypothyroidism, afib not on coumadin presents with

   her mental status on the Floor prior to transfer to ICU.
   # Altered mental status: Differential is broad, but may be related to
   toxic metabolic process given renal failure, reported LFT
   abnormalities, and hypercarbia. Given history of angina, ACS must be
   evoked as well. However, patient does not reportedly had CAD history.
   Exam concerning given facial droop, but improves when awake. Per report
   patient did have some LEFT sided weakness on EXam in ED prior to mental
   status decline. Additionally, patient is Afib without coumadin, putting
   him at higher CVA risk. Also patient has been inadvertently off of
   synthroid for the last 3 weeks. Finally, CXR might be suspicious for
   recent aspiration event.
   - CT head stat to r/o CVA, and may require MRI
   - Add on LFTs
   - Add on TFTs and restart synthroid
   - NPO for now and consider S and S consult if MS improved
   - Hold off on abx for now given patient afebrile
   - Correct electrolytes as apporpopriate
   - Send urine, blood and sputum cultures
   - Cycle enzymes
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: CO2 improved from 62 to 54 without
   intervention. Seems that CO2 is likely a side effect of the altered
   mental status, and not vice versa. Likely an acute process given that
   ph corrects to 7.45 with CO2 of 40. AG only 11.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation (afib) who presented with a history consistent with unstable angina. The patient's mental status rapidly deteriorated prior to transfer to the ICU. The patient has been off of synthroid for the past three weeks and has a history of not taking prescribed medications. The patient's examination revealed facial droop, left-sided weakness, and signs consistent with CHF. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 93/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently on prophylactic heparin and has multiple medications being held or adjusted due to various reasons.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's rapid deterioration in mental status could be attributed to several factors including toxic metabolic processes, renal failure, reported liver function abnormalities, and hypercarbia. Additionally, given the patient's history of angina, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should also be considered. However, the patient does not have a reported history of coronary artery disease (CAD).

2. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA): The patient's facial droop and left-sided weakness on examination raise concerns for a possible stroke. Further evaluation with a CT scan or MRI is"

   2. Multiple simple bilateral renal cysts.
   3. Distal abdominal aortic aneurysm.
   4. Ascites.
   CT Head:
   IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema. No fracture.
   But with apparent post surgical changes in the right mastoid bone.
   CXR:
   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there is no relevant
   change. Large hiatal hernia, unchanged pulmonary edema, unchanged
   bilateral pleural effusions that distribute in a slightly different
   fashion but are overall unchanged in extent. Unchanged moderate
   cardiomegaly.
   No evidence of newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities, no
   pneumothorax.
   ECHO:
   The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated. No
   atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is severe
   symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
   small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
   (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to akinesis of the inferior and posterior walls
   and hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle. There is no
   ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is markedly
   dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is
   moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Mild to moderate ([**2-1**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
   structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+]
   tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with CHF, hypothyroidism, afib not on coumadin presents with
   history consistent with unstable angina, and had rapildy worsening of
   her mental status on the Floor prior to transfer to ICU.
   # Altered mental status: Differential is broad, but may be related to
   toxic metabolic process given renal failure, reported LFT
   abnormalities, and hypercarbia. Given history of angina, ACS must be
   evoked as well. However, patient does not reportedly had CAD history.
   Exam concerning given facial droop, but improves when awake. Per report
   patient did have some LEFT sided weakness on Exam in ED prior to mental
   status decline. Additionally, patient is Afib without coumadin, putting
   him at higher CVA risk. Also patient has been inadvertently off of
   synthroid for the last 3 weeks. Finally, CXR might be suspicious for
   recent aspiration event.
   - Synthroid restarted
   - Add on LFTs
   - NPO for now and consider S and S consult if MS improved
   - Hold off on abx for now given patient afebrile
   - Correct electrolytes as appropriate
   - F/u urine, blood and sputum cultures
   - Cycle enzymes
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: CO2 improved from 62 to 54 without
   intervention. Seems that CO2 is likely a side effect of the altered
   mental status, and not vice versa. Likely an acute process given that
   ph corrects to 7.45 with CO2 of 40. AG only 11.
   - Continue to follow respiratory status; if worsens will get ABG
   - Defer BIpap for now
   # CHF: Exam consistent with CHF given edema, elevated JVP, and
   irregular rhythm. Given unknown baseline of CR, will defer diuresis for
   now. Will also defer betablockers and ace-i given history of prior
   sensitivies. Cards consulted, did not have any new recommendations.
   - Will not diurese because he is preload dependent.
   - Monitor of tele
   # A fib: Rate controlled for now. Not on coumadin at baseline despite
   CHADS of at least 2.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Cards recommended not beta-blocking given dCHF and hypothyroidism.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet although poor PO
   intake
   - If continues not taking [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] consider NG tube placement

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation (afib) who presents with unstable angina and rapidly worsening mental status. The patient is not on coumadin, putting him at higher risk for cerebrovascular accidents. Additionally, the patient has been inadvertently off of synthroid for the last three weeks.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97%), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 93/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's current medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles bilaterally in the lungs, right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, cyanosis, and coldness in the extremities. The patient is sedated and barely arousable with a response to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show leukocyte count of 6.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 16.7 g/dL, glucose of 98 mg/dL, sodium of 135 mEq/L, potassium of 4.6 mEq/L, chloride of 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 32 mEq/L, BUN of 39 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, calcium of 9.7 mg/dL, magnesium of 2.4 mg/dL, phosphate of 4.6 mg/dL, total bilirubin of 3.4 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 86 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 29 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 18 U/L, lactate of 1.9 mmol/L, and prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) of 18.7/35.0/1.7, respectively.

Imaging studies reveal a tiny punctate focus of susceptibility in the right cerebellum, which could be a microhemorrhage, and suboptimal MRA of the head and neck due to the patient's inability to cooperate in the scanner and motion. The RUQ ultrasound shows gallbladder likely entirely filled with small stones, no biliary dilatation, multiple simple bilateral renal cysts, distal abdominal aortic aneurysm, and ascites. The CT head shows no intracranial hemorrhage or edema, no fracture, but apparent post-surgical changes in the right mastoid bone. The chest X-ray shows large hiatal hernia, unchanged pulmonary edema, unchanged bilateral pleural eff"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a chief complaint of mental status changes, congestive heart failure (CHF), and hypothyroidism. He presented with a history consistent with unstable angina and rapidly worsening mental status before being transferred to the ICU. The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests including a trans-thoracic echo, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). His vital signs are within normal range, except for atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, right and left lower extremity edema, and he is non-tender and obese in the abdomen. Neurological assessment shows that the patient is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, and is somnolent. Lab results indicate elevated levels of potassium, creatinine, and white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory support indicates hypercarbic respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is necessary.
2. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CHF and AF, there is a risk of further cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest. Monitoring of heart rhythm and cardiac function should be continued.
3. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and edema. Prophylactic measures like SQ UF Heparin"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with CHF, hypothyroidism, afib not on coumadin presents with
   history consistent with unstable angina, and had rapildy worsening of
   her mental status on the Floor prior to transfer to ICU.
   # Altered mental status: Significantly improved. Differential is broad,
   but likely due to hypothyroidism. [**Month (only) 51**] be related to toxic metabolic
   process given renal failure, reported LFT abnormalities, and
   hypercarbia. Given history of angina, ACS must be evoked as well.
   However, patient does not reportedly had CAD history. Exam concerning
   given facial droop, but improves when awake. Per report patient did
   have some LEFT sided weakness on Exam in ED prior to mental status
   decline. Additionally, patient is Afib without coumadin, putting him at
   higher CVA risk. Also patient has been inadvertently off of synthroid
   for the last 3 weeks. Finally, CXR might be suspicious for recent
   aspiration event.
   - Continuing synthroid
   - Speech and swallow consult
   - Advance to clears while up in chair
   - Correct electrolytes as appropriate
   - F/u urine, blood and sputum cultures
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: CO2 improved from 62 to 54 without
   intervention. Seems that CO2 is likely a side effect of the altered
   mental status, and not vice versa. Likely an acute process given that
   ph corrects to 7.45 with CO2 of 40. AG only 11.
   -          Continue to follow respiratory status; if worsens will get
   ABG
   -          Levaquin q48h; started on [**4-18**]. To end on [**4-25**]. Low
   suspicion for PNA.
   # CHF: Exam consistent with CHF given edema, elevated JVP, and
   irregular rhythm. Given unknown baseline of CR, will defer diuresis for
   now. Will also defer betablockers and ace-i given history of prior
   sensitivies. Cards consulted, did not have any new recommendations.
   - Will not diurese because he is preload dependent.
   - Monitor on tele
   # A fib: Rate controlled for now. Not on coumadin at baseline despite
   CHADS of at least 2.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Cards recommended not beta-blocking given dCHF and hypothyroidism.
   # Hypothyroidism
   -          Change today to PO synthroid
   -          Will have out-patient TFTs for follow-up
   # Hyperbilirubinemia
unclear etiology. No clear abdominal pain. [**Month (only) 51**]
   have congestive hepatopathy for CHF
   - Check indirect bilirubin to ensure he is not hemolysing
   # Polycythemia
elevated MCV
   -          Follow-up folate, B12 studies
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, advance to clears, speech and
   swallow eval and if does well will advance to a regular diet.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation (afib) who presents with altered mental status, edema in both lower extremities, and potential signs of respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about his cardiac function, renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and possible aspiration. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to crackles in the lungs and diminished breath sounds, indicating possible fluid accumulation. This can lead to respiratory failure if not addressed.
2. Hypothyroidism: The patient's mental status improvement is likely due to hypothyroidism. Continuing synthroid and following up with thyroid function tests (TFTs) is important to manage this condition.
3. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient's elevated CO2 levels suggest hypercarbic respiratory failure. This condition needs to be corrected promptly, and further ABG analysis may be required.
4. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's exam findings are consistent with CHF, including edema and elevated JVP. Monitoring his cardiac status and avoiding diuresis due to preload dependency are necessary.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: Rate control is essential for this patient with a history of afib. Monitoring on telemetry and considering anticoagulation therapy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C (96.6°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 132/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient has no known drug allergies and is currently receiving prophylactic heparin sodium. The patient's weight is 100 kg. 

The patient attempted to eat with observation but was unable to tolerate a nasogastric tube, so tube feeds were not started. Instead, the patient was allowed to eat a little, which went well. The patient's pressures were low in the afternoon but rose as he started drinking fluids. The patient drank a lot of fluid and appeared more alert and responsive.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events mentioned above. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on anticoagulation therapy.

Flowsheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 1,050 mL of fluids since 29 AM, with 900 mL given orally, 150 mL through IV fluids, and 120 mL through nasogastric tube. The patient's output includes 500 mL of urine, 85 mL of blood products, and 550 mL of stool.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with CHF, hypothyroidism, afib not on coumadin presents with
   history consistent with unstable angina, and had rapildy worsening of
   her mental status on the Floor prior to transfer to ICU.
   # Altered mental status: Differential is broad, but may be related to
   toxic metabolic process given renal failure, reported LFT
   abnormalities, and hypercarbia. Given history of angina, ACS must be
   evoked as well. However, patient does not reportedly had CAD history.
   Exam concerning given facial droop, but improves when awake. Per report
   patient did have some LEFT sided weakness on Exam in ED prior to mental
   status decline. Additionally, patient is Afib without coumadin, putting
   him at higher CVA risk. Also patient has been inadvertently off of
   synthroid for the last 3 weeks. Finally, CXR might be suspicious for
   recent aspiration event.
   - Synthroid restarted
   - Add on LFTs
   - NPO for now and consider S and S consult if MS improved
   - Hold off on abx for now given patient afebrile
   - Correct electrolytes as appropriate
   - F/u urine, blood and sputum cultures
   - Cycle enzymes
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: CO2 improved from 62 to 54 without
   intervention. Seems that CO2 is likely a side effect of the altered
   mental status, and not vice versa. Likely an acute process given that
   ph corrects to 7.45 with CO2 of 40. AG only 11.
   - Continue to follow respiratory status; if worsens will get ABG
   - Defer Bipap for now
   # CHF: Exam consistent with CHF given edema, elevated JVP, and
   irregular rhythm. Given unknown baseline of CR, will defer diuresis for
   now. Will also defer betablockers and ace-i given history of prior
   sensitivies. Cards consulted, did not have any new recommendations.
   - Will not diurese because he is preload dependent.
   - Monitor of tele
   # A fib: Rate controlled for now. Not on coumadin at baseline despite
   CHADS of at least 2.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Cards recommended not beta-blocking given dCHF and hypothyroidism.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet although poor PO
   intake
   - If continues not taking [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] consider NG tube placement

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation (afib) who presents with unstable angina and rapidly worsening mental status. He has been off of his thyroid medication for the past three weeks. The patient's physical examination shows bilateral crackles in the lungs, edema in both lower extremities, cyanosis, and cold extremities. His vital signs are stable, but he has an irregularly irregular heart rhythm. Laboratory results indicate renal failure, elevated liver enzymes, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and there are concerns about potential aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's initial CO2 level was 62, which improved to 54 without intervention. Close monitoring of respiratory status is required, and further ABG may be necessary if there is worsening.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient has a history of renal failure, and his current renal function needs to be closely monitored.
3. CHF exacerbation: The patient's physical examination findings suggest CHF, and careful monitoring of his fluid status and consideration of diuretics may be necessary.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's irregular heart rhythm needs to be managed, and rate control should be achieved.
5. Hypothyroidism: Restarting the patient's thyroid medication is crucial, as he has been"

   but may be related to toxic metabolic process given renal failure,
   reported LFT abnormalities, and hypercarbia. Given history of angina,
   ACS must be evoked as well. However, patient does not reportedly had
   CAD history. Exam concerning given facial droop, but improves when
   awake. Per report patient did have some LEFT sided weakness on Exam in
   ED prior to mental status decline. Additionally, patient is Afib
   without coumadin, putting him at higher CVA risk. Also patient has been
   inadvertently off of synthroid for the last 3 weeks. Finally, CXR might
   be suspicious for recent aspiration event.
   - Synthroid restarted
   - NPO for now and consider S and S consult if MS improved
   - Correct electrolytes as appropriate
   - F/u urine, blood and sputum cultures
   # Hypercarbic respiratory failure: CO2 improved from 62 to 54 without
   intervention. Seems that CO2 is likely a side effect of the altered
   mental status, and not vice versa. Likely an acute process given that
   ph corrects to 7.45 with CO2 of 40. AG only 11.
   - Continue to follow respiratory status; if worsens will get ABG
   - Defer Bipap for now
   # CHF: Exam consistent with CHF given edema, elevated JVP, and
   irregular rhythm. Given unknown baseline of CR, will defer diuresis for
   now. Will also defer betablockers and ace-i given history of prior
   sensitivies. Cards consulted, did not have any new recommendations.
   - Will not diurese because he is preload dependent.
   - Monitor of tele
   # A fib: Rate controlled for now. Not on coumadin at baseline despite
   CHADS of at least 2.
   - Monitor on tele
   - Cards recommended not beta-blocking given dCHF and hypothyroidism.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet although poor PO
   intake

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypothyroidism, and atrial fibrillation (AFib). He presented with symptoms consistent with unstable angina and rapidly worsening mental status before being transferred to the ICU. The patient is currently on a 5-day course of Levofloxacin and Synthroid for his hypothyroidism. His vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/70 to 137/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient has crackles at the right base of his lungs, edema in both lower extremities, and positive venous stasis changes. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid levels. Other lab results are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothyroidism: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to his hypothyroidism. It is essential to monitor his thyroid hormone levels and continue with appropriate Synthroid dosing.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient's history of AFib and current heart rate in the 80s indicate the need for close monitoring of his cardiac rhythm and potential management"
