","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and restrictive lung disease, presenting with severe lupus-induced cardiomyopathy. She has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% and increased left ventricular cavity size. The patient also has worsening renal function with a creatinine level of 2.9 and evidence of prerenal ischemia. She is currently in the ICU receiving supportive care, including milrinone for heart failure, and is on a renal dose of medications. The patient's medical history includes diagnoses of SLE, membranous nephropathy, Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, and pleuritis. She is being treated with high-dose steroids and consideration for immunosuppressive therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to severe lupus-induced cardiomyopathy and reduced EF.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to worsening renal function and evidence of prerenal ischemia.
3. Infection due to immunosuppressive therapy and prolonged ICU stay.
4. Thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and anticoagulation therapy.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding from stress ulcer prophylaxis.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name **] or health care proxy. I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 9220**] and [**Doctor Last Name 3068**] from rheumatology and
   renal, respectively. Progress reviewed extensively during family
   meeting.
   Total time spent on patient care: 80 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   Cardiac index is markedly improved on milrinone.  This is an excellent
   sign, as it indicates significant contractile reserve.  Hemodynamically
   stable.  Unfortunately, the creat continues to rise, and she remains
   oliguric.  This is due to the underlying lupus nephritis (in acute on
   chronic phase) as well as reduced effective arterial volume.  Now that
   she is on milrinone, her pulmonary vascular  and alveolar edema have
   resolved.  Her last PAD was 5 mmHg and her last RA pressure was - 2
   mmHg despite oliguria/anuria.  This indicated that the augmented
   cardiac output has completely resolved all of her venous congestion and
   now she can handle, in fact, requires more fluids.
   Therefore we will give iv fluid boluses PLUS Lasix gtt simultaneously.
   I consider this to be a sort of crisis period which, if patient can be
   sustained, will end in a reasonable hope for cardiac, and hopefully
   renal, recovery.  Therefore, maximal immunosuppressive therapy will be
   implemented, including high dose glucocorticoid, cyclophosphamide,
   plasmapheresis.  Continue milrinone.  Check echocardiogram today, and
   ambx when available.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), presenting with severe lupus-induced cardiomyopathy. She also has restrictive lung disease and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%. The patient's renal function is worsening, with an increased creatinine level from 1.4 on admission to 2.9 today. She is oliguric and experiencing mild abdominal discomfort without bowel movements since yesterday. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has a fever of 36.6°C (97.8°F). Her blood pressure is within normal limits, and she is on milrinone infusion to maintain cardiac output. The patient has been diagnosed with acute on chronic renal failure due to SLE nephritis, with a repeat biopsy showing type 3,4,5 lupus nephritis. She is receiving symptomatic management for nausea and diarrhea.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiorenal syndrome: The patient's poor cardiac output may lead to further worsening of renal function, causing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to SLE and immunosuppressive medications increases the risk of infections, particularly in the urinary tract or respiratory system.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's oliguria and low urine output indicate a possible fluid"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who presents with severe lupus-induced cardiomyopathy, restrictive lung disease, and chronic renal failure secondary to SLE nephritis. 

The patient's current condition includes low urine output (oliguria) and worsening renal function. She has been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, as evidenced by an echocardiogram showing a decreased ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% and increased left ventricular cavity size. Additionally, right ventricular dysfunction is present. A heart catheterization revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 33, pulmonary artery saturation (PA sat) of 37%, and cardiac index (CI) of 1.35. The patient is currently on milrinone, with a goal systemic blood pressure (SBP) >80 mmHg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg, and CI of 2.

The patient also has a history of SLE with manifestations including kidney disease, facial rash, Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, and pleuritis. She is being followed by a rheumatologist, and it is planned to start her on solumedrol and consider cytoxan after consulting with the rheumatologist.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, collagen vascular disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and cardiomyopathy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/67 to 120/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving dialysis through a tunneled line placed in the inferior vena cava. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels and slightly low potassium levels. The patient's WBC count is within normal range, but the platelet count is slightly low. The patient's electrolytes and other lab values are mostly within normal limits. The patient's recent ABG results show a pH of 7.18. The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular issues, and neurologic assessment is incomplete due to the patient's unresponsiveness. The patient has been receiving various medications including Compazine, Zosyn, and other ICU medications. The patient's weight has decreased from 71 kg at admission to 68.4 kg currently. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 879 mL, output of 222 mL, and a positive balance of 657 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's respiratory support consists"

   #. Cardiomyopathy: Pt with ECHO on [**10-11**] that showed worsening EF of
   15-20% with increased LV cavity size has increased and more prominent
   RV dysfunction. Pt with heart cath that showed PCWP of 33, PA sat of
   37% and CI of 1.35.  Given the patient's severe SLE she is not a
   transplant candidate.  Unclear if she has lupus induced cardiomyopathy
   (typically [**12-20**] myocarditis) or a peripartum cardiomyopathy.  ECHO has
   shown some improvement of EF.   However, this is in the setting of
   milrinone.  ECHO also showed no evidence of [**Doctor Last Name 10280**] [**Doctor Last Name 9386**]
   endocarditis.   Improvement in cardiac reserve suggests that she could
   potentially do well if source of her heart failure is treated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), presenting with cardiomyopathy, acute on chronic renal failure, and anemia. She is currently in the ICU for management of her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15-20% and right ventricular dysfunction. This can lead to further heart failure exacerbations and potential arrhythmias.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function, with a creatinine level of 3.7, indicates the need for careful fluid balance management and consideration for dialysis. There is also a risk of developing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to poor cardiac output.
3. Anemia: With a hematocrit (Hct) level of 26.9%, the patient requires close monitoring and may require transfusion support.
4. Nausea/Diarrhea: The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms are likely due to edema from heart failure, but other causes such as hepatic congestion should also be considered.
5. Infection Risk: Given the patient's immunosuppressed state due to SLE and ongoing treatment, she is at increased risk for infections. Prophylactic measures, such as stress ulcer prophylaxis and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) proph"

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), presenting with cardiomyopathy, acute on chronic renal failure, and anemia. She has been admitted to the ICU for management of her conditions. The patient's cardiac function has shown some improvement with the use of milrinone, but her renal function has worsened, with a creatinine level of 3.7. She is planned for dialysis today. Her anemia is being managed with transfusion goals of 23. She also has nausea and diarrhea, which are thought to be due to edema of the GI system from heart failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiomyopathy may lead to further deterioration in cardiac function, resulting in heart failure or arrhythmias.
2. Renal complications: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure could progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately, requiring renal replacement therapy such as dialysis or kidney transplantation.
3. Anemia-related complications: The patient's anemia could lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, or other symptoms associated with decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.
4. Infections: Due to immunosuppressive therapy, the patient may be at increased risk of infections, including urinary tract infections, pneumonia, or sepsis.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's nausea and diarrhea could wors"

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and acute on chronic renal failure. She presented with cardiomyopathy, characterized by a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% and increased left ventricular cavity size. The patient also has evidence of right ventricular dysfunction. She underwent a heart catheterization that revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 33 mmHg, pulmonary artery saturation (PA sat) of 37%, and cardiac index (CI) of 1.35. 

Due to her severe SLE, the patient is not a candidate for heart transplantation. It is unclear whether she has lupus-induced cardiomyopathy or peripartum cardiomyopathy. However, there has been some improvement in her cardiac reserve, suggesting that she could potentially do well if the source of her heart failure is treated. Presumably, lupus is the source of her heart failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 yo F with SLE, restrictive lung disease, CM (EF 15-20%) presents
   with severe lupus induced cardiomyopathy.
   #. Cardiomyopathy: Pt with ECHO on [**10-11**] that showed worsening EF of
   15-20% with increased LV cavity size has increased and more prominent
   RV dysfunction. Pt with heart cath that showed PCWP of 33, PA sat of
   37% and CI of 1.35.  Given the patient's severe SLE she is not a
   transplant candidate.  Unclear if she has lupus induced cardiomyopathy
   (typically [**12-20**] myocarditis) or a peripartum cardiomyopathy.  Treating
   for Lupus myocarditis induced myopathy.  ECHO has shown some
   improvement of EF, in the setting of milrinone.  However, CI has
   improved off of the milrinone and Swan Ganz now d/c'd.  Pt
   hemodynamically stable, believe she is perfusing her kidneys well and
   urine output is now moderate.
   - Completed  1g solumedrol x3 days, continue with solumedrol 1mg/kg
   daily

   #. SLE: Pt diagnosed in [**2168**], manifested by kidney disease previously
   membranous nephropathy, facial rash, Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's
   phenomenon, and pleuritis.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10980**] at B&W.  Now s/p
   cytoxan, expect to see drop in platelets (pt has h/o ITP) and
   neutropenia.   Expect to see response in 10 days.

   - lupus anticoagulant negative
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt with h/o SLE Nephritis. Pt
   previously with membranous nephropathy on prior biopsy.  She had repeat
   biopsy showing type 3,4,5 lupus nephritis.  Worsening renal failure
   with creatinine increased to 3.7 today up from 1.4 on admission.  Urine
   lytes indicative of prerenal ischemia (FeUrea < 0.02%) +/- evolving
   ATN  likely from poor cardiac output/ cardiorenal syndrome.  renal U/S
   show's no obstruction.   Expect to see some improvement with treatmetn
   of lupus as above.

   #Anemia - Hct 29 s/p dialysis, improved from nadir of 26.6.  Suggesting
   dilution is a significant component.  [**Month (only) 60**] be contributed by phelbotomy,
   low erythropoeisis in setting of active lupus, steroid/cytoxan tx.
   - T&S, Goal to transfuse is 23.
   #. Nausea/Diarrhea: Most likely due to edema of the GI system from
   heart failure.  Transaminitis can also be attributed to hepatic
   congestion. No evidence of portal thrombosis.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   35 year old asian female with history of SLE as well as Scleroderma now
   presents with CHF in the setting of a Lupus flair and resultant
   cardiomyopathy. EF decreased to 15% at it's lowest and post-milrinone
   and IV solumedrol has increased to 25-30%. Pathology of RV biopsy
   demonstrates lymphocyic inflitrate preliminarily. Patient is now on
   Solumedrol 30 mg Q 12 hours and is receiving plasma exchange with a
   planned course of every other day for a total of 5 treatments. She
   received a one time dose of Cytoxan by rheum yesterday and is
   tolerating this well. She has some blood tinged urine which is being
   irrigated with a 3 lumen foley and bladder washes. She is off Milrinone
   and breathing is much improved today as she is able to lye flat. I/O
   are -1600 in 24 hours.
   Physical Examination
   lungs - rales half up on right and at base on left
   heart - RR no murmer
   Ext - min bilateral edema
   Medical Decision Making
   Will plan for ongoin PEX today and QOD for a total of 5 treatments.
   Will follow-up final result of the RV biopsy. Follow createnine closely
   as it does not appear that she is making more than 10 cc/hour but this
   is difficult to assess given bladder washes. Follow right vascath site
   as it continues to ooze and is very painful. Plan for re-echo next
   week.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   35 year old asian female with history of SLE as well as Scleroderma now
   presents with CHF in the setting of a Lupus flair and resultant
   cardiomyopathy. EF decreased to 15% at it's lowest and post-milrinone
   and IV solumedrol has increased to 25-30%. Pathology of RV biopsy
   demonstrates lymphocyic inflitrate preliminarily. Patient is now on
   Solumedrol 30 mg Q 12 hours and is receiving plasma exchange with a
   planned course of every other day for a total of 5 treatments. She
   received a one time dose of Cytoxan by rheum yesterday and is
   tolerating this well. She has some blood tinged urine which is being
   irrigated with a 3 lumen foley and bladder washes. She is off Milrinone
   and breathing is much improved today as she is able to lye flat. I/O
   are -1600 in 24 hours.
   Physical Examination
   lungs - rales half up on right and at base on left
   heart - RR no murmer
   Ext - min bilateral edema
   Medical Decision Making
   Will plan for ongoin PEX today and QOD for a total of 5 treatments.
   Will follow-up final result of the RV biopsy. Follow createnine closely
   as it does not appear that she is making more than 10 cc/hour but this
   is difficult to assess given bladder washes. Follow right vascath site
   as it continues to ooze and is very painful. Plan for re-echo next
   week.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) and scleroderma. She presents with CHF (Congestive Heart Failure) in the setting of a lupus flare and resultant cardiomyopathy. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has decreased to 15% at its lowest but has improved post-milrinone and IV solumedrol to 25-30%. The RV (right ventricular) biopsy shows a lymphocytic infiltrate.

The patient is currently on solumedrol 30 mg Q 12 hours and receiving plasma exchange with a planned course of every other day for a total of 5 treatments. She received a one-time dose of Cytoxan by rheum yesterday and is tolerating it well. The patient has some blood-tinged urine, which is being irrigated with a 3-lumen Foley and bladder washes. She is off milrinone and her breathing has improved today as she is able to lie flat. Her I/O (intake/output) are -1600 in 24 hours.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 77 bpm (69-94 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 115/81 mmHg to 123/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths"

","The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of SLE, restrictive lung disease, and CM (EF 15-20%) presenting with severe lupus-induced cardiomyopathy. The patient has an echocardiogram showing worsening EF of 15-20% with increased LV cavity size and more prominent RV dysfunction. The heart cath revealed PCWP of 33, PASAT of 37%, and CI of 1.35. The patient is not a transplant candidate due to her severe SLE.

The patient's current medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, solubilize, cytoxan, plasmapheresis, and mesna. The plan is to continue with solumedrol 1 mg/kg daily, consider starting lasix to diurese if urine output improves to ~20-30cc/hr consistently, and follow up with rheum recs.

The patient has a history of SLE diagnosed in [**2168**], manifested by kidney disease previously membranous nephropathy, facial rash, Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, and pleuritis. The patient is currently receiving cytoxan, expecting to see a drop in platelets (due to h/o ITP) and neutropenia.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   35 year old asian female with history of SLE as well as Scleroderma now
   presents with CHF in the setting of a Lupus flair and resultant
   cardiomyopathy. EF decreased to 15% at it's lowest and post-milrinone
   and IV solumedrol has increased to 25-30%. Pathology of RV biopsy
   demonstrates lymphocyic inflitrate preliminarily. Patient is now on
   Solumedrol 30 mg Q 12 hours and is receiving plasma exchange with a
   planned course of every other day for a total of 5 treatments. She
   received a one time dose of Cytoxan by rheum yesterday and is
   tolerating this well. She has some blood tinged urine which is being
   irrigated with a 3 lumen foley and bladder washes. She is off Milrinone
   and breathing is much improved today as she is able to lye flat. I/O
   are -1600 in 24 hours.
   Physical Examination
   lungs - rales half up on right and at base on left
   heart - RR no murmer
   Ext - min bilateral edema
   Medical Decision Making
   Will plan for ongoin PEX today and QOD for a total of 5 treatments.
   Will follow-up final result of the RV biopsy. Follow createnine closely
   as it does not appear that she is making more than 10 cc/hour but this
   is difficult to assess given bladder washes. Follow right vascath site
   as it continues to ooze and is very painful. Plan for re-echo next
   week.

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of SLE and scleroderma presenting with severe lupus-induced cardiomyopathy. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently stable. Her cardiac function has improved from an ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% to 25-30% with treatment. However, her renal function has worsened with a creatinine level of 3.7. She has undergone plasma exchange and received a dose of Cytoxan. The patient also has anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 29%, likely due to dilution, phlebotomy, low erythropoiesis in active lupus, and steroid/cytoxan treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's severe lupus-induced cardiomyopathy could lead to further deterioration of cardiac function, resulting in heart failure.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function may progress to acute renal failure, requiring dialysis.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and weakness.
4. Gastrointestinal Issues: The patient may continue to experience nausea and diarrhea due to edema of the GI system from heart failure and hepatic congestion.
5. Infection: Immunosuppressive therapy and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of infection"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient experienced bleeding from the hemodialysis (HD) site, which improved with cryoprecipitate, platelets, and surgicel. The patient's platelet count is currently 79 K/uL, and she is being monitored closely for any signs of further bleeding. The healthcare team has consulted with hematology to remove aspirin (ASA), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and all heparin products due to the risk of HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia).

2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has severe lupus-induced cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%. This is evident from the echocardiogram showing worsening EF and increased left ventricular cavity size. The patient also has right ventricular dysfunction. A heart catheterization revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 33, pulmonary artery saturation (PA sat) of 37%, and cardiac index (CI) of 1.35.

   Assessment and Plan
   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   [**Known firstname 2127**] received 1 units of PLatelets and cryoppt yesterday for
   ongoing oozing at the vascath site in the right chest. Her platelet
   count is up to 75K today and the vascath oozing has ceased. All
   heparins have been removed and HIT Ab has been sent. Her low platelets
   are likely due to ITP.PLasma exchange continues and is tolerated well.
   This morning she is complaining of chest heaviness and difficulty
   breathing but her sats are 100% on RA. We will check a CXR to r/o
   pulonary edema although she has rales bilaterally on exam and bilateral
   effusions. Will also check an echo to r/o pericardial effusion. We will
   give lasix 40 mg PO today and begin carvedilol 3.125 mg PO BID. We will
   discuss with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] adding hydralazine and nitrates. She remains on
   SQ heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
   # Thrombocytopenia
 Pt bleeding from HD site yesterday, improved with
   Cryo, Platelets, and Surgicel. Heme consulted
 remove ASA, NSAIDs, all
   heparin products, f/u LFTs, fibrinogen.
   - f/u HIT Ab panel
   - trend plt
   - monitor HCT
   #. Cardiomyopathy: Pt with ECHO on [**10-11**] that showed worsening EF of
   15-20% with increased LV cavity size has increased and more prominent
   RV dysfunction. Pt with heart cath that showed PCWP of 33, PA sat of
   37% and CI of 1.35.  Given the patient's severe SLE she is not a
   transplant candidate.  Unclear if she has lupus induced cardiomyopathy
   (typically [**12-20**] myocarditis) or a peripartum cardiomyopathy.  Treating
   for Lupus myocarditis induced myopathy.  ECHO has shown some
   improvement of EF, in the setting of milrinone.  However, CI has
   improved off of the milrinone and Swan Ganz now d/c'd.  Pt
   hemodynamically stable, believe she is perfusing her kidneys well and
   urine output is now moderate.
   - Completed  1g solumedrol x3 days, continue with solumedrol 1mg/kg
   daily
   - s/p cytoxan 750mg  X 1 with mesna on [**10-20**]
   - plasmapharesis X 5 tx qod, s/p 2 tx
   - biopsy pending
   - if UOP improves to ~20-30cc/hr consistently, will consider starting
   lasix to diurese
   #. SLE: Pt diagnosed in [**2168**], manifested by kidney disease previously
   membranous nephropathy, facial rash, Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's
   phenomenon, and pleuritis.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10980**] at B&W.  Now s/p
   cytoxan, expect to see drop in platelets (pt has h/o ITP) and
   neutropenia.   Expect to see response in 10 days.
   - f/u rheum recs
   - cont ASA
   - continue steroids
   - Cont pheresis X 5 tx  Pt received 7.5mg Leupron [**10-18**] for ovarian
   protection.  Received 750mg cytoxan on [**10-20**] with mesna
   - f/u lupus labs, C3 and C4 low.  ds DNA positive 1:140.
   - lupus anticoagulant negative
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Pt with h/o SLE Nephritis. Pt
   previously with membranous nephropathy on prior biopsy.  She had repeat
   biopsy showing type 3,4,5 lupus nephritis.  Worsening renal failure
   with creatinine increased to 3.7 today up from 1.4 on admission.  Urine
   lytes indicative of prerenal ischemia (FeUrea < 0.02%) +/- evolving
   ATN  likely from poor cardiac output/ cardiorenal syndrome.  renal U/S
   show's no obstruction.   Expect to see some improvement with treatmetn
   of lupus as above.
    - f/u renal recs.  dialysis per renal team.
   - cont to trend Cr
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   #Anemia - Hct 29 s/p dialysis, improved from nadir of 26.6.  Suggesting
   dilution is a significant component.  [**Month (only) 60**] be contributed by phelbotomy,
   low erythropoeisis in setting of active lupus, steroid/cytoxan tx.
   - T&S, Goal to transfuse is 23.
   #. Nausea/Diarrhea: Most likely due to edema of the GI system from
   heart failure.  Transaminitis can also be attributed to hepatic
   congestion. No evidence of portal thrombosis.
   Symptoms have significantly improved with diuresis.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and recent diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening heart failure and acute kidney injury. The patient's medical history includes membranous nephropathy, facial rash, Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, and pleuritis. She has been treated with cyclophosphamide (cytoxan) and plasmapheresis.

The patient's current condition includes ongoing bleeding from the hemodialysis site, which has improved with cryoprecipitate and platelet transfusion. Her platelet count is currently at 79,000/uL. The patient is also experiencing chest heaviness and difficulty breathing, with rales bilaterally on examination. She has been started on Lasix and carvedilol.

The patient's laboratory results show a creatinine level of 3.4, blood glucose of 173, and a platelet count of 79,000/uL. Her electrolytes are within normal range, but her calcium level is slightly low at 8.7 mg/dL.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may lead to further bleeding complications.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's worsening ejection fraction and increased LV cavity size indicate worsening heart function"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) who is currently in the ICU. The patient's main medical complications include:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient experienced bleeding from the hemodialysis (HD) site yesterday, which improved with cryoprecipitate, platelets, and surgical. The patient has been advised to discontinue aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), all heparin products, and follow-up liver function tests (LFTs) and fibrinogen levels.

2. Chest heaviness/SOB: The patient reported symptoms of chest heaviness and shortness of breath, which are likely due to fluid overload. The patient's fluid status needs to be closely monitored, and further investigations such as a repeat chest X-ray, Lasix bolus, and echocardiogram (ECHO) need to be done to rule out pericardial effusion.

3. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has severe lupus-induced cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20%. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 33, pulmonary artery saturation (PA sat) of 37%, and cardiac index (CI) of 1.35.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been diagnosed with severe lupus-induced cardiomyopathy (SLE-CM) and is not a transplant candidate due to her severe SLE.
- An echocardiogram showed worsening left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15-20% with increased left ventricular cavity size and more prominent right ventricular dysfunction.
- A heart catheterization revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 33, pulmonary artery saturation (Pa sat) of 37%, and cardiac index (CI) of 1.35.
- The patient has been treated with intravenous milrinone and Swan-Ganz catheterization, which have improved her hemodynamics and urine output.
- She received a 1g solumedrol pulse over three days and will continue with daily solumedrol.
- The patient underwent plasmapheresis five times every other day and completed cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) 750mg on [**10-20**], with expected effects in three weeks.
- A renal biopsy is pending.
- The patient has a history of SLE with manifestations including kidney disease (membranous nephropathy), facial rash, Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, and pleuritis.
- She is being followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10980**] at B&W and is currently on steroids and pheresis.
- The patient received 7.5mg Leupron on [**10-18**] for ovarian protection.
- Laboratory results show low C3 and C4 levels, positive anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) at a titer of 1:140, and negative lupus anticoagulant.
- The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with worsening renal function, likely due to prerenal ischemia and evolving acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- A renal ultrasound showed no obstruction, and renal dosing of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins are advised.
- The patient experienced thrombocytopenia with bleeding from the hemodialysis (HD) site, but improved with cryoprecipitate, platelets, and surgicel.
- Although the likelihood of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is low, all heparin products have been discontinued.
- The patient's anemia is attributed to dilutional effects from dialysis, phlebotomy, low erythropoiesis in the setting of active lupus, and steroid/cytoxan treatment.
- Nausea and diarrhea have significantly improved with diuresis and are likely due to edema of the GI system from heart failure.
- Prophylaxis measures include DVT ppx with"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is currently admitted to the ICU. She has multiple medical complications, including cardiomyopathy, renal failure, anemia, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

The patient's cardiomyopathy is indicated by an echocardiogram showing a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. She also underwent a heart catheterization, which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 33, pulmonary artery saturation (PA sat) of 37%, and cardiac index (CI) of 1.35. The patient is not a candidate for cardiac transplantation due to her severe SLE.

Renal failure is evident from a repeat kidney biopsy showing types 3, 4, and 5 lupus nephritis. Her serum creatinine level has increased from 1.4 on admission to 3.7 today. Urine electrolytes suggest prerenal ischemia or evolving acute tubular necrosis (ATN), possibly due to poor cardiac output or cardiorenal syndrome. There is no obstruction on renal ultrasound.

The patient's anemia is likely multifactorial, involving dilutional effects from dialysis, phlebotomy, low erythropoiesis in active lupus, and steroid/cytoxan treatment. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has improved"
