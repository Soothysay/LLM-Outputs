   VBG added to f/u pH of 7.2, thought to be from opioid-induced

   24 y/o woman with SLE, stage 5 chronic kidney disease, and hypertension
   who presents in transfer from the medical floor with hypotension and
   altered mental status.
   # Hypotension: Improved after arrival to the MICU and after
   administration of naloxone. Could be related to narcosis, though
   concerning in this patient with difficult to control hypertension who
   missed several of her medications today that there is underlying
   infectious process with ? early sepsis. CXR without obvious infiltrate,
   though other potential sources would include peritoneal fluid (PD
   cath), urine, and blood (though patient does not have any indwelling
   lines). Hip, due to small effusion, could be another source though no
   pain with active or passive motion on my exam to suggest septic
   arthritis. Patient's clonidine patch actually intact throughout episode
   (including improvement of BPs to 150s systolic), so will keep on for
   now and continue to monitor.
   - send blood cultures, UA & cultures, PD dialysate culture
   - as BP improved to 150s systolic with only intervention naloxone, will
   continue to monitor, though will consider antibiotics if hypotension
   recurs
   - if hypotension recurs, remove clonidine patch
   - consider hip effusion as potential source if patient decompensates
   - due to chronic steroid use, if hypotension recurs or persists, would
   use stress dose steroids
   # Altered mental status: Prior to transfer, the patient was noted to be
   less arousable. Had received narcotics, though these were last given in
   the morning. By time of transfer back to mental baseline per patient
   and family, though patient does not recall episode (including ABG).
   - avoid sedating medications
   - continue to monitor though appears at current baseline
   # Right leg/hip pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or fracture on
   MRI though there is a small effusion.
   - continue to monitor
   - avoid narcotics for now, restart slowly when mentally clear in the AM
   # Hyperkalemia: Chronic issue. Patient takes kayexalate intermittently
   per her report (last dose Monday).
   - will give single dose of kayexelate 30 g PO X 1 now
   - no further calcium gluconate as calcium level > 15 (though suspect
   drawn near calcium infusion)
   # CKD V: Chronic issue and not yet on PD as she has not tolerated it
   during this admission.
   - Renal following and aware of ICU transfer
   # Anemia: Hct stable around 20. S/p 1 U PRBCs today with Hct 20.1 to
   21.9. Continue to monitor.
   - guaiac stools
   #. Prior SVC thrombus: INR 3.5 on ICU admission. Hold warfarin tonight

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old woman with a medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD), and hypertension. She presents with hypotension and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102Â°F, blood pressure ranging from 106/48 to 183/90 mmHg, heart rate between 70-94 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 89%. 

The patient has been started on antibiotics for suspected infection, but the renal team agrees that intraperitoneal antibiotics should not be initiated. She has received multiple doses of vancomycin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a right pupil that is round and reactive to light, bilateral periorbital edema, a clear chest with good inspiratory effort, and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. Her abdomen is soft, slightly distended, and resonant to percussion. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine, and low potassium levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging includes an echocardiogram (Echo), V/Q scan, and ultrasound (U/S). 

The assessment and plan include the addition of a"

   mg/dL
   Imaging: V/Q scan, U/S
   TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is severe symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
   normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
   ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%). A mild (18
   mmHg) mid-cavitary gradient is identified. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high
   cardiac output. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no
   systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion
   appears circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   IMPRESSION: Severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   hyperdynamic systolic function and mild mid-cavitary gradient. Mild
   aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Findings
   consistent with hyperrtophic cardiomyopathy.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-26**], pulmonary
   hypertension has developed (also present on the study from [**2140-5-20**]).
   Pericardial effusion is also new.
   V/Q scan:
   Improved V/Q scan from [**9-/2139**] with no findings to suggest acute
   pulmonary embolism.
   B/L upper extremity and neck U/S:
   Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 4090**] of the
   right and left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial,
   basilic and
   cephalic veins were performed. There is nonocclusive focal thrombus
   seen in
   the left subclavian vein, where the vein is not fully compressible.
   Flow is
   seen in the region, indicating that the thrombus is nonocclusive.
   Elsewhere,
   normal flow, augmentation, compressibility were appropriate and
   waveforms are
   demonstrated.
   Assessment and Plan
   24 y/o woman with SLE, stage 5 chronic kidney disease, and hypertension
   who presents in transfer from the medical floor with hypotension and
   altered mental status.
   # Labile blood pressure: Hypotension improved after arrival to the MICU
   and after administration of naloxone. Could be related to narcosis,
   though concerning in this patient with difficult to control
   hypertension who missed several of her medications today that there is
   underlying infectious process with ? early sepsis. CXR without obvious
   infiltrate, PD fluid without infection, no pyuria. Hip, due to small
   effusion, could be another source though no pain with active or passive
   motion on my exam to suggest septic arthritis. Patient's clonidine
   patch actually intact throughout episode (including improvement of BPs
   to 150s systolic), so will keep on for now and continue to monitor.
   Doing well on prednisone 15mg (home dose 5mg).
   - rheum saw patient and did not feel there is much concern for septic
   joint
   - f/u blood cultures
   - as BP improved to 150s systolic with only intervention naloxone, will
   continue to monitor, though will consider antibiotics if hypotension
   recurs
   - if hypotension recurs, remove clonidine patch
   - d/c hydralazine
   - consider hip effusion as potential source if patient decompensates
   # Febrile Episode: unclear etiology. On vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
   aztreonam
   - await culture results --- if no growth for 48-72 hours and still no
   clear source, d/c antibiotics
   # Altered mental status: Prior to transfer, the patient was noted to be
   less arousable. Had received narcotics, though these were last given in
   the morning. By time of transfer back to mental baseline per patient
   and family, though patient does not recall episode (including ABG).
   - avoid sedating medications
   - continue to monitor though appears at current baseline
   # Right leg/hip pain: Resolved per patient.  No evidence of avascular
   necrosis or fracture on MRI though there is a small effusion.
   - continue to monitor
   - avoid morphine, use Tylenol and vicodin for pain control
   # Hyperkalemia: Chronic issue. Patient takes kayexalate intermittently
   per her report (last dose Monday).
   - monitor and dose as needed
   # CKD V: Renal following. Did well with PD on [**9-22**]
