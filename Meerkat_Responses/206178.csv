","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old male with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer.
- The patient presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to tumor invasion into the duodenal bulb.
- The patient received a transfusion of 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) to address the bleeding.
- An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, which showed direct tumor invasion and ulceration of the duodenal bulb. The bleeding has resolved for now.
- The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, but they are still at risk for rebleeding. The healthcare team will monitor the patient's hematocrit levels and watch for signs of bleeding.
- The patient's platelet count is low, but it is believed to be due to a dilution effect from the transfusion. There is no clinical suspicion for systemic causes such as sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or drug-related causes since the patient has not received any offending medications since admission when platelet counts were normal.
- The healthcare team will continue to trend the patient's platelet counts and does not recommend platelet transfusion at this time.
- The patient has a partial gastric outlet obstruction due to disease extension, but they are currently asymptomatic and their appetite is returning.
- The nasogastric tube (NGT) can be discontinued, and antiemetics can be given"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to apparent duodenal tumor invasion. He has received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). His hemodynamic status is stable, and he has a stable hematocrit (Hct). The patient also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 62 K/uL, but no clinical signs of bleeding. Other medical issues include partial gastric outlet obstruction, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and cardiac disease. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, as well as abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) and electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Continued bleeding: The patient's UGIB needs close monitoring for any signs of re-bleeding or worsening anemia.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count should be monitored, and any signs of bleeding or clinical suspicion for systemic causes such as sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) should be investigated.
3. Partial gastric outlet obstruction: The patient's appetite is returning, but maintaining the nasogastric tube (NGT) to suction is recommended. Further evaluation and management"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer who is currently being treated with gemcitabine. The patient presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and underwent endoscopy, which revealed duodenal tumor invasion as the cause. The patient received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/81 mmHg to 128/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently intubated with an NG tube and has diminished pulses in both distal extremities.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL, hematocrit of 27.3%, platelet count of 62 K/uL, and elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level.

The assessment and plan include monitoring the patient's hemoglobin trend and platelet count, continuing trend platelet counts while monitoring hematocrit, maintaining the NG tube to suction, and considering options for surgical intervention due to the limited nature of the pancreatic cancer and its contribution to the UGIB.

","The patient is a 77-year-old male with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer. He presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to tumor invasion into the duodenal bulb. The patient underwent angiographic embolization and received a transfusion of 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).

The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, naloxone, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 100/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals sinus bradycardia, diminished peripheral pulses, crackles in the bilateral lung bases, and bibasilar end-expiratory squeak. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 15.2 g/dL, hematocrit of 40.5%, platelet count of 62 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 26 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, and glucose of 192 mg/dL. Other labs include elevated PT/PTT/INR, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

The assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring for symptoms of bleeding, continued trend platelet counts, maintenance of NG tube to suction, administration of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) gtt x 24 hours followed by IV PPI, and consideration of additional fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to thrombocytopenia. The patient also requires close monitoring of mental status and neurologic examination due to a recent fall and potential for intracranial hemorrhage. Additionally, glycemic control should be maintained with regular insulin sliding scale, and systemic anticoagulation should be considered for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient experienced a rebleeding episode, resulting in bloody brown postural pitching rash (BRBPR), spitting up blood, and a drop in blood pressure. The patient responded to 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/55 to 79/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient has received 3,515 mL of total fluid input, including 345 mL of parenteral nutrition (TF), 3,046 mL of intravenous fluids (IVF), 469 mL of blood products, and 281 mL of blood product transfusion. The total fluid output includes 1,995 mL of urine, 740 mL of drain output, and a balance of 1,520 mL.

The patient is on respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device, and their arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits. Physical examination findings are mostly not assessed due to the patient's critical condition.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer who has experienced upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to tumor invasion into the duodenal bulb. The patient received a transfusion of 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and is currently stable with resolved bleeding. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Rebleeding: Despite the patient's current stability, there is still a risk of rebleeding from the duodenal bulb due to the underlying pancreatic cancer.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be a result of the recent blood transfusion. Close monitoring of platelet counts is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.

3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to cancer and potential exposure to invasive procedures increases the risk of infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infection.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes mellitus type II, and pancreatic cancer can further worsen glycemic control. Monitoring and management of blood glucose levels are essential to prevent diabetic complications.

5. Hypokalemia: The patient requires potassium repletion, and ongoing monitoring of electrolyte levels is necessary to prevent complications related to low potassium levels.

6. Gastric outlet obstruction: The patient has a history of partial gastric outlet obstruction, which"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer. He presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to tumor invasion into the duodenal bulb. The bleeding has been temporarily resolved after the transfusion of 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The patient's current condition is stable, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: There is a risk of re-bleeding from the ulcerated duodenal bulb caused by the pancreatic tumor. Continuous monitoring for signs of bleeding and maintaining adequate access for further transfusions if needed are essential.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to dilution from the recent transfusion. Regular monitoring of platelet counts is necessary to assess the need for platelet transfusion or other interventions.
3. Partial gastric outlet obstruction: The patient's pancreatic cancer may lead to partial gastric outlet obstruction, as mentioned on [**2-28**]. Although the patient is currently asymptomatic, close monitoring is required to manage this condition and make appropriate dietary adjustments.
4. Fall-related injuries: The patient had a fall on [**7-29**], but no intracranial hemorrhage was detected on a limited head CT. Continuous monitoring of mental status and neurologic examination is crucial, especially considering the patient's cancer and potential impact on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to tumor invasion into the duodenal bulb. The patient underwent endoscopy, which showed direct tumor invasion and ulceration of the duodenal bulb. The bleeding has resolved for now, and the patient is hemodynamically stable. The patient's platelet count is low but is expected to improve, and there are no clinical signs of bleeding at this time. The patient has a history of falls, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and pancreatic cancer. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate), and the plan is to arrange hospice care and discuss end-of-life care with the patient and family. The patient is currently on a regular diet, and there are no plans for further chemotherapy or radiation. The patient's medical team is monitoring his condition closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: Since the patient had a previous episode of UGIB, there is a risk of rebleeding, especially if the underlying cause, such as tumor invasion into the duodenal bulb, persists.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding. However, since there are no clinical signs of bleeding at this time, close monitoring is recommended.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). They have a history of diabetes mellitus type II, cancer in the pancreas, and an unstable ulcerated gastrointestinal tumor. The patient experienced a substantial bleed overnight but it stopped without intervention. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/106 mmHg to 133/106 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on multiple medications including pantoprazole and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's blood products have been transfused, with a total intake of 3,515 mL and output of 1,995 mL. The patient's labs show elevated glucose levels, low platelet count, and elevated creatinine. The patient's prognosis is terminal, and they have chosen comfort care. They desire to go home with palliative care and have declined radiation therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Further gastrointestinal bleeding: Given the patient's unstable ulcerated GI tumor, there is a risk of recurrent bleeding.
2. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system, they may be susceptible to infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer. He has been experiencing upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to tumor invasion into the duodenal bulb. The patient has received a transfusion of 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and his bleeding has resolved for now. His hemodynamic status is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. UGIB: The patient's current condition of UGIB poses a risk for further bleeding. Close monitoring for any signs of recurrent bleeding is necessary.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, but there are no clinical signs of bleeding at this time. It is likely a dilution effect from the blood transfusion. Regular monitoring of platelet counts is recommended.
3. Partial gastric outlet obstruction: The patient has a history of partial gastric outlet obstruction due to disease extension. As he is currently asymptomatic, the nasogastric tube (NGT) can be discontinued. Antiemetics should be given as needed, and a regular diet can be initiated.
4. Fall risk: The patient had a fall previously, but no intracranial hemorrhage was detected. A head computed tomography (CT) scan showed limited contrast given for an abdominal/pelvic CT. Continuous monitoring of mental status and neurologic examination is advised.
5. Diabetes mellitus (DM): The patient has diabetes with a glucose"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed direct tumor invasion and ulceration of the duodenal bulb. The bleeding has resolved for now, and the patient is hemodynamically stable. The patient's platelet count is low, but there are no clinical signs of bleeding at this time, and it is likely a dilution effect from transfusion. There is no suspicion for systemic causes such as sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or drug-related causes. The patient's partial gastric outlet obstruction is asymptomatic at present, and his appetite is good. He has diabetes mellitus with poorly controlled blood glucose levels. The patient has hypertension, and it is recommended to hold ACE inhibitors for now. The patient's pancreatic cancer is the source of bleeding, but he is not a surgical candidate. Further chemotherapy is likely to magnify the bleeding risk. The decision was made to discontinue chemotherapy and radiation therapy at the request of the hematology/oncology team. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR)/do not intubate (DNI). The patient's family has been informed and provided with consent forms. The patient will be transferred to the floor after a consult with palliative care."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a terminally ill individual with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, diabetes mellitus type II, and pancreatic cancer. They are currently in the ICU and have stabilized from the bleeding episode. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/58 mmHg to 139/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 87%. The patient's blood glucose levels have been high, ranging from 192 mg/dL to 197 mg/dL. The patient's blood counts show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.9 g/dL, and the platelet count has been fluctuating between 62 thousand and 127 thousand. The patient's kidney function appears to be normal based on the creatinine levels, which have been consistently around 0.6 mg/dL. The patient has received pantoprazole infusions for stress ulcer prophylaxis and has been on other medications including antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to significant blood loss and anemia. Continued bleeding or re-bleeding could worsen the patient's condition.
2. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's high blood glucose levels indicate poor glycemic control. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer. He has undergone cyberknife treatment and is currently receiving gemcitabine therapy. The patient presented with brisk upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to tumor invasion into the duodenal bulb, for which he received a transfusion of 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). His bleeding has resolved for now, and he is hemodynamically stable. 

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and thrombocytopenia. His current laboratory values show elevated blood glucose levels, low hemoglobin (Hct) and hematocrit (Hct), elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low platelet count (Plt), and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient has been placed on comfort measures only (CMO) and has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) code status. He is being managed with palliative care and will be discharged home after a consultation with the palliative care team. The patient's pain and end-of-life care discussions have been arranged with the pain and palliative care team.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Re-bleeding from the duodenal bulb due to tumor invasion.
2. Development of further thrombocytopenia, which could increase the risk"

","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II and cancer of the pancreas. The patient is experiencing melena, which is the presence of black, tarry stools indicative of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but they show signs of anemia and acute blood loss. The patient has been receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition remains critical, and they have chosen to spend their remaining time at home with hospice care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability due to ongoing bleeding.
2. Development of hypovolemic shock as a result of acute blood loss.
3. Progressive anemia and potential need for transfusion.
4. Metabolic disturbances, including hyperglycemia due to poorly controlled diabetes.
5. Infection risks associated with invasive lines and immobility.
6. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, due to impaired swallowing and aspiration risk.
7. Increased risk of thromboembolic events, including DVT and pulmonary embolism, due to immobility and critical illness.
8. Potential complications related to the underlying malignancy, such as tumor invasion or metastasis.

Please note that these potential complications are based"
