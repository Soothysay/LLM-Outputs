   new pulmonary infiltrates, intubated given respiratory distress.
   # PNEUMONIA: Infiltrates in the RUL and the RML on CXR obscuring the
   heart border and superior to fissure on R side.  He has had a recent
   hospitalization for pneumonia with out any + culture data.  He is not
   neutropenic but given lymphoma and prednisone he is immunosuppressed.
   - BAL for cultures, including PCP and fungal, viral culture and PCR and
   AFB, legionella, galactomannan on BAL- previous BAL from the beginning
   of [**2103-10-1**] without any growth
   - Crypto antigen, CMV VL pending
   - Glucan and galactomannan pending
   - Urine legionella pending
   - Continue posaconazole, vanc, meropenem, and levoflox per ID
   recommendations for empiric coverage
   - Standing nebs (xopenex given tachycardia and atrovent)
   - On mechanical ventilation, given frequent ABGs will place A line
   # TACHYCARDIA: Sinus tachycardia, resolving. Likely related to acute
   infection. Has be hypothyroid in past.
   - Sedate while on mechanical ventilation
   - Continue to treat pneumonia
   # RENAL FAILURE: Cr 2.7 down from 3.1. Continuing to fall since renal
   failure at last admission which required HD. He had a renal biopsy at
   that time with findings consistent with ATN. FeNa nonspecific with
   value 1.8%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma, who underwent an allogeneic transplant and developed recurrence. He presented with fever, hypoxia, and new pulmonary infiltrates. He was admitted and intubated due to respiratory distress. The patient has a history of recent hospitalization for pneumonia, immunosuppression due to lymphoma and prednisone use, and renal failure requiring dialysis in the past.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has new pulmonary infiltrates, and there is a concern for pneumonia. He is receiving appropriate empiric coverage with antibiotics, but the specific causative agent needs to be identified and treated accordingly.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia, which is likely related to acute infection. It is important to monitor his heart rate and adjust sedation while he is on mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of renal failure and required hemodialysis in the past. His current creatinine level is elevated at 2.7. Close monitoring of renal function and medication dosing is necessary. Maintaining adequate urine output and avoiding hypotension are crucial.
4. Hodgkin's Lymphoma: The patient has a history of multiple treatments for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Ongoing management of his cancer therapy is important, including monitoring for any potential complications related to immunosuppression"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma, who underwent an allogeneic transplant and had recurrence. He was admitted with fever, hypoxia, and new pulmonary infiltrates. The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory distress. His condition is complicated by pneumonia, sinus tachycardia, renal failure, and acid/base disturbance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has new pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating possible pneumonia. This condition requires prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics and other supportive measures.
2. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be due to fever, hypoxia, or sepsis. Close monitoring of heart rate and volume status is necessary, and sedation may be required while on mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating impaired renal function. It is crucial to maintain adequate urine output, avoid hypotension, and continue renal dosing of medications.
4. Acid/Base Disturbance: The patient is acidemic with a primary metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis. Efforts should be made to correct the respiratory acidosis through mechanical ventilation and manage the underlying causes of metabolic acidosis.
5. Hodgkin's Lymphoma: The patient's history of Hodgkin's lymphoma requires ongoing treatment management, including continuation of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic transplant. He was admitted with fever, hypoxia, and new pulmonary infiltrates. The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU. He is immunosuppressed due to his lymphoma treatment and prednisone use. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains tachycardic and tachypneic. His laboratory results show renal failure, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate levels. He is being treated with antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care for respiratory distress. The patient also has a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma and previous renal issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the presence of bilateral infiltrates suggest the possibility of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated inflammatory markers indicate a possible infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, renal failure, and cardiovascular collapse.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of renal failure suggest ongoing kidney dysfunction. Monitoring urine output and adjusting medication dosages accordingly is crucial.
4. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's low bicarbonate levels and high lactate levels indicate anion gap"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo M with a long history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p
   allogeneic transplant with recurrence admitted with fever, hypoxia and
   new pulmonary infiltrates, intubated given respiratory distress.
   # Respiratory distress: Infiltrates bilaterally, although these be
   fluid as well. He has had a recent hospitalization for pneumonia with
   out any + culture data
 was febrile prior to arrival in ICU but has
   been afebrile ever since; continues to be tachycardic, tachypneic. He
   is not neutropenic but given lymphoma and prednisone he is
   immunosuppressed. No leads with micro data. In addition to infection,
   heart failure is in differenital. Last TTE in [**2-6**] was normal.

   - Glucan and galactomannan pending
   - Continue posaconazole, vanc, meropenem, and levoflox per ID
   recommendations for empiric coverage
   - Standing nebs (xopenex given tachycardia and atrovent)
   - On mechanical ventilation
   - TTE, BNP to evaluate for heart failure
   # RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine stable around 2.7-3.0. . Continuing to fall
   since renal failure at last admission which required HD. He had a renal
   biopsy at that time with findings consistent with ATN. FeNa nonspecific
   with value 1.8%.
   - Continue to renally dose meds, avoid hypotension and keep UOP >
   30cc/hr
   - Continue to monitor
   # HODGKINS LYMPHOMA: Has had multiple courses of treatment.
   -continue solumedrol 10mg IV q6hrs currrently
   -continue Lamivudine 100mg po daily given +HBV in the past
   -continue acyclovir 400mg po q12hrs
   -tx PRBC for hct < 25, and plts < 10, maintain active type and screen

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma, who underwent an allogeneic transplant and has now developed a recurrence. He was admitted with fever, hypoxia, and new pulmonary infiltrates, leading to intubation due to respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, with infiltrates in the right upper lobe and middle lobe on chest X-ray. He is immunosuppressed due to lymphoma treatment and prednisone use. Empiric coverage for the infection has been initiated, including posaconazole, vancomycin, meropenem, and levofloxacin. The patient also has sinus tachycardia, likely related to acute infection, and resolving. He has a history of hypothyroidism. His renal function has improved from previous admission, but he still requires close monitoring. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation, sedation, renal dosing of medications, and aggressive fluid management. Other ongoing issues include Hodgkin's lymphoma treatment, nutritional support, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo M with a long history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p
   allogeneic transplant with recurrence admitted with fever, hypoxia and
   new pulmonary infiltrates, intubated given respiratory distress.
   #. Respiratory distress: Pneumonia vs. fluid overload. TTE with mild
   reduction in LV systolic function
 more remarkable for considerable
   right heart pressures. BNP elevated, although this may be due to
   increased pressures in right heart.
        Infiltrates bilaterally. He has had a recent hospitalization for
   pneumonia with out any + culture data
 was febrile prior to arrival in
   ICU but has been afebrile ever since; continues to be tachycardic,
   tachypneic. He is not neutropenic but given lymphoma and prednisone he
   is immunosuppressed. No leads with micro data. In addition to
   infection, heart failure is in differenital. Last TTE in [**2-6**] was
   normal.
   - Gently diurese today with goal net output of 500cc.
   - Continue posaconazole, meropenem, and levoflox per ID recommendations
   for empiric coverage
   - D/c vancomycin given drop in WBC count and unclear infection that we
   are treating; if spikes overnight, will restart coverage for Staph
   - Standing nebs (xopenex given tachycardia and atrovent)
   - On mechanical ventilation
   #. Falling WBC count: Likely related to medication
 vancomycin? [**Month (only) 60**]
   also be decreased with infection, underlying malignancy
   - Check ANC
   - D/c vancoymcin
   #. RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine between 2.5-3.0. Falling since last
   admission when patient was suspected of having renal failure secondary
   to contrast. Last admission which required HD; had renal biopsy at that
   time with findings consistent with ATN. FeNa nonspecific with value
   1.8%. Good urine production.
   - Continue to renally dose meds, avoid hypotension and keep UOP >
   30cc/hr
   - Continue to monitor
   #. ANION GAP METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Gap closed. Lactate within normal
   limits.
   #. HODGKINS LYMPHOMA: Has had multiple courses of treatment.
   - Continue solumedrol 10mg IV q6hrs currrently
   - Continue Lamivudine 100mg po daily given +HBV in the past
   - Continue acyclovir 400mg po q12hrs
   - Transfuse PRBC for hct < 25, and plts < 10, maintain active type and
   screen. Received one dose on [**11-4**].

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma who has undergone an allogeneic transplant. He was admitted with fever, hypoxia, and new pulmonary infiltrates, and subsequently intubated due to respiratory distress. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be caused by pneumonia or fluid overload. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed mild reduction in left ventricular systolic function and considerable right heart pressures. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is elevated, which could be due to increased pressures in the right heart.

2. Infiltrates: Bilateral infiltrates are present, indicating possible infection in the lungs. The patient had a recent hospitalization for pneumonia without any positive culture data.

3. Heart failure: The patient's symptoms and TTE findings suggest heart failure as a possible differential diagnosis. It is necessary to consider both infection and heart failure when managing the patient's respiratory distress.

4. Falling WBC count: The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count has been decreasing, which may be related to medication, especially vancomycin. Other causes such as infection or underlying malignancy should also be considered.

5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been between 2.5-3.0, falling since the last admission when he was suspected of having renal failure"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma who has undergone an allogeneic transplant. He was admitted to the ICU with fever, hypoxia, and new pulmonary infiltrates. The patient required intubation due to respiratory distress.

Key findings and assessments include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has bilateral infiltrates, which may be fluid-filled. He is also tachycardic and tachypneic. Given his immunosuppressed state due to lymphoma treatment and prednisone use, infection is a primary concern. Heart failure is also in the differential diagnosis.

2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are between 2.5-3.0, indicating renal impairment. This may be secondary to contrast exposure during a previous admission. The patient had a renal biopsy that revealed acute tubular necrosis (ATN). FeNa (fractional excretion of sodium) is nonspecific with a value of 1.8%. Good urine production is noted at approximately 35 cc/hour.

3. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has an anion gap of 60, which could be due to renal failure. Lactate levels should be monitored.

4. Hodgkin's lymphoma: The patient has had multiple courses of treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma.

   Approved: TUE [**2103-11-6**] 8:49 AM
   - CHEST CT, [**11-5**]:
     HISTORY: Patient with recurrent Hodgkin's disease, now intubated.
   Question
   pneumonia or fluid overload.
     TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed
   without
   intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name **] reconstructed as contiguous 5- and 1.25-mm
   thick
   axial and 5 mm thick coronal and paramedian sagittal images compared to
   chest
   CT scanning since [**2103-8-28**], most recently [**2103-10-24**], read
   in
   conjunction with recent chest radiographs.
     FINDINGS: Recent chest radiographs document the development of large
   region
   of consolidation in the right upper lobe, and in the right lower lung,
   including at least the middle lobe, between [**10-24**] and [**11-2**],
   consistent with pneumonia or, given the appropriate clinical history,
   pulmonary hemorrhage; mild interstitial pulmonary edema cleared between
   [**11-2**] and [**11-5**]:
     The most recent prior chest CT [**2103-10-24**] shows multifocal
   pneumonia
   had progressed since [**10-23**]. Today's examination shows a
   substantial
   progression of consolidation, peribronchial infiltration and
   ground-glass
   opacification in all of the areas previously abnormal but does not
   reflect
   recent improvement over the past several days.
     Small-to-moderate nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusion is
   unchanged.
   Marked thickening of the left posterior costal pleural surface in the
   lower
   lungs is stable, indicating either chronicity or exudate.
     There is no pulmonary edema. The mass-like area of consolidation in
   the
   infrahilar right lower lobe has been present since at least [**2103-2-7**],
   but substantially smaller since, though stable since [**2103-10-5**].
   This
   could represent local recurrence of lymphoma responding to treatment,
   or an
   associated condition such as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Focal
   thickening of the pericardium around the large chronic, peripherally
   calcified
   mediastinal cyst or residual lymphoma, is also stable. There is no new
   mediastinal adenopathy.
     The study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, except to
   note some
   involution of the infiltrating nodal mass in the retroperitoneum at the
   level
   of the superior mesenteric artery, and not particularly the left
   adrenal
   component which measured 36 x 43 mm on [**10-5**] and is 29 x 25 mm
   today
   (2:53).
     IMPRESSION:
   1. No pulmonary edema. Multifocal pneumonia progressed since [**10-24**],
   [**2103**] Chest CT, but improved when chest radiographs are reviewed between
   [**11-2**] and [**11-5**].
   2. Right infrahilar mass decreased in size since [**2103-1-30**],
   retroperitoneal adenopathy and left adrenal mass decreased since
   [**2103-10-5**]. These areas may represent treatment response of lymphoma.
   3. Conventional chest radiography should be sufficient to chart the
   course of
   intrathoracic findings over the near future.
     The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo M with a long history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p
   allogeneic transplant with recurrence admitted with fever, hypoxia and
   new pulmonary infiltrates, intubated given respiratory distress.
   #. Respiratory distress/failure: CT scan is consistent with a
   multifocal pneumonia. However, patient remains afebrile without
   leukocytosis. There may be some component of pulmonary edema. TTE with
   mild reduction in LV systolic function
 more remarkable for
   considerable right heart pressures. BNP elevated, although this may be
   due to increased pressures in right heart.
        Infiltrates bilaterally. He has had a recent hospitalization for
   pneumonia without any positive culture data
 was febrile prior to
   arrival in ICU but has been afebrile ever since. Microbiology results
   continue to be negative. In addition to infection, heart failure is in
   differenital. Last TTE in [**2-6**] was normal.  No change on CXR from
   yesterday.
   - Gently diurese today with goal net output of 500cc. Lasix 20mg IV at
   12:30pm and 6:30pm +/- midnight.
   - Continue posaconazole, meropenem, and levoflox per ID recommendations
   for empiric coverage. Consider discontinuing these antibiotics as this
   is less likely to be infectious.
   - Standing nebs (xopenex given tachycardia and atrovent)
   - On mechanical ventilation with standard precautions
   - Consider pleurocentesis
   - Consider VATS for tissue diagnosis
   #. Falling WBC count: WBC rose today to 3.3. The drop yesterday may
   have been due to vancomycin. Patient did not spike fever overnight. WBC
   changes may also be decreased with infection, underlying malignancy.
   - If patient becomes febrile, consider coverage for staph. Until then,
   hold vancomycin.
   #. RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine between 2.5-3.0. Falling since last
   admission when patient was suspected of having renal failure secondary
   to contrast. Last admission which required HD; had renal biopsy at that
   time with findings consistent with ATN. FeNa nonspecific with value
   1.8%. Good urine production > 100/hour.
   - Continue to renally dose meds, avoid hypotension and keep UOP >
   30cc/hr
   - Continue to monitor
   #. ANION GAP METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Gap nearly closed. Lactate within
   normal limits. Recent ABG=7.28/33/101. HCO3=15. This is compensated
   metabolic acidosis with AG=13, which is slightly elevated.  Check
   lactate today.
   #. HODGKINS LYMPHOMA: Has had multiple courses of treatment.
   - Continue solumedrol 10mg IV q6hrs currrently
   - Continue Lamivudine 100mg po daily given +HBV in the past
   - Continue acyclovir 400mg po q12hrs
   - Transfuse PRBC for hct < 25, and plts < 10, maintain active type and
   screen. Received one dose on [**11-4**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma who was admitted with fever, hypoxia, and new pulmonary infiltrates. He was intubated due to respiratory distress. The patient has been afebrile since admission and has not shown leukocytosis. The CT scan indicates multifocal pneumonia, but there may also be a component of pulmonary edema. The patient's right heart pressures are elevated, and his BNP levels are high. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern, as he was intubated due to respiratory distress. The CT scan shows multifocal pneumonia, which could be contributing to his respiratory issues. However, the patient remains afebrile without leukocytosis, suggesting that an infectious cause might not be the primary issue. Another possibility is pulmonary edema, which can cause respiratory distress.

2. Falling White Blood Cell (WBC) Count: The patient's WBC count dropped yesterday but rose today. This fluctuation could be due to vancomycin treatment. The patient's underlying malignancy and infection may also contribute to the decrease in WBC count.

3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been between 2.5-3.0, indicating renal failure. This could be a result of contrast-induced nephropathy during a previous admission. The patient has ATN"

   45 yo M with a long history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p
   allogeneic transplant with recurrence admitted with fever, hypoxia and
   new pulmonary infiltrates, intubated given respiratory distress.
   #. Respiratory distress/failure: CT scan is consistent with a
   multifocal pneumonia. However, patient remains afebrile without
   leukocytosis. There may be some component of pulmonary edema. TTE with
   mild reduction in LV systolic function
 more remarkable for
   considerable right heart pressures. BNP elevated, although this may be
   due to increased pressures in right heart.

   yesterday.
   - Gently diurese today with goal net output of 500cc. Lasix 20mg IV at
   12:30pm and 6:30pm +/- midnight.
   - Continue posaconazole, meropenem, and levoflox per ID recommendations
   for empiric coverage. Consider discontinuing these antibiotics as this
   is less likely to be infectious.
   - Standing nebs (xopenex given tachycardia and atrovent)
   - On mechanical ventilation with standard precautions
   - Consider pleurocentesis
   - Consider VATS for tissue diagnosis
   #. Falling WBC count: WBC rose today to 3.3. The drop yesterday may
   have been due to vancomycin. Patient did not spike fever overnight. WBC
   changes may also be decreased with infection, underlying malignancy.
   - If patient becomes febrile, consider coverage for staph. Until then,
   hold vancomycin.
   #. RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine between 2.5-3.0. Falling since last
   admission when patient was suspected of having renal failure secondary

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma, who was admitted with fever, hypoxia, and new pulmonary infiltrates. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient's condition remains afebrile without leukocytosis, and there is evidence of multifocal pneumonia on chest CT scan. There may also be some component of pulmonary edema. The patient has a history of renal failure and is being managed with renal dosing of medications. Additionally, the patient has anion gap metabolic acidosis, and his Hodgkin's lymphoma requires ongoing treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress/failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to the presence of multifocal pneumonia and potential pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of vital signs and oxygenation is essential.
2. Falling WBC count: The drop in WBC count may be due to vancomycin or underlying malignancy. If the patient becomes febrile, consideration should be given to coverage for staphylococcus until vancomycin is discontinued.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal impairment. It is crucial to continue renal dosing of medications, avoid hypotension, and maintain urine output above 30cc/hr.
4. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has a compensated metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap"

   Approved: TUE [**2103-11-6**] 8:49 AM
   - CHEST CT, [**11-5**]:
     HISTORY: Patient with recurrent Hodgkin's disease, now intubated.
   Question
   pneumonia or fluid overload.
     TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed
   without
   intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name **] reconstructed as contiguous 5- and 1.25-mm
   thick
   axial and 5 mm thick coronal and paramedian sagittal images compared to
   chest
   CT scanning since [**2103-8-28**], most recently [**2103-10-24**], read
   in
   conjunction with recent chest radiographs.
     FINDINGS: Recent chest radiographs document the development of large
   region
   of consolidation in the right upper lobe, and in the right lower lung,
   including at least the middle lobe, between [**10-24**] and [**11-2**],
   consistent with pneumonia or, given the appropriate clinical history,
   pulmonary hemorrhage; mild interstitial pulmonary edema cleared between
   [**11-2**] and [**11-5**]:
     The most recent prior chest CT [**2103-10-24**] shows multifocal
   pneumonia
   had progressed since [**10-23**]. Today's examination shows a
   substantial
   progression of consolidation, peribronchial infiltration and
   ground-glass
   opacification in all of the areas previously abnormal but does not
   reflect
   recent improvement over the past several days.
     Small-to-moderate nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusion is
   unchanged.
   Marked thickening of the left posterior costal pleural surface in the
   lower
   lungs is stable, indicating either chronicity or exudate.
     There is no pulmonary edema. The mass-like area of consolidation in
   the
   infrahilar right lower lobe has been present since at least [**2103-2-7**],
   but substantially smaller since, though stable since [**2103-10-5**].
   This
   could represent local recurrence of lymphoma responding to treatment,
   or an
   associated condition such as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Focal
   thickening of the pericardium around the large chronic, peripherally
   calcified
   mediastinal cyst or residual lymphoma, is also stable. There is no new
   mediastinal adenopathy.
     The study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, except to
   note some
   involution of the infiltrating nodal mass in the retroperitoneum at the
   level
   of the superior mesenteric artery, and not particularly the left
   adrenal
   component which measured 36 x 43 mm on [**10-5**] and is 29 x 25 mm
   today
   (2:53).
     IMPRESSION:
   1. No pulmonary edema. Multifocal pneumonia progressed since [**10-24**],
   [**2103**] Chest CT, but improved when chest radiographs are reviewed between
   [**11-2**] and [**11-5**].
   2. Right infrahilar mass decreased in size since [**2103-1-30**],
   retroperitoneal adenopathy and left adrenal mass decreased since
   [**2103-10-5**]. These areas may represent treatment response of lymphoma.
   3. Conventional chest radiography should be sufficient to chart the
   course of
   intrathoracic findings over the near future.
     The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

   Respiratory status remains unchanged with RR 30
s with any decrease in
   support.  CXR also unchanged. I  am still skeptical this is infectious.
   Have reviewed films with radiology. Plan is to diurese and then VATS if
   no response.
   Time spent: 65 min
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma who was admitted with fever, hypoxia, and new pulmonary infiltrates. He was intubated due to respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has persistent hypoxia. Imaging studies show multifocal pneumonia with some improvement since the last CT scan. There is also a calcified mass present. The patient's white blood cell count has been fluctuating, and he has an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, suggesting right heart pressures. He is being treated with antibiotics and diuretics, and his renal function is monitored closely. The patient has a history of renal failure and is receiving medication for his underlying malignancy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, and he is dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a possibility of worsening respiratory failure if the pneumonia does not improve or if there is an underlying pulmonary edema.
2. Infection: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient's fever has resolved, but he still has persistent pulmonary infiltrates. There is a possibility of a resistant infection or another source of infection that needs to be identified and treated.
3. Heart Failure: The elevated BNP level and the presence of right heart pressures suggest a possibility of heart failure. The patient's cardiac function should be closely monitored, and further evaluation"

   Approved: TUE [**2103-11-6**] 8:49 AM
   - CHEST CT, [**11-5**]:
   HISTORY: Patient with recurrent Hodgkin's disease, now intubated.
   Question
   pneumonia or fluid overload.
   TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed
   without
   intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name **] reconstructed as contiguous 5- and 1.25-mm
   thick
   axial and 5 mm thick coronal and paramedian sagittal images compared to
   chest
   CT scanning since [**2103-8-28**], most recently [**2103-10-24**], read
   in
   conjunction with recent chest radiographs.
   FINDINGS: Recent chest radiographs document the development of large
   region
   of consolidation in the right upper lobe, and in the right lower lung,
   including at least the middle lobe, between [**10-24**] and [**11-2**],
   consistent with pneumonia or, given the appropriate clinical history,
   pulmonary hemorrhage; mild interstitial pulmonary edema cleared between
   [**11-2**] and [**11-5**]:
   The most recent prior chest CT [**2103-10-24**] shows multifocal
   pneumonia
   had progressed since [**10-23**]. Today's examination shows a
   substantial
   progression of consolidation, peribronchial infiltration and
   ground-glass
   opacification in all of the areas previously abnormal but does not
   reflect
   recent improvement over the past several days.
   Small-to-moderate nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusion is
   unchanged.
   Marked thickening of the left posterior costal pleural surface in the
   lower
   lungs is stable, indicating either chronicity or exudate.
   There is no pulmonary edema. The mass-like area of consolidation in the
   infrahilar right lower lobe has been present since at least [**2103-2-7**],
   but substantially smaller since, though stable since [**2103-10-5**].
   This
   could represent local recurrence of lymphoma responding to treatment,
   or an
   associated condition such as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Focal
   thickening of the pericardium around the large chronic, peripherally
   calcified
   mediastinal cyst or residual lymphoma, is also stable. There is no new
   mediastinal adenopathy.
   The study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, except to
   note some
   involution of the infiltrating nodal mass in the retroperitoneum at the
   level
   of the superior mesenteric artery, and not particularly the left
   adrenal
   component which measured 36 x 43 mm on [**10-5**] and is 29 x 25 mm
   today
   (2:53).
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No pulmonary edema. Multifocal pneumonia progressed since [**10-24**],
   [**2103**] Chest CT, but improved when chest radiographs are reviewed between
   [**11-2**] and [**11-5**].
   2. Right infrahilar mass decreased in size since [**2103-1-30**],
   retroperitoneal adenopathy and left adrenal mass decreased since
   [**2103-10-5**]. These areas may represent treatment response of lymphoma.
   3. Conventional chest radiography should be sufficient to chart the
   course of
   intrathoracic findings over the near future.
   The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's disease, currently intubated and in the ICU. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics including Vancomycin, Acyclovir, Levofloxacin, and Meropenem. The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/79 mmHg to 144/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 35% FiO2. The patient is mechanically ventilated using a CMV/ASSIST mode with settings of Vt 450 mL, RR (set) 18, PEEP 8 cmH2O, and FiO2 35%. The patient's recent laboratory results indicate a WBC count ranging from 3.8 to 4.6 K/uL, Hct ranging from 23.0 to 27.7%, Plt count ranging from 81 to 66 K/uL, Cr level ranging from 2.9 to 2.6 mg/dL, and glucose level ranging from 163 to 199 mg/dL. Imaging shows a large region of consolidation in the right upper lobe, and in the right lower lung, consistent with pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's imaging shows a large region of consolidation in the right upper and lower lobes, consistent with pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory status and potentially sepsis.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance sheet indicates a positive balance of 174 mL, which may suggest fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient has small bilateral pleural effusions, which can be associated with infection, heart failure, or malignancy. These effusions can impair respiratory mechanics and oxygenation.
4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure readings are variable, ranging from 133/79 mmHg to 144/88 mmHg. This variability may indicate hemodynamic instability, which can be related to sepsis or fluid shifts.
5. Renal impairment: The patient's creatinine level has been ranging from 2.9 to 2.6 mg/dL, indicating potential renal impairment. Renal function can be affected by sepsis, medications, or underlying comorbidities.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels have been elevated, ranging from 163 to 199 mg/dL. Hyperglycemia can occur in critically ill patients due to stress response and may increase the risk of infections.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory"

   Imaging: - FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**11-5**], the endotracheal
   tube lies only about 1.3 cm above the carina. The remainder of the
   heart and lungs is
   essentially unchanged with right upper and some left-sided airspace
   opacification. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions persist. The
   large
   calcified mass is again seen.

   Approved: TUE [**2103-11-6**] 8:49 AM
   - CHEST CT, [**11-5**]:
   HISTORY: Patient with recurrent Hodgkin's disease, now intubated.
   Question
   pneumonia or fluid overload.
   TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed
   without
   intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name **] reconstructed as contiguous 5- and 1.25-mm
   thick
   axial and 5 mm thick coronal and paramedian sagittal images compared to
   chest
   CT scanning since [**2103-8-28**], most recently [**2103-10-24**], read
   in
   conjunction with recent chest radiographs.
   FINDINGS: Recent chest radiographs document the development of large
   region
   of consolidation in the right upper lobe, and in the right lower lung,
   including at least the middle lobe, between [**10-24**] and [**11-2**],
   consistent with pneumonia or, given the appropriate clinical history,
   pulmonary hemorrhage; mild interstitial pulmonary edema cleared between
   [**11-2**] and [**11-5**]:
   The most recent prior chest CT [**2103-10-24**] shows multifocal
   pneumonia
   had progressed since [**10-23**]. Today's examination shows a
   substantial
   progression of consolidation, peribronchial infiltration and
   ground-glass
   opacification in all of the areas previously abnormal but does not
   reflect
   recent improvement over the past several days.
   Small-to-moderate nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusion is
   unchanged.
   Marked thickening of the left posterior costal pleural surface in the
   lower
   lungs is stable, indicating either chronicity or exudate.
   There is no pulmonary edema. The mass-like area of consolidation in the
   infrahilar right lower lobe has been present since at least [**2103-2-7**],
   but substantially smaller since, though stable since [**2103-10-5**].
   This
   could represent local recurrence of lymphoma responding to treatment,
   or an
   associated condition such as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Focal
   thickening of the pericardium around the large chronic, peripherally
   calcified
   mediastinal cyst or residual lymphoma, is also stable. There is no new
   mediastinal adenopathy.
   The study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, except to
   note some
   involution of the infiltrating nodal mass in the retroperitoneum at the
   level
   of the superior mesenteric artery, and not particularly the left
   adrenal
   component which measured 36 x 43 mm on [**10-5**] and is 29 x 25 mm
   today
   (2:53).
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No pulmonary edema. Multifocal pneumonia progressed since [**10-24**],
   [**2103**] Chest CT, but improved when chest radiographs are reviewed between
   [**11-2**] and [**11-5**].
   2. Right infrahilar mass decreased in size since [**2103-1-30**],
   retroperitoneal adenopathy and left adrenal mass decreased since
   [**2103-10-5**]. These areas may represent treatment response of lymphoma.
   3. Conventional chest radiography should be sufficient to chart the
   course of
   intrathoracic findings over the near future.
   The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo M with a long history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p
   allogeneic transplant with recurrence admitted with fever, hypoxia and
   new pulmonary infiltrates, intubated given respiratory distress.
   #. Respiratory distress: Pneumonia vs. fluid overload. TTE with mild
   reduction in LV systolic function
 more remarkable for considerable
   right heart pressures. BNP elevated, although this may be due to
   increased pressures in right heart.
        Infiltrates bilaterally. He has had a recent hospitalization for
   pneumonia without any positive culture data
 was febrile prior to
   arrival in ICU but has been afebrile ever since. Microbiology results
   continue to be negative. In addition to infection, heart failure is in
   differenital. Last TTE in [**2-6**] was normal.  Right lung field appears
   more opacified today.
   - Gently diurese today with goal net output of 500cc.
   - Continue posaconazole, meropenem, and levoflox per ID recommendations
   for empiric coverage.
   - Standing nebs (xopenex given tachycardia and atrovent)
   - On mechanical ventilation with standard precautions
   #. Falling WBC count: WBC rose today to 3,300. The drop yesterday may
   have been due to vancomycin. Patient did not spike fever overnight. WBC
   changes may also be decreased with infection, underlying malignancy.
   - If patient becomes febrile, consider coverage for staph. Until then,
   hold vancomycin.
   #. RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine between 2.5-3.0. Falling since last
   admission when patient was suspected of having renal failure secondary
   to contrast. Last admission which required HD; had renal biopsy at that
   time with findings consistent with ATN. FeNa nonspecific with value
   1.8%. Good urine production > 100/hour.
   - Continue to renally dose meds, avoid hypotension and keep UOP >
   30cc/hr
   - Continue to monitor
   #. ANION GAP METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Gap nearly closed. Lactate within
   normal limits. Recent ABG=7.28/33/101. HCO3=15. This is compensated
   metabolic acidosis with AG=13, which is slightly elevated.
   #. HODGKINS LYMPHOMA: Has had multiple courses of treatment.
   - Continue solumedrol 10mg IV q6hrs currrently
   - Continue Lamivudine 100mg po daily given +HBV in the past
   - Continue acyclovir 400mg po q12hrs
   - Transfuse PRBC for hct < 25, and plts < 10, maintain active type and

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma, admitted to the ICU with fever, hypoxia, and new pulmonary infiltrates. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient has been febrile prior to admission but has been afebrile since being in the ICU. Microbiology results continue to be negative. There is a concern for pneumonia versus fluid overload. The patient has an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, indicating increased right heart pressures. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) dropped yesterday but increased today, possibly due to vancomycin or underlying malignancy. There are concerns about renal failure, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and ongoing treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to pneumonia or fluid overload. The presence of bilateral infiltrates on imaging suggests a possible infection. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory parameters is crucial.
2. Right Heart Pressures: The elevated BNP level indicates increased right heart pressures. This could be a sign of right heart strain or failure. Monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP) and echocardiographic evaluation would be important.
3. Falling WBC Count: The drop in WBC count yesterday may have been caused by vancomycin. However, the patient's WBC"

   Imaging: CXR([**2103-11-7**]):
   REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma,
   intubated for respiratory distress. Portable AP chest radiograph was
   compared to prior study obtained on [**2103-11-6**] at 06:04 a.m. The
   ET tube tip remains low, approximately 1.5 cm above the carina, but
   given significant flexion of patient neck, it might be still within the
   appropriate limits. There is still present extensive right upper lobe
   opacities continuing towards the lower lungs might represent infection.
   The known right infrahilar mass is seen. Small-to-moderate bilateral
   pleural effusions are demonstrated.

   CXR (10/0908): Official Read Pending.
   Microbiology: Beta Glucan Pending
   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo M with a long history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p
   allogeneic transplant with recurrence admitted with fever, hypoxia and
   new pulmonary infiltrates, intubated given respiratory distress.
   #. Respiratory distress/failure: CT scan is consistent with a
   multifocal pneumonia. However, patient remains afebrile without
   leukocytosis. There may be some component of pulmonary edema. TTE
   inconsistent with heart failure as cause of respiratory distress.
   Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is on differential as well as fungal
   infection. Thoracic surgery has been consulted for possible VATs with
   tissue biopsy for diagnosis of COP or fungal infection. However,
   patient diuresed 1500mL in past 24 hours and CXR is much improved from
   yesterday with substantially less pulmonary edema. Thus, will defer
   further work up for now while continuing diuresis.
   - Continue diuresis today. Currently on lasix drip with goal of
   UOP=100cc/hr.
   - Consider Vigileo to further assess possibilty of cardiogenic
   pulmonary edema
   - Continue posaconazole, meropenem, and levoflox per ID recommendations
   for empiric coverage. Discuss with ID/BMT regarding need for these
   medications as patient is improving with diuresis.
   - Standing nebs (xopenex given tachycardia and atrovent)
   - On mechanical ventilation with standard precautions
   - If continued improvement in CXR findings and RSBI, likely extubation
   tomorrow.
   #. RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine continuing to drop despite diuresis.
   Falling since last admission when patient was suspected of having renal

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma who was admitted with fever, hypoxia, and new pulmonary infiltrates. The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 130/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 35% FiO2. The patient's general appearance is well-nourished and not in acute distress.

The patient's chest radiograph shows extensive right upper lobe opacities, which may represent infection, along with small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions. The tip of the endotracheal tube is low, approximately 1.5 cm above the carina, but it might still be within appropriate limits considering the patient's neck flexion.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.6 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, sodium of 162 mg/dL, potassium of 3.8 mEq/L, glucose of 163 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.9 mg/dL, and a pH of 7.32 with a bicarbonate level of 16 mEq/L.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma who is currently intubated in the ICU for respiratory distress. He has received several doses of Lasix to manage fluid balance, and his current status shows a negative fluid balance of -700 mL. The patient is on multiple antibiotics, including meropenem, levofloxacin, and posaconazole. His vital signs show a heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 130/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 35%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 329. The physical examination reveals tachycardia, clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, and soft and non-tender abdomen. Laboratory values show elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging reveals extensive right upper lobe opacities, a known right infrahilar mass, and small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory distress and the presence of extensive right upper lobe opacities on imaging suggest a potential respiratory complication such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These conditions can"

   Imaging: CXR([**2103-11-7**]):
   REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma,
   intubated for respiratory distress. Portable AP chest radiograph was
   compared to prior study obtained on [**2103-11-6**] at 06:04 a.m. The
   ET tube tip remains low, approximately 1.5 cm above the carina, but
   given significant flexion of patient neck, it might be still within the
   appropriate limits. There is still present extensive right upper lobe
   opacities continuing towards the lower lungs might represent infection.
   The known right infrahilar mass is seen. Small-to-moderate bilateral
   pleural effusions are demonstrated.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo M with a long history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p
   allogeneic transplant with recurrence admitted with fever, hypoxia and
   new pulmonary infiltrates, intubated given respiratory distress.
   #. Respiratory distress/failure: CT scan is consistent with a
   multifocal pneumonia. However, patient remains afebrile without
   leukocytosis. There may be some component of pulmonary edema. TTE
   inconsistent with heart failure as cause of respiratory distress.
   Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is on differential. Diagnosis is made
   through tissue histology. Possibility of fungal infection as well.
   Thoracic surgery has been consulted for possible VATs with tissue
   biopsy.
         Patient diuresed 1500mL in past 24 hours. CXR
   - Continue diuresis today. Currently on lasix drip.
   - Continue posaconazole, meropenem, and levoflox per ID recommendations
   for empiric coverage.
   - Standing nebs (xopenex given tachycardia and atrovent)
   - On mechanical ventilation with standard precautions
   - Follow up with surgery and heme/onc regarding possible VATs
   #. RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine between 2.5-3.0. Falling since last
   admission when patient was suspected of having renal failure secondary
   to contrast. Last admission which required HD; had renal biopsy at that
   time with findings consistent with ATN. Good urine production >
   100/hour while on lasix with stable creatinine.
   - Continue to renally dose meds, avoid hypotension and keep UOP >
   30cc/hr
   - Continue to monitor
   #. METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Minimally improved from yesterday with pH=7.30.
   AG=11. Lactate within normal limits. This is compensated metabolic
   acidosis. Continue to monitor with ABGs.
   #. HODGKINS LYMPHOMA: Has had multiple courses of treatment.
   - Continue solumedrol 10mg IV q6hrs currrently
   - Continue Lamivudine 100mg po daily given +HBV in the past
   - Continue acyclovir 400mg po q12hrs
   - Transfuse PRBC for hct < 25, and plts < 10, maintain active type and
   screen. Received one dose on [**11-4**].
   #. WBC COUNT: Had dropped while on Vancomycin. Resolved after
   discontinuation. White count stable.
   #. FEN/GI: TF, PPI, sliding scale electrolyte repletion. Insulin
   sliding scale increased yesterday as glucose had been elevated.
   Continue to monitor. Adjust insulin as needed.

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma who underwent an allogeneic transplant and now has recurrence. He presented with fever, hypoxia, and new pulmonary infiltrates, leading to intubation due to respiratory distress. The patient has extensive right upper lobe opacities on chest X-ray, which may represent infection, along with small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions. 

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1. Respiratory distress/failure: The patient's CT scan shows multifocal pneumonia, but he remains afebrile without leukocytosis. There may be some component of pulmonary edema. A transthoracic echo (TTE) is inconsistent with heart failure as a cause of respiratory distress. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is on the differential diagnosis, and a tissue histology is needed for diagnosis. Possibility of fungal infection is also considered. Thoracic surgery has been consulted for possible video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with tissue biopsy.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been between 2.5-3.0, falling since the last admission when he was suspected of having renal failure secondary to contrast. He had a renal biopsy during the last admission with findings consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Good urine production (>100/hour) while on Lasix with stable creatinine is observed.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation but was extubated yesterday. The patient's chief complaint is weakness and a desire to move around, which is understandable given their ICU stay.

The patient's lab results show a positive beta-glucan test, indicating a fungal infection. However, the galactomannan test is negative, which suggests that Aspergillus infection is less likely. The sputum gram stain shows 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs, chains, and clusters, indicating a possible bacterial infection. Further testing is needed to identify the specific organism.

The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including acyclovir for viral infection, meropenem for bacterial infection, and vancomycin for MRSA coverage. The patient's sodium levels were initially hypernatremic at 147 but have improved to 144. No intervention has been done for this.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/75 mmHg to 142/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 36.9°C.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,403 mL total, with 753 mL given through IV fluids and 260"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo M with a long history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p
   allogeneic transplant with recurrence admitted with fever, hypoxia and
   new pulmonary infiltrates, intubated given respiratory distress.
   #. Respiratory distress/failure: Patient has shown improvement in
   respiratory function and on CXR with continued diuresis. He was
   extubated yesterday afternoon and denies any shortness of breath
   currently. His respiratory distress/failure may have been due to
   pulmonary edema. Beta-glucan, which is a fungal assay, came back
   positive. This may be a false positive secondary to antibiotic use.
   Patient has been on posaconazole for presumed fungal infection. Patient
   was negative nearly 3 liters yesterday. Vigileo yesterday showed
   CO=9.6, CI=5.8, indicating he was hypervolemic with good cardiac
   function.
   - Will decrease diuresis.
   - Will consult cardiology today to determine if his pulmonary edema was
   cardiogenic.
   - Continue posaconazole, meropenem, and levoflox per ID recommendations
   for empiric coverage.
   - Standing nebs (xopenex given tachycardia and atrovent)
   - Restarted Vancomycin secondary to GPC on gram stain
   #. RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine continuing to drop despite diuresis.
   Falling since last admission when patient was suspected of having renal
   failure secondary to contrast. Last admission which required HD; had
   renal biopsy at that time with findings consistent with ATN. Good urine
   production > 100/hour while on lasix with stable creatinine.
   - Continue to renally dose meds, avoid hypotension and keep UOP >
   30cc/hr
   - Continue to monitor
   #. METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: pH=7.32 this morning with AG=11. This is
   compensated metabolic acidosis with improving HCO3. Continue to monitor
   with ABGs.
   #. HODGKINS LYMPHOMA: Has had multiple courses of treatment.
   - Continue outpatient dose of Prednisone 10mg PO
   - Continue Lamivudine 100mg po daily given +HBV in the past
   - Continue acyclovir 400mg po q12hrs
   - Transfuse PRBC for hct < 25, and plts < 10, maintain active type and
   screen. Received one dose on [**11-4**].
   #. WBC COUNT: Had dropped while on Vancomycin. Resolved after
   discontinuation. White count stable. Will continue to monitor as
   patient
s vancomycin was restarted.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma who was admitted with fever, hypoxia, and new pulmonary infiltrates. He was intubated due to respiratory distress but has since shown improvement in respiratory function and was extubated yesterday afternoon. The patient denies any shortness of breath currently. His respiratory distress may have been secondary to pulmonary edema. The beta-glucan assay came back positive, which could be a false positive due to antibiotic use. The patient has been on posaconazole for presumed fungal infection. He was negative nearly 3 liters yesterday. A Vigileo showed CO=9.6, CI=5.8, indicating he was hypervolemic with good cardiac function.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory distress/failure: The patient's respiratory function has improved, and his pulmonary infiltrates appear to have improved on CXR with continued diuresis. His respiratory distress may have been due to pulmonary edema. Beta-glucan, which is a fungal assay, came back positive. This may be a false positive secondary to antibiotic use. The patient will continue on posaconazole, meropenem, and levofloxacin for empiric coverage.
2. Renal failure: Creatinine levels are continuing to drop despite diuresis. The patient had a previous admission where he was suspected of having renal failure secondary to contrast. Renal biopsy showed findings consistent with acute tub"

   45 yo M with a long history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma s/p
   allogeneic transplant with recurrence admitted with fever, hypoxia and
   new pulmonary infiltrates, intubated given respiratory distress.
   #. Respiratory distress/failure: Patient has shown improvement in
   respiratory function and on CXR with continued diuresis. He was
   extubated yesterday afternoon and denies any shortness of breath
   currently. His respiratory distress/failure may have been due to
   pulmonary edema. Beta-glucan, which is a fungal assay, came back
   positive. Patient has already been on posaconazole for presumed fungal
   infection. Fluid balance was negative nearly 3 liters yesterday.
   Vigileo yesterday showed CO=9.6, CI=5.8, indicating he was hypervolemic
   with good cardiac function. Pulmonary [**Last Name (un) **]-occlusive disease may be an
   underlying etiology responsible for his respiratory status. Diagnostic
   work up would include right heart catheterization.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with goal of -2L today.
   - Switch to Lasix 20mg PO daily. Discontinue Lasix IV drip.
   - Will not consult cardiology as patient has requested that no more
   procedures be done. Right heart catheterization may be an appropriate
   next step in his work up to provide further diagnostic and prognostic
   information. VATs may be another possible investigation, but will not
   be considered at this time given his improving respiratory function and
   patient
s wishes.
   - Continue posaconazole, meropenem, and levoflox per ID
   recommendations.
   - Standing nebs (xopenex given tachycardia and atrovent)
   - Discontinue vancomycin as any severe GPC infection would produce
   symptoms.
   #. RENAL FAILURE: Creatinine continuing to drop with diuresis. Falling
   since last admission when patient was suspected of having renal failure
   secondary to contrast. Last admission which required HD; had renal
   biopsy at that time with findings consistent with ATN. Good urine
   production > 100/hour while on lasix with stable creatinine.
   - Continue to renally dose meds, avoid hypotension and keep UOP >
   30cc/hr
   - Continue to monitor
   #. HODGKINS LYMPHOMA: Has had multiple courses of treatment.
   - Continue outpatient dose of Prednisone 10mg PO
   - Continue Lamivudine 100mg po daily given +HBV in the past
   - Continue acyclovir 400mg po q12hrs
   - Transfuse PRBC for hct < 25, and plts < 10, maintain active type and
   screen. Received one dose on [**11-4**].
   - Platelets continuing to drop. Check tomorrow AM and transfuse when
   drops below 10.
   #. WBC COUNT: Had dropped while on Vancomycin. Resolved after
   discontinuation. White count stable. Will continue to monitor as
   patient
s vancomycin was restarted.
   #. FEN/GI: ADAT, PPI, sliding scale electrolyte repletion. Adjust
   insulin as needed.
   #. PPX: Pneumatic compression boots, PPI
   #. CODE STATUS: FULL CODE
   #. DISPO: Callout to Oncology today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma who was admitted with fever, hypoxia, and new pulmonary infiltrates. He was intubated due to respiratory distress but has since shown improvement and was extubated yesterday afternoon. His respiratory function and chest x-ray have also improved with continued diuresis. The patient's respiratory distress may have been caused by pulmonary edema, as indicated by the positive beta-glucan assay, suggesting a fungal infection. The patient is already on posaconazole for presumed fungal infection. Fluid balance was negative nearly 3 liters yesterday, and the patient's cardiac function is good with a Vigileo showing CO=9.6 and CI=5.8. Pulmonary arterial occlusive disease may be an underlying cause of his respiratory status, and a diagnostic workup including right heart catheterization is being considered. The patient has declined further procedures. 

Other findings include renal failure with improving creatinine levels, Hodgkin's lymphoma with ongoing treatment, and a low white blood cell count that has stabilized after discontinuation of vancomycin. The patient's platelet count is decreasing and should be monitored closely. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress/failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory distress and failure may have been due to pulmonary edema. 
2. Positive beta-glucan: The positive fungal assay indicates a potential fungal infection, which is being treated with"
