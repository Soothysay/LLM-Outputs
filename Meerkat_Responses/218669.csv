   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old man with DM and asthma who presents
   following a cardiopulmonary arrest at home.
   .
   1. s/p cardiac arrest
   ?PEA arrest secondary to hypoxia or acidosis, now in SR remains vent
   and pressor dependent. Though patient presents to the floor >6 hours
   after arrest, will proceed with cooling protocol as neurologic
   prognosis seems quite poor.
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM
   - ASA 325 now
   - check TTE to eval pump function and for wmas
   .
   2. Hypotension
   Remains pressor dependent at this time. In setting of infecton,
   concerning for sepsis. Consider also cardiogenic shock, though seems
   less slikely.
   - fluid resuscitate to CVP 8-12
   - titrate levophed to MAP >65, urine output 50cc/hr
   - sepsis catheter
   - check SVo2
   - IJ placement for accurate CVP measurement
   .
   3. Respiratory failure
   Probably secondary to pneumonia versus COPD exacerbation. Imaging
   consistent with multifocal pna - recent MICU stay consider nosocomial
   pathogens though he has more recently been home. Patient currently with
   high PIPs nl plateaus c/w bronchospasm.
   - Will start empiric vanc/zosyn, might be able to [**Doctor Last Name **] back to
   ceftriaxone/levoflox
   - Check urinary legionella antigen.
   - F/u blood cultures
   - Gram stain and culture of respiratory secretions
   - Continue nebs and steroids

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and asthma who presented to the ICU after experiencing a cardiopulmonary arrest at home. The patient remains ventilator and pressor-dependent and is currently being treated for several medical conditions.

1. The patient had a cardiac arrest secondary to hypoxia or acidosis, and despite being more than 6 hours post-arrest, the medical team has decided to proceed with a cooling protocol due to the poor prognosis for neurologic recovery. They are monitoring cardiac enzymes, repeating EKGs, administering ASA 325, and evaluating pump function through a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess for any potential complications like myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism.

2. The patient is hypotensive and remains pressor-dependent. The medical team is concerned about the possibility of sepsis, especially given the presence of infection. Other potential causes such as cardiogenic shock are being considered as well. The treatment plan includes fluid resuscitation to achieve a central venous pressure (CVP) between 8-12 mmHg, titrating levophed to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg and urine output at 50cc/hr, placing a sepsis catheter, checking systemic vascular oxygen saturation (SVo2), and considering inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement for accurate CVP measurement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old man with diabetes and asthma who presented following a cardiopulmonary arrest at home. He remains ventilated and pressor dependent, indicating severe respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient's neurologic prognosis appears poor, so a cooling protocol has been initiated to prevent further brain damage. There are concerns about sepsis, possibly due to an infection or cardiogenic shock. The patient also has hyperglycemia, hypothermia, and acute respiratory failure, which may be secondary to pneumonia or a COPD exacerbation. An anoxic brain injury is suspected, and the patient requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis, especially considering the presence of an infection. Immediate fluid resuscitation and consideration of sepsis catheter placement are necessary.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension could also be due to cardiogenic shock, which needs to be evaluated and managed appropriately.
3. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's minimal responsiveness indicates a potential anoxic brain injury. Neurologic prognosis seems poor, and further interventions such as cooling and MRI head are recommended.
4. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia or a COPD exacerbation. Close monitoring of oxygenation, ventilation, and bronchospasm is crucial. Continued use"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of hypotension, hyperglycemia, hypothermia, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been started on arterial and multi-lumen lines, as well as various infusions including norepinephrine, midazolam, fentanyl, cisatracurium, and insulin. The patient's vital signs show a low heart rate, stable blood pressure, and adequate oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a slightly elevated central venous pressure. Fluid balance shows an intake-output discrepancy. The patient's ABG results indicate mild respiratory alkalosis with normal oxygenation. Laboratory results reveal elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and significantly high glucose levels. The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's current condition is stable, but there are potential complications related to hypotension, hyperglycemia, hypothermia, and respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the elevated white blood cell count and the presence of multi-lumen lines, there is a possibility of hospital-acquired infection leading to sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels and history of chronic kidney disease may worsen due to inadequate fluid management or other factors.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The significantly high"

   68 yr good man with COPD s/p prolonged cardiac arrest transferred with
   shock and anoxic brain injury
   1. CardioPulmonary Arrest: etiology unclear- it may well have
   hypoxemic, hypercarbic as opposed to primary cardiac. ECG without
   evidence of STEMI. Will give ASA, no systemic anti coag in light of
   intra cranial edema. Initiate cooling though it is getting a late start
 worth a try given his down time. Presently with adequate MAPs on
   Levophed. Would favor getting IJ to transduce CVP and check SCVo2 to
   determine how much mixed cardiogenic septic
   2. Hypercarbic and Hypoxemic Resp Failure: he is actively
   bronchospastic with pulmonary edema. High PIP. Convert to PCV and
   paralyze. Continue IV steroids and aggressive MDI. Goal maintain pH
   greater than 7.15 with permissive hypercapnia.
   3. Anoxic brain Injury: supportive care, therapeutic hypothermia,
   follow up head CT in AM.
   4. ARF: ATN in setting of hypotension likely.

The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs show hypotension (low blood pressure), tachycardia (high heart rate), and hypothermia (low body temperature). The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) with assist, autoflow mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 390 mL, set respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), blood glucose levels, and elevated levels of troponin T, lactate, and lactic acid. The patient also has deranged renal function tests and electrolyte imbalances.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate poor perfusion and organ hypoxia. It is important to optimize fluid administration"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD who experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest, likely due to hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was successfully resuscitated but suffered an anoxic brain injury. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications including hypotension, hyperglycemia, hypothermia, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has been paralyzed to facilitate weaning off the ventilator. Therapeutic hypothermia is being used to protect the brain, and the patient's blood glucose levels are being carefully monitored and managed with an insulin drip. Other supportive measures include prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and frequent cultures of respiratory secretions will be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin injection will be used to prevent this complication.
3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness can lead to stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum. Prophylactic use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) will help reduce the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD who experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest and is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure due to hypercarbic and hypoxemic respiratory failure, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Septic shock: The patient's shock is likely evolving septic in nature, indicated by low systemic vascular oxygenation (SCVO2) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). This can lead to further hypotension and organ dysfunction.

3. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient's acute renal failure is suspected to be caused by hypotension and the development of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which can worsen due to stress and may require insulin therapy to maintain blood glucose levels within a target range.

5. Anoxic brain injury: The patient has suffered an anoxic brain injury, and supportive care, therapeutic hypothermia, and follow-up head CT perfusion will be necessary for management.

6. Pulmonary edema: The patient shows signs of pulmonary edema, which can complicate his respiratory status and increase the risk of further respiratory failure.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with diabetes mellitus (DM) and asthma who presented following a cardiopulmonary arrest at home. The patient remains vent and pressor dependent after the arrest. 

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is unresponsive and does not follow simple commands. This could be due to anoxic brain injury, as indicated by the CT scan.
2. Renal failure, acute: The patient has an elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output, suggesting acute kidney injury (AKI). This could be secondary to hypotension during the arrest.
3. Hypotension: The patient remains pressor dependent, indicating ongoing hypotension. This may be due to sepsis or the cardiopulmonary arrest.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has high blood glucose levels, which is a common complication in critically ill patients and should be managed with insulin therapy.
5. Respiratory failure, acute: The patient likely has pneumonia as the cause of COPD exacerbation with elements of sepsis. Imaging shows multifocal pneumonia, and respiratory support is required.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient had peaked T waves on the EKG, which resolved after administration of calcium, insulin/dextrose, and Kayexalate.
7. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is rising,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several tests and interventions. 

On [**2112-11-19**] 09:38 AM, an EKG was performed, followed by a transthoracic echo at 10:00 AM. The patient then experienced a multi-lumen stop at 10:51 PM, after which the cooling protocol was ended and the patient was warmed. The patient continues to be bradycardic and hypotensive, requiring small boluses and levophed. The femoral arterial line failed, and a radial arterial line could not be replaced. Dopamine was started for inotropic support, and the patient developed a palpable thrill.

Allergies:
- No known drug allergies

Medications:
- Meropenem was administered on [**2112-11-19**] 04:26 AM.
- Vancomycin was given on [**2112-11-19**] 08:15 AM.

   1. s/p cardiac arrest
   ?PEA arrest secondary to hypoxia or acidosis, now in SR remains vent
   and pressor dependent. Though patient presents to the floor >6 hours
   after arrest, will proceed with cooling protocol as neurologic
   prognosis seems quite poor.  Cyceld cardiac enzymes. Repeated EKG.  ASA
   325 y/d.
   -  check TTE to eval pump function and for wmas
   .
   2. Hypotension
   Remains pressor dependent at this time. In setting of infecton,
   concerning for sepsis. Consider also cardiogenic shock.
   - fluid resuscitate to CVP 8-12
   - titrate levophed to MAP >65, urine output 50cc/hr
   - sepsis catheter
   - check SVo2
   - IJ placed for accurate CVP measurement
   .
   3. Respiratory failure
   Probably secondary to pneumonia versus COPD exacerbation. Imaging
   consistent with multifocal pna - recent MICU stay consider nosocomial
   pathogens though he has more recently been home. Patient currently with
   high PIPs nl plateaus c/w bronchospasm.
   - Started empiric vanc/zosyn
   - Check urinary legionella antigen.
   - F/u blood cultures
   - Gram stain and culture of respiratory secretions
   - Continue nebs and steroids
   .
   4. ?Anoxic brain injury
   Minimally responsive at this time
   - cooling as above
   - MRI head per neurosurgery recommendations once stabilized.
   - F/u neurology and neurosurgery recommendations.
   - Serial neuro checks.
   - EEG
   - f/u C spine read
   .
   4. DM - Started insulin drip and titer to sugars b/w 100-200, goal
   fingersticks <150
   .
   5. HTN - Holding home lisinopril in the setting of hypotension.
   .
   6. Hyperkalemia - peaked T's resolved on repeat EKG in ICU. Got
   calcium, insulin/dextrose. Kayexalate.  Repeat K WNL.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old man with diabetes mellitus and asthma who presented following a cardiopulmonary arrest at home. The patient remains vent and pressor dependent and has been diagnosed with several medical complications.

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is unresponsive and sedated, which could be due to anoxic brain injury or other causes.
2. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Kidney Injury, AKI): The patient's serum creatinine level has increased from baseline, indicating possible acute kidney injury. This could be related to hypotension, sepsis, or other factors.
3. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive and requires pressor support. This may indicate sepsis or cardiogenic shock.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, requiring insulin therapy to control blood sugar levels.
5. Respiratory Failure, Acute: The patient likely has respiratory failure due to pneumonia or COPD exacerbation. Imaging shows multifocal pneumonia, and the patient is being treated with appropriate antibiotics and supportive measures.
6. Possible Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient's minimal responsiveness suggests the possibility of anoxic brain injury, and further evaluation with MRI and neurologic assessments is planned.
7. Hyperkalemia: The patient had peaked T waves on EKG, which resolved after treatment with calcium, insulin/dextrose, and Kayexalate."

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yr good man with COPD s/p prolonged cardiac arrest transferred with
   shock and anoxic brain injury
   1. CardioPulmonary Arrest: etiology unclear- likely hypoxemic,
   hypercarbic as opposed to primary cardiac. ECG without evidence of
   STEMI. Will give ASA, no systemic anti coag in light of intra cranial
   edema
   2. Shock: likely evolving septic, SCVO2 77, CVP 14, MAP 70, wean
   Levophed/Dopa as tolerated
   3. [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 4800**] [**Doctor Last Name **] injury: no gag, no dolls eye, not overbreathing EEG
   looks flat, check stat repeat head ct to confirm findings., then
   proceed to brain death exam with Neuro approval
   2. Hypercarbic and Hypoxemic Resp Failure: he is actively
   bronchospastic with pulmonary edema. High PIP. Convert to PCV and
   paralyze. Continue IV steroids and aggressive MDI. Goal maintain pH
   greater than 7.15 with permissive hypercapnia.
   3. Anoxic brain Injury: supportive care, therapeutic hypothermia,
   follow up head CT perfusion.
   4. ARF: ATN in setting of hypotension likely.   Rising K
 would not
   start HD as progressing to near brain death
   5. Hyperglycemia: Insulin drip
 to maintain FS 180-200
 avoid lows in
   light of neurologic insult
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff Notes

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiorespiratory arrest. The patient's condition is critical, and he is currently intubated and sedated. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.7 C (98.1 F), heart rate 57 bpm (normal range 45-71 bpm), blood pressure 104/54 mmHg (normal range 65-89 mmHg), respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute (normal range 15-22 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation 94%, and junctional rhythm.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including dopamine, insulin, norepinephrine, famotidine, heparin sodium, and Dilantin. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 349 mg/dL.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (23.2 K/uL), hemoglobin (14.6 g/dL), creatinine (2.4-3.6 mg/dL), potassium (24 mEq/L), and blood urea nitrogen (60 mg/dL). The patient's electrolytes and other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's chest X-ray shows an endotracheal tube in good position, right lower lobe infiltrate, and hyperinflation consistent with COPD.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several medical complications, including altered mental status (not delirium), acute renal failure, hypotension (not in shock), hyperglycemia, and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS). The patient is also being evaluated for potential brain death due to anoxic brain injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and blood urea nitrogen suggest acute renal failure. This can be caused by hypotension and decreased renal perfusion.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and increased PaCO2 indicate respiratory failure. This may be due to COPD exacerbation and pulmonary edema.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose level requires management with insulin to maintain fasting serum glucose levels between 180-200 mg/dL.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates hypotension, which may be due to septic shock.
5. Brain death: The patient's flat EEG and lack of brainstem reflexes raise concerns for brain death, especially in the context of anoxic brain injury.

Note: The patient's family has agreed to defer the apnea test and has given permission for extubation and comfort measures only."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a history of cardiorespiratory arrest and COPD exacerbation. The patient's current conditions include altered mental status, acute renal failure, hypotension, hyperglycemia, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to altered mental status and acute renal failure can increase the risk of infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

2. Respiratory complications: Acute respiratory failure may lead to further respiratory distress, such as barotrauma, volutrauma, or ventilator-induced lung injury. Additionally, the presence of right lower lobe infiltrate on the chest X-ray suggests a possible pneumonia or worsening of underlying COPD.

3. Cardiac issues: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia may indicate cardiac dysfunction. This can potentially progress to cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.

4. Hyperkalemia: The elevated potassium level (24 mEq/L) increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and requires careful monitoring and management.

5. Poor glycemic control: The high glucose level (349 mg/dL) suggests poorly controlled diabetes, which can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state.

6. Thromboembolic events: Critically ill patients are"

   Assessment and Plan
   68 yr good man with COPD s/p prolonged cardiac arrest transferred with
   shock and anoxic brain injury
   1. CardioPulmonary Arrest: etiology unclear- likely hypoxemic,
   hypercarbic as opposed to primary cardiac. ECG without evidence of
   STEMI. Will give ASA, no systemic anti coag in light of intra cranial
   edema. 12 hours into cooling
 was a late start
 worth a try given his
   down time.
   2. Shock: likely evolving septic, SCVO2 77, CVP 14, MAP 70, wean
   Levophed as tolerated.
   2. Hypercarbic and Hypoxemic Resp Failure: he is actively
   bronchospastic with pulmonary edema. High PIP. Convert to PCV and
   paralyze. Continue IV steroids and aggressive MDI. Goal maintain pH
   greater than 7.15 with permissive hypercapnia.
   3. Anoxic brain Injury: supportive care, therapeutic hypothermia,
   follow up head CT perfusion.
   4. ARF: ATN in setting of hypotension likely.
   5. Hyperglycemia: Insulin drip
 to maintain FS 180-200
 avoid lows in
   light of neurologic insult
   Remaining issues as per Housestaff Notes
   ICU Care

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of COPD exacerbation who experienced a cardiorespiratory arrest. The cause of the arrest is unclear, but it is likely related to hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure rather than a primary cardiac issue. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. He is also receiving IV steroids and aggressive medical management for his bronchospasm and pulmonary edema.

The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, which is not delirium, acute renal failure, hypotension (not in shock), hyperglycemia, and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS). The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, and an insulin drip is being used to maintain fasting serum glucose levels between 180-200 mg/dL to avoid hypoglycemia, especially considering the neurologic insult.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/54 to 123/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg, and his mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 70 mmHg.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell"
