","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and invasive ventilation was initiated. The patient also started on multi-lumen support. Allergies include Zosyn, which causes a rash. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent events. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/81 mmHg to 172/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 38 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 25 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 30 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) level of 137 mEq/L, potassium (K+) level of 6.0 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) level of 99 mEq/L, and magnesium (Mg++) level of 2.1 mg/dL. The patient's blood glucose level is within normal range, but there are fluctuations. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count has increased from 6.3 K/uL to 8.2 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level has increased from 29.4% to 30.4%, platelet (Plt) count has increased from 358 K/uL to 411 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level has slightly increased from 8.3 mg/dL to 8.0 mg/dL, and lactic acid level is within normal range. The patient's physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient being intubated. The patient has a history of tracheobronchomalacia and requires ongoing respiratory support. The patient's current medications include pantoprazole and other ICU medications. The patient's code status is full code and the disposition is ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of tracheomalacia, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. She presented with acute worsening of dyspnea, concerning for stridor. The physical examination revealed expiratory wheezing over the trachea, indicating possible recurrence of tracheal stenosis and malacia. Other findings include respiratory acidosis with CO2 retention and controlled intubation was performed.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient has tracheomalacia, which has worsened acutely. Bronchoscopy showed tracheal stenosis with granulation tissue and malacia. A procedure involving stent placement is planned in the OR tomorrow morning.
2. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient is on hemodialysis three times a week. HD in the morning prior to OR is scheduled. Calcium acetate and epogen will be continued.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is difficult to control with nodal agents and antiarrhythmics. Vitamin K and FFP will be given in the morning if needed. Coumadin will be held overnight, and diltiazem will be held as well. Amiodarone will be continued.
4. Anemia: The patient has CKD, and epogen and"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of tracheomalacia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), obesity, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD).
- She presented with acute worsening of dyspnea, concerning for stridor.
- The physical examination revealed expiratory wheezing over the trachea, raising concerns for recurrence of tracheal stenosis and malacia.
- The patient's blood gas showed respiratory acidosis with CO2 at baseline.
- She underwent bronchoscopy, which showed tracheal stenosis with granulation tissue and malacia.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is expected to be taken to the operating room (OR) for likely stent placement.
- Other medical issues include ESRD, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheal stenosis with granulation tissue and malacia: The patient's symptoms and bronchoscopy findings suggest a recurrence of tracheal stenosis and malacia. This condition can lead to airway obstruction and respiratory distress.
2. Respiratory acidosis: The patient's blood gas showed respiratory acidosis with elevated CO2 levels. If not managed properly, this can progress to more severe acidosis and respiratory failure.
3. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of tracheomalacia, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. She presented with acute worsening of dyspnea and was found to have respiratory acidosis with a CO2 baseline. The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with stent placement and is currently intubated. She has been dialyzed yesterday and today. The patient's medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease, and anemia. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Recurrence of tracheal stenosis and malacia: The patient's examination revealed expiratory wheezing over the trachea, which raises concern for the recurrence of tracheal stenosis and malacia.
2. Volume overload: The patient's history is not consistent with pulmonary edema as a cause of acute decompensation, but it is important to consider volume overload as a potential cause of chronic dyspnea.
3. Pulmonary embolism: Although the patient's response to minimal treatment with nebulizers and quick improvement in oxygenation make pulmonary embolism less likely, it should still be considered in the differential diagnosis.
4. Respiratory infections: The presence of Gram-positive cocci in the sputum culture suggests the possibility of a respiratory infection, which can further exacerbate the patient's respiratory distress.
5. Arrhythmias: The"
