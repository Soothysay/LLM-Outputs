   Assessment and Plan
   85M with Hodgkin's Lymphoma currently undergoing chemotherapy with
   Gemzar/[**Hospital 5413**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for work-up of fever and
   tachycardia.
   .
   Fevers/SIRS- In the setting of tachycardia, elevated WBC - meets
   criteria for SIRS.  UA clean. Chest x-ray and CT chest without evidence
   of pneumonia or intraabdominal abscess. After 4 liters of NS, systolic
   BPs in 80s, asymptomatic.  Per OMR, baseline BPs 120-140s on a
   BBlocker.  Baseline HR 70s-80s on BBlocker.  Patient last recieved
   Neulasta on [**8-13**].  Differential includes SIRS/Sepsis v. tamponade v a
   conglomeration of lymphoma and treatment related symptoms.
   Mild-moderate pericardial effusion noted in ED.  EKG somewhat low
   voltage, no electrical alternans, cards consulted.  No JVD or pulsus
   paradoxus on exam but distant heart sounds.  Pt does have small
   pericardial effusion noted on prior Cts.  On coumadin with INR of 2.7.
   Effusion could be hemorrhagic v malignant v other.  Oncologist, Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5411**], felt that elevation of WBC count could be attributable to
   Neulasta and that fevers are not uncommon in patient's with lymphoma.
   Etiology of tachycardia uncertain, however, as per cardiology rhythm is
   atrial tachycardia with rapid onset and rapid offest.  Elevation of
   lactate likely due to fall and being down for an unknown period of
   time.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5411**] also noted that patients who have been on chemo for
   extended periods can develop neuropathies and cardiac conduction
   abnormalities.
   - repeat CBC and diff
   - patient has not required aggressive fluid resuscitation since arrival
   - f/u blood and urine cultures -pending
   - patient received vanc and levo in ED, originally were going to hold
   off on additional antiobiotics however patietn spiked fever again
   - recultured where portacath site is, and restarted vancomycin, will
   continue pending negative blood/line culture results and potential
   source of infection in this patient
   - CTA negative for acute PE, no PNA noted either, CT abdomen negative
   for intrabdominal process
   Tachycardia
 appears to be atrial tachycardia
   - appreciate cards consult yesterday, reccomended beta blocker to treat
   a-tach
   - tried esmolol drip without success in breaking rhythm and also
   limited by low blood pressure
   - d/c esmolol drip and patient returned to [**Location 848**] sinus rhythm
   overnight
   - subsequently patient developed run of 22 NSVT with stable blood
   pressure, asymptomatic
 checked electrolytes which were okay (gave
   repletion to optimize) and started on amio load
   - will need to reconsult cardiology regarding other options for
   treatment as IV beta blocker did not work and now with NSVT
   - as below the pericardial effusion appears circumferential without
   signs of tamponade, so would continue to dose coumadin at regular dose
   - ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
   Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the
   apical free wall. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion
   appears circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade. No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is
   seen.
   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2166-7-28**], the right ventricle is no longer dilated and
   globally hypocontractile.

   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5411**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] dose chemo next week
   - last dose chemo [**2167-8-12**], last dose neulasta [**8-13**]
   - continue megace for now
   .
   Hypertension -  Baseline 140s
   - hold BBlocker, hold doxazosin
   - currently still hypotensive

","Summary of Progress Note:
An 85-year-old male with Hodgkin's lymphoma is admitted to the ICU for work-up of fever and tachycardia. He has been undergoing chemotherapy with gemzar/navelbine. The patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. He reports feeling hungry for breakfast. His temperature spikes overnight to 101, and blood cultures are pending. The patient is on esmolol drip for atrial tachycardia but does not break rhythm. Troponin levels are slightly elevated, and TSH is slightly elevated as well. An EKG is ordered for the morning, and blood cultures and urine culture results are pending. The patient develops NSVT and is started on amiodarone. 

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient meets criteria for SIRS. Urine analysis is clean. Chest x-ray and CT chest do not show evidence of pneumonia or intraabdominal abscess. The patient's baseline BPs are in the 120-140s on a beta-blocker, and his baseline HR is in the 70s-80s on a beta-blocker. Differential includes SIRS/sepsis v. tamponade v. a conglomeration of lymphoma and treatment-related symptoms.

","Summary:
An 85-year-old male with Hodgkin's lymphoma, currently undergoing chemotherapy, was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of fever and tachycardia. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, renal insufficiency, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101°F, heart rate of 151 bpm, blood pressure of 102/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is well-nourished and shows no acute distress.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the fever and tachycardia. His labs show a WBC count of 12.8 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL, platelet count of 265 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, and lactate level of 23.2%. His electrolytes are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient meets the criteria for SIRS and sepsis, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. The differential includes SIRS/sepsis, tamponade, and a combination of lymphoma and treatment-related symptoms. The oncologist believes that the elevated WBC count could be attributable to Neulasta and that fevers are not uncommon in patients with lymphoma. The etiology of t"

   .
   Fevers/SIRS- In the setting of tachycardia, elevated WBC - meets
   criteria for SIRS.  UA clean. Chest x-ray and CT chest without evidence
   of pneumonia or intraabdominal abscess. After 4 liters of NS, systolic
   BPs in 80s, asymptomatic.  Per OMR, baseline BPs 120-140s on a
   BBlocker.  Baseline HR 70s-80s on BBlocker.  Patient last recieved
   Neulasta on [**8-13**].  Differential includes SIRS/Sepsis v. tamponade v a
   conglomeration of lymphoma and treatment related symptoms.
   Mild-moderate pericardial effusion noted in ED.  EKG somewhat low
   voltage, no electrical alternans, cards consulted.  No JVD or pulsus
   paradoxus on exam but distant heart sounds.  Pt does have small
   pericardial effusion noted on prior Cts.  On coumadin with INR of 2.7.
   Effusion could be hemorrhagic v malignant v other.  Oncologist, Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 5411**], felt that elevation of WBC count could be attributable to
   Neulasta and that fevers are not uncommon in patient's with lymphoma.
   Etiology of tachycardia uncertain, however, as per cardiology rhythm is
   atrial tachycardia with rapid onset and rapid offest.  Elevation of
   lactate likely due to fall and being down for an unknown period of
   time.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5411**] also noted that patients who have been on chemo for
   extended periods can develop neuropathies and cardiac conduction
   abnormalities.

   Assessment and Plan
   85M with Hodgkin's Lymphoma currently undergoing chemotherapy with
   Gemzar/[**Hospital 5413**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for work-up of fever and
   tachycardia.
   .
   Fever, hypotension, tachycardia, elevated WBC - meets criteria for
   SIRS.  After 4 liters of NS, systolic BPs in 80s, asymptomatic.  Per
   OMR, baseline BPs 120-140s on a BBlocker.  Baseline HR 70s-80s on
   BBlocker.  Patient last recieved Neulasta on [**8-13**].  Differntial includes
   SIRS/Sepsis v. tamponade v a conglomeration of lymphoma and treatment
   related symptoms.  Discussed patient with primary oncologist this am.
   Mild-moderate pericardial effusion noted in ED.  EKG somewhat low
   voltage, no electrical alternans, cards consulted.  No JVD or pulses on
   exam but distant heart sounds.  Pt does have small pericardial effusion
   noted on prior Cts.  On coumadin with INR of 2.7.  Effusion could be
   hemorrhagic v malignant v other.  Oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5411**], felt that
   elevation of WBC count could be attributable to Neulasta and that
   fevers are not uncommon in patient's with lymphoma.  Etiology of
   tachycardia uncertain, however, patient now back at baseline with only
   fluid intervention and BBlocker held.  Elevation of lactate likely due
   to fall and being down for an unknown period of time.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5411**] also
   noted that patients who have been on chemo for extended periods can
   develop neuropathies and cardiac conduction abnormalities.
   - repeat CBC and diff
   - continue fluid resuscitation as needed, pt continues to make
   excellent urine and sats are 100% on RA
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - patient received vanc and levo in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] gold on further
   antibiotics for now and observe patient
   - CTA negative for acute PE, no PNA noted either
   - CT abdomen negative for intrabdominal process
   - mild-moderate pericardial effusion also noted, could account for
   tachycardia
   - ECHO for better evaluation of pericardial effusion
   - cards consult
   - hold coumadin pending work-up of effusion

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with Hodgkin's lymphoma who is currently undergoing chemotherapy with gemzar/navelbine. He was transferred to the ICU for work-up of fever and tachycardia.

The patient has a history of fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, which meet the criteria for SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome). His vital signs include a temperature of 101°F, heart rate of 151 bpm, blood pressure of 102/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance with no acute distress. His cardiovascular examination shows tachycardia and no murmurs. He has distant heart sounds, but no jugular venous distention or pulses are noted. His respiratory examination is clear bilaterally. His abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender bowel sounds. His extremities are warm and well-perfused. His neurologic examination shows that he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to person, time, and place.

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 12.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 265. Other lab values include sodium of 135 mEq/L, potassium of 4."

","The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of Hodgkin lymphoma who presented to the emergency department with tachycardia. He was initially thought to have acute coronary syndrome but was found to have atrial tachycardia instead. The patient was started on esmolol, which was not effective, and then switched to amiodarone drip after experiencing nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient has also been febrile with a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 128 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient's physical examination reveals warm extremities, diminished pulses in both distal arteries, and no other significant findings. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. The cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, as well as liver function tests. The patient's imaging studies, including an echocardiogram and CT scans of the chest and abdomen, did not reveal any abnormalities. 

The patient's assessment and plan include fevers of unknown origin, awaiting cultures and empiric vancomycin coverage. The cause of his hot off the nose (HOTN) is unclear, possibly due to decreased oral intake"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old man with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma who presented to the hospital after tripping and falling. He was initially diagnosed with atrial tachycardia but later experienced a run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient has been started on amiodarone, which helped to convert him into sinus rhythm. He also has a fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit and is suspected to have indwelling port-related infection. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 128 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has been placed on empiric vancomycin while awaiting culture results. His past medical history includes allergies to bleomycin and anaphylaxis from strawberry and pineapple. The patient's review of systems is positive for fever, tachycardia, and no dyspnea, abdominal pain, dysuria, joint pain, or rash. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level, indicating possible infection. Imaging studies such as an echocardiogram and CT scans of the chest and abdomen are negative for tamponade, pulmonary embolism, or any abdominal processes. The patient's plan includes continuing amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, providing glycemic control, and maintaining"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented to the ICU with complaints of loss of consciousness (LOC) following a fall. The patient has a history of Coumadin use, which was restarted, along with amiodarone load. The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) at 5pm for low hemoglobin concentration (hct). Urine culture was negative. The patient is experiencing significant peripheral neuropathy, necessitating the use of a walker at home. Neurontin was renally dosed today. The patient also has several runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), but is asymptomatic.

Allergies include bleomycins, anaphylaxis from strawberry and pineapple, and unknown allergy from a previous dose of antibiotics (vancomycin). The patient's last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on 08:00 AM on 08/27/2017.

Infusions include ICU medications and other medications. There are no changes to the patient's medical and family history.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted peripheral neuropathy.

Vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature (Tmax): 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.7 Fahrenheit)
- Heart rate (HR): 78-132 beats per minute
- Blood pressure (BP): 124/52 mmHg (90/50-134/87 mmHg)

   Gemzar/[**Hospital 5413**] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for work-up of fever and
   tachycardia.
   .
   Fevers- Patient still with fever and increasing WBC with left shift,
   but hemodinamically stable. Blood cultures and urine cultures negative
   so far. Portho cath site looks ok. CXR and CT of abdomen and pelvis
   without signs of infection. Small pericardial effusion by
   echocardiogram.  Oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5411**], felt that elevation of WBC
   count could be attributable to Neulasta and that fevers are not
   uncommon in patient's with lymphoma.
   - F/u CBC and diff
   - f/u blood and urine cultures -pending
   Tachycardia
 appears to be atrial tachycardia
   - appreciate cards consult yesterday, reccomended beta blocker to treat

   Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%).
   Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of the
   apical free wall. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not

   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. The effusion
   appears circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade. No right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is
   seen.
   Compared with the findings of the prior report (images unavailable for

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's Lymphoma, currently undergoing chemotherapy with Gemzar. He was transferred to the ICU for work-up of fever and tachycardia. The patient still has a fever, but hemodynamically stable with negative blood and urine cultures. A small pericardial effusion was noted on echocardiogram. The oncologist believes the elevated WBC count could be attributable to Neulasta, and fevers are not uncommon in patients with lymphoma. The tachycardia appears to be atrial tachycardia, and the patient was started on amiodarone load. The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease and received femoral and posterior tibial bypass surgery (also stent). He has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, renal insufficiency, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and a recent fall due to unsteadiness of gait.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has persistent fever despite negative blood and urine cultures. There is a concern for a potential infection, which may require further investigation and treatment.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has developed atrial tachycardia and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). These cardiac arrhythmias need to be monitored closely, and appropriate interventions should be considered based on the patient's hem"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with persistent and recurrent tachycardia now with
   substantial improvement and return to sinus rhythm.  This was in the
   setting of Amiodarone being given but long term plan will need to be
   clarified with cardiology consultation given difficult to control heart
   rate on Esmolol.
   1)Atrial Tachycardia-Difficult decision, Amiodarone considered but
   patient has conversion to stabilized heart rate without significant
   load of medication
   -Will continue with beta-blocker dosing
   -Consider Amiodarone if worsening seen and symptomatic insult noted
   2)Fever
no bacterial source identified on cultures.  Patient has been
   maintained on Vanco.
   -Will D/C if cultures negative
   3)Malignancy-
   -Follow up treatment per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5411**]
