","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presented with vomiting and diarrhea and was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute on chronic renal insufficiency. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.8°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 104/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on endotracheal tube with mechanical ventilation. 

The patient has been intubated for respiratory failure due to profound acidemia. A radial arterial line has been placed, and a CT abdomen/pelvis with intravenous contrast has been ordered. Stress-dose steroids have been started due to a history of panhypopituitarism, and a right internal jugular central venous line has been placed. The patient is also receiving levoflaxacin and vancomycin for empiric treatment of severe Clostridium difficile infection. Renal replacement therapy is being deferred at this time. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. He is receiving infusions of fentanyl, midazolam, and norepinephrine. Other medications include lorazepam, dextrose, meperidine, and sodium bicarbonate. 

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for pain, which the patient is unable to answer. 

Physical examination reveals that the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent CABG surgery. He presented with vomiting and diarrhea for three days and was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute on chronic renal insufficiency. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely caused by a gastrointestinal source, as indicated by low random cortisol levels indicating adrenal insufficiency. The patient's condition requires immediate attention and intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further complications related to sepsis, including organ dysfunction and multiple organ failure. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms is crucial.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is a ventilator-associated pneumonia or if the underlying cause of respiratory failure is not appropriately managed.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury may progress if renal perfusion is not adequately maintained or if there is ongoing ischemia/reperfusion injury.
4. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and CABG surgery, he is at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, or heart failure.
5. Clostridium difficile Infection: Although the initial C. difficile toxin assay was negative, the patient's symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea raise concerns"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and pituitary resection. He was admitted with fevers, diarrhea, shock, acidosis, and developed acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues:

1. Shock: The patient is experiencing distributive shock with sepsis and adrenal insufficiency. The concern is that the source of sepsis is likely gastrointestinal due to symptoms of diarrhea. The patient is being managed with pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, hydrocortisone, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient remains mechanically ventilated with appropriate oxygenation and ventilation. Current ventilator settings will be continued.

3. Acidosis: The patient has mixed anion gap (AG) and non-gap metabolic acidosis in the context of acute renal failure. He is receiving bicarbonate infusion to improve acidosis.

4. Cardiac enzyme elevations: There are mildly elevated cardiac enzymes, but they are more likely due to demand ischemia rather than an acute thrombotic event. Enzyme trends will be monitored to ensure resolution, and the patient is on statin therapy.

Other considerations include chronic renal failure, acute lung injury, and fever of unknown origin. The patient's overall condition is critical, and he requires intensive care unit"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and pituitary resection. He was admitted with fevers, diarrhea, shock, acidosis, and acute respiratory failure. The patient developed acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. He also has distributive shock with sepsis and adrenal insufficiency, with the highest concern for a gastrointestinal (GI) source given symptoms of diarrhea. The patient remains mechanically ventilated with appropriate oxygenation and ventilation. 

The patient has mixed acid-base disorder, which may be partly due to worsening renal failure. He also has mildly elevated cardiac enzymes, but this is suspected to be from demand ischemia rather than an acute thrombotic event. 

The patient is critically ill and requires ongoing ICU care. His condition should be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should be implemented based on his vital signs and clinical progress."

He presented with vomiting and diarrhea, and was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute on chronic renal insufficiency.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), a heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/74 mmHg to 163/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, ranitidine, heparin, and various antibiotics. The patient has a Foley catheter in place, and is receiving tube feeds through a fiberoptic feeding tube.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's liver function tests are normal, but there is evidence of acute kidney injury with an elevated serum lactate level.

The patient's imaging studies reveal left lower lobe consolidation and bilateral pleural effusions on chest computed tomography (CT). The echocardiogram shows a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, known right adrenal adenoma, and small bowel chronic inflammation. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, possible sepsis, and respiratory distress. The patient has been sedated and unable to provide history. His current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, ranitidine, and heparin prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs show sinus bradycardia, mildly elevated blood pressure, and normal oxygen saturation. His recent lab results show stable kidney function, slightly elevated white blood cell count, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal left lower lobe consolidation, bilateral effusions, and a distended gallbladder without signs of inflammation or stones. An echocardiogram shows preserved biventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of over 55%. The patient's recent microbiology test is negative for Clostridium difficile toxin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and presence of consolidation on imaging may indicate an ongoing infection. This could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and sepsis.
2. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows a positive fluid intake of 9,331 mL and output of 1,945 mL over 24 hours. This suggests a potential fluid overload situation, which can contribute to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory distress.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is mildly elevated but has been previously reported as hypotensive. If the hypotension persists or worsens, it can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure.
4. Renal function deterioration: Although the patient's current renal function appears stable, his chronic renal failure puts him at risk for further deterioration. Close monitoring of renal function markers is necessary to prevent acute kidney injury.
5. Adrenal crisis: The patient's known right adrenal adenoma raises concerns about adrenal insufficiency or crisis, especially in the setting of critical illness and stress. Adrenal crisis can present with hypotension, hyperkalemia, and hyponatremia.
6. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobilization and underlying risk factors make him susceptible to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures such as systemic anticoagulation should be continued.

Please note that these are potential complications based on the information provided in the progress note. The actual clinical situation may vary, and further assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

   insufficiency.
   #Shock
 off pressors <24 hrs; fever, hemodynamics, and acidemia
   improving; suspect sepsis from a GI source given presenting symptoms in
   addition to possible PNA as evidenced by LLL consolidation on CT, and
   adrenal insufficiency; cardiogenic shock unlikely given TTE findings

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. He presents with symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, along with shock, respiratory failure, and acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency. The patient's condition is improving, but he still requires close monitoring and treatment for various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and acidemia suggest a possible sepsis. The presence of LLL consolidation on CT also indicates pneumonia as a potential source of infection.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has a known right adrenal adenoma, and the recent CT scan shows stranding around the right kidney and small bowel, which may indicate chronic inflammation. This could suggest adrenal insufficiency.
3. Cardiogenic shock: Although the TTE (transesophageal echocardiogram) shows preserved biventricular systolic function, the patient initially required pressor support. Therefore, there is a possibility of cardiogenic shock due to underlying cardiac issues.
4. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, which can be associated with C. difficile infection. Despite two negative toxin assays, it is important to continue treatment for severe C. difficile colitis until final confirmation.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and pituitary resection. He was admitted with fevers, diarrhea, shock, acidosis, and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient is currently improving off pressors and on minimal vent requirements. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient has a distributive shock picture with sepsis and adrenal insufficiency, with the highest concern for a gastrointestinal source given symptoms of diarrhea versus a viral process.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient remains mechanically ventilated with appropriate oxygenation/ventilation. There is a possibility of extubation if sedation and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) are successful.
3. Cardiac Enzyme Elevations: There are mildly elevated cardiac enzymes, which are suspected to be due to demand ischemia rather than an acute thrombotic event. Enzymes will be trended to ensure resolution, and no additional acute management is required.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is improving, and no hemodialysis (HD) is needed. Acid-base status and urine output (UOP) will be followed.
5. ETOH Abuse: The patient is currently on versed gtt. Once off sedation, his ETOH abuse will be addressed.

Overall, the patient is critically ill, and careful monitoring and management are necessary to address the various"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. They have been on mechanical ventilation and pressors. The patient has undergone multiple imaging studies, including an abdominal CT scan showing bilateral effusions, bibasilar consolidations, gallbladder distension, mesenteric stranding, and a right adrenal lesion. The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's thyroid function tests are within normal range. The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and adrenal insufficiency. They have no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they are sedated and not fully assessed neurologically. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set Vt of 500 mL, RR of 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 98%. The patient's ABG results indicate a slightly acidic pH with normal oxygenation and ventilation parameters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures to prevent VAP, such as elevating the head of bed, performing daily wake-up trials,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presented with symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea and was admitted to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute on chronic renal insufficiency. The patient's condition has been improving, with fever, hemodynamics, and acidemia improving off pressors within 24 hours. However, the patient still requires ongoing treatment and monitoring for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, hypotension, and respiratory failure suggests the possibility of sepsis, especially considering the presence of pneumonia on imaging. The source of infection may be gastrointestinal due to vomiting and diarrhea.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea could potentially indicate acute pancreatitis, which may require further evaluation and management.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient is receiving stress-dose steroids, indicating possible adrenal insufficiency, which can occur in critically ill patients.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has underlying respiratory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient has acute on chronic renal insufficiency, requiring careful management of fluid balance, electrolytes, and medication dosing.
6. Cardiac complications: Although the patient's cardiac biomarkers are trending"

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea and was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute on chronic renal insufficiency. The patient's current condition shows improvement in hemodynamics, fever, and acidemia, suggesting a possible sepsis from a gastrointestinal (GI) source, along with pneumonia evidenced by left lower lobe (LLL) consolidation on CT scan, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient's cardiogenic shock is unlikely given the findings from the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a possible sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of LLL consolidation on CT scan indicates pneumonia, which is an infection in the lungs that can cause respiratory failure if not treated promptly.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute on chronic renal insufficiency may progress to AKI, especially if there is inadequate fluid resuscitation or continued hypotension leading to decreased renal perfusion.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has been diagnosed with panhypopituitarism, which can lead to adrenal insufficiency. Stress-dose steroids are being administered to compensate for"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and pituitary resection. He was admitted with fevers, diarrhea, shock, acidosis, and progressing to acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient is now improving off pressors on minimal vent requirements. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Shock: The patient has a distributive shock picture with sepsis and adrenal insufficiency. No definitive infectious source has been identified yet. The patient has started with viral process, nausea/vomiting, and inability to take home medications resulting in panhypopituitary picture. 
   - The patient is off pressors for 20 hours.
   - He is on hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h.
   - IV fluids are maintained to maintain systolic blood pressure (SBP).
   - Continue IV vancomycin and cefepime for now, with Vanc trough in the morning. If cultures remain persistently negative, will discontinue IV vancomycin.
   - If Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is negative today, will discontinue oral vancomycin and IV flagyl.

2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient remains mechanically ventilated with appropriate oxygenation/ventilation.
   - Off sedation and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today, possible extubation.

   60 yo male with CAD, hx pituitary resection admitted with fevers,
   diarrhea, shock, acidosis, progressing to acute respiratory failure
   requiring intubation/mechanical ventilation.  Now improving
 off
   pressors on minimal vent requirements.  Panhypopit/adrenal
   insufficiency appears a large component of etiologic factors given
   rapid improvement over the past day.
   #. Shock: has distributive shock picture with sepsis and adrenal
   insufficiency. No definitive infectious source identified yet, though
   CXR today has not yet performed. [**Month (only) 60**] have started with viral process,
   N/V with inability to take home meds resulting in panhypopit picture.
   Now resolved and off pressors x 2 days.
   - On hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h
   - IVF to maintain SBP
   - Plan for 8 days of Cefepime
   - Continue  IV vanco until sputum speciated
   #. Acute respiratory failure: remains mechanically ventilated with
   appropriate oxygenation/ventilation.
   - Extubate this am
   #. Panhypopit: On hydrocort and synthroid.
   - Endocrine consult
   #. Cardiac enzyme elevations: mildly elevated, suspect more from demand
   ischemia rather than an acute thrombotic event. Will trend enzymes to
   ensure they resolve, otherwise no add'l acute management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and pituitary resection who was admitted with fevers, diarrhea, shock, acidosis, and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient showed signs of distributive shock with sepsis and adrenal insufficiency, but has improved over the past day. He is now off pressors and on minimal vent requirements. The patient has been diagnosed with panhypopituitarism due to viral process, N/V, and inability to take home medications. He is currently on hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h and Synthroid. An endocrine consult has been ordered. The patient's cardiac enzyme levels are mildly elevated, but no additional acute management is required. He also has acute renal failure with non-oliguric urine output and no change in renal function. No hemodialysis is needed at this time. The patient has a history of ETOH abuse and is currently on versed gtt. A CIWA scale will be followed once off sedation. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C (97.6 F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 147/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm. The patient's recent lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin,"

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with vomiting and diarrhea. He was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute on chronic renal insufficiency. The patient's medical complications include hypertension, alcohol withdrawal, fever of unknown origin, chronic renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and possible Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient has been weaned off pressors and his hemodynamics, fever, and acidemia are improving. However, he remains on vasopressors for hypotension. The patient's respiratory status has improved with extubation, but he still requires supplemental oxygen. The patient's renal function is improving with a slight decrease in creatinine levels.

The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms suggest a possible viral process or C. difficile infection. Stool cultures have been negative for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and C. difficile toxin assays have been negative as well. The patient's endotracheal aspirate Gram stain showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and rods, but no growth on respiratory culture.

The patient's management plan includes stress-dose steroids for suspected adrenal insufficiency, continuation of antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, and further evaluation of stool cultures and blood cultures. The patient's electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances are being monitored and managed accordingly.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor soon."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
- He presented with vomiting and diarrhea, and was admitted with shock, respiratory failure, and acute on chronic renal insufficiency.
- The patient's condition has improved significantly, with resolution of shock and decreasing cardiac enzymes.
- However, he continues to experience vomiting and diarrhea, which may suggest a viral gastrointestinal process or Clostridium difficile infection.
- The patient has also shown signs of adrenal insufficiency and is being treated with stress-dose steroids.
- His hypertension is well-controlled, and he has been restarted on Coreg.
- The patient's renal function has improved slightly, but he remains with acute on chronic renal insufficiency.
- He is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with shock and respiratory failure suggests a potential sepsis, possibly due to pneumonia or a viral gastrointestinal process. Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is crucial to detect any signs of recurrence.
2. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI): Despite negative toxin assays, the patient's symptoms of diarrhea could still indicate CDI. Continued monitoring for signs of worsening diarrhea and appropriate antibiotic stewardship are important.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings indicate adrenal insufficiency, for which"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 yo male with CAD, hx pituitary resection admitted with fevers,
   diarrhea, shock, acidosis, progressing to acute respiratory failure
   requiring intubation/mechanical ventilation.  Now improving
 off
   pressors on minimal vent requirements.  Panhypopit/adrenal
   insufficiency appears a large component of etiologic factors given
   rapid improvement over the past day.
   #. Shock: has distributive shock picture with sepsis and adrenal
   insufficiency. No definitive infectious source identified yet, though
   CXR today has not yet performed. [**Month (only) 60**] have started with viral process,
   N/V with inability to take home meds resulting in panhypopit picture.
   Now resolved and off pressors x 2 days.
   - On hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h
   - IVF to maintain SBP
   - Plan for 8 days of Cefepime
   - Continue  IV vanco until sputum speciated
   #. Acute respiratory failure: remains mechanically ventilated with
   appropriate oxygenation/ventilation.
   - Extubate this am
   #. Panhypopit: On hydrocort and synthroid.
   - Endocrine consult
   #. Cardiac enzyme elevations: mildly elevated, suspect more from demand
   ischemia rather than an acute thrombotic event. Will trend enzymes to
   ensure they resolve, otherwise no add'l acute management.
   - ASA / Statin
   #. Acute renal failure: Non-oliguric, no change in renal function over
   last day. No HD needs.  Follow AG acidosis/bicarb.  Follow UOP, avoid
   nephrotoxins.
   #. ETOH abuse: Currently on versed gtt.  Will follow once off sedation.
   Tremulous today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and pituitary resection. He was admitted with fevers, diarrhea, shock, acidosis, and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient is now improving and off pressors on minimal vent requirements.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Shock: The patient has distributive shock with sepsis and adrenal insufficiency. No definitive infectious source has been identified yet. The patient is being treated with hydrocortisone and intravenous fluids to maintain stable blood pressure. The plan is to continue Cefepime for 8 days and continue IV vancomycin until sputum is specified.

2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient remains mechanically ventilated with appropriate oxygenation and ventilation. The plan is to extubate the patient in the morning.

3. Panhypopituitarism: The patient is on hydrocortisone and Synthroid. An endocrine consult is planned.

4. Cardiac enzyme elevations: The patient has mildly elevated cardiac enzymes, which are suspected to be due to demand ischemia rather than an acute thrombotic event. The plan is to trend enzymes to ensure they resolve and prescribe aspirin and statin.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient has non-oliguric renal failure with no change in renal function over the last day"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and pituitary resection. He was admitted with fevers, diarrhea, shock, acidosis, and acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient is now improving off pressors on minimal vent requirements. Panhypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency appear to be significant contributing factors given the rapid improvement over the past day.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient likely experienced adrenal insufficiency with a component of distributive shock picture due to sepsis and hypovolemia from diarrhea. This complication has been addressed with appropriate management.
2. Panhypopituitarism: The patient has been started on hydrocortisone and synthroid. An endocrine consult recommended a steroid taper, and no growth hormone will be administered while the patient is inpatient.
3. Cardiac enzyme elevations: These elevations are suspected to be more from demand ischemia rather than an acute thrombotic event. Management includes ASA and statin therapy.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient is non-oliguric with no change in renal function over the last day. No hemodialysis is needed at this time. The patient's acid-base status should be followed, and efforts should be made to avoid nephrotoxins. Foley catheter should be discontinued.

- The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and pituitary resection.
- He was admitted with fevers, diarrhea, shock, acidosis, and progressing to acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
- The patient has been improving and is now off pressors and extubated.
- The assessment indicates that the patient likely had adrenal insufficiency with a component of distributive shock due to sepsis and hypovolemia from diarrhea.
- The patient's rapid improvement suggests a viral process leading to a panhypopituitary picture, which has now resolved.
- The patient's current conditions include shock, panhypopituitarism, cardiac enzyme elevations, hypertension, acute renal failure, and ethanol abuse.
- The plan includes continuing with cefepime antibiotics for 8 days, weaning steroids per endocrine consult, initiating hydrocortisone and synthroid, monitoring cardiac enzymes, titrating antihypertensives, managing acute renal failure, addressing ETOH abuse, and advancing diet as tolerated.
