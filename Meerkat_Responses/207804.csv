   Echo: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
   left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
   left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %). The right ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
   The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The number of aortic valve
   leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. Significant aortic stenosis is present (not
   quantified). Mild to moderate ([**11-29**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward the anterior
   mitral leaflet. There is no pericardial effusion.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe aortic stenosis, and tobacco abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for evaluation and management of heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress. The patient has been intubated and sedated, with a tracheostomy placed. Multiple tests have been conducted, including blood cultures, sputum culture, urine culture, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showing moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction, right ventricular dilatation, and aortic valve abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Biventricular heart failure - Severe aortic stenosis and known reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25% contribute to biventricular heart failure. The patient requires diuresis and dobutamine to improve hemodynamics.
2. Respiratory failure - The patient was intubated for respiratory distress. He will be kept on mechanical ventilation until tomorrow for assistance with diuresis. There is a concern for aspiration pneumonia and the need for antibiotics.
3. Liver failure/coagulopathy - Right-sided heart failure may lead to hepatic congestion and coagulopathy. The patient should be monitored for signs of liver dysfunction, and DIC labs should be sent.
4. Upper GI bleed - The patient has a positive guaiac test on"

   Echo: There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
   left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
   left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %). The right ventricular
   cavity is moderately dilated with depressed free wall contractility.
   The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The number of aortic valve
   leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. Significant aortic stenosis is present (not
   quantified). Mild to moderate ([**11-29**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward the anterior
   mitral leaflet. There is no pericardial effusion.

Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient was intubated earlier today at an outside hospital for respiratory distress. He will be kept on ventilatory support overnight and weaned in the morning. It is unclear what precipitated the need for intubation, but it could be hypoxia from pulmonary edema secondary to severe AS and heart failure, or aspiration, or flash pulmonary edema.
- The patient has severe biventricular heart failure most likely due to severe aortic stenosis. He will be started on low-dose dobutamine as an inotropic agent to improve his hemodynamics, and will receive IV lasix to diurese. He will need a repeat cardiac catheterization and cardiac surgery consultation for valve repair.

The patient was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management of heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Biventricular heart failure: The patient has severe aortic stenosis with a known bicuspid aortic valve, resulting in biventricular heart failure. He has been on Lasix PO as an outpatient, and his last ejection fraction (EF) was 25%, confirmed by bedside echo.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated earlier today at an outside hospital for respiratory distress. He will be kept on ventilator support until tomorrow for assistance with diuresis. The cause of intubation is unclear, but it may be due to hypoxia from pulmonary edema secondary to severe AS and heart failure, or aspiration event.

3. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is not currently on any medications for hyperlipidemia as an outpatient, and statins will be held due to liver failure.

4. Liver failure/coagulopathy: The patient likely has hepatic congestion from right-sided heart failure. Lab tests including DIC, hepatitis serologies, and HIV test will be sent when the patient is awake and able to consent for the procedure.

The patient was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management of his heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:
- Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate is 99 bpm, blood pressure is 108/83 mmHg, respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95% on ventilator support.
- Review of systems: The patient has unchanged symptoms from admission except for the presence of a loud aortic valve murmur and right-sided heart failure.
- Physical examination: The patient is intubated and sedated, with an inability to evaluate the head and neck. The cardiovascular examination reveals a loud aortic valve murmur and right-sided heart failure. The pulmonary examination shows diffuse crackles, and the abdominal examination is unremarkable. The extremities are warm, petechial rash, erythematous, and edematous.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and tobacco abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of his heart failure, AS, and acute respiratory distress.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need attention. These include:

1. Biventricular heart failure: This is likely secondary to severe AS and other factors such as mitral regurgitation (MR) and nutritional deficiencies. The patient is being diuresed with Lasix drip to achieve negative fluid balance, and labs are pending for scurvy and hematochromatosis. The patient is also receiving Vitamin C and MVi, Thiamine, and Folate supplementation.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient tolerates ventilation well and is ready for extubation based on settings and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). However, it will be waited until after an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and more diuresis. The patient is also on a ventilator bundle, including daily chest X-rays and serial arterial blood gases (ABGs).

3. Hypertension: Dobutamine weaning is planned, and the patient is being monitored for blood pressure control.

4. Hyperlipidemia: Statin therapy is being held due to liver failure.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and tobacco abuse. The patient was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of heart failure, AS, and acute respiratory distress. 

The patient's current conditions include biventricular heart failure, respiratory failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, liver failure/coagulopathy, upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, renal failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and alcohol withdrawal. 

The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. They have a central line, and their vital signs are relatively stable with a blood pressure of 108/83 mmHg, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and temperature of 37.7°C. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, along with decreased platelet count and albumin. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and there are indications of possible nutritional deficiencies (e.g., thiamine, folate). 

The patient has severe global hypokinesis and cavity dilation of the left ventricle, as well as severe aortic valve stenosis with a bicuspid aortic valve and dilated ascending aorta. 

The patient's plan includes diuresis with Lasix to improve outcomes, Vitamin C and MVi supplementation, and further evaluation for scurvy and hemochromatosis. They are also being monitored for potential complications such as VAP, upper GI bleed, and alcohol withdrawal."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with ongoing medical management. The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl for pain management, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, with a maximum recorded temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius. The patient's heart rate is within normal limits, ranging from 71 to 99 beats per minute. Blood pressure is slightly low, with readings as low as 94/65 mmHg. Respiratory rate is within the expected range for a mechanically ventilated patient, with spontaneous respiratory efforts not observed. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 94% through supplemental oxygen delivery.

The patient's fluid balance indicates a net negative balance of 2,583 mL since admission, with total intake being 1,557 mL and total output being 4,140 mL. This suggests ongoing fluid losses that need to be addressed.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 40%. The patient's respiratory system compliance is noted to be 80.9 cmH2O/mL.

Laboratory results show a slight elevation in white blood cell count, with"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and tobacco abuse. He was transferred from an outside hospital for further evaluation and management of heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress.

The patient has been diuresing well, but still requires ID approval for Vancomycin. He has upped slightly on PEEP and RR for AM ABG. There are no known drug allergies.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated. Physical examination reveals a loud systolic murmur at the upper sternal borders and apex, with an S2 only heard at the apex. The patient has clear lungs, soft abdomen, warm extremities, and a petechial rash with erythematous distal edema.

Laboratory results show elevated AST and ALT levels, as well as abnormal kidney and liver function tests. The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated, while platelet count is within normal range. Troponin levels are normal, but there is evidence of acute respiratory failure and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pump: Biventricular heart failure likely secondary to severe AS, malnutrition, and mitral regurgitation. Aggressive diuresis with Lasix drip is being administered.
2. Hypertension: Controlled without medical intervention.
3. Rhythm: Normal sinus"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and tobacco abuse. The patient was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Biventricular heart failure: The patient has severe AS, which can lead to biventricular heart failure due to the obstruction of blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which is a risk factor for ischemic complications.
3. Ischemia: The patient's risk factors for ischemia include hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Statin therapy has been held due to liver function abnormalities.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support, indicating respiratory failure. There is a concern for extubation readiness based on settings and respiratory system resistance index (RSBI), but hemoptysis needs to be evaluated first.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has an improving white blood cell count but continues to have low-grade fever, suggesting possible VAP. Vancomycin and Zosyn have been continued, and a bronchoscopy is pending.
6. Hemoptysis: The cause of hemoptysis is unclear, but it may be contributing to"

4. Respiratory failure, with the patient tolerating ventilation well but failing three respiratory system assessments (RSBI). Daily chest X-rays and serial arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis are planned.
5. Hemoptysis, with bronchoscopy showing the endotracheal tube as the likely culprit. Monitoring is ongoing.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), for which Zosyn has been continued, and blood cultures are pending. The patient's white blood cell count is improving, but they continue to have low-grade fever.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and tobacco abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of heart failure, AS, and acute respiratory distress. The patient has been receiving various medications including diuretics, antibiotics, sedatives, and nutritional supplements. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Biventricular heart failure: The patient likely has severe AS, which may have led to biventricular heart failure. This condition is further complicated by mitral regurgitation (MR) and nutritional deficiencies.
2. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension but does not require medical control at the moment.
3. Arrhythmia: The patient is experiencing occasional PVCs while maintaining normal sinus rhythm.
4. Ischemia: The patient is at risk for ischemic events due to hypertension and hyperlipidemia. However, statin therapy is temporarily held due to liver function abnormalities.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is tolerating ventilation well but has failed three respiratory system assessment and support initiation (RSBI) trials. Daily chest X-rays and serial arterial blood gases (ABGs) are planned. The patient's ABG shows alkalosis, which may be secondary to overdiuresis.

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a chief complaint of congestive heart failure and aortic stenosis. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management of his heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress.

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications. Firstly, the patient has biventricular heart failure which is likely secondary to severe AS (aortic stenosis) and other factors such as mitral regurgitation and nutritional deficiencies. The patient's hypertension has not required medical control. The patient also has an irregular heart rhythm with occasional PVCs (premature ventricular contractions).

Regarding pulmonary issues, the patient is experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has been tolerating ventilation well but failed three respiratory system assessment with breathing (RSBI) yesterday. This morning, the patient's RSBI is 112, but the patient has an elevated heart rate and blood pressure when stopping midazolam. The patient also had hemoptysis, which has since resolved, and a bronchoscopy showed the endotracheal tube as the likely culprit. 

In terms of infectious complications, the patient is suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is being continued on Zosyn and a bronchoscopy is pending. The patient continues to have low-grade temperature and a white blood cell count that is improving.

The patient previously experienced hepatic complications, including liver failure and coagulopathy, but these"

   Assessment and Plan
   48 M with HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS, and tobacco abuse who was
   transferred from an OSH for further evaluation and management of his
   heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress.
   # PUMP:
   1) Biventricular heart failure
 Multifactorial
 likely secondary to
   severe AS, also MR, nutritional deficiency.
   - hematochromatosis ruled out. Getting Vit C and MVi, Thiamine, Folate
   - No diuresis
   2) Hypertension
 has not required medical control
   # RHYTHM:
   - NSR with occasional PVCs
   # ISCHEMIA:
   Risk factors: HTN, HL
 BP well control, statin held for LFT
   abnormalities
   Will eventually need repeat Cath, CT scan, dental and valve
   replacement.
   # PULMONARY:
   1) Respiratory failure
   - Tolerating vent well, failed three RSBI yesterday.  RSBI 112 this AM,
   but patient has elevated HR and BP with stopping Midazolam.
   - daily CXRs, serial ABGs.  ABG with Alkalosis, likely sec to
   overdiuresis.
   2) Hemoptysis, resolved.
   - Bronch showed ET tube as likely culprit.
   - Monitor
   # INFECTIOUS:
   VAP
   - Continue Zosyn
   - BCx pending
   - WBC improving but continues to have low grade temp
   # HEPATIC: Resolved.  Liver failure/coagulopathy
   # GASTRIC
 Stable.  Had upper GI bleed on presentation Hct stable.
   UGI showed gastritic/duodenitis without active bleeding and no varices.
   - transfuse for > 10 point HCT drop
   - Protonix IV BID
   # RENAL
 Improved renal function, peak Cr 1.6, now 1.2. Thought to be
   secondary to poor forward flow.
   -          Monitoring [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -          No [**Last Name (LF) 2788**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] add free water to TF

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and tobacco abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress. 

During his stay in the ICU, the patient has been receiving various medications, including diamox, ativan, fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. He has also undergone several interventions, such as removal and replacement of oral gastric and arterial lines, and placement of a central line.

The patient's vital signs have been stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/57 to 80/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His weight has decreased from 83.2 kg on admission to 70.4 kg currently.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of potassium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes. His white blood cell count is within normal range, and his platelet count is slightly low. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with readings between 87 and 132 mg/dL. Other lab values, including electrolytes and cardiac enzymes, are within normal limits.

   24 Hour Events:
   Altered mental status (not Delirium)
   Assessment:
   Pt remains confused, lethargic, agitated. Speaking in slurred speech if
   at all and difficult to understand . Inconsistently answering questions
   and mostly not making sense.
   Action:
   Constantly attempting to reorient to place, time, person. Not aware of
   place or time nor person in spite of orientation attempts. Pt given
   haldol 2 mg IVP x 2 middle of nite for extreme persistant agitation
   since 1:30am.

   Response:
   Not much result as all from haldol dose. Pt continues to need constant
   supervision, rearranging and bilateral wrist restraints for safety.
   Frequent thrashing in bed, adding pillows and more cushioning to
   provide safety as well. Agitation level appears to be worsening over
   course of shift instead of clearing. Neuro exam unchanged,
   Plan:
   Continue to monitor ? psych consult if doesn

   - Versed, Fentanyl, Haldol and Ativan do not interact with each other
   but are all substrates of CYP450 3A4.  Chronic etoh use can lower
   CYP450 even without altering liver function.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe aortic stenosis, and tobacco abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress.

The patient remains confused, lethargic, and agitated, speaking in slurred speech. He has been given Haldol 2 mg IV for extreme agitation but has shown little improvement. The patient's mental status appears to be worsening, and he requires constant supervision with bilateral wrist restraints for safety. 

The patient's respiratory status is fair, and he is extubated after many days of intubation. He is on a 40% face tent and continues on diamox q6h with minimal urine output. The patient has tachypnea, periods of apnea, and rhonchi in his lung sounds. A chest X-ray revealed improving pulmonary edema and pneumonia. 

The patient has a low-grade temperature and is on antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia. He has been given Tylenol and a 250 mL NS bolus for hypovolemia. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/51 mmHg to 143/122 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 89%, and a sinus tachycard"

   transferred from an OSH for further evaluation and management of his
   heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress.
   # PUMP:
   1) Biventricular heart failure
 Multifactorial
 likely secondary to
   severe AS, also MR, nutritional deficiency.
   - hematochromatosis ruled out. Getting Vit C (level still pending) and
   MVi, Thiamine, Folate
   - No diuresis (no sign of hypervolemia, if anything dry since
   tachycardic and diuresed 12.3 L neg for LOS)

   Will eventually need repeat Cath, CT scan, dental and valve
   replacement.
   # PULMONARY:
   1) Respiratory failure
 unable to extubate yest due to
   over/undersedation. Plan due lower PEEP, recheck ABG and RSBi, then
   lower sedation with prn Haldol (QT ok) and extubate today.
   - Continue diamox to alkalize and stimulate resp
   2) Hemoptysis, resolved.
   - Bronch showed ET tube as likely culprit.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe aortic stenosis, and tobacco abuse. He was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management of heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress.

The patient has been experiencing several episodes of agitation throughout the day, which were controlled with Halolol IV. In the morning, he coughed up a large mucus plug, and his agitation has since resolved.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 98/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a face tent. He is intubated and sedated.

The patient's physical examination reveals a loud systolic murmur at the upper sternal borders and apex, with an S2 only heard at the apex. He also has a regular rapid heart rate (RRR) and a petechial rash that is resolving.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2, hematocrit of 47.9%, platelet count of 149,000/mm³, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, total CO2 of 40, glucose of 111 mg/dL, and an albumin level of 3.3 g/dL. Other"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe aortic stenosis, and tobacco abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress. The patient's condition has been improving gradually.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been improving, but still has low-grade fever and an elevated white blood cell count. Antibiotics have been discontinued on day 7, and a sputum culture is pending.
2. Biventricular heart failure: The patient likely has biventricular heart failure secondary to severe aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and nutritional deficiency. Diuretics have been withheld due to the patient's tachycardia and ongoing fluid losses.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated despite being on a beta-blocker. Statin therapy has been held due to liver function abnormalities.
4. Arrhythmia: The patient has been experiencing occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) while in normal sinus rhythm.
5. Ischemia: The patient is at risk for ischemia due to hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Repeat cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography will be needed, along with dental evaluation and valve replacement.
6. Pulmonary: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure but has since improved and"

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and tobacco abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/62 mmHg to 132/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and a sinus rhythm. The patient has lost weight since admission, weighing 70.4 kg initially and currently at 70 kg. 

The physical examination reveals a loud systolic murmur at the upper sternal borders and apex, rales in both lung bases, a petechial rash resolving, erythematous distal extremities with edema, and normal neurologic examination. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 238 K/uL, leukocyte count (WBC) at 9.6-11.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 13.4 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) at 196-238 K/uL. Liver function tests (LFTs"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe aortic stenosis, and tobacco abuse. He was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management of heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress.

The patient has shown improvement in his respiratory status, as he has been extubated and is now breathing without assistance. However, he still requires supplemental oxygen.

In terms of cardiac function, the patient has biventricular heart failure, which is likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. Nutritional deficiency, specifically vitamin C deficiency, has also been confirmed. The patient is receiving multivitamins, thiamine, folate, and vitamin C repletion.

The patient's hypertension is being managed with beta-blockers, but the use of ACE inhibitors has been held due to dependency on preload.

Agitation episodes have been observed in the patient, which have been resolved with haloperidol and zydis on an as-needed basis. These episodes may be related to benzodiazepine/fentanyl clearance in light of the patient's liver issues.

The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). However, he has risk factors for ischemia, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Statins have been held due to liver function test abnormalities.

The patient had pneumonia"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe aortic stenosis (AS), tobacco abuse, and acute respiratory distress. He was transferred from an outside hospital for further evaluation and management of heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including medications such as metoprolol, heparin, pantoprazole, insulin, folic acid, multivitamins, thiamine, and vitamin C. He has also been given senna for constipation and acetaminophen for pain relief.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 119/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His weight is currently 70.4 kg, and his height is 70 inches.

The patient's physical examination reveals a loud systolic murmur at the upper sternal borders and apex, clear to auscultation lungs bilaterally, and a rash resolving with edema and erythema distally. His neurological examination shows normal airway, breathing, and circulation.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), normal platelet count (Plt), and mildly elevated creatinine (Cr) levels. Other lab values such as potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), blood glucose (Glucose), liver function tests (ALT, AST), and coagulation profile (PT/INR) are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan:
1. The patient is diagnosed with biventricular heart failure, likely secondary to severe AS, MR, and nutritional deficiency (confirmed vitamin C deficiency).
- Continue multivitamins, thiamine, and folate supplementation.
- Administer vitamin C repletion (5 days) followed by maintenance repletion.
- Restart home peroral Lasix regimen.
- Monitor for improvement in symptoms and follow-up with echocardiography.

2. The patient is also diagnosed with hypertension and is currently on beta-blocker therapy.
- Hold ace inhibitor due to dependency on preload.
- Monitor blood pressure regularly and adjust medication as needed.

3. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).
- No specific interventions required at this time.

4. The patient's ischemia risk factors include hypertension and hyperlipidemia.
- Statin therapy should be restarted once liver function tests normalize.
- Consider repeat catheterization, CT scan, carotid ultrasound, and dental evaluation prior to valve replacement.
- If the patient is not a surgical candidate, consider valvuloplasty as a temporary solution.

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe aortic stenosis (AS), and tobacco abuse. He was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 109/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Physical examination reveals a loud systolic murmur at the upper sternal borders and apex, along with a regular rhythm. Other findings include sclera icteric, CTA B, soft abdomen with no hepatosplenomegaly, warm extremities with a resolving petechial rash, and edema distally. Neurological examination shows the patient is alert and oriented.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 28 mEq/L, potassium (K+) at 4.0 mEq/L, sodium (Na+) at 140 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) at 106 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3-) at 17 mg/dL, calcium (Ca++) at 8.6 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) at 1.6 mg/dL, phosphate (PO4) at 3.5 mg/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) at 9.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) at 14.1 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) at 50.2%, platelet count (Plt) at 196 K/uL, and liver function tests (LFTs) showing slight elevation.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of biventricular heart failure, hypertension, rhythm disturbances, ischemia, respiratory issues, agitation, infection, hepatic abnormalities, gastric problems, acute renal insufficiency, toxic effects of ethanol abuse, and nutritional deficiencies. The patient is also on cardiac diet and has undergone proton pump inhibitor therapy, low molecular weight heparin, and pneumoboots."

   Assessment and Plan
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. On admission, the patient's vital signs were stable, but he developed hypotension and required fluid resuscitation. The patient's current vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 109/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient is still receiving pantoprazole and heparin sodium as prophylaxis. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1480 mL since 12 AM, with 720 mL given through the intravenous route. The total output was 1381 mL, including 190 mL of urine output. The patient's weight is currently 70.4 kg, which is a decrease from the admission weight of 83.2 kg. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. His lungs are clear bilaterally, and his heart rhythm remains sinus rhythm. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 335 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 14.1 g/dL, elevated blood glucose level of 108 mg/dL, and slightly low sodium"

","The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe aortic stenosis, and tobacco abuse. He was transferred from another hospital for further evaluation and management of heart failure, aortic stenosis, and acute respiratory distress. 

The patient has been started on home doses of PO lasix, and his agitation has resolved without the need for zydis. 

Initial laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), indicating potential kidney dysfunction. There is also evidence of liver dysfunction, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and bilirubin levels. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate within normal range and blood pressure within acceptable limits. However, the patient's respiratory status is concerning, with bilateral pleural effusions, atelectasis, and multifocal consolidation seen on chest CT. 

Based on the assessment and plan, the patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. These include biventricular heart failure likely secondary to severe aortic stenosis, rhythm disturbances (NSR with occasional PVCs), ischemia risk factors (hypertension and hyperlipidemia), respiratory issues (extubated and weaning off oxygen), hepatic dysfunction, agitation resolved but previously present, no signs of active infection, resolved upper GI bleed, resolved acute renal insufficiency, resolved toxic etoh abuse, and cardiac diet"
