   Assessment and Plan
   63F with history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipids
   who presents on transfer with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia.
   .
   1. RLL consolidation with post-obstructive pneumonia: Appears that this
   has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months prior with recent
   bronchoscopy revealing foreign object.  Diffuse wheezing concerning for
   underlying reactive airway component.
   - Will likely need repeat rigid bronchoscopy here with possible
   intervention
 call IP this AM
   - Treat for likely post-obstructive PNA (Vanc Day 1 / Zosyn Day 6
   duration 14 days)
   - Wean steroids
   - Send sputum
   - SBT after bronch, likely extubate today, but concern for reactive
   airway, body habitus and met alkalosis
 consider NS bolus prior to
   extubation for alkalosis and clinically dry
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. ECG showed
   antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. Does not seem consistent
   with an acute plaque rupture but rather demand ischemia.
   - Continue with aspirin
   - Beta-blocker as tolerated by BP
   - Stop heparin in AM [**2-9**] (48 hours)
   - Home statin; has not tolerated atorvastatin in past and given that
   ACS is less likely, can defer max dose for now
   - Transfuse to >30 (29.9 this AM isOK)
 recheck [**Hospital1 **]
   - Repeat ECHO in AM
   - Serial ECGs
   - Consider cards consult for possible cardiac cath or future
   intervention
   3. Hyponatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to diuresis at OSH though pulmonary
   process is suggestive of SIADH. Urine lytes show FENa of 0.28% so
   prerenal hypovolemia likely.
   - NS bolus prior to extubation and recheck PM lytes
   .
   4. Metabolic alkalosis: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to diuresis; OG has not been
   in very long.
   - NS bolus this PM
   .
   5. Leukocytosis: Resolved by HOD 2. Could be sec to infection that is
   being treated currently.
   - Follow daily
   .
   6. Diabetes: HISS
   .
   7. Hyperlipidemia: Statin; tricor is not formulary and likely okay to
   hold for now
   .
   FEN: NPO for now, will advance after extubation
   PPX: Heparin gtt; PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presents with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia, likely requiring another rigid bronchoscopy with possible intervention. She also has evidence of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), for which she will continue with aspirin and a beta-blocker as tolerated, and heparin will be stopped in the morning. The patient's hyponatremia and metabolic alkalosis are secondary to diuresis. Leukocytosis has resolved but may be due to an ongoing infection being treated. The patient's diabetes and hyperlipidemia will be managed accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration and presence of a foreign object in the bronchus indicate a high risk of recurrent lung infections. Further intervention during bronchoscopy may be required to address this issue.
2. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient has evidence of an NSTEMI, which needs to be managed appropriately with medications such as aspirin and beta-blockers. Close monitoring and consideration for cardiac catheterization or future intervention may be necessary.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's low sodium levels are likely due to diuresis. Rechecking the electrolytes and considering a sodium bolus prior to extubation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an obese individual who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and chest pain. They have a history of allergies to certain medications and an arrhythmia. The patient has been receiving various infusions, including pain management and antibiotics. They continue to ooze blood around their right internal jugular (RIJ) dressing. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and normal blood pressure. Their respiratory rate is within the expected range, and their oxygen saturation is at 97%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing oozing of blood around the RIJ dressing could indicate an ongoing infection, which can potentially lead to sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: The anterior wheeze noted in the left upper lobes may suggest pneumonia, which can cause respiratory complications.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's right foot being cooler than the left and trace edema bilaterally could be signs of DVT, leading to potential complications such as pulmonary embolism.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels indicate a potential risk for AKI, which can occur due to decreased renal perfusion or other factors.
5. Delirium: The patient's ICU stay and use of sedatives like midazolam may contribute to"

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipids
   who presents on transfer with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonias.
   1. RLL consolidation with post-obstructive pneumonia: Appears that this
   has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months prior with recent
   bronchoscopy revealing foreign object.
   - Will likely need repeat bronchoscopy here with possible intervention
   - Treat for likely post-obstructive PNA
   - Wean steroids
   - Send sputum
   2. NSTEMI: Ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. ECG showed
   antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. Does not seem consistent
   with an acute plaque rupture but rather demand ischemia.
   - Continue with aspirin
   - Beta-blocker as tolerated by BP
   - Stop heparin in AM (48 hours)
   - Home statin; has not tolerated atorvastatin in past and given that
   ACS is less likely, can defer max dose for now
   - Transfuse to >30
   - Repeat ECHO in AM
   - Serial ECGs
   - Consider cards consult for possible cardiac cath
   3. Hyponatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to diuresis at OSH though pulmonary
   process is suggestive of SIADH.
   - Send urine lytes
   4. Metabolic alkalosis: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to diuresis; OG has not been
   in very long.
   - Will follow
   5. Leukocytosis: Steroids vs. infections
   - Follow daily
   6. Diabetes: HISS
   7. Hyperlipidemia: Statin; tricor is not formulary and likely okay to
   hold for now
   FEN: NPO for now
   PPX: Heparin ggt; PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipids.
- She presents with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonias and has had a recent bronchoscopy revealing a foreign object.
- She also has a diagnosis of NSTEMI, for which she is being treated with aspirin, beta-blocker, and heparin.
- Her vital signs show a slight elevation in heart rate, stable blood pressure, and normal oxygen saturation.
- The patient's labs indicate hyponatremia, metabolic alkalosis, leukocytosis, and elevated glucose levels.
- The physical examination reveals obesity, intubation, interactive behavior, distant heart sounds, wheezing in the left upper lobes, and left-sided abdominal tenderness with a small anterior hematoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia due to the presence of a foreign object in the bronchial tree.
2. Risk of further cardiac events or complications related to the NSTEMI, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
3. Development of respiratory complications due to mechanical ventilation and the presence of wheezing.
4. Risk of infection or sepsis due to the presence of leukocytosis and the ongoing use of invasive lines and devices.
5. Potential worsening of diabetes control due to the elevated glucose levels.
6. Possibility of electrolyte im"

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipids
   who presents on transfer with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia.
   1. RLL consolidation with post-obstructive pneumonia: Appears that this
   has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months prior with recent
   bronchoscopy revealing foreign object.
   - Will likely need repeat bronchoscopy here with possible intervention
   - Treat for likely post-obstructive PNA
   - Wean steroids
   - Send sputum
   2. NSTEMI: Ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. ECG showed
   antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. Does not seem consistent
   with an acute plaque rupture but rather demand ischemia.
   - Continue with aspirin
   - Beta-blocker as tolerated by BP
   - Stop heparin in AM (48 hours)
   - Home statin; has not tolerated atorvastatin in past and given that
   ACS is less likely, can defer max dose for now
   - Transfuse to >30
   - Repeat ECHO in AM
   - Serial ECGs
   - Consider cards consult for possible cardiac cath
   3. Hyponatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to diuresis at OSH though pulmonary
   process is suggestive of SIADH.
   - Send urine lytes
   4. Metabolic alkalosis: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to diuresis; OG has not been
   in very long.
   - Will follow
   5. Leukocytosis: Steroids vs. infections
   - Follow daily
   6. Diabetes: HISS
   7. Hyperlipidemia: Statin; tricor is not formulary and likely okay to
   hold for now
   FEN: NPO for now
   PPX: Heparin ggt; PPI

   1. RLL consolidation with post-obstructive pneumonia: Appears that this
   has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months prior with recent
   bronchoscopy revealing foreign object.  Diffuse wheezing concerning for
   underlying reactive airway component.  During course of overnight [**2-9**],
   patient had multiple episodes of SOB that are likely due to
   derecruitment, partial lung collapse and anxiety. IP performed flex
   bronch [**2-9**] with possible finding of aspergillus, but seems less likely
   due to short duration of steroids (~2-4 weeks), but CT findings of
   multiple small nodules are suggestive.
   - Start treatment for fungus with voriconazole
   - f/u bronch studies and sputum
   - Treat for likely post-obstructive PNA (Vanc Day 1 / Zosyn Day 6
   duration 14 days)
   - Will continue steroids at admission dose due to increased wheezing
   with drop in steroid dose on [**2-9**]
   - SBT after bronch, likely extubate today, but concern for reactive
   airway, body habitus and met alkalosis
 consider NS bolus prior to
   extubation for alkalosis and clinically dry
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. ECG showed
   antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. Does not seem consistent
   with an acute plaque rupture but rather demand ischemia.

 recheck [**Hospital1 **]
   - Repeat ECHO in AM
   - Serial ECGs
   - Consider cards consult for possible cardiac cath or future
   intervention
   3. Hyponatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to diuresis at OSH though pulmonary
   process is suggestive of SIADH. Urine lytes show FENa of 0.28% so
   prerenal hypovolemia likely.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia. She has been intubated and is currently in the ICU. The patient had multiple episodes of shortness of breath (SOB) overnight, which are likely due to derecruitment and partial lung collapse, as well as anxiety. There was a possible finding of aspergillus during a flexible bronchoscopy, but it seems less likely due to the short duration of steroid treatment. The patient's CT scan showed multiple small nodules, suggestive of a fungal infection. Treatment for fungus with voriconazole has been initiated, along with antibiotics for likely post-obstructive pneumonia.

The patient also has evidence of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), with a peak troponin I level of 2.69 and antero-lateral changes on ECG. Aspirin and a beta-blocker have been continued, and heparin will be stopped in the morning. A cardiac catheterization or future intervention may be considered after further evaluation.

The patient's sodium levels are low, possibly secondary to diuresis at OSH, although pulmonary process suggests SIADH. A NS bolus prior to extubation and recheck of PM lytes have been recommended.

The patient also has metabolic alkalosis, likely secondary to diuresis, and leukocyt"

The patient is a [**Last Name (Titles)**] with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient's medical history includes hypertension and previous cardiac events. The patient underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) which showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction >55%. There was also a mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis observed. No aortic stenosis or regurgitation was seen, and there was trivial mitral regurgitation. The patient's current medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, pantoprazole (Protonix), and morphine sulfate. The patient has allergies to ketorolac, nalbuphine, simvastatin, and atorvastatin. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/83 mmHg to 163/115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature within normal limits. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP and PPS modes. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 50 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 124, and oxygen ventilation (Ve) of 1.2 L/min. Physical examination"

","Summary:
The patient is a 35-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a medical history of hypertension. He presented with symptoms of chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. The patient underwent an echocardiogram that revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction >55%. There was also a possibility of focal wall motion abnormality due to suboptimal technical quality, along with mild dilation of the right ventricle and mild global free wall hypokinesis. No aortic stenosis or regurgitation was observed, and there was trivial mitral regurgitation. 

The patient required consultation from both the cardiology department and CT. They recommended an ischemia work-up, likely involving a catheterization procedure, once the patient's pulmonary issues resolve. The discrepancy between the images obtained here and at OSH prompted the suggestion to repeat the TTE when the patient is extubated. The possibility of discontinuing beta-blockers was considered if wheezing or respiratory distress occurs.

During the course of treatment, the patient experienced multiple episodes of shortness of breath, hypoxia, and chest tightness. These episodes were associated with turning, pain, hypertension, and anxiety. The patient was placed on BiPAP, nitroglycerin, and ativan for relief. A speech and swallow evaluation was ordered due to the patient's poor gag reflex.

The patient has allergies to ketorolac, causing diarrhea, and joint discomfort due to Crest"

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipids
   who presents on transfer with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia.
   .
   1. RLL consolidation with post-obstructive pneumonia: Appears that this
   has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months prior with recent
   bronchoscopy revealing foreign object.  Diffuse wheezing concerning for
   underlying reactive airway component.
   - Will likely need repeat rigid bronchoscopy here with possible
   intervention
 call IP this AM
   - Treat for likely post-obstructive PNA (Vanc Day 1 / Zosyn Day 6
   duration 14 days)
   - Wean steroids
   - Send sputum
   - SBT after bronch, likely extubate today, but concern for reactive
   airway, body habitus and met alkalosis
 consider NS bolus prior to
   extubation for alkalosis and clinically dry
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. ECG showed
   antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. Does not seem consistent
   with an acute plaque rupture but rather demand ischemia.
   - Continue with aspirin
   - Beta-blocker as tolerated by BP
   - Stop heparin in AM [**2-9**] (48 hours)
   - Home statin; has not tolerated atorvastatin in past and given that
   ACS is less likely, can defer max dose for now
   - Transfuse to >30 (29.9 this AM isOK)
 recheck [**Hospital1 **]
   - Repeat ECHO in AM
   - Serial ECGs
   - Consider cards consult for possible cardiac cath or future
   intervention
   3. Hyponatremia: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to diuresis at OSH though pulmonary
   process is suggestive of SIADH. Urine lytes show FENa of 0.28% so
   prerenal hypovolemia likely.
   - NS bolus prior to extubation and recheck PM lytes
   .
   4. Metabolic alkalosis: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to diuresis; OG has not been
   in very long.
   - NS bolus this PM
   .
   5. Leukocytosis: Resolved by HOD 2. Could be sec to infection that is
   being treated currently.
   - Follow daily
   .
   6. Diabetes: HISS
   .
   7. Hyperlipidemia: Statin; tricor is not formulary and likely okay to
   hold for now
   .
   FEN: NPO for now, will advance after extubation

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presents with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. The patient had a foreign object found in the right lower lobe during a recent bronchoscopy. She also has evidence of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), with troponin I levels peaking at 2.69. The ECG showed antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. The patient's sodium levels are low, which could be secondary to diuresis or a pulmonary process such as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Her metabolic alkalosis may also be due to diuresis or poor oral intake. The patient has leukocytosis, which has resolved, and she is being treated for an infection. She also has diabetes and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Right lower lobe consolidation with post-obstructive pneumonia: The patient may require a repeat rigid bronchoscopy with possible intervention to address the recurrent issue of post-obstructive pneumonia.

2. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's NSTEMI should be managed with aspirin, beta-blocker as tolerated by blood pressure, stopping heparin in the morning, and considering a cardiac catheterization or future intervention.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipids. She presents with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia, and her recent bronchoscopy revealed a foreign object. She also has mild symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction >55% and mildly dilated right ventricle with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The patient experienced multiple episodes of shortness of breath overnight, likely due to derecruitment and anxiety. She was found to have possible findings of aspergillus, but this is less likely given the short duration of steroid use. CT findings suggest multiple small nodules, which are suggestive of a fungal infection. Treatment for fungus with voriconazole has been started, and follow-up bronchoscopic studies and sputum analysis will be performed. The patient is also being treated for likely post-obstructive pneumonia with vancomycin on day 1 and zosyn on day 7 for a duration of 14 days. The patient's steroid dose will be increased due to increased wheezing with the drop in steroid dose. She is experiencing episodes of dyspnea and anxiety, so anxiolytics and nebs will be continued for dyspnea exacerbations. The patient needs a speech and swallow evaluation for possible aspiration precautions. The patient's NSTEMI has been ruled-in with peak troponin I of 2.69, but ECG changes"

   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo female with obesity and following reported aspiration of foreign
   body has not evolved a patter of recurrent and acute evolution of
   hypoxia--this is associated with wheezing--monophonic and very
   responsive to NIV.  This may well represent a combination of proximal
   airway compromise--with perhaps some malacia and some upper airway
   compromise.  This in combination with a component of reactive airways
   disease may represent acute trigger.  The role of dynamic changes in
   LVEDP was entertained but response has been minimal to interventions,
   ECG without change and CK's wnl.
   !)Respiratory Failure
Will need to maintain maximal treatment for
   reactive airways disease and recruitment of collapsed lung units.
   Doubt active ischemia is playing a role but will continue ECG
   monitoring.
   -Will continue with BIPAP 10/5 for intermittent support-This for lung
   recruitment and decreased work of breathing
   -Will continue vanco/zosyn
   -Will need to maintain low threshold for initiation of anti-fungal and
   will maintain close follow up of cultures
   -Will return to 40mg Solumedrol q 8 hours
both for bronchospasm and
   laryngeal edema which may be playing a role
   -Will continue with Atrovent/Albuterol
   -Will maintain NPO and pursue speech and swallow eval prior to return
   to full po
   -Ativan PRN for anxiety
   2)Foreign Body-
   -Some diffuse airway edema seen throughout on bronch
   -When patient stable will continue to pursue CT for airway examination
   going forward when stable
   -Will need time for resolution of post obstructive pneumonia
   -Will Rx with anti-fungals for positive findings on bronch
   3)Cardiac Ischemia-
   -Follow up ECHO when stable
   -Daily ECG has been reassuring
with only subtle T-wave changes and no
   evidence of transmural injury
   -Will avoid B-blocker if recurrent bronchospasm seen following
   administration
   -Heparin completed and retain high threshold for use given significant
   bleeding from right neck
   -Will continue ASA
   -Wean TNG to off and maintain BP control with po meds as possible
will
   return to ACE-I
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date.

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with obesity who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. She had a reported aspiration of a foreign body, which has not shown a pattern of recurrent and acute evolution of hypoxia. The patient's condition is associated with wheezing and is responsive to non-invasive ventilation (NIV). The assessment suggests that the patient may have a combination of proximal airway compromise, possibly with some malacia, and upper airway compromise, along with reactive airways disease, which may represent an acute trigger.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 151/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently receiving NIV with a ventilator mode of standby, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PS) of 5 cmH2O, respiratory rate (RR) of 15 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, plateau pressure of 22 cmH2O, and a SpO2 of 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 14.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of"

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipids
   who presents on transfer with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia.
   .
   1. RLL consolidation with post-obstructive pneumonia: Appears that this
   has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months prior with recent
   bronchoscopy revealing foreign object.  Diffuse wheezing concerning for
   underlying reactive airway component.  During course of overnight [**2-9**],
   patient had multiple episodes of SOB that are likely due to
   derecruitment, partial lung collapse and anxiety. IP performed flex
   bronch [**2-9**] with possible finding of aspergillus, but seems less likely
   due to short duration of steroids (~2-4 weeks), but CT findings of
   multiple small nodules are suggestive.
   - Start treatment for fungus with voriconazole
   - f/u bronch studies and sputum
   - Treat for likely post-obstructive PNA (Vanc Day 1 / Zosyn Day 7
   duration 14 days)
   - Will increase steroids to admission dose due to increased wheezing
   with drop in steroid dose on [**2-9**]
   - Cont anxiolytics and nebs for dyspnea exascerbations
   - Needs speech and swallow eval for possible aspiration precautions
   - Cont IS
   - D/c nitro gtt as not likely flash pulm edema or related to cardiac
   issues
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. ECG showed
   antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. Does not seem consistent
   with an acute plaque rupture but rather demand ischemia. Had chest
   pressure during acute dyspneic episode on [**2-9**], EKG unchanged, CXR
   unchanged. TTE showed mild changes, but nothing suggesting acute
   ischemia. Will likely need outpatient imaging vs. cath.
   - Continue with aspirin
   - D/c the Beta-blocker per Cards recs as patient having wheezing
   - Home statin; has not tolerated atorvastatin in past and given that
   ACS is less likely, can defer max dose for now
   - Transfuse to >30
 stable
 recheck qday
   - Serial ECGs and will cycle CE if worsens
   - F/u Cards and CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   3. Hyponatremia: Resolving. Urine lytes show FENa of 0.28% so prerenal
   hypovolemia likely.
   - Trend Na
   .
   4. Metabolic alkalosis: Stable. [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to diuresis; OG has
   not been in very long.
   - Trend lytes
   .
   5. Leukocytosis: Resolved by HOD 2. Could be sec to infection that is
   being treated currently.
   - Follow daily
   .
   6. Diabetes: HISS
   .
   7. Hyperlipidemia: Statin; tricor is not formulary and likely okay to
   hold for now

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presents with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia and has been admitted to the ICU.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. RLL consolidation with post-obstructive pneumonia: The patient has a history of recurrent pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. There is an ongoing treatment for suspected fungal infection, which may be related to the underlying reactive airway component. Further bronchoscopic evaluation and sputum analysis are planned.

2. NSTEMI: The patient has been ruled-in for NSTEMI with peak troponin I levels of 2.69. Although the ECG showed antero-lateral changes, no ST-elevations were observed. The patient experienced chest pressure during an acute dyspneic episode, but the EKG and chest X-ray remained unchanged. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed mild changes but no evidence of acute ischemia. It is recommended to continue with aspirin, discontinue the beta-blocker due to wheezing, and consider outpatient imaging versus coronary catheterization.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is resolving, and the urine electrolytes show a fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) of 0.28%, indicating prerenal hypovolem"

 CTA chest prelim read: No central, segmental or large
   subsegmental PE. The distal subsegmental vessels are not well
   opacified. Apparent filling defects in the subsegmental distribution
   which in correlation with the MIPS appear to be mixing and/or partial
   volume from underlying pulmonary pathology. Bilateral apical and
   perihilar ground glass opacities, D/D includes pulmonary edema,
   atypical infections, in certain clinical setting pulmonary hemorrhage.
   RLL opacity, part of which may be compressive atelectasis from the
   associated right sided effusion, however a concomitant RLL pneumonia
   remains in the differential. There are B/L pleural effusions, R>L.
   Small air in periportal region, outside portal vein, could be bilary
   tree air? ERCP, GI procedures.
   Assessment and Plan
   63F with history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension and
   hyperlipidemia who presents on transfer with recurrent post-obstructive
   pneumonia.
   .
   1. Hypoxia / Dyspnea / RLL consolidation with post-obstructive
   pneumonia: Dyspnea has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months
   prior with recent bronchoscopy revealing foreign object.  Diffuse
   wheezing concerning for underlying reactive airway component.  IP
   performed flex bronch [**2-9**] with possible finding of aspergillus, but
   seems less likely due to short duration of steroids (~2-4 weeks).
   Intubated on [**2-10**] due to hypoxia and fatigue.  CTA on [**2-10**] showed no
   evidence of PE.  Dense consolidation in RLL likely post-obstructive
   PNA.  However, R and L upper lobes both with diffuse ground glass
   opacities which could represent infection vs. inflammation.  Will cont.
   broad spectrum abx for HAP.  Will uptitrate steroids to treat for
   organizing pneumonitis in upper lobes.
   - Vanc (D1 [**2-10**]) & zosyn (D1 [**2-4**]) for post-obstructive PNA for 2 week
   course of each
   - Voriconazole (D1 [**2-10**]) for possible aspergillosis
   - Bactrim (D1 [**2-10**]) for PJP prophylaxis
   - Increase steroids to methylpred 80 mg IV Q8H for organizing
   pneumonitis (D1 = [**2-11**]) for 1 week course then slow taper
   - f/u bronch studies and sputum
   - Cont anxiolytics and nebs for dyspnea
   - Needs speech and swallow eval when extubated and taking POs

   2. NSTEMI: Ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. ECG showed
   antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. Does not seem consistent
   with an acute plaque rupture but rather demand ischemia. Had chest
   pressure during acute dyspneic episode on [**2-9**], EKG unchanged, CXR
   unchanged. TTE showed mild changes, but nothing suggesting acute
   ischemia, however, image quality poor. Will likely need repeat TTE and
   outpatient imaging vs. cath.
   - Continue with aspirin
   - D/c the Beta-blocker per Cards recs as patient having wheezing

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with respiratory failure due to diffuse ground glass opacities in the upper lobes. The patient has been unresponsive to antibiotic, steroid, and antifungal therapies. The possible causes for the persistent respiratory failure include atypical infection with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), sarcoidosis, or organizing pneumonia. The patient's pneumonia has been treated with Zosyn/Vanco antibiotics, and prophylaxis with Bactrim is being continued. The airways obstruction may be caused by a blocked right lower lobe bronchus, which needs to be addressed to maintain sputum clearance and aeration. The patient's myocardial infarction has been treated, and she requires pain control, fever management, and anxiety treatment. The ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is the primary concern. If left untreated, it can lead to further deterioration of lung function, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and ultimately cardiac arrest.
2. Pneumonia: If the pneumonia is not effectively treated, it can progress, leading to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Airway Obstruction: If the blocked right lower l"

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension and
   hyperlipidemia who presents on transfer with recurrent post-obstructive
   pneumonia.
   .
   1. Hypoxia / Dyspnea / RLL consolidation with post-obstructive
   pneumonia: Dyspnea has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months
   prior with recent bronchoscopy revealing foreign object.  Diffuse
   wheezing concerning for underlying reactive airway component.  IP
   performed flex bronch [**2-9**] with possible finding of aspergillus, but
   seems less likely due to short duration of steroids (~2-4 weeks).
   Intubated on [**2-10**] due to hypoxia and fatigue.  CTA on [**2-10**] showed no
   evidence of PE.  Dense consolidation in RLL likely post-obstructive
   PNA.  However, R and L upper lobes both with diffuse ground glass
   opacities which could represent infection vs. inflammation.  Will cont.
   broad spectrum abx for HAP.  Will uptitrate steroids to treat for
   organizing pneumonitis in upper lobes.
   - Vanc (D1 [**2-10**]) & zosyn (D1 [**2-4**]) for post-obstructive PNA for 2 week
   course of each
   - Voriconazole (D1 [**2-10**]) for possible aspergillosis
   - Bactrim (D1 [**2-10**]) for PJP prophylaxis
   - Increase steroids to methylpred 80 mg IV Q8H for organizing
   pneumonitis (D1 = [**2-11**]) for 1 week course then slow taper
   - f/u bronch studies and sputum
   - Cont anxiolytics and nebs for dyspnea
   - Needs speech and swallow eval when extubated and taking POs
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. ECG showed
   antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. Does not seem consistent
   with an acute plaque rupture but rather demand ischemia. Had chest
   pressure during acute dyspneic episode on [**2-9**], EKG unchanged, CXR
   unchanged. TTE showed mild changes, but nothing suggesting acute
   ischemia, however, image quality poor. Will likely need repeat TTE and
   outpatient imaging vs. cath.
   - Continue with aspirin
   - D/c the Beta-blocker per Cards recs as patient having wheezing
   - Home statin; has not tolerated atorvastatin in past and given that
   ACS is less likely, can defer max dose for now
   - Transfuse to >30
 stable
   - Serial ECGs and will cycle CE if worsens
   - Repeat TTE when extubated.
   - F/u Cards and CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   .
   3. Hypertension: On max dose of Ramipril at home.  Has been
   hypertensive here.
   - increase enalapril dose & cont. to monitor.
   .
   4. Hyperlipidemia: pravastatin; tricor is not formulary and likely okay
   to hold for now
   .
   5. Diabetes: RISS
   .
   6. Hyponatremia: Resolved. Urine lytes show FENa of 0.28% so prerenal
   hypovolemia likely.
   - Trend Na
   .
   7. Metabolic alkalosis: Stable.
   - Trend lytes
   .
   8. Leukocytosis: Resolved by HOD 2. Could be sec to infection that is
   being treated currently.
   - Follow daily
   .
   .
   FEN: Start tube feeds, replete lytes prn, S/S eval when extubated and
   ready to start POs
   PPX: HSC; PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presents with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia and is currently intubated due to hypoxia and fatigue. The patient has dense consolidation in the right lower lobe, which is likely post-obstructive pneumonia. There are also diffuse ground-glass opacities in both upper lobes, which could represent infection or inflammation. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, steroids, and antifungal medication. She also has a history of NSTEMI and requires further cardiac evaluation. Other medical issues include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hyponatremia, metabolic alkalosis, and leukocytosis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, pneumonia, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac complications, kidney dysfunction, and electrolyte imbalances."

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension and
   hyperlipidemia who presents on transfer with recurrent post-obstructive
   pneumonia.
   .
   1. Hypoxia / Dyspnea / RLL consolidation with post-obstructive
   pneumonia: Dyspnea has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months
   prior with recent bronchoscopy revealing foreign object.  Diffuse
   wheezing concerning for underlying reactive airway component.  IP
   performed flex bronch [**2-9**] with possible finding of aspergillus, but
   seems less likely due to short duration of steroids (~2-4 weeks).
   Intubated on [**2-10**] due to hypoxia and fatigue.  CTA on [**2-10**] showed no
   evidence of PE.  Dense consolidation in RLL likely post-obstructive
   PNA.  However, R and L upper lobes both with diffuse ground glass
   opacities which could represent infection vs. inflammation.  Will cont.
   broad spectrum abx for HAP.  Will uptitrate steroids to treat for
   organizing pneumonitis in upper lobes.  Bronchoscopy specimen suggests
   that sarcoid is not contributing and again no evidence for
   aspergillosis.  Results also consistent with pneumonitis
   - Vanc (D1 [**2-10**]) & zosyn (D1 [**2-4**]) for post-obstructive PNA for 2 week
   course of each
   - Voriconazole (D1 [**2-10**]) for possible aspergillosis stopped [**2-10**]
   - Bactrim (D1 [**2-10**]) for PJP prophylaxis
   - Increase steroids to methylpred 80 mg IV Q8H for organizing
   pneumonitis (D1 = [**2-11**]) for 1 week course then slow taper
   - Cont anxiolytics and nebs for dyspnea
   - Needs speech and swallow eval when extubated and taking POs
   - Will ask IP to perform thoracentesis to r/u empyema given larger
   pleural effusion on R on CXR & persistent PNA
   - Increase PEEP to 10 to open up atelectatic airspaces
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. ECG showed
   antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. Does not seem consistent
   with an acute plaque rupture but rather demand ischemia. Had chest
   pressure during acute dyspneic episode on [**2-9**], EKG unchanged, CXR
   unchanged. TTE showed mild changes, but nothing suggesting acute
   ischemia, however, image quality poor. Will likely need repeat TTE and
   outpatient imaging vs. cath.
   - Continue with aspirin
   - D/c the Beta-blocker per Cards recs as patient having wheezing
   - Home statin; has not tolerated atorvastatin in past and given that
   ACS is less likely, can defer max dose for now
   - Transfuse to >30
 stable
   - Serial ECGs and will cycle CE if worsens
   - Repeat TTE when extubated.
   - F/u Cards and CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   .
   3. Hypertension: On max dose of Ramipril at home.  Has been
   hypertensive here.
   - increase enalapril dose again & cont. to monitor.
   - d/c spironolactone
   .
   4. Hyperlipidemia: pravastatin; tricor is not formulary and likely okay
   to hold for now
   .
   5. Diabetes: [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] titrate up sliding scale as pt. has been
   hyperglycemic, likely because of steroids.  Will need to further
   increase when TF are started.  Will likely need some standing
   long-acting insulin
   .
   6. Hyponatremia: Resolved. Urine lytes show FENa of 0.28% so prerenal
   hypovolemia likely.
   - Trend Na
   .
   7. Metabolic alkalosis: Worse today.
   - Diamox 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 doses
   - d/c spironolactone
   .
   8. Leukocytosis: Resolved by HOD 2. Could be sec to infection that is
   being treated currently.
   - Follow daily
   .
   9. Anxiety:
   - cont. to reassure patient
   - midazolam boluses prn
   .
   FEN: Start tube feeds, replete lytes prn, S/S eval when extubated and
   ready to start POs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is persistent right lower lobe (RLL) obstruction. The note also mentions several other medical conditions and interventions. 

1. Hypoxia / Dyspnea / RLL consolidation with post-obstructive pneumonia: The patient has a history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia, which was initially thought to be due to aspiration of a foreign object. A bronchoscopy revealed a possible finding of aspergillus, but this seems less likely given the short duration of steroid use. The patient was intubated on [**2-10**] due to hypoxia and fatigue, and a CT angiography showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. There is dense consolidation in the RLL, likely post-obstructive PNA, along with diffuse ground-glass opacities in both upper lobes, which could represent infection or inflammation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and steroids have been uptitrated to treat organizing pneumonitis in the upper lobes.

2. NSTEMI: The patient was ruled in for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) at OSH with a peak troponin I level of 2.69. The ECG showed anterolateral changes but no ST-elevations. This does not seem consistent with acute"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with initial presentation with aspiration of FB and
   suggestion of post obstructive pneumonia now with progression to
   recurrent hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Respiratory Failure--Hypoxemic and associated wtih diffuse ground glass
   opacities
certainly pulmonary edema is possible but response to
   interventions as only transient and progression to some areas of
   consolidation argues that it is not simply pulmonary edema and move to
   diuresis in the setting of alkalosis is difficult.  Will need to
   evaluate pleural space fluid further.
   -Thoracentesis today to evaluate nature of fluid in right chest with
   cell count
   -Will move to diuresis today in the setting of pulmonary edema
   suggested and will need to stabilize metabolic acidosis at this
   time
move to diamox for 24 hours
   -Continue with Solumedrol 80mg tid
   -Continue with Bactrim prophylaxis
   -Continue with antibacterials
   -Will move to PSV support with 12/10
   -Will check urine histo today
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She presented initially with aspiration of foreign body and suggestion of post-obstructive pneumonia, which has now progressed to recurrent hypoxemic respiratory failure. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 160/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 28 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 23 cmH2O. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 50%.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.8 K/uL, and slightly decreased platelet count (Plt) of 278 K/uL. Blood chemistry shows normal electrolyte levels, but elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 41 mg/dL and creatinine (Cr) of 1.4 mg/dL. Other lab results, including liver enzymes, cardiac enzymes, and kidney function tests, are within normal range.

Imaging studies reveal diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities and fibroblasts seen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, acute myocardial infarction, chest pain, respiratory failure, acute anxiety, and chronic pain. The patient presented to the ICU with complaints of diabetes mellitus, acute myocardial infarction, chest pain, respiratory failure, anxiety, and fever. The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

24-hour events include administration of Diamox, ordering urine histoplasma antigen, ordering glargine 10 units at bedtime, increasing RISS, performing thoracentesis which showed transudate, and administering Lasix 40 mg IV with good diuresis. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 100/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,911 mL, output of 1,885 mL, and a positive balance of 26 mL. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, glucose level of 257 mg/dL, sodium level of 135 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal range. 

The patient's physical examination reveals scattered wheezing throughout the lungs, regular heart sounds with no apparent murmurs, and trace bilateral edema. 

Assessment and plan include diabetes mellitus type II, acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, anxiety, and pain control. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition through a pulmonary formula, glycemic control, arterial and peripheral IV lines for medication administration, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and prolonged intubation increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and central venous catheter placement increase the risk of DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical illness and sedation may increase the risk of stress ulcers.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes and insulin therapy may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
6. Arrhythmias: The patient's acute myocardial infarction increases the risk of arrhythmias.
7. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive"

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension and
   hyperlipidemia who presents on transfer with recurrent post-obstructive
   pneumonia.
   .
   1. Hypoxia / Dyspnea / RLL consolidation with post-obstructive
   pneumonia: Dyspnea has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months
   prior with recent bronchoscopy revealing foreign object.  Diffuse
   wheezing concerning for underlying reactive airway component.  IP
   performed flex bronch [**2-9**] with possible finding of aspergillus, but
   seems less likely due to short duration of steroids (~2-4 weeks).
   Intubated on [**2-10**] due to hypoxia and fatigue.  CTA on [**2-10**] showed no
   evidence of PE.  Dense consolidation in RLL likely post-obstructive
   PNA.  However, R and L upper lobes both with diffuse ground glass
   opacities which could represent infection vs. inflammation.  Will cont.
   broad spectrum abx for HAP.  Will uptitrate steroids to treat for
   organizing pneumonitis in upper lobes.  Bronchoscopy specimen suggests
   that sarcoid is not contributing and again no evidence for
   aspergillosis.  Results also consistent with pneumonitis (BOOP/COP).
   Thoracentesis [**2-12**] c/w transudate.
   - Lasix 40 x1 given with good diuresis and stable met alkalosis with
   Diamox
 consider additional diuresis if resp status improves
   - Vanc (D1 [**2-10**]) & zosyn (D1 [**2-4**]) for post-obstructive PNA for 2 week
   course of each
   - Bactrim (D1 [**2-10**]) for PJP prophylaxis
   - Continue steroids -  methylpred 80 mg IV Q8H for organizing
   pneumonitis (D1 = [**2-11**]) for 1 week course then slow taper
   - Cont anxiolytics and nebs for dyspnea
   - Needs speech and swallow eval when extubated and taking POs
   - Increase PEEP to 10 to open up atelectatic airspaces
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. ECG showed
   antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. Does not seem consistent
   with an acute plaque rupture but rather demand ischemia. Had chest
   pressure during acute dyspneic episode on [**2-9**], EKG unchanged, CXR
   unchanged. TTE showed mild changes, but nothing suggesting acute
   ischemia, however, image quality poor. Will likely need repeat TTE and
   outpatient imaging vs. cath.
   - Continue with aspirin
   - D/c the Beta-blocker per Cards recs as patient having wheezing
   - Home statin; has not tolerated atorvastatin in past and given that
   ACS is less likely, can defer max dose for now
   - Transfuse to ~30
 stable
   - Repeat TTE when extubated.
   - F/u Cards and CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   .
   3. Hypertension: On max dose of Ramipril at home.  Has been
   hypertensive here.
   - increase enalapril dose again & cont. to monitor.
   .
   4. Hyperlipidemia: pravastatin; tricor is not formulary and likely okay
   to hold for now
   .
   5. Diabetes: [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] titrate up sliding scale as pt. has been
   hyperglycemic, likely because of steroids.  Will need to further
   increase when TF are started.  Will likely need some standing
   long-acting insulin
   .
   6. Hyponatremia: Resolved. Urine lytes show FENa of 0.28% so prerenal
   hypovolemia likely.
   - Trend Na
   .
   7. Metabolic alkalosis: stable.  Diamox 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 doses with good
   result.
   - Consider additional doses if resp condition improves with Lasix
   .
   8. Leukocytosis: Resolved by HOD 2. Could be sec to infection that is
   being treated currently.
   - Follow daily
   .
   9. Anxiety:
   - cont. to reassure patient
   - midazolam boluses prn
   .
   FEN: TF started [**2-12**], replete lytes prn, S/S eval when extubated and
   ready to start Pos, cont to tighten ISS

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia and was intubated on [**2-10**] due to hypoxia and fatigue. A CT scan showed dense consolidation in the right lower lobe likely post-obstructive pneumonia, but also diffuse ground glass opacities in both upper lobes which could represent infection or inflammation. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which suggested that sarcoid is not contributing and there is no evidence for aspergillosis. The results are consistent with organizing pneumonitis (BOOP/COP). A thoracentesis on [**2-12**] showed transudate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Dyspnea/RLL consolidation with post-obstructive pneumonia: The patient's recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia and dense consolidation in the right lower lobe may lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening hypoxia.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has been ruled in for NSTEMI with peak troponin I of 2.69. There is a risk of further cardiac ischemia or complications such as myocardial infarction.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as heart failure or stroke.

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension and
   hyperlipidemia who presents on transfer with recurrent post-obstructive
   pneumonia.
   .
   1. Hypoxia / Dyspnea / RLL consolidation with post-obstructive
   pneumonia: Dyspnea has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months
   prior with recent bronchoscopy revealing foreign object.  Diffuse
   wheezing concerning for underlying reactive airway component.  IP
   performed flex bronch [**2-9**] with possible finding of aspergillus, but
   seems less likely due to short duration of steroids (~2-4 weeks).
   Intubated on [**2-10**] due to hypoxia and fatigue.  CTA on [**2-10**] showed no
   evidence of PE.  Dense consolidation in RLL likely post-obstructive
   PNA.  However, R and L upper lobes both with diffuse ground glass
   opacities which could represent infection vs. inflammation.  Will cont.
   broad spectrum abx for HAP.  Will uptitrate steroids to treat for
   organizing pneumonitis in upper lobes.  Bronchoscopy specimen suggests
   that sarcoid is not contributing and again no evidence for
   aspergillosis.  Results also consistent with pneumonitis (BOOP/COP).
   Thoracentesis [**2-12**] c/w transudate.
   - Lasix 40 x1 given with good diuresis and stable met alkalosis with
   Diamox
 consider additional diuresis if resp status improves
   - Vanc day 4 (D1 [**2-10**]) & zosyn day10 (D1 [**2-4**]) for post-obstructive PNA
   for 2 week course of each
   - Bactrim day 4 (D1 [**2-10**]) for PJP prophylaxis
   - Continue steroids -  methylpred 80 mg IV Q8H for organizing
   pneumonitis
 day 3 (D1 = [**2-11**]) for 1 week course then slow taper
   - Cont anxiolytics and nebs for dyspnea
 d/c
d Cymbalta ER (can
t put
   it down NGT) changed to Paxil 30mg qday
   - Needs speech and swallow eval when extubated and taking POs
   - Will decrease PS/PEEP to attempt to wean to extubation
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. ECG showed
   antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. Does not seem consistent
   with an acute plaque rupture but rather demand ischemia. Had chest
   pressure during acute dyspneic episode on [**2-9**], EKG unchanged, CXR
   unchanged. TTE showed mild changes, but nothing suggesting acute
   ischemia, however, image quality poor. Will likely need repeat TTE and
   outpatient imaging vs. cath.
   - Continue with aspirin
   - D/c the Beta-blocker per Cards recs as patient having wheezing
   - Home statin; has not tolerated atorvastatin in past and given that
   ACS is less likely, can defer max dose for now
   - Transfuse to ~30
 stable
   - Repeat TTE when extubated.
   - F/u Cards and CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   .
   3. Hypertension: On max dose of Ramipril at home.  Has been
   hypertensive here.
   - increase enalapril dose again & cont. to monitor.
   .
   4. Hyperlipidemia: pravastatin; tricor is not formulary and likely okay
   to hold for now
   .
   5. Diabetes: [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] titrate up sliding scale as pt. has been
   hyperglycemic, likely because of steroids.  Will need to further
   increase when TF are started.  Will likely need some standing
   long-acting insulin
   .
   6. Hyponatremia: Resolved. Urine lytes show FENa of 0.28% so prerenal
   hypovolemia likely.
   - Trend Na
   .
   7. Metabolic alkalosis: stable.  Diamox 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 doses with good
   result.
   - Lasix gtt started today to attempt to remove another 500cc by this
   evening
   .
   8. Leukocytosis: Resolved by HOD 2. Could be sec to infection that is
   being treated currently.
   - Follow daily

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient presents with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia and was intubated on [**2-10**] due to hypoxia and fatigue. The assessment reveals several medical complications:

1. Hypoxia/Dyspnea/RLL consolidation with post-obstructive pneumonia: The patient has had recurrent dyspnea since an aspiration episode three months prior. Bronchoscopy revealed a foreign object, and dense consolidation in the right lower lobe is likely post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient also has diffuse ground glass opacities in both upper lobes, which could represent infection or inflammation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and steroids have been uptitrated to treat organizing pneumonitis in the upper lobes.

2. NSTEMI: The patient was ruled-in for an acute coronary syndrome at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. The ECG showed antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. The patient experienced chest pressure during an acute dyspneic episode on [**2-9**], but the EKG and chest X-ray were unchanged. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed mild changes, but nothing suggesting acute ischemia. It is recommended to perform another TTE and outpatient imaging or consider cardiac"

A bronchoscopy specimen suggests that sarcoid is not contributing and there is no evidence for aspergillosis. Thoracentesis on 2/12 showed transudate, and Lasix was given with good diuresis. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 99% on 50% FiO2.

The patient also has a history of NSTEMI, which was ruled in at OSH with a peak troponin I of 2.69. An ECG showed antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. The patient had chest pressure during an acute dyspneic episode on 2/9, but the EKG and CXR remained unchanged. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed mild changes, but nothing suggesting acute"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old female admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient has persistent hypoxemia and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. The initial insult was aspiration of a foreign body, but now the patient is presenting with post-obstructive pneumonia, organizing pneumonitis, and/or pulmonary edema.

The patient has been weaned off PSV support with good stability of ventilation and oxygenation. However, there are multiple issues contributing to the respiratory failure, including pneumonia, possible organizing pneumonitis, reactive airways disease/COPD, and pulmonary edema.

The plan includes treating likely pneumonia with Vancomycin/Zosyn, providing Bactrim prophylaxis, methylprednisolone for possible organizing pneumonitis, bronchodilator therapy for reactive airways disease/COPD, and moving towards a negative fluid balance to look for the capacity to clear opacities. The patient will be monitored for any changes in creatinine and blood pressure.

Additional issues mentioned in the housestaff note of this date will also be addressed. The patient's nutrition will be managed with Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 30 mL/hour. Glycemic control will be maintained. The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line, arterial line, and a 20-gauge line. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with subcutaneous UF heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension and
   hyperlipidemia who presents on transfer with recurrent post-obstructive
   pneumonia.
   .
   1. Hypoxia / Dyspnea / RLL consolidation with post-obstructive
   pneumonia: Dyspnea has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months
   prior with recent bronchoscopy revealing foreign object.  Diffuse
   wheezing concerning for underlying reactive airway component.  IP
   performed flex bronch [**2-9**] with possible finding of aspergillus, but
   seems less likely due to short duration of steroids (~2-4 weeks).
   Intubated on [**2-10**] due to hypoxia and fatigue.  CTA on [**2-10**] showed no
   evidence of PE.  Dense consolidation in RLL likely post-obstructive
   PNA.  However, R and L upper lobes both with diffuse ground glass
   opacities which could represent infection vs. inflammation.  Will cont.
   broad spectrum abx for HAP.  Will uptitrate steroids to treat for
   organizing pneumonitis in upper lobes.  Bronchoscopy specimen suggests
   that sarcoid is not contributing and again no evidence for
   aspergillosis.  Results also consistent with pneumonitis (BOOP/COP).
   Thoracentesis [**2-12**] c/w transudate.
   - Lasix gtt with good diuresis and stable met alkalosis
   - Vanc day 5 (D1 [**2-10**]) & zosyn day 11 (D1 [**2-4**]) for post-obstructive
   PNA for 2 week course of each
   - Bactrim day 4 (D1 [**2-10**]) for PJP prophylaxis while on steroids
   - Continue steroids -  methylpred 80 mg IV Q8H for organizing
   pneumonitis
 day 4 (D1 = [**2-11**]) for 1 week course then slow taper
   - Cont anxiolytics and nebs for dyspnea
 changed Paxil 30mg qday (can
   be crushed for NGT)
   - Needs speech and swallow eval when extubated and taking POs
   - Will decrease PS/PEEP to attempt to wean to extubation
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. ECG showed
   antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. Does not seem consistent
   with an acute plaque rupture but rather demand ischemia. Had chest
   pressure during acute dyspneic episode on [**2-9**], EKG unchanged, CXR
   unchanged. TTE showed mild changes, but nothing suggesting acute
   ischemia, however, image quality poor. Will likely need repeat TTE and
   outpatient imaging vs. cath.
   - Continue with aspirin
   - Hold the Beta-blocker per Cards recs as patient having wheezing
   - Home statin; has not tolerated atorvastatin in past and given that
   ACS is less likely, can defer max dose for now
   - Transfuse to ~30
 stable
   - Repeat TTE when extubated.
   - F/u Cards and CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   .
   3. Hypertension: On max dose of Ramipril at home.  Has been

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presents with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia, hypoxia, dyspnea, and right lower lobe consolidation. The patient was intubated due to hypoxia and fatigue. Imaging revealed dense consolidation in the right lower lobe, which is likely post-obstructive pneumonia. Ground glass opacities in the right and left upper lobes could represent infection or inflammation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and steroids have been uptitrated to treat organizing pneumonitis in the upper lobes. The patient also has a history of NSTEMI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hyponatremia, which have been managed accordingly. She is currently stable, but several potential medical complications can arise, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Regular surveillance cultures and antibiotic therapy may be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and subcutaneous hepar"

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension and
   hyperlipidemia who presents on transfer with recurrent post-obstructive
   pneumonia.
   .
   1. Hypoxia / Dyspnea / RLL consolidation with post-obstructive
   pneumonia: Dyspnea has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months
   prior with recent bronchoscopy revealing foreign object.  Diffuse
   wheezing concerning for underlying reactive airway component.  IP
   performed flex bronch [**2-9**] with possible finding of aspergillus, but
   seems less likely due to short duration of steroids (~2-4 weeks).
   Intubated on [**2-10**] due to hypoxia and fatigue.  CTA on [**2-10**] showed no
   evidence of PE.  Dense consolidation in RLL likely post-obstructive
   PNA.  However, R and L upper lobes both with diffuse ground glass
   opacities which could represent infection vs. inflammation.  Will cont.
   broad spectrum abx for HAP.  Will uptitrate steroids to treat for
   organizing pneumonitis in upper lobes.  Bronchoscopy specimen suggests
   that sarcoid is not contributing and again no evidence for
   aspergillosis.  Results also consistent with pneumonitis (BOOP/COP).
   Thoracentesis [**2-12**] c/w transudate.
   - Lasix gtt with good diuresis and stable met alkalosis
   - Vanc day 5 (D1 [**2-10**]) & zosyn day 11 (D1 [**2-4**]) for post-obstructive
   PNA for 2 week course of each
   - Bactrim day 4 (D1 [**2-10**]) for PJP prophylaxis while on steroids
   - Continue steroids -  methylpred 80 mg IV Q8H for organizing
   pneumonitis
 day 4 (D1 = [**2-11**]) for 1 week course then slow taper
   - Cont anxiolytics and nebs for dyspnea
 changed Paxil 30mg qday (can
   be crushed for NGT)
   - Needs speech and swallow eval when extubated and taking POs
   - Will decrease PS/PEEP to attempt to wean to extubation
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. ECG showed
   antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. Does not seem consistent
   with an acute plaque rupture but rather demand ischemia. Had chest
   pressure during acute dyspneic episode on [**2-9**], EKG unchanged, CXR
   unchanged. TTE showed mild changes, but nothing suggesting acute
   ischemia, however, image quality poor. Will likely need repeat TTE and
   outpatient imaging vs. cath.
   - Continue with aspirin
   - Hold the Beta-blocker per Cards recs as patient having wheezing
   - Home statin; has not tolerated atorvastatin in past and given that
   ACS is less likely, can defer max dose for now
   - Transfuse to ~30
 stable
   - Repeat TTE when extubated.
   - F/u Cards and CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   .
   3. Hypertension: On max dose of Ramipril at home.  Has been
   hypertensive here.
   - Cont enalapril dose again & cont. to monitor.
   - Will consider restarting B-blocker post extubation
   .
   4. Hyperlipidemia: cont pravastatin; tricor is not formulary and likely
   okay to hold for now
   .
   5. Diabetes: RISS, was increased [**2-12**] and [**2-13**].  Will likely need some
   standing long-acting insulin
   .
   6. Hyponatremia: Resolved.
   - Trend Na
   .
   7. Metabolic alkalosis: stable.  Diamox 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 doses with good
   result.
   - Lasix gtt started [**2-13**], brisk UOP overnight
   .
   8. Leukocytosis: Resolved by HOD 2. Could be sec to infection that is
   being treated currently.
   - Follow daily

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old female who was admitted with respiratory compromise. She has a recent history of aspiration of a foreign body and evidence of airflow obstruction. She has evolved multifocal infiltrates consistent with multifocal pneumonia, exacerbated by dynamic airflow obstruction and possible organizing pneumonitis and/or pulmonary edema. The patient is critically ill and requires continued treatment for multiple possible etiologies contributing to recurrent hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing recurrent hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. It is important to monitor and manage her respiratory status closely.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal infiltrates consistent with multifocal pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy (Vanco/Zosyn) is being administered for pneumonia treatment.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient may have pulmonary edema, and diuresis with Lasix is being continued to alleviate symptoms.
4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has evidence of airflow obstruction, and management with Alb/Atrovent and systemic steroids is ongoing.
5. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type II: The patient's insulin dosing needs to be uptitrated for better glycemic control.

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension and
   hyperlipidemia who presents on transfer with recurrent post-obstructive
   pneumonia.
   .
   1. Hypoxia / Dyspnea / RLL consolidation with post-obstructive
   pneumonia: Dyspnea has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months
   prior with recent bronchoscopy revealing foreign object.  Diffuse
   wheezing concerning for underlying reactive airway component.  IP
   performed flex bronch [**2-9**] with possible finding of aspergillus, but
   seems less likely due to short duration of steroids (~2-4 weeks).
   Intubated on [**2-10**] due to hypoxia and fatigue.  CTA on [**2-10**] showed no
   evidence of PE.  Dense consolidation in RLL likely post-obstructive
   PNA.  However, R and L upper lobes both with diffuse ground glass
   opacities which could represent infection vs. inflammation.  Will cont.
   broad spectrum abx for HAP.  Will uptitrate steroids to treat for
   organizing pneumonitis in upper lobes.  Bronchoscopy specimen suggests
   that sarcoid is not contributing and again no evidence for
   aspergillosis.  Results also consistent with pneumonitis (BOOP/COP).
   Thoracentesis [**2-12**] c/w transudate.  Patient now doing much better after
   aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt and several days of high dose
   steroids.  Respiratory distress may have been more related to volume
   overload than BOOP.  Successfully extubated on [**2-14**].
   - transition to lasix 40 mg IV BID with goal -1-2L/day
   - Vanc day 5 (D1 [**2-10**]) & zosyn day 11 (D1 [**2-4**]) for post-obstructive
   PNA for 2 week course of each
   - Bactrim day 4 (D1 [**2-10**]) for PJP prophylaxis while on steroids
   - Continue steroids but will titrate down as more likely volume
   overload than BOOP -  methylpred 80 mg IV Q8H for organizing
   pneumonitis
 (D1 = [**2-11**]) changed to prednisone 30 mg PO daily on
   [**2-15**].  Will keep on this dose for several days then titrate down with
   slow taper
   - Cont anxiolytics and nebs for dyspnea
 changed Paxil back to home
   duloxetine/Cymbalta
   - Needs speech and swallow eval when extubated and taking POs
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. ECG showed
   antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. Does not seem consistent
   with an acute plaque rupture but rather demand ischemia. Had chest
   pressure during acute dyspneic episode on [**2-9**], EKG unchanged, CXR
   unchanged. TTE showed mild changes, but nothing suggesting acute
   ischemia, however, image quality poor. Will likely need repeat TTE and
   outpatient imaging vs. cath.
   - Continue with aspirin
   - Hold the Beta-blocker per Cards recs as patient having wheezing
   - Home statin; has not tolerated atorvastatin in past and given that
   ACS is less likely, can defer max dose for now
   - Transfuse to ~30
 stable
   - Repeat TTE when extubated.
   - F/u Cards and CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   .
   3. Hypertension: On max dose of Ramipril at home.  Has been
   hypertensive here, though improved with labetalol.
   - Stop enalapril and labetalol and transition back to home dose
   ramipril now that she is extubated.
   .
   4. Hyperlipidemia: cont pravastatin; tricor is not formulary and likely
   okay to hold for now
   .
   5. Diabetes: RISS, and glargine
 monitor FSBS and titrate down as
   blood sugars improve with decreased steroids.
   .
   6. Hyponatremia: Resolved.
   - Trend Na
   .
   7. Metabolic alkalosis: stable.  Diamox 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 doses with good
   result.  Cont. aggressive diuresis for now as patient continues to
   improve.
   - Increase K+ to 4.5 for likely improvement of alkalosis
 hold
   acetazolamide for now
   .
   8. Leukocytosis: Resolved by HOD 2. Could be sec to infection that is
   being treated currently.
   - Follow daily
   .
   9. Anxiety:
   - cont. to reassure patient
   - ativan prn
   .
   FEN: TF started [**2-12**], replete lytes prn, soft mechanical diet with
   thickened liquids today (pt. appears to cough after thin liquids) with
   S/S eval tomorrow.
   PPX: HSC; PPI while on high dose steroids

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension and
   hyperlipidemia who presents on transfer with recurrent post-obstructive
   pneumonia.
   .
   1. Hypoxia / Dyspnea / RLL consolidation with post-obstructive
   pneumonia: Dyspnea has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months
   prior with recent bronchoscopy revealing foreign object.  Diffuse
   wheezing concerning for underlying reactive airway component.  IP
   performed flex bronch [**2-9**] with possible finding of aspergillus, but
   seems less likely due to short duration of steroids (~2-4 weeks).
   Intubated on [**2-10**] due to hypoxia and fatigue.  CTA on [**2-10**] showed no
   evidence of PE.  Dense consolidation in RLL likely post-obstructive
   PNA.  However, R and L upper lobes both with diffuse ground glass
   opacities which could represent infection vs. inflammation.  Will cont.
   broad spectrum abx for HAP.  Will uptitrate steroids to treat for
   organizing pneumonitis in upper lobes.  Bronchoscopy specimen suggests
   that sarcoid is not contributing and again no evidence for
   aspergillosis.  Results also consistent with pneumonitis (BOOP/COP).
   Thoracentesis [**2-12**] c/w transudate.  Patient now doing much better after
   aggressive diuresis with lasix gtt and several days of high dose
   steroids.  Respiratory distress may have been more related to volume
   overload than BOOP.  Successfully extubated on [**2-14**].
   - transition to lasix 40 mg IV BID with goal -1-2L/day
   - Vanc day 5 (D1 [**2-10**]) & zosyn day 11 (D1 [**2-4**]) for post-obstructive
   PNA for 2 week course of each
   - Bactrim day 4 (D1 [**2-10**]) for PJP prophylaxis while on steroids
   - Continue steroids but will titrate down as more likely volume
   overload than BOOP -  methylpred 80 mg IV Q8H for organizing
   pneumonitis
 (D1 = [**2-11**]) changed to prednisone 30 mg PO daily on
   [**2-15**].  Will keep on this dose for several days then titrate down with
   slow taper
   - Cont anxiolytics and nebs for dyspnea
 changed Paxil 30mg qday (can
   be crushed for OGT)
   - Needs speech and swallow eval when extubated and taking POs
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. ECG showed
   antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. Does not seem consistent
   with an acute plaque rupture but rather demand ischemia. Had chest
   pressure during acute dyspneic episode on [**2-9**], EKG unchanged, CXR
   unchanged. TTE showed mild changes, but nothing suggesting acute
   ischemia, however, image quality poor. Will likely need repeat TTE and
   outpatient imaging vs. cath.
   - Continue with aspirin
   - Hold the Beta-blocker per Cards recs as patient having wheezing
   - Home statin; has not tolerated atorvastatin in past and given that
   ACS is less likely, can defer max dose for now
   - Transfuse to ~30
 stable
   - Repeat TTE when extubated.
   - F/u Cards and CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   .
   3. Hypertension: On max dose of Ramipril at home.  Has been
   hypertensive here, though improved with labetalol.
   - Stop enalapril and labetalol and transition back to home dose
   ramipril now that she is extubated.
   .
   4. Hyperlipidemia: cont pravastatin; tricor is not formulary and likely
   okay to hold for now
   .
   5. Diabetes: RISS, and glargine
 monitor FSBS and titrate down as
   blood sugars improve with decreased steroids.
   .
   6. Hyponatremia: Resolved.
   - Trend Na
   .
   7. Metabolic alkalosis: stable.  Diamox 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 doses with good
   result.  Cont. aggressive diuresis for now as patient continues to
   improve.
   - Increase K+ to 4.5 for likely improvement of alkalosis
 hold
   acetazolamide for now
   .
   8. Leukocytosis: Resolved by HOD 2. Could be sec to infection that is
   being treated currently.
   - Follow daily
   .
   9. Anxiety:
   - cont. to reassure patient
   - midazolam boluses prn
   .
   FEN: TF started [**2-12**], replete lytes prn, S/S eval when extubated and

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presented with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia and was intubated due to hypoxia and fatigue. A CT scan showed dense consolidation in the right lower lobe, likely post-obstructive pneumonia. However, the upper lobes showed diffuse ground glass opacities, which could represent infection or inflammation. The patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and steroids to treat organizing pneumonitis in the upper lobes. Thoracentesis revealed a transudate. The patient was successfully extubated on [**2-14**] and transitioned to lasix 40 mg IV BID with a goal of -1-2L/day.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Dyspnea/Right Lower Lobe consolidation with post-obstructive pneumonia: The patient presented with dyspnea and was found to have a foreign object in the bronchus during bronchoscopy. There were also diffuse wheezing and ground glass opacities in the upper lobes. The patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for HAP and steroids for organizing pneumonitis. The patient improved after aggressive diuresis and high-dose steroids.
2. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient had chest pain"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She presents with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia due to aspiration of a foreign object three months prior. The patient was intubated on [**2-10**] due to hypoxia and fatigue, and a CT scan showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE). Dense consolidation in the right lower lobe is likely post-obstructive pneumonia, while diffuse ground glass opacities in both upper lobes could represent infection versus inflammation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and steroids have been uptitrated to treat organizing pneumonitis in the upper lobes. A bronchoscopy specimen suggests that sarcoid is not contributing and there is no evidence for aspergillosis.

Other medical issues include an acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69, antero-lateral changes on ECG, but no ST-elevations. The patient also has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hyponatremia, which have been addressed accordingly.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 156/67 mmHg to 183/128 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated potassium levels, elevated glucose levels, and other abnormalities.

The patient's plan includes uptitrating steroids to treat organizing pneumonitis, continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics for HAP, starting Bactrim for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis while on steroids, and weaning off mechanical ventilation. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and potential cardiac complications due to the history of NSTEMI."

   Assessment and Plan
   63F with history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension and
   hyperlipidemia who presents on transfer with recurrent post-obstructive
   pneumonia.
   .
   1. Hypoxia / Dyspnea / RLL consolidation with post-obstructive
   pneumonia: Dyspnea has been a recurrent issue since aspiration 3 months
   prior with recent bronchoscopy revealing foreign object.  Diffuse
   wheezing concerning for underlying reactive airway component.  IP
   performed flex bronch [**2-9**] with possible finding of aspergillus, but
   seems less likely due to short duration of steroids (~2-4 weeks).
   Intubated on [**2-10**] due to hypoxia and fatigue.  CTA on [**2-10**] showed no
   evidence of PE.  Dense consolidation in RLL likely post-obstructive
   PNA.  However, R and L upper lobes both with diffuse ground glass
   opacities which could represent infection vs. inflammation.  Will cont.
   broad spectrum abx for HAP.  Will uptitrate steroids to treat for
   organizing pneumonitis in upper lobes.  Bronchoscopy specimen suggests
   that sarcoid is not contributing and again no evidence for
   aspergillosis.  Results also consistent with pneumonitis (BOOP/COP).
   Thoracentesis [**2-12**] c/w transudate.
   - Lasix gtt with good diuresis and stable met alkalosis
   - Vanc day 5 (D1 [**2-10**]) & zosyn day 11 (D1 [**2-4**]) for post-obstructive
   PNA for 2 week course of each
   - Bactrim day 4 (D1 [**2-10**]) for PJP prophylaxis while on steroids
   - Continue steroids -  methylpred 80 mg IV Q8H for organizing
   pneumonitis
 day 4 (D1 = [**2-11**]) for 1 week course then slow taper
   - Cont anxiolytics and nebs for dyspnea
 changed Paxil 30mg qday (can
   be crushed for NGT)
   - Needs speech and swallow eval when extubated and taking POs
   - Will decrease PS/PEEP to attempt to wean to extubation
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Ruled-in at OSH with peak troponin I of 2.69. ECG showed
   antero-lateral changes but no ST-elevations. Does not seem consistent
   with an acute plaque rupture but rather demand ischemia. Had chest
   pressure during acute dyspneic episode on [**2-9**], EKG unchanged, CXR
   unchanged. TTE showed mild changes, but nothing suggesting acute
   ischemia, however, image quality poor. Will likely need repeat TTE and
   outpatient imaging vs. cath.
   - Continue with aspirin
   - Hold the Beta-blocker per Cards recs as patient having wheezing
   - Home statin; has not tolerated atorvastatin in past and given that
   ACS is less likely, can defer max dose for now
   - Transfuse to ~30
 stable
   - Repeat TTE when extubated.
   - F/u Cards and CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] recs
   .
   3. Hypertension: On max dose of Ramipril at home.  Has been
   hypertensive here.
   - Cont enalapril dose again & cont. to monitor.
   - Will consider restarting B-blocker post extubation
   .
   4. Hyperlipidemia: cont pravastatin; tricor is not formulary and likely
   okay to hold for now
   .
   5. Diabetes: RISS, was increased [**2-12**] and [**2-13**].  Will likely need some
   standing long-acting insulin
   .
   6. Hyponatremia: Resolved.
   - Trend Na
   .
   7. Metabolic alkalosis: stable.  Diamox 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 doses with good
   result.
   - Lasix gtt started [**2-13**], brisk UOP overnight
   - Increase K+ to 4.5 for likely improvement of alkalosis
 hold
   acetazolamide for now
   .
   8. Leukocytosis: Resolved by HOD 2. Could be sec to infection that is

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted to the ICU with recurrent post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is still on invasive ventilation support.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including hypoxia/dyspnea/right lower lobe consolidation with post-obstructive pneumonia, NSTEMI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hyponatremia, metabolic alkalosis, leukocytosis, and anxiety.

The patient is currently receiving various treatments, including broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia, steroids for organizing pneumonitis, anxiolytics, nebs for dyspnea, Lasix gtt for fluid management, and continuous glucose monitoring.

The patient's laboratory results show normal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and liver function tests. However, the patient has elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate.

The patient's chest X-ray reveals dense consolidation in the right lower lobe, which is likely post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient also has diffuse ground glass opacities in both upper lobes, which could represent infection versus inflammation.

The patient's cardiac enzymes show elevated troponin I levels, indicating"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with history of sarcoidosis and with multifactorial
   sources of hypoxemic respiratory failure.  She has had response to
   intervention for infection, organizing pneumonia and with rapid
   improvement in oxygenationand respiratory status with diuresis over
   past two days with stable extubation.  She does have residual
   persistence of RLL collapse in area of previous aspiration and
   obstruction.  We have had concern for LV function based on echo and
   given brisk response to diuresis suggesting significant pulmonary edema
   certainly evaluation for possible ischemic heart disease would be
   warranted during this admission.  Patient with severe impaired motor
   strenth--dominantly in lower extremities.
   1)Respiratory Failure
Now, strongest issue facing her is the
   deconditioning and keeping favorable BP and HR control and negative
   fluid balance.  She has had significant improvement in infiltrates.
   -Will decrease steroids to 40mg pred qd and taper over the course of 7
   days as limited by her bronchospasm as the argument for organizing
   pneumonitis is not supported by the rapid response to diuretics and
   resolution of iniltrates substantially at 5 days of Rx
   -Will need continued diuresis with Lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **]
   -Will replace KCL to 4.5 goal and to minimize alkalosis
   -Continue with Advair for COPD
   -Will need completion of cardiac ischemia evaluation in the setting of
   significant argument for possible myocardial ischemia contributing to
   respiratory failure is present
   -Complete ABX
   2)Hypertension
   -Will move to home regiment of BP control medications
   -Labetolol with good effect
   3)CAD-
   -ASA
   -Pravastatin
   -Will need to complete evaluation
   Additional issues to be managed as defined in the housestaff note of

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of sarcoidosis and multifactorial sources of hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has shown improvement in her oxygenation and respiratory status with diuresis over the past two days, and her condition has stabilized after being extubated. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is the strongest issue facing her. It is crucial to maintain favorable blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) control, as well as achieve a negative fluid balance. The patient has shown significant improvement in infiltrates, and further management should include decreasing steroids, continuing diuretics, replacing potassium chloride (KCL), and completing cardiac ischemia evaluation.

2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be managed with home BP control medications, specifically labetalol, which has shown good effects.

3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient requires evaluation for CAD, considering the significant argument for possible myocardial ischemia contributing to respiratory failure. Medications such as aspirin (ASA), pravastatin, and further evaluation are necessary.

Other issues mentioned in the note include nutrition management, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's code status is set to full code,"
