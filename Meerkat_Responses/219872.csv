   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with hypox resp failure [**3-11**] multifocal infiltrates and
   now with ARDS
   .
   1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: Has received multiple
   liters of fluid for hypotension and also received additional fluid in
   the ED.  Patient with thin red/[**Location (un) **] secretions consistent with
   gastric fluid and none was aspirated from OGT, concerning for
   aspiration.  Now with clinical picture concerning for ARDS.  Infectious
   etiology as primary insult most likely--primary bacterial pneumonia (S.
   pneumo) vs. viral process with bacterial superinfection vs. atypical
   infection (given resp and GI symptoms).
   --Continue vanc/zosyn and add azithromycin for Legionella coverage.
   --Sputum culture.
   --ARDS net ventilation
   --Currently paralyzed to maintain O2 saturation/synchronize with
   ventilator
   --Requiring high PEEP
   .
   # Hypotension: presented with hypertension (SBP >200) initially and now
   hypotensive.  BP dropped rapidly with sedation, PEEP, intubation, but
   given clinical picture, concerning for sepsis.  Remains fluid
   responsive currently. [**Month (only) 51**] need CVL for now.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: likely hypovolemic hyponatremia vs. SIADH from lung
   process.  Was 132 at ED presentation yesterday.  Will hydrate and
   recheck in am, if not improved, send urine studies
   .
   # Microcytosis: check iron, hematocrit stable, but expect it will
   decrease following hydration. Guaiac stool
   .
   # Leukopenia: Initially leukopenic at admission

   aspiration followed by ARDS. Unclear if superimposed infectious process
   (viral vs   Infectious etiology as primary insult most likely--primary
   bacterial pneumonia (S. pneumo) vs. viral process with bacterial
   superinfection vs. atypical infection (given resp and GI symptoms).  ?
   cardiogenic component as well. No obvious suggestion of inflammatory
   lung disease (AIP, no eosinophils peripherally to suggest AEP although
   we [**Male First Name (un) **]
t have a BAL fluid cell count.)
   -Continue vanc/zosyn and add azithromycin for Legionella coverage. As
   well as osaltamivir
   -Sputum culture.
   -ARDS net ventilation, with paralysis. Consider APRV as rescue mode.
   Worsening O2 with high PEEP suggestive of possible conversion to
   increased West Lung zone I. will recheck ABG (may need more volume vs
   lower PEEP)
   - Check TTE with bubble study, cardiac enzymes
   - f/u clx data (add on pneumocystis if possible). Check 1,3 glucan and
   GM.
   > Hypotension: presented with hypertension (SBP >200) initially and now
   hypotensive.  BP dropped rapidly with sedation, PEEP, intubation, with
   additional concern for emerging sepsis.  Remains fluid responsive
   currently.
   - CVL today
   > Nausea and vomiting: concern for MW tear Primary etiology unclear
   (related to underlying infection vs primary process: neg lipase,  nl
   bili.). Will d/w with GI.
   - Abd U/S
   - GI consult.
   > Hyponatremia: likely hypovolemic hyponatremia responded well to

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure, multifocal infiltrates (possibly due to aspiration), and now with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) requiring high PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure). The patient has a history of nausea and vomiting, hypotension, hyponatremia, and microcytosis. The patient is critically ill and requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient already has ARDS, which can lead to further respiratory complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and acute lung injury.
2. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with initial hypertension followed by hypotension suggests a possible emerging sepsis. The presence of hyponatremia and microcytosis may also indicate sepsis-related changes.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's nausea and vomiting could be related to an underlying infection or a primary gastrointestinal process. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the cause.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates potential renal dysfunction, which can be exacerbated by sepsis and decreased renal perfusion.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's initial hypertension and subsequent hypotension suggest a possible cardiovascular component to the patient's illness. Further cardiac evaluation, including a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with bubble"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male with hypox resp failure [**3-11**] multifocal infiltrates
   (?aspiration) and now with ARDS with high PEEP.
   > Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: Concerning for large volume
   aspiration followed by ARDS. Unclear if superimposed infectious process
   (viral vs   Infectious etiology as primary insult most likely--primary
   bacterial pneumonia (S. pneumo) vs. viral process with bacterial
   superinfection vs. atypical infection (given resp and GI symptoms).  ?
   cardiogenic component as well. No obvious suggestion of inflammatory
   lung disease (AIP, no eosinophils peripherally to suggest AEP although
   we [**Male First Name (un) **]
t have a BAL fluid cell count.)
   -Continue vanc/CTX/azithromycin for Legionella coverage. As well as
   osaltamivir
   -Sputum culture.
   -ARDS net ventilation, with paralysis. Consider APRV as rescue mode.
   Worsening O2 with high PEEP suggestive of possible conversion to
   increased West Lung zone I. will recheck ABG (may need more volume vs
   lower PEEP)
   - Check TTE with bubble study, cardiac enzymes
   - f/u clx data (add on pneumocystis if possible). Check 1,3 glucan and
   GM.
   Place esophageal balloon
   > Hypotension: presented with hypertension (SBP >200) initially and now
   hypotensive.  BP dropped rapidly with sedation, PEEP, intubation, with
   additional concern for emerging sepsis.  Remains fluid responsive
   currently.
   - CVL today
   > Nausea and vomiting: concern for MW tear Primary etiology unclear
   (related to underlying infection vs primary process: neg lipase,  nl
   bili.). Will d/w with GI.
   - Abd U/S
   - GI consult.
   > Hyponatremia: likely hypovolemic hyponatremia responded well to
   hydration.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with hypox respiratory failure, multifocal infiltrates (possibly aspiration), and now with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition is critical, and several potential medical complications can arise.

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has ARDS, which is characterized by rapid progression of multifocal infiltrates and respiratory failure. This condition can lead to further deterioration of lung function and the need for increased ventilatory support.

2. Infectious Complications: The patient's respiratory symptoms may be due to an infectious etiology, such as bacterial pneumonia (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae), viral process with bacterial superinfection, or atypical infection. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary to manage any infectious complications.

3. Cardiogenic Complications: There is a concern for a cardiogenic component to the patient's hypotension, as evidenced by initial hypertension (SBP > 200) followed by hypotension. This could indicate underlying cardiac dysfunction or cardiac complications related to sepsis.

4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient presents with nausea and vomiting, raising concern for Mallory-Weiss tear or gastrointestinal bleeding. This warrants further evaluation and management, including abdominal ultrasound (Abd U/S) and consultation with the gastroenterology team.

5. Hyponatremia: The patient exhibits hyponatremia, likely due"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of an esophageal balloon placement. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiorgan dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and vasopressor support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and prompt identification of any signs of infection are crucial.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The presence of central lines increases the risk of bloodstream infections. Regular assessment of the lines and prompt investigation of fever or other signs of infection are important.
3. Catheter-related urinary tract infection (UTI): Given the duration of urinary catheterization, there is a risk of developing a UTI. Regular urine cultures and monitoring for urinary symptoms are necessary.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of DVT formation. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and early mobilization should be implemented.
5. Stress ulcer: Prolonged critical illness and the use of certain medications can lead to stress ulcers. Monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding and providing prophylactic medication may be necessary.

   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   and now with respiratory failure.
   .
   1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: Has received multiple
   liters of fluid for hypotension and also received additional fluid in
   the ED.  Patient with thin red/[**Location (un) **] secretions consistent with
   gastric fluid and none was aspirated from OGT, concerning for
   aspiration.  Now with clinical picture concerning for ARDS.  Infectious
   etiology as primary insult most likely--primary bacterial pneumonia (S.
   pneumo) vs. viral process with bacterial superinfection vs. atypical
   infection (given resp and GI symptoms).
   --Continue vanc/zosyn and add azithromycin for Legionella coverage.
   --Sputum culture.
   --ARDS net ventilation
   --Currently paralyzed to maintain O2 saturation/synchronize with
   ventilator
   --Requiring high PEEP
   .
   # Hypotension: presented with hypertension (SBP >200) initially and now
   hypotensive.  BP dropped rapidly with sedation, PEEP, intubation, but
   given clinical picture, concerning for sepsis.  Remains fluid
   responsive currently. [**Month (only) 51**] need CVL for now.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: likely hypovolemic hyponatremia vs. SIADH from lung
   process.  Was 132 at ED presentation yesterday.  Will hydrate and
   recheck in am, if not improved, send urine studies
   .
   # Microcytosis: check iron, hematocrit stable, but expect it will
   decrease following hydration. Guaiac stool

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a presentation of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He has received multiple liters of fluid for hypotension and additional fluid in the ED. The patient has thin red secretions consistent with gastric fluid and none was aspirated from OGT, concerning for aspiration. He is now showing clinical signs of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's blood pressure initially presented with hypertension but is now hypotensive. There is concern for sepsis. He remains fluid responsive currently and needs a central venous line for now. 

The patient has hyponatremia, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia vs. SIADH from lung process. He will be hydrated and rechecked in the morning, if not improved, urine studies will be sent. 

Microcytosis is noted, and it is recommended to check iron levels. Hematocrit is stable but expected to decrease following hydration. Guaiac stool test is also planned. 

Leukopenia was initially observed at admission. 

The patient is NPO pending stabilization of respiratory status, IVF resuscitation, following electrolytes.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   and now with respiratory failure.
   .
   1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: Has received multiple
   liters of fluid for hypotension and also received additional fluid in
   the ED.  Patient with thin red/[**Location (un) **] secretions consistent with
   gastric fluid and none was aspirated from OGT, concerning for
   aspiration.  Now with clinical picture concerning for ARDS.  Infectious
   etiology as primary insult most likely--primary bacterial pneumonia (S.
   pneumo) vs. viral process with bacterial superinfection vs. atypical
   infection (given resp and GI symptoms).
   --Continue vanc/zosyn and add azithromycin for Legionella coverage.
   --Sputum culture.
   --ARDS net ventilation
   --Currently paralyzed to maintain O2 saturation/synchronize with
   ventilator
   --Requiring high PEEP
   .
   # Hypotension: presented with hypertension (SBP >200) initially and now
   hypotensive.  BP dropped rapidly with sedation, PEEP, intubation, but
   given clinical picture, concerning for sepsis.  Remains fluid
   responsive currently. [**Month (only) 51**] need CVL for now.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: likely hypovolemic hyponatremia vs. SIADH from lung
   process.  Was 132 at ED presentation yesterday.  Will hydrate and
   recheck in am, if not improved, send urine studies
   .
   # Microcytosis: check iron, hematocrit stable, but expect it will
   decrease following hydration. Guaiac stool

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of pneumonia and respiratory failure.
- The patient presented with thin red secretions consistent with gastric fluid, indicating a possible aspiration event.
- The patient's condition has rapidly worsened, leading to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
- Initial hypertension has progressed to hypotension, possibly due to sepsis.
- The patient's sodium levels are low, suggesting hyponatremia.
- The patient's blood counts indicate leukopenia and microcytosis.
- The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level.
- The patient's electrolyte levels are imbalanced, with low potassium and magnesium levels.
- The patient's platelet count is slightly low.
- The patient has been receiving multiple liters of fluid resuscitation.
- The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation with high PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure).
- The patient has been paralyzed to synchronize with the ventilator and maintain oxygen saturation.
- The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is not provided.
- The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's clinical picture is concerning for ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory failure and difficulty maintaining oxygenation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 65-year-old male with hypox respiratory failure and multifocal infiltrates, possibly due to aspiration.
- He has been diagnosed with influenza A, presumed H1N1, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with increased peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and plateau pressure (Pplat).
- He is also on vasopressor support with levophed due to hypotension and renal replacement therapy with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to acute renal failure.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and lactic acid, as well as low platelet count.
- Imaging shows worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray.
- The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS and hypox respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially requiring increased levels of ventilatory support or alternative interventions such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

   Patient is critically ill.
   Total time: 65 min
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypox respiratory failure, multifocal infiltrates, and presumed H1N1 influenza A infection. He was admitted with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and subsequently developed acute renal failure. The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing difficulties in oxygenation and ventilation. He requires intubation, mechanical ventilation, and vasoactive medications for blood pressure support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen levels require aggressive interventions to maintain adequate oxygenation. Prone positioning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be considered to improve oxygen delivery.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is worsening, as indicated by bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. Prone positioning and lung recruitment maneuvers can help improve oxygenation.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, evidenced by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output). Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may be necessary to manage renal failure and fluid balance.
4. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest ongoing septic shock. In addition to fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy with medications like norepinephrine or vasopressin may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with no clear past medical history, presenting with multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He has tested positive for influenza A, which is likely H1N1. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring various interventions such as cardioversion for atrial flutter, dialysis catheter placement for continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), and proning to improve oxygenation. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 30 and FiO2 of 40%. The patient's vital signs are stable but show signs of ongoing respiratory distress. His laboratory results indicate renal dysfunction, electrolyte imbalances, and leukopenia. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure: The patient's underlying condition remains a significant concern. There is a risk of worsening respiratory function, potential sepsis, and the need for further interventions such as tracheostomy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

2. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's presentation suggests the possibility of ARDS, characterized by severe hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates on imaging, and respiratory failure. Management includes optimizing oxygenation, reducing lung injury, and considering adjunctive therapies like neuromuscular blockade and prone positioning."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a presentation of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has worsened, and he is now in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with H1N1 influenza and is being treated with tamiflu. The patient's vital signs are unstable, and he is experiencing hypotension, acute renal failure (ARF), hyponatremia, atrial flutter, leukopenia, and is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current treatment includes pressors, CVVH, dialysis catheter placement, proning, and sedation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient already has multifocal pneumonia, which has progressed to respiratory failure. This condition can lead to further deterioration of lung function and may require more aggressive interventions such as ECMO or rotation bed.
2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, and there is a plan to start levophed for MAP > 65 mmHg. If the hypotension persists or worsens, it could lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential organ damage.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient is showing signs of ARF, which may be due to pre-renal causes. CVVH has been initiated for renal support, but if the ARF progresses, it could result in end-stage renal disease requiring long-term dial"

   add the following points:
   Dramatic oxygenation improvement with proning. CVVH has been held today
   and unfortunately he remains anuric. He has also required a resumption
   of low-dose pressors. Cardioverted and remains in sinus with

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with hypox respiratory failure, multifocal infiltrates (possibly aspiration), and confirmed influenza A positive, presumed H1N1. The patient's condition has improved significantly since admission, but there are still potential medical complications that can arise. 

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and multifocal infiltrates suggest the possibility of ARDS. This is a life-threatening condition that requires careful management, including maintaining oxygenation, avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury, and considering extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) if necessary.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) as indicated by an increase in serum creatinine and decreased urine output. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration of renal replacement therapy (e.g., CVVH) may be required.

3. Hypotension: The patient has required low-dose vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status and adjustment of pressor support will be necessary.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient has mild hyponatremia, which should be monitored and corrected if necessary.

5. Legionella Coverage: Despite the patient's negative cultures, coverage for Legionella should be continued due to the initial suspicion of infection.

6. Glycemic Control: The patient should be monitored for hyperglycemia, especially given the use of corticosteroids and sed"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He has tested positive for influenza A, suggesting a possible H1N1 infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to ARDS.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired pneumonia): Prolonged mechanical ventilation and immobility increase the risk of developing nosocomial pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated events: The patient is on prolonged mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated events such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated events, or ventilator-associated conditions.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of developing DVT. Anticoagulation prophylaxis should be considered.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical illness and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of developing stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitor prophylaxis should be considered.
5. Catheter-related bloodstream infections: The patient has multiple lines and catheters, which increase the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections. Central venous catheter replacement and strict aseptic technique should be followed.
6. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has been receiving CVVH, indicating potential renal impairment. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary.
7. Hypotension: The patient has been"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with no clear past medical history. He presented with multifocal pneumonia and is now experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated, sedated, and paralyzed. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/59 mmHg to 139/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 72%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and his central venous pressure (CVP) is 20 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying pneumonia does not improve or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which could be due to sepsis or other factors. This could lead to organ perfusion issues and potentially result in shock or organ dysfunction.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure (ARF), possibly due to tubular necrosis (ATN). This may require renal replacement therapy"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He has tested positive for flu A, indicating a likely H1N1 infection. The patient is currently intubated, sedated, and paralyzed, requiring mechanical ventilation support. His vital signs show a heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/59 mmHg to 139/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 72%. The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. He also has leukopenia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's condition is being managed with multiple medications including antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and piperacillin), antiviral medication (tamiflu), and other ICU medications (midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium). The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.34, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 270, and ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch. The patient's physical examination reveals facial edema, scattered ronchi in both lungs"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with ARDS, ARF on CVVH, and previous conditions such as hypox respiratory failure, multifocal infiltrates (possibly due to aspiration), influenza A positive for presumed H1N1, and aspiration. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 23 cmH2O. He is sedated and paralyzed, but these medications may be weaned off soon. The patient has a history of renal failure and is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to his critically ill state.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. Measures should be taken to prevent VAP, including elevating the head of bed (HOB), performing daily mouth care, and assessing for any signs of infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, should be continued to reduce the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration in kidney function"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with hypox respiratory failure, multifocal infiltrates, and a history of influenza A infection. He was admitted with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and has been receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with periods of improvement and deterioration. He is currently intubated, sedated, and unresponsive. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/64 mmHg to 139/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 71%. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by acute renal failure. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. The patient's respiratory secretions may become infected, leading to a secondary bacterial infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs. These clots can potentially dislodge and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism.
3. Nosocomial infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin, Piperacillin), sedatives (Fentanyl, Midazolam), and other ICU medications (Pantoprazole, Heparin). His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/62 to 137/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has a central venous pressure of 24 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,545 mL and output of 1,113 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,432 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 7.0 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 202 K/uL. Other lab values show elevated creatinine levels and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's blood cultures were positive for influenza A and H1N1. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute kidney injury (AKI) due to tubular necrosis (ATN"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving as they no longer require rotabed or paralytics. The goal is to wean PEEP to achieve a PaO2 of 65-70. Treatment for influenza A with ramantidine and H1N1 with tamiflu should be continued. H1N1 testing should be followed up, and the current antibiotic regimen of vanc and zosyn should be continued. ARDS net ventilation is also being used.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, and the plan is to attempt diuresis without the need for pressors or IV fluids.

3. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal replacement therapy (RRT) such as hemodialysis (HD) or continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is being considered. The patient may need an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter if there are concerns about anticoagulation.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was in atrial fibrillation but has been cardioverted back to normal sinus rhythm.

5. Leukopenia:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various medical complications. The patient's condition has shown some improvement as he no longer requires rotabed or paralytics. However, he still requires ongoing sedation and treatment for influenza A and H1N1.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, as evidenced by the need for mechanical ventilation and ongoing treatment for pneumonia.
2. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which may be related to septic shock or other factors. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are necessary.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has evidence of acute renal failure, possibly due to rhabdomyolysis or sepsis. Renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis or continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), may be required.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation, which has been cardioverted. Monitoring for recurrent arrhythmias is important.
5. Leukopenia: The patient initially presented with leukopenia, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
6. Feeding tube (FEN): The patient is expected to start receiving tube feedings later today"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 23 cmH2O and FiO2 of 40%. The patient has been diagnosed with influenza A (H1N1) and is being treated with oseltamivir and rimantadine. He also has acute kidney injury (ATN) and is undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled but has not been successfully cardioverted. He is also leukopenic and is receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The patient's nutrition is being advanced through an orogastric tube, and his code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient's underlying condition can progress to severe respiratory distress or develop secondary infections.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate further, leading to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.
3. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient's renal function may worsen, requiring adjustments in fluid management and medication dosing.
4. Influenza A (H1N1): The patient may develop complications associated with influenza infection, such as pneumonia or worsening respiratory status.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient may experience further cardiac arrhythmias or episodes of atrial fibrillation, potentially"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low (113/61 mmHg), indicating hypotension. This could lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs and potential organ damage.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid accumulation in the alveoli, leading to impaired gas exchange. This can result in respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

3. Influenza A infection: The patient tested positive for influenza A, which may have contributed to the development of ARDS. Influenza infection can cause severe respiratory symptoms and complications.

4. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's clinical presentation suggests a possible aspiration event, leading to pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.

5. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, indicated by elevated creatinine levels and oliguria (low urine output). This could be due to sepsis or direct renal injury from the underlying condition.

6. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient experienced recurrent episodes of AFib, an irregular heart rhythm that can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and other cardiovascular complications.

7. Sepsis: The patient's presentation suggests se"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with hypox respiratory failure, multifocal infiltrates (possibly due to aspiration), and now diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient tested positive for Influenza A and is presumed to have H1N1. The patient's condition has improved with the use of CVVH and lower FiO2 and PEEP levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS indicates a significant impairment in lung function. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, leading to respiratory failure.

2. Infection: The patient is on multiple antibiotics due to the suspicion of bacterial superinfection. There is a risk of developing antibiotic resistance or not fully eradicating the infection.

3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to sepsis and/or the use of nephrotoxic drugs. There is a risk of worsening renal function and the need for dialysis.

4. Arrhythmias: The patient has had recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation. There is a risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias or complications related to anticoagulation therapy.

5. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient needs a bowel regimen to manage potential gastrointestinal complications such as stress ulcers or bowel ischemia.

6. Venous thromboembolism: The patient is at risk"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and receiving various treatments for his conditions. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 125/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

His hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 18 mmHg and mean arterial pressure (MAP) within normal range. Fluid balance is negative with a total output of 9,504 mL and total input of 7,844 mL. 

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 480 mL, respiratory rate set at 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 23 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. ABG results show a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 160, indicating adequate oxygenation and ventilation. 

Laboratory values reveal leukopenia with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 4.5 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 27 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 3.4 mg/dL, and slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.6 g/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits. 

The patient's arterial line was placed on 07/23/2143 at 07:58 PM, and a dialysis catheter was inserted on 07/26/2143 at 06:20 PM. 

Assessment and plan include continuing treatment for influenza A and H1N1, attempting to wean PEEP, and monitoring for any changes in the patient's condition. The patient is also being managed for ARF with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), atrial flutter, leukopenia, and other comorbidities. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI)."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:
   - The patient is improving and no longer requires rotabed or paralytics.
   - Sedation will be continued.
   - PEEP will be attempted to be weaned with a goal PaO2 of 65-70.
   - Treatment for influenza A and H1N1 will be continued.
   - H1N1 testing will be followed up.
   - Antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and Zosyn will be continued.
   - ARDS net ventilation will be utilized.
   - Goal for input/output balance will be achieved today.

2. Hypotension:
   - The patient's hypotension has resolved.
   - Diuresis will be attempted, and no pressors or IV fluids are currently required.

3. Acute kidney injury (ARF):
   - The patient is suspected to have acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
   - Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) will be initiated.
   - An inferior vena cava (IVC) line may be considered.

4. Atrial flutter:
   - The patient's atrial flutter has returned.
   - Rate control will be maintained, as cardioversion attempts have failed.

5. Leukopenia:
   - The patient has leukopenia.
   - Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) will be started.

6. Feeding:
   - The patient's feeding tube will be advanced.
   - Tube feedings will be initiated later today or tomorrow.
   - Residuals will be monitored.

7. Prophylaxis:
   - Prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) will be administered.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if there is a worsening of pneumonia or if weaning from mechanical ventilation fails.

2. ARDS: The patient is already experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Any further lung injury or infection could exacerbate ARDS and lead to increased difficulty in oxygenation.

3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function may worsen, leading to further fluid accumulation and electrolyte imbalances.

4. Infections: Despite ongoing antibiotic therapy, the patient may develop new infections due to immunosuppression and prolonged ICU stay.

5. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial flutter increases the risk of further cardiac arrhythmias, which could compromise hemodynamics.

6. Bleeding: The patient's elevated INR and prolonged PTT indicate a bleeding risk. Any procedure or medication that affects clotting factors could increase the risk of bleeding.

7. Malnutrition: P"

The patient's condition has been complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), hypotension, and pulmonary edema.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 37.6°C (99.7°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate (HR) of 75 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 115/60 mmHg to 175/82 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%.

The patient's respiratory support includes being intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation (CMV mode). The ventilator settings include a tidal volume (Vt) of 480 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 21 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with influenza A (H1N1) and is currently receiving treatment for it. The patient is sedated and paralyzed to maintain oxygenation and synchronize with the ventilator. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/55 to 170/99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has a central venous pressure of 13 mmHg and is receiving aggressive diuresis. His renal function is impaired, and he is tolerating continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter but is currently in sinus rhythm. He is on tube feeds and has been having stools. The patient has multiple lines including a multi-lumen central line, arterial line, CVL, and dialysis catheter. He is on prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and he is admitted to the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient has been experiencing hiccups unresponsive to sedation and paralysis, which suggests a possible neurological issue or an underlying condition affecting the muscles involved in breathing.
2. The patient's PEEP was decreased to 19, but the sats dropped, so it was increased back to 21. This indicates that the patient may have difficulty maintaining oxygen saturation levels, possibly due to compromised lung function or respiratory distress.
3. The patient developed a breakdown on the coccyx and lesions on the heels, raising concerns about the development of deep tissue injuries, which could be related to immobility or poor circulation.
4. The patient required fluid removal at a rate of 150-200 cc/hr, suggesting possible fluid overload or edema.
5. The patient had bowel movements (BMs), indicating some degree of gastrointestinal function.
6. The Infectious Disease (ID) team recommended discontinuing rimantidine and Azithromycin, suggesting a change in the antibiotic regimen.
7. The Renal team aimed to achieve a negative fluid balance of 3 liters, indicating a focus on managing the patient's renal function and fluid management.
8. The patient has no known drug allergies.
9. The patient received various medications including piperacillin, vancomycin, Azithromycin, midazol"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He has been intubated and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 99/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and paralyzed. Fluid balance shows a positive fluid intake of 8,040 mL and output of 13,134 mL since midnight. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 3.1 mg/dL and urea nitrogen level of 25 mg/dL. There are no known drug allergies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient presents with multifocal pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure. The ongoing treatment includes antibiotics (vanc / zosyn) and antivirals (ramantidine and tamiflu) for influenza A and H1N1. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation is essential.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's condition may progress to ARDS due to the severity of the pneumonia. Management includes optimizing oxygenation and ventilation strategies, such as reducing PEEP and minimizing lung injury.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with no clear medical history who presented with multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with influenza A and H1N1.

The patient requires paralytics intermittently to synchronize with the ventilator and maintain oxygenation. He experiences desaturation when desynchronized with the ventilator, leading to an increase in blood pressure.

Aggressive diuresis has not stabilized the oxygen requirement, so the patient continues to require sedation and paralysis. The goal is to wean the PEEP while maintaining a PaO2 level between 65-70.

The patient is being treated for influenza A with rimantadine and for H1N1 with tamiflu for 10 days. He is also receiving vancomycin and Zosyn for a total of 10 days.

The patient has acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and is tolerating continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). Fluid removal is being done aggressively, and if the CVVH machine goes down, a transition to hemodialysis (HD) may be considered.

The patient was previously in atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter but is now in sinus rhythm. Monitoring is being done via tele.

The patient's feeding tube is to be started with total parenteral nutrition (TPN)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with influenza A H1N1, multifocal pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has been on high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and required assistance with ventilation.

The patient's course in the ICU has been complicated by acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to sepsis while on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). He was intermittently on paralytics and was prone for one day. After being taken off paralytics, the patient began experiencing dysynchrony and hiccuping. He also became hypertensive, tachycardic, and required paralysis again.

The patient has had intermittent bowel movements and no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and azithromycin.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.9°C (100.2°F)
- Heart rate: 86 bpm (66-103 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 108/89 mmHg (98/55-170/99 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute (19-45 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 100%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with no known drug allergies. The patient received bolused paralytics and remained off paralytics. The patient's PEEP was decreased to 16, and their RR was increased to 26. The patient tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and started receiving oral vancomycin. The patient also started hemodialysis (HD) and received a single dose of vancomycin IV due to low vancomycin levels. The patient's antibiotic regimen includes vancomycin, zosyn, and oseltamivir for 10 days, with continued oral vancomycin for 14 days. The patient's ETT was advanced, and TF was restarted. 

Medical Complications:
1. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient tested positive for C. diff, indicating an intestinal infection caused by the bacteria. This can lead to severe diarrhea and colitis. The patient is being treated with oral vancomycin to target the infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings show variations between 123/64 mmHg and 157/94 mmHg. Hypotension refers to low blood pressure, which can compromise blood flow to vital organs and may require further evaluation and treatment.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support with a ventilator mode set to CMV/ASSIST. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure, now presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) mode. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/64 to 157/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm. The patient is receiving multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with compensated metabolic alkalosis. Imaging studies reveal the presence of bilateral infiltrates consistent with pneumonia.

Plan:
1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: The patient will continue to receive aggressive diuresis, weaning of PEEP/FiO2 with a goal PaO2 of 65-70, and treatment for H1N1 with oseltamivir for 10 days. Antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam will be continued for a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a presentation of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure, suspected to be caused by H1N1 influenza. The patient requires ongoing respiratory support and sedation/paralytics to sync with the ventilator and maintain oxygenation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing daily wake-up tests, and maintaining appropriate respiratory secretion hygiene should be implemented to reduce this risk.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's current renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels. Aggressive fluid removal through continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is being attempted, but close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial to prevent further deterioration.

3. Atrial fibrillation/flutter: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter, which may complicate weaning off mechanical ventilation and potentially lead to hemodynamic instability. Continuous cardiac monitoring and appropriate anticoagulation should be continued.

4. Feeding intolerance: The patient is currently receiving tube feeds, but there is a concern for possible feeding intolerance or aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and gastrointestinal symptoms is essential to ensure safe and effective enteral nutrition.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient in the ICU is currently on mechanical ventilation with a decreased PEEP of 16 and respiratory rate of 26. They have been bolused with paralytics and remain off paralytics. The patient has tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and has been started on vancomycin. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been initiated due to renal issues, and the vancomycin level is low, so an additional dose of 500 mg IV was given. The patient is on a combination of antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and oseltamivir for a duration of 10 days. The patient's ETT (endotracheal tube) was advanced, and TF (not specified) was restarted. The patient has no known drug allergies. 

Infusions of midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl are ongoing, along with other ICU medications such as pantoprazole (Protonix) and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/64 to 157/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure, suspected to be caused by H1N1 influenza. The patient is currently sedated and intubated on mechanical ventilation with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) mode. He has been weaned off the ventilator but experiences desaturation with PEEP reduction below 15 cmH2O. His temperature is 101.3°F, blood cultures were obtained, and arterial lines were stopped due to clotting issues. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, and he has a heart rate of 91 bpm. Oxygen saturation is 92% on FiO2 of 55%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation. Fluid balance shows a positive balance of 1,683 mL since midnight. 

The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 480 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 19 cmH2O, plateau pressure (Pplat) of 27 cmH2O, and compliance of 43.6 mL/cmH2O. Oxygenation parameters include PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 189, oxygenation index (OI"

The patient's arterial lines stopped working twice, and he has been febrile since 4:00 PM yesterday. His blood cultures were sent, and he is receiving antibiotics for suspected H1N1 infection. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/55 to 134/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. He is on sedation and paralytics to maintain oxygenation and sync with the ventilator. The patient has been receiving diuretics due to fluid overload. There have been attempts to wean PEEP and FiO2, but the patient's oxygenation drops below target levels. The patient also has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, Clostridium difficile colitis, and is on tube feeds. He has multiple lines and catheters in place, including an arterial line, central venous line, and dialysis catheter.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with H1N1 influenza. The medical team is working to wean the patient off the ventilator by gradually decreasing the PEEP and FiO2 settings while maintaining adequate oxygenation. The patient is also being treated with antiviral medication (Tamiflu) for H1N1 and antibiotics (Vanc and Zosyn) for pneumonia.

The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to acute renal failure (ARF). He is being transitioned to hemodialysis (HD) for renal support. The patient is also experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter with frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs). He is receiving beta-blocker therapy to manage this condition.

Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis and is being treated with oral vancomycin for a 14-day course. He is receiving tube feeds and his electrolytes are being monitored and corrected through continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place, including a peripheral IV line, arterial line, central venous line, and dialysis catheter. His code status is set to full code. The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU, and regular rounds are being held to assess his progress."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of H1N1 flu and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient presented with multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure, and was diagnosed with H1N1 influenza. The patient has been receiving treatment for H1N1 with tamiflu for 10 days and antibiotics (Vanc and Zosyn) for a total of 10 days.

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) with a diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and is currently on hemodialysis (HD) with no signs of kidney improvement. The patient's atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter is being managed with lopressor. Additionally, the patient has been treated for Clostridium difficile colitis with oral vancomycin for a planned 14-day course after completing antibiotics.

The patient's fever has resolved since removing all lines yesterday. The patient is on tube feeds at goal and is producing fair stool output, with daily electrolyte follow-up. The patient's access includes peripheral IV, HD catheter, and a picc line today.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient may be at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further deterioration in renal function. Regular monitoring of vital signs, respiratory status, kidney function, and infection parameters will be important to prevent these complications"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including ARF (acute renal failure), atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, C. difficile colitis, and anemia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/52 to 154/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 480 mL, respiratory rate of 24, PEEP of 11 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 0.

The patient has a central line, arterial line, and urinary catheter in place. His labs show elevated creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and lactate levels, as well as low hemoglobin and platelet count. The patient is receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, and pantoprazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia with respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may continue to deteriorate, leading to further hypoxia and potential need for more aggressive ventilatory support.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function may worsen, resulting in fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and potential need for dialysis.
3. Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter: The patient's cardiac rhythm abnormalities may persist or progress, increasing the risk of thromboembolic events and hemodynamic instability.
4. C. difficile colitis: The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain may worsen, leading to dehydration and potential complications such as sepsis or perforation.
5. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels may lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen carrying capacity.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots in the deep veins of the legs due to immobility and central venous catheters.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation, which can prolong ICU stay and increase mortality.

Overall, the patient's medical conditions and interventions pose various potential complications that require close monitoring and management."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with shock, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The note also indicates hypotension, but states that it is not in shock.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 120/52 to 154/77 mmHg, heart rate between 83-105 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results reveal elevated white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine, blood glucose, and lactate levels, along with decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and albumin. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a tidal volume set at 480 mL, respiratory system compliance of 53.3 cmH2O/mL, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 11 cmH2O.

The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by the need for dialysis and fluid removal.

The patient's recent medical interventions include placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, low-twitch (U/F) for fluid removal, and initiation of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) due to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure, now presenting with additional complications. The patient requires paralytics to sync with the ventilator and maintain oxygenation. There is a positive fluid balance, indicating fluid retention. The patient has been treated for H1N1 with Tamiflu and is also receiving antibiotics for a total of 10-day courses. The patient's renal function is impaired, and they are currently undergoing hemodialysis. The patient has episodes of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, which are being managed with Lopressor. The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis and is on a 14-day course of vancomycin. Anemia is also present, with a planned transfusion threshold of less than 21. The patient is receiving tube feeds but experiencing stooling issues due to C. difficile. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine, total bilirubin, and lactate levels, as well as low albumin and potassium levels. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits, while respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are slightly elevated. Physical examination reveals clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, and normal bowel sounds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with influenza PNA and ARDS. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned off PEEP. He has a fever and is receiving antibiotics (Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.4 C (101.2 F), heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 147/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a maximum temperature of 38.4 C, current temperature of 38 C, heart rate within normal range, blood pressure slightly elevated, and respiratory rate slightly above normal. The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 2,121 mL total in and output of 3,300 mL total out, resulting in a negative balance of 1,179 mL. 

The patient's respiratory support consists of being on a ventilator with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 480 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 23 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 21 cmH2O, compliance of 53.3 cmH2O/mL, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are pending.

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, Clostridium difficile colitis, and anemia. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. He is also on tube feeds and has a PICC line, dialysis catheter, and 20-gauge IV line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure if not effectively treated.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient is experiencing no urine output, indicating potential ARF. Continued monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further kidney damage.
3. Atrial fibrillation/Atrial flutter: The patient's heart rhythm is fluctuating between atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Close monitoring and management are required to prevent complications such as stroke or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient has been prescribed vancomycin for 14 days to treat C. difficile colitis. Monitoring stool output and adjusting medication dosage may be necessary.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing several medical complications.

1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: The patient has been diagnosed with H1N1 influenza and is showing signs of respiratory failure. The treatment plan includes finishing last doses of antibiotics, discontinuing unnecessary antibiotics, starting hemodialysis for acute renal failure (ARF) and fluid removal, and culturing if spikes in temperature.

2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing no urine output, leading to ATN (acute tubular necrosis). Hemodialysis has been initiated for fluid removal and renal support. Recommendations for further management of renal function are appreciated.

3. Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter: The patient is having frequent PACs (premature atrial contractions) and flips in and out of AF/NSR (normal sinus rhythm). It is recommended to continue lopressor to maintain hemodynamic stability.

4. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient has been on po vancomycin for a 14-day course. Stool output is stabilizing, and it may be necessary to increase the dose of po vancomycin.

5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is trending downward, with no evidence of active bleeding. Frequent phlebotomy is being performed"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, Clostridium difficile colitis, and anemia. The patient's current condition includes fever, increased seroquel, decreased fentanyl, started methadone crossover, and weaning down of versed in 24-48 days.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia, which is a serious infection affecting multiple areas of the lungs. Complications may include respiratory failure, sepsis, and respiratory distress.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, as indicated by the need for mechanical ventilation. Complications may include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, or oxygen toxicity.
3. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient is experiencing oliguria (low urine output) and has been transitioned to hemodialysis (HD). Complications may include further deterioration of renal function, electrolyte imbalances, or fluid overload.
4. Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter: The patient has been experiencing frequent PACs (premature atrial contractions) and flips between AF (atrial fibrillation) and NSR (normal sinus rhythm). Complications may include thromboembolic events, such as stroke or"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old man with influenza PNA, ARDS, and ARF. He had his HD catheter changed yesterday and required an increase in PEEP. The patient has been experiencing fever, with temperatures reaching 101.7°F. He has no known drug allergies. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, lansoprazole, heparin sodium, and methadone hydrochloride.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, as indicated by his need for continued ventilatory support and weaning of PEEP.
2. Fever: The patient's fever may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response. It is important to identify the source of the fever and treat it appropriately.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure, as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels. He is scheduled for dialysis today.
4. Drug Rash: The patient has developed a drug rash, which may be related to the antibiotics he is currently taking. It is necessary to discontinue all antibiotics and consider alternative treatments.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous UF heparin, should be implemented.
6. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due"

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 8.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 24.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 301 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 62 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 9.8 mg/dL, glucose level of 151 mg/dL, and lactic acid level of 1.3 mmol/L. The patient's electrolytes show a potassium level of 4.4 mEq/L, sodium level of 140 mEq/L, chloride level of 102 mEq/L, magnesium level of 2.5 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 3.5 mg/dL. Other lab results include elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 301 K/uL, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 414 IU/L, and decreased albumin level of 2.4 g/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, and normal bowel sounds. The patient is responding to commands but his movement, tone, and neurological status are not assessed. 

The patient's assessment and plan include the following: 
1. Multifocal pneumonia/respiratory failure with suspected H1N1 influenza. The patient is expected to finish the last doses of antibiotics today and will be discharged in the morning. Follow-up with infectious disease recommendations is advised.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF) with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and no urine output. The patient has been transitioned to hemodialysis (HD) and renal follow-up is appreciated. Plan for HD per renal guidelines.
3. Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs) and flips in and out of AF/NSR. The patient will continue on lopressor, which remains hemodynamically stable.
4. Clostridium difficile colitis, for which the patient has been on oral vancomycin for a 14-day course. The patient's stool output is stabil"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fevers, with a maximum temperature of 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient has undergone dialysis, removing a total of 3.2 liters yesterday due to low systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s. Sedation was stopped, and the patient is now only on methadone for pain management. Foley catheter was discontinued, and a straight catheter is being used every 12 hours.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 132/59 mmHg to 139/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 699 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 7 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at 23 cmH2O, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 5.7 to 8.9 thousand cells per microliter, hemoglobin concentration ranging from 23.0 to 27.0 grams per deciliter, platelet count ranging from"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a presentation of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications.

1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and is now experiencing respiratory failure. The note mentions that he has H1N1. The plan includes finishing last doses of antibiotics today and discontinuing them in the morning, following ID recommendations, initiating hemodialysis (HD) for acute renal failure (ARF) and fluid removal, and culturing if spikes. If the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable, antibiotics will be added.

2. ARF: The patient has no urine output, indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient has been transitioned to HD, and it is recommended to follow renal recommendations. The plan for HD is based on renal function.

3. Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter: The patient is having frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs) and flips in and out of atrial fibrillation/normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The plan is to continue lopressor, as the patient remains hemodynamically stable.

4. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient is on oral vancomycin for a 14-day course (last dose on [**2143-8-11**]). The stool output is stabilizing, and the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, and he is being treated with lopressor to maintain hemodynamic stability. He also has C. difficile colitis, for which he is receiving vancomycin. The patient has acute renal failure with anuria and is undergoing hemodialysis. He is anemic but not actively bleeding. The patient is receiving tube feeds but is experiencing stooling due to C. difficile. He is sedated with methadone only and may require additional sedation as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia can worsen, leading to increased respiratory distress and potential sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, necessitating further interventions such as tracheostomy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. C. difficile colitis: The patient's C. difficile infection can progress, causing severe diarrhea and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function may worsen, leading to the need for ongoing hemodialysis or kidney transplantation.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may become more severe, requiring blood transfusions and close monitoring of oxygen carrying capacity.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia, respiratory failure, and H1N1 infection. He is currently in the ICU and has been treated with antibiotics for his pneumonia. The patient has developed fevers, likely due to a drug reaction from piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), as evidenced by the presence of a diffuse maculopapular rash. Cultures are being followed, and additional antibiotics may be added if the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable. The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) with anuria and is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), which has been transitioned to intermittent hemodialysis (HD). Recommendations for renal management are appreciated. Additionally, the patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter and will continue on lopressor. He has been prescribed vancomycin for Clostridium difficile colitis. Sedation has been weaned, with methadone being tapered off. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and various lines for medication administration. Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis are in place. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure due to H1N1. He has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 102.5°F (39.2°C), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 131/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. His weight is currently 99.3 kg, and he has lost 24.5 kg since admission.

The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and most recently, piperacillin-tazobactam again. He is also on prophylactic heparin sodium, methadone hydrochloride, midazolam (versed), and fentanyl.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, elevated blood glucose levels, and altered liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes multifocal pneumonia, respiratory failure due to H1N1, and possible C. difficile colitis. He is currently being treated with vancomycin for the latter condition.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure due to H1N1. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, oseltamivir, and intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) for fluid removal. The patient's condition is complicated by fevers, acute kidney injury (ARF) with acute tubular necrosis (ATN), atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, Clostridium difficile colitis, and sedation.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 102.5°F (39.2°C), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/62 mmHg to 95/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 541-772 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 7 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is 62%, indicating inadequate oxygen delivery or increased oxygen consumption.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 7.6 to 8.9 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 4.2 to 9.8 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 1."

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia, respiratory failure, and fever. He has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions. 

The patient has been off oseltamivir and antibiotics, but still presents with ongoing fevers. The source of the fever is uncertain, with possibilities including drug reaction, ongoing infection (such as C. difficile or mold), or other causes. 

The patient's renal function is impaired, with anuria and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He has been transitioned to hemodialysis (HD) with ultrafiltration (UF) for fluid removal. 

The patient also has atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, for which he is being monitored closely. 

Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis, for which he is receiving oral vancomycin. 

Other issues include anemia, which is being managed with frequent phlebotomy and a transfusion threshold of less than 21. The patient is currently on tube feeds but had his enteral nutrition (FEN) held due to concerns about extubation, stooling related to C. difficile, and electrolyte management through HD. 

Regarding sedation, the patient is currently on methadone and receives bolus fentanyl/versed as necessary. 

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein throm"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a well-nourished individual who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing various medical complications and interventions over the past few days. 

24-hour events include blood cultures taken from the PICC line twice, an ultrasound examination, and fever with a recorded temperature of 101.3°F (Tmax: 38.5°C). The patient underwent ultrafiltration, with 1.5L removed initially, but experienced hypotension, which resolved with slower fluid removal. Methadone was discontinued, and precedex was started due to hypotension, bradycardia, RR to 30-50 frequently, and difficult to control. At 9 pm, methadone was restarted at 5 mg tid, propofol gtt, versed/fentanyl boluses were administered, and attempts were made to decrease vent support. High fever, liver function tests (LFTs) with elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT), right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound was performed to check for ongoing Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection or drug fever. Sputum sample with mold was observed, and rechecks for galactomannan/beta glucan were ordered, along with a CT chest. The patient also experienced atrial flutter with a slow ventricular response of 40s/50s and had metoprolol discontinued. Respiratory rate (RR) increased and remained difficult to recover. A large volume of tube feeds was aspirated from the mouth while on oxygen, raising concerns about aspiration. Tube feeds were held. RUQ ultrasound revealed sludge but no cholecystitis.

Allergies: No known drug allergies were reported.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure secondary to ARDS. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a fever of 101.3°F, elevated liver function tests, and a positive blood culture for gram-negative bacteria. He has been treated with various antibiotics but has not shown improvement. The patient also has acute kidney injury and is dependent on dialysis. He has been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis and is being treated with vancomycin. The patient has atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with variable heart rates and blood pressures. He is sedated with propofol and methadone, and his pain is managed with fentanyl and versed boluses.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of the bed, using chlorhexidine for oral care, and performing daily spontaneous breathing trials should be implemented to minimize this risk.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobility and central venous catheters, there is an increased risk for developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin or compression stockings should be considered.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient is currently being treated for C. difficile col"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with no clear past medical history, presenting with multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure due to H1N1 influenza. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various complications. The patient has been febrile, had an episode of desaturation with tube feeds suctioned from both the mouth and endotracheal tube, and exhibited atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. He also has a history of C. difficile colitis, which is being treated with oral vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia with respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of multifocal pneumonia has progressed to respiratory failure, indicating a severe infection. This can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential complications such as sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's recent episode of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response indicates an abnormal heart rhythm. If left untreated, it can lead to inadequate blood flow to the body's organs and potentially result in heart failure or stroke.
3. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, which is a bacterial infection commonly associated with antibiotic use. If not appropriately managed, this infection can cause severe diarrhea, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. ARF (acute renal failure): The patient's lack of urine output and"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   and now with respiratory failure [**3-11**] H1N1.
   24 Hour Events:
   Ultrafiltration done yesterday to aid fluid removal and resp status. ID
   consulted re: fevers. Febrile yesterday afternoon and this morning.
   Last night episode of desat w/ tube feeds suctioned both from mouth and
   from ETT. Sedation changed yesterday morning to Percedex for possible
   extubation- pt did not tolerate well and pt resumed on methadone and
   propofol gtt. Slow a flutter (rate 40s)- metoprolol held and now rate
   normalized.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure due to H1N1 infection. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues.

1. The patient developed fevers, and ID consultation was sought. An episode of desaturation occurred while the patient was receiving tube feeds, and sedation was changed to Percedex, which was not well tolerated. The patient resumed on methadone and propofol.

2. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, with frequent PACs and flips in and out of AF/NSR. Bradycardia was noted yesterday, possibly related to Percedex, and metoprolol was held.

3. The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with anuria and is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD), which has been transitioned to intermittent hemodialysis (HD). Renal following is appreciated for recommendations.

4. The patient has a positive sputum culture for mold and yeast, and further evaluation is needed.

5. The patient has multifocal pneumonia, and the CXR shows RUL consolidation and LLL infiltrate. Empiric antifungal treatment may be considered.

6. The patient has a history of Clostridium difficile colitis, for which he received oral vancomycin.

7. The patient's sedation management has been"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and fluid overload. He has been persistently febrile with unclear etiology, despite negative blood, urine, and sputum cultures. He has been treated for Clostridium difficile infection with oral vancomycin. The patient's condition is complicated by a possible small segmental pulmonary embolism, drug fever, acute renal failure with anuria, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, and anemia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy planned if there is no imminent plan for extubation. The patient's treatment plan includes hemodialysis, continuation of heparin for pulmonary embolism, continuation of vancomycin for C. difficile infection, and weaning off antibiotics for pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to influenza A and ARDS, leading to fluid overload.
2. Segmental Pulmonary Embolus: The patient has a possible small segmental pulmonary embolism, which can lead to further respiratory complications.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with anuria, which may require dialysis and management of volume overload.
4. Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter: The patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of unclear past medical history. He presented with multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure, which is suspected to be caused by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). He also has fever, and cultures have been taken. Imaging studies show a possible filling defect in the right lower lobe segmental artery, indicating a potential pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as a tiny filling defect in the right common femoral vein, suggesting a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's vital signs are unstable, with fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. He is sedated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and ARDS are likely due to this condition. It can lead to further deterioration in lung function and increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The presence of a filling defect in the right lower lobe segmental artery suggests a possible PE. If confirmed, it can lead to significant respiratory compromise and circulatory instability.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The tiny filling defect in the right common femoral vein indicates a potential DVT. If left untreated, it can lead to a pulmonary embolism and other complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome.
4. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 126/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 633 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%.

The patient has a history of atrial flutter, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. On admission, the patient presented with fever, hypotension, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient underwent a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which showed bronchopneumonia, a filling defect in the right lower lobe segmental artery suggestive of a pulmonary embolism, and a tiny filling defect in the right common femoral vein. The patient was started on heparin and received a bilateral lower extremity ultrasound which was negative for deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, high lactate level, and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. The"

   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   and now with respiratory failure c/b ARDS.
   #. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure/Fever: has H1N1 off
   oseltamivir and off all antibiotics. CXR worsened this morning with
   mold in sputum culture. All lines have been removed/changed and no
   growth from tip.
   - f/u ID recs
   - CT torso today
   - f/u cultures (ID to ask about speciation)
   - continue current abx (po vanco)
   - f/u RUQ U/S final read
   - attempt to go down on PS today
   - CIS / follow fever curve, if continues to be febrile, consider occult
   DVT
   - no HD today, but likely tomorrow
   - consider trach if no imminent plan for extubation
   # Sedation: on propofol gtt and methadone, attempted precedex but
   tachypnea
   - continue methadone 10 po QID
   - continue propofol gtt
   - need to readdress sedation every day

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure, possibly secondary to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has a fever and positive blood cultures indicating a possible bloodstream infection. The patient's condition has been complicated by the development of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, anemia, and Clostridium difficile colitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Progressive respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Severe sepsis or septic shock: The positive blood cultures and fever suggest a systemic infection, which could progress to severe sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The presence of a tiny filling defect in the right common femoral vein on CT scan raises the possibility of DVT. If left untreated, it could lead to pulmonary embolism.
4. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient's treatment for C. difficile colitis needs to be continued to prevent recurrence or worsening of symptoms.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's frequent PACs and flips in and out of AF/NSR indicate an unstable cardiac rhythm, which may require further management and stabilization.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia requires close monitoring, and appropriate transfusion decisions should be made"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old man with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He has a history of influenza pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and renal failure. The patient has been slowly improving overall but recently developed fevers. A full-body CT scan revealed filling defects.

The patient underwent blood cultures from a PICC line and vein puncture on 08/04/2143. An ultrasound was performed at the bedside to assess for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right lower extremity. An EKG was conducted on 08/05/2143 at 06:54 AM.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate between 74-92 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 120/50 to 135/65 mmHg, respiratory rate between 20-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90%. The patient has atrial flutter as his heart rhythm.

The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin sodium, propofol, chlorhexidine, lansoprazole, methadone, lopressor, and vancomycin both intravenously and orally.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for recent fevers. The flow sheet data indicates ongoing respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set at a tidal volume of 590-"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now with respiratory failure due to ARDS. He has been persistently febrile with unclear etiology, negative blood, urine, and sputum cultures. He also has a positive stool culture for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and is being treated with oral vancomycin. There are new elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) concerning for a cholestatic source, but recent right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ U/S) was unremarkable. The patient may have a right lower lobe (RLL) segmental pulmonary embolism, which could be the source of his fevers. Drug fever is always a possibility, and we will try to limit medications as much as possible.

The patient is currently on airway continuous mandatory pressure support (AC) due to concern for increased work of breathing (WOB); we will wean back to pressure support (PS) when able. He is on continuous heparin gtt for the segmental pulmonary embolism and will bridge to coumadin if there is no upcoming plan for procedure. He is off antibiotics for pneumonia, and we will continue to follow his fever curve (CIS). He is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) to optimize fluid and electrolyte balance.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Fevers:  Patient has been persistently febrile with unclear etiology.
   Blood, urine, sputum cultures negative.  C.diff positive being treated
   with PO vancomycin. RLL segmental pulmonary embolism may be source of
   his fevers. New elevations in LFTs concerning for cholestatic source
   but recent RUQ u/s unremarkable. Drug fever is always a possibility and
   we will try limit medications as much as possible.
   - consider repeat RUQ u/s
   - follow cultures
   - follow ID recs
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism
    Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE.
   - currently on AC due to concern for increased WOB; wean back to PS
   when able
   - cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism; bridge to coumadin
   if no upcoming plan for procedure
   - off antibiotics for pneumonia
   - CIS / follow fever curve
   - cont CVVH
   - consider trach if no imminent plan for extubation
   Sedation: On propofol gtt and methadone, attempted precedex but
   hypotension and bradycardia. Attempting to wean sedation as possible.
   - continue methadone 10 po BID
   - wean propofol gtt as tolerated
   - haldol prn, to titrate up for agitated delirium
   - need to readdress sedation daily
   Acute Renal Failure: Now on CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes
   balance
   - cont CVVH with goal of running net negative as able
   - follow up renal recommendations
   - straight cath every 12 hours instead of standing foley?
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter:  Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated
   C.difficle colitis: on po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also affected by fluid shifts as Hct
   improved back to baseline after HD yesterday.
   - transfusion threshold <21

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of unclear medical past who presented with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS. The patient has been persistently febrile with unclear etiology, blood, urine, and sputum cultures negative. He tested positive for C. diff and is being treated with PO vancomycin. The patient also has a right lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism, which may be the source of his fevers. There are concerns about drug fever and cholestatic source for elevated liver function tests, but recent RUQ ultrasound was unremarkable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to influenza A, ARDS, fluid overload, and right lower lobe pulmonary embolism. There is a concern for increased work of breathing, so the patient has been placed on assisted ventilation with AC mode. The plan is to wean back to pressure support when able.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) to optimize fluid and electrolyte balance.
3. Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter: The patient has a history of frequent premature atrial contractions and has been in and out of AF/NSR. Currently, he is in sinus rhythm, but"

","The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various medical complications. The patient has a history of intermittent hemodialysis (HD) with concerns about electrolyte and fluid balance. They were switched back to continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to these concerns.

The patient's medications include methadone, which has been weaned to 10 mg, and low-dose haloperidol (Haldol) as needed. The patient also has an infection with a segmental pulmonary embolism and is being treated with heparin.

Blood cultures have been taken and show no growth so far. The patient has a fever of 101 degrees and is unable to provide a history as they are sedated. The patient has allergies to Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam), which caused a rash and fever in the past. The last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin on 08/04/2143.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 156/61 mmHg to 87/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is experiencing atrial flutter and has a weight of 94.9 kg, up from 84.5 kg on admission.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been experiencing fevers, but was afebrile overnight. He has vesicles on his left buttock, which are concerning for herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus infection. His sputum culture is growing Aspergillus, which may be a colonizer. He has been treated for Clostridium difficile infection with oral vancomycin and is on heparin for a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism. His liver function tests (LFTs) are still rising, but there is no sonographic evidence of cholecystitis. He has been on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for acute renal failure and has a history of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter. He has anemia and is being managed accordingly. He has multiple lines, including a PICC line and a dialysis catheter. He is receiving appropriate prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). His current medications include seroquel, haloperidol, propofol, methadone, and calcium gluconate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due"

   There is no pericholecystic fluid, and the gallbladder does not appear
   hypervascular on color Doppler imaging. Slight wall edema is noted but
   in the setting of low albumin, this is a non-specific finding. There is
   no biliary dilatation and the common duct measures 0.6 cm. IMPRESSION:
   Unchanged moderately distended gallbladder containing sludge. No
   son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of cholecystitis; however, if clinical suspicion
   remains high, a radionuclide HIDA scan should be considered.
   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Fevers:  Pt had been spiking nightly fevers but afebrile last night.
   This may represent suppression on CVVH v. continued improvement in
   fever curve with possible etiology drug fever to Zosyn, now
   discontinued. WBC/diff unremarkable. Sputum cx growing aspergillus
   which may be colonizer. Blood, urine cx neg. C.diff being treated with
   PO vancomycin. On heparin gtt for RLL segmental PE. LFTs still rising
   but still without son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of cholecystisis.
   - trend fever curve and WBC
   - follow cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan
   - complete vancomycin po course for c.diff
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - consider HIDA scan if LFTs do not level off or clinical worsening
   - follow ID recs
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Congestive hepatopathy possible but
   increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests a cholestatic picture although
   no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on repeat RUQ u/s.
   - Consider HIDA scan if LFTs cont to rise or pt cont to spike fevers
    Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE.
   - off antibiotics for pneumonia
   - cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism; bridge to coumadin
   if no upcoming plan for procedure
   - wean PS settings and sedation as able
   - possibility of trach discussed with family but not indicated for now
   Sedation: On propofol gtt and methadone, attempting to wean as possible
   although still with occasional episodes of agitation.
   - continue methadone 10 po BID
   - wean propofol gtt as tolerated
   - Standing seroquel 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - haldol prn, to titrate up for agitated delirium
   - need to readdress sedation daily
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes balance
   - cont CVVH with goal of running net negative as able
   - follow up renal recommendations
   - given minimal UOP, with decrease straight cath to 2x/weekly
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also affected by fluid shifts as Hct
   improved back to baseline after HD yesterday.
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia, now experiencing respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's fever curve has shown improvement, but he still has occasional spikes in temperature. His white blood cell count and differential are unremarkable. Cultures are pending, and he is being treated with vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection. The patient also has a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism and is receiving heparin via a continuous infusion. His liver function tests are rising, but there is no evidence of cholecystitis on repeat abdominal ultrasound. The patient's sedation is being weaned as tolerated, and there is a possibility of tracheostomy if needed. He is also being treated for acute renal failure with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: Due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and immobility, the patient is at risk for developing nosocomial pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT formation.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's current treatment for ARDS may lead to further renal impairment, potentially progressing to AKI.
4. Hepatic failure: Rising liver enzymes indicate potential liver injury"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 34-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition has been stable, with improvements in oxygenation and ventilation. However, there have been some concerning events and potential complications.

1. Ultrasound: At 10:22 AM on [date], an ultrasound was performed, revealing increased work of breathing (WOB) with large tidal volumes, potentially indicating deadspace. This could be related to agitation in the setting of methadone taper. The patient's agitation led to an increase in haloperidol (Haldol) and the use of propofol bolus.

2. Infection Control: The patient has an Aspergillus species growing from sputum cultures, which may be a colonizer. Further investigation with beta glucan/galactomannan is planned. There is no change in antibiotics for now, but consideration for a right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ U/S) is being made.

3. Renal Function: The patient's renal function has shown improvement on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and is tolerating ultrafiltration (UF). Therefore, CVVH and UF will be continued.

4. Medication Adjustments: The patient was placed on a standing dose of Seroquel 25 mg at [hospital name]. Ventilator settings were weaned down throughout the day.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Fevers:  Patient has been persistently febrile with unclear etiology.
   Blood, urine, sputum cultures negative.  C.diff positive being treated
   with PO vancomycin. RLL segmental pulmonary embolism may be source of
   his fevers. New elevations in LFTs concerning for cholestatic source
   but recent RUQ u/s unremarkable. Drug fever is always a possibility and
   we will try limit medications as much as possible.
   - repeat RUQ u/s
   - follow cultures
   - follow ID recs
   - Add on Differential
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism
    Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE.
   - currently on AC due to concern for increased WOB; wean back to PS
   when able
   - cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism; bridge to coumadin
   if no upcoming plan for procedure
   - off antibiotics for pneumonia
   - CIS / follow fever curve
   - cont CVVH
   - consider trach if no imminent plan for extubation
   Sedation: On propofol gtt and methadone, attempted precedex but
   hypotension and bradycardia. Attempting to wean sedation as possible.
   - continue methadone 10 po BID
   - wean propofol gtt as tolerated
   - Standing seroquel 25mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - haldol prn, to titrate up for agitated delirium
   - need to readdress sedation daily
   Acute Renal Failure: Now on CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes
   balance
   - cont CVVH with goal of running net negative as able
   - follow up renal recommendations
   - straight cath every 48 hours instead of standing foley?
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter:  Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated
   C.difficle colitis: on po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also affected by fluid shifts as Hct
   improved back to baseline after HD yesterday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now with respiratory failure due to ARDS. He is febrile with unclear etiology, and has negative blood, urine, and sputum cultures. He tested positive for C.difficile and is being treated with PO vancomycin. There is also a concern for a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism as a potential source of his fevers. His liver function tests have shown new elevations, suggesting a cholestatic source, but recent RUQ ultrasound was unremarkable. Drug fever is a possibility and will be investigated further.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying condition puts him at risk for worsening respiratory failure, especially since he is already on mechanical ventilation.
2. C.difficile colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with C.difficile colitis and is being treated with PO vancomycin. However, there is a risk of recurrence or complications such as toxic megacolon or sepsis.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a segmental pulmonary embolism, which increases the risk of further embolic events or complications such as pulmonary hypertension.
4. ARDS: The patient's ARDS increases the risk of acute respiratory distress and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support.
5. Drug-induced liver injury: The new elevations in liver function tests could indicate drug-induced liver injury. Monitoring liver function and considering medication adjustments or discontinuation may be necessary.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be closely monitored, especially considering his chronic illness, iron deficiency, and ongoing fluid shifts. Blood transfusions may be required if the patient's hemoglobin levels drop below the transfusion threshold.
7. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires ongoing management with CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolyte balance. Monitoring renal function and following up with renal recommendations are crucial.
8. Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter: The patient's cardiac arrhythmias need to be closely monitored, and efforts should be made to maintain sinus rhythm. Adjustments to beta-blocker therapy may be necessary.
9. Sedation/ delirium: The patient's sedation regimen will be weaned as tolerated, but close monitoring for delirium and agitation is required. Medications like haloperidol or seroquel may be used to manage agitation and delirium.
10. Pressure ulcers: The patient's prolonged immobility increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which require regular skin assessment and preventative measures.

The patient's complex medical condition and multiple comorbidities make him susceptible to various potential medical complications. Close monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary to manage these risks and optimize his outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Fevers:  Pt had been spiking nightly fevers but afebrile last night.
   This may represent suppression on CVVH v. continued improvement in
   fever curve with possible etiology drug fever to Zosyn, now
   discontinued. WBC/diff unremarkable. Has vesicles on left buttock
   concerning for HSV/HZV. Sputum cx growing aspergillus which may be
   colonizer. Blood, urine cx neg. C.diff being treated with PO
   vancomycin. On heparin gtt for RLL segmental PE. LFTs still rising but
   still without son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of cholecystisis.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - culture vesicles per ID recs
   - follow cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan
   - complete vancomycin po course for c.diff
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism (PTT still mildly
   subtherapeutic)
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - Will get HIDA scan today and consider surgery consult
   - consider changing lines if respikes or clinical worsening
   - appreciate ID recs; will continue to follow
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Congestive hepatopathy possible but
   increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests a cholestatic picture although
   no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on repeat RUQ u/s.
   - Get HIDA scan today
    Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE.
   - off antibiotics for pneumonia
   - cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism; bridge to coumadin
   if no upcoming plan for procedure
   - wean PS settings and sedation as able
   - possibility of trach discussed with family.  Will plan for pursuing
   trach if no improvement by Monday.  Will discuss with interventional
   pulmonary today
   Sedation: On propofol gtt and methadone, attempting to wean as possible
   although still with occasional episodes of agitation.
   - Wean methadone to 5 po BID
   - Fentanyl boluses PRN prior to care for likely pain
   - wean propofol gtt as tolerated
   - will d/c PRN seroquel and continue only standing at 25 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - haldol prn, to titrate up for agitated delirium
   - need to readdress sedation daily

   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with no clear medical history who presented with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now with respiratory failure due to ARDS. He has been experiencing nightly fevers but was afebrile last night. The patient has vesicles on his left buttock concerning for HSV/HZV. Sputum culture is growing Aspergillus, which may be a colonizer. Blood and urine cultures are negative. He is being treated for C.difficile colitis with PO vancomycin. The patient has a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism and is on heparin gtt. His liver function tests are still rising, but there is no evidence of cholecystitis on repeat RUQ u/s. 

The plan moving forward includes continuing to trend the fever curve and WBC, culturing the vesicles per ID recs, following cultures, beta glucan, and galactomannan, completing the vancomycin PO course for C.difficile, continuing heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism (PTT still mildly subtherapeutic), limiting medications as much as possible, obtaining a HIDA scan today and considering a surgery consult, and changing lines if there are spikes or clinical worsening. 

Other concerns include elevated LFTs with unclear source, the possibility of congestive hepatopathy, and a cholestatic picture without sonographic evidence of cholecystitis. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of pneumonia, respiratory failure, ARDS, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The patient has been experiencing fevers, which may be due to drug fever from antibiotics or improvement in the underlying infection. Aspergillus growing from sputum culture may be a colonizer. Blood and urine cultures are negative. The patient has C. difficile being treated with oral vancomycin, and heparin gtt for right lower lobe pulmonary embolism. His liver function tests are rising, but there is no evidence of cholecystitis on repeat RUQ u/s. The patient's condition is complicated by multifocal pneumonia, respiratory failure secondary to influenza A and ARDS, fluid overload, and right lower lobe pulmonary embolism. The patient is on CVVH for acute renal failure, and he has been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis. He is also being treated for atrial fibrillation and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Progression of pneumonia and respiratory failure leading to further deterioration in lung function.
2. Development of new pulmonary embolisms or worsening of existing one.
3. Worsening of renal function and difficulty in managing fluid and electrolyte balance.
4. Recurrence or worsening of C. difficile colitis.
5. Continued elevation of liver function tests with potential development of liver failure.

   vancomycin. On heparin gtt for RLL segmental PE. LFTs still rising but
   still without son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of cholecystisis.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - culture vesicles per ID recs
   - follow cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan
   - complete vancomycin po course for c.diff
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism (PTT still mildly
   subtherapeutic)
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - consider HIDA scan if LFTs do not level off or clinical worsening
   - consider changing lines if respikes or clinical worsening
   - follow ID recs
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Congestive hepatopathy possible but
   increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests a cholestatic picture although
   no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on repeat RUQ u/s.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A and respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for acute renal failure and has vesicles on his left buttock concerning for herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus infection. The patient also has a history of right lower lobe pulmonary embolism, c.difficile colitis being treated with oral vancomycin, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient is at risk due to being on mechanical ventilation and having a tracheostomy.
2. Ventilator-associated events (VAE): The patient may develop ventilator-associated conditions such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT), or ventilator-associated events (VAE).
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of right lower lobe pulmonary embolism and is at risk for developing another DVT while in the ICU.
4. C. difficile infection: The patient is currently being treated for c.difficile colitis with oral vancomycin, and there is a risk of recurrence or spread of the infection.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated LFT"

   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Fevers:  Pt had been spiking nightly fevers but afebrile last night.
   This may represent suppression on CVVH v. continued improvement in
   fever curve with possible etiology drug fever to Zosyn, now
   discontinued. WBC/diff unremarkable. Has vesicles on left buttock
   concerning for HSV/HZV. Sputum cx growing aspergillus which may be
   colonizer. Blood, urine cx neg. C.diff being treated with PO
   vancomycin. On heparin gtt for RLL segmental PE. LFTs still rising but
   still without son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of cholecystisis.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - culture vesicles per ID recs
   - follow cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan
   - complete vancomycin po course for c.diff
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism (PTT still mildly
   subtherapeutic)
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - Will get HIDA scan today and consider surgery consult
   - consider changing lines if respikes or clinical worsening
   - appreciate ID recs; will continue to follow
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Congestive hepatopathy possible but
   increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests a cholestatic picture although
   no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on repeat RUQ u/s.
   - Get HIDA scan today
    Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE.
   - off antibiotics for pneumonia
   - cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism; bridge to coumadin
   if no upcoming plan for procedure
   - wean PS settings and sedation as able
   - possibility of trach discussed with family.  Will plan for pursuing
   trach if no improvement by Monday.  Will discuss with interventional
   pulmonary today
   Sedation: On propofol gtt and methadone, attempting to wean as possible
   although still with occasional episodes of agitation.
   - Wean methadone to 5 po BID
   - Fentanyl boluses PRN prior to care for likely pain
   - wean propofol gtt as tolerated
   - will d/c PRN seroquel and continue only standing at 25 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - haldol prn, to titrate up for agitated delirium
   - need to readdress sedation daily
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes balance
   - cont CVVH with goal of running net negative as able
   - follow up renal recommendations
   - given minimal UOP, with decrease straight cath to 2x/weekly

   [**2143-8-11**])
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also affected by fluid shifts as Hct
   improved back to baseline after HD yesterday.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now with respiratory failure due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). He has been experiencing fevers, but was afebrile last night. The patient has vesicles on his left buttock concerning for Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2), and his sputum culture is growing Aspergillus, which may be a colonizer. He is currently being treated for Clostridium difficile infection with oral vancomycin and has a history of right lower lobe pulmonary embolism (PE) for which he is receiving heparin.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are still rising, but there is no sonographic evidence of cholecystitis. His white blood cell count (WBC) is slightly elevated, but other laboratory values are within normal range. The patient is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for acute renal failure, and his fluid balance is being closely monitored.

The patient has multifocal pneumonia, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, anemia, and is being treated for C. difficile colitis. He is on multiple medications including propofol, methadone, fentanyl, haloperidol, and heparin. The patient's sedation is being weaned as tolerated, and he is being closely monitored"

   - continue to trend
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
   - given elevated triglycerides will switch from propofol to fentanly
   and versed
   - will recheck pancreatic enzymes
    Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,

   Hyponatremia:  Likely in part due to CVVH.  Also may be falsely low
   secondary to hypertriglyceridemia.  Also concern that may be related to
   propofol.
   - switch to versed with methadone and Fentanyl boluses
   - continue to monitor sodium
   Sedation: On propofol gtt and methadone, attempting to wean as possible
   although still with occasional episodes of agitation.
   - Will switch to versed given hypertriglyceridemia
   - continue methadone with Fentanyl boluses
   - continue standing seroquel
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes balance
   - cont CVVH with goal of running net negative as able
   - follow up renal recommendations
   - given minimal UOP, with decrease straight cath to 2x/weekly
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated
   Altered mental status:  Patient has not woken up since decreasing
   sedation.  Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is likely.  Also of concern
   that he is on heparin gtt and may have intracranial pathology.
   - if no improvement will get CT head and consider EEG
   - will see if improved with ET tube exchange
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also affected by fluid shifts as Hct

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now with respiratory failure caused by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient has multiple medical complications including fevers, vesicles on the left buttock concerning for HSV/HZV, positive for HSV-2, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), congestive hepatopathy, high triglycerides, hyponatremia, acute renal failure on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), Clostridium difficile colitis being treated with oral vancomycin, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, altered mental status, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of ARDS, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further spread of HSV-2 infection, worsening liver function, complications related to CVVH, recurrence or worsening of C. difficile colitis, cardiac arrhythmias, worsening renal function, and potential neurological complications.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, liver function, renal function, electrolyte levels, and infection status. Timely intervention and appropriate management of these complications are crucial for the patient's well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Fespiratory distress with vagal episodes
   likely secondary to crusting of ETT; improved with change of tube.
   - wean PS settings and sedation as able
   - off antibiotics for pneumonia
   - cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism; bridge to coumadin
   if no upcoming plan for procedure
   - possibility of trach discussed with family.  Will plan for pursuing
   trach if no improvement by Tuesday.
   Sedation: On propofol gtt and methadone, attempting to wean as possible
   although still with occasional episodes of agitation.
   - Will switch to versed given hypertriglyceridemia
   - continue methadone with Fentanyl boluses
   - continue standing seroquel
   Fevers:  Now improved.  Afebrile for three days although may represent
   suppression on CVVH v. continued improvement in fever curve with
   possible etiology drug fever to Zosyn, now discontinued. WBC/diff
   unremarkable. Sputum cx growing aspergillus but beta
   glucan/galactomannan unremarkable. Vesicles positive for HSV 2 but no
   plans to treat. Blood, urine cx neg. C.diff being treated with PO
   vancomycin. On heparin gtt for RLL segmental PE. LFTs still rising but
   still without son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of cholecystisis, HIDA scan
   negative.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - follow cultures
   - complete vancomycin po course for c.diff
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism (PTT still mildly
   subtherapeutic)
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - consider resiting LIJ if respikes or clinical worsening
   - consider CT chest in 1 week ([**8-11**]) to reevaluate and r/o fungal
   infection given aspergillus in sputum
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Congestive hepatopathy possible but
   increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests a cholestatic picture although
   no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on repeat RUQ u/s. HIDA scan
   negative.  Triglycerides are also high.
   - Continue to trend
   - given elevated triglycerides will switch from propofol to fentanly
   and versed
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
   - will recheck pancreatic enzymes
    Hyponatremia:  Likely due to CVVH and falsely low secondary to
   hypertriglyceridemia.  Also concern that may be related to propofol.
   - switch to versed with methadone and Fentanyl boluses
   - continue to monitor sodium
   Altered mental status:  Patient has not woken up since decreasing
   sedation.  Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is likely.  Also of concern
   that he is on heparin gtt and may have intracranial pathology.
   - monitor for improvement now that ET tube exchange
   - if no improvement will get CT head and consider EEG
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes balance
   - cont CVVH with goal of running net negative as able
   - follow up renal recommendations
   - given minimal UOP, with decrease straight cath to 2x/weekly

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now presenting with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fluid overload, and a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism. The patient has undergone several interventions, including changing the endotracheal tube due to crusted secretions, switching from propofol to versed due to elevated liver function tests and triglycerides, and discontinuing antibiotics for pneumonia. The patient's fevers have improved, but there may still be a drug fever from Zosyn. The patient's white blood cell count and differential are unremarkable. Imaging shows widespread parenchymal opacities in the right upper lobe, worse in the lower lungs, and minimally improved in the right upper lobe, consistent with multifocal pneumonia and possible secondary superimposed process like hydrostatic edema or evolving ARDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status continues to worsen, and he is dependent on mechanical ventilation. The risk of further deterioration and potential need for more aggressive interventions such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be closely monitored.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload, which increases the risk of pulmonary edema and worsening ARDS. Careful monitoring of fluid balance and ongoing efforts to achieve net negative fluid balance through continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) are"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of worsening respiratory status and bradycardia. The patient has been in the ICU for an unknown duration and has a history of multifocal pneumonia. 

From the 24-hour events, it is noted that the patient had crusted secretions in the endotracheal tube, which was causing the worsening respiratory status. The tube was switched and the patient's respiratory status rapidly improved. The patient also has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and triglycerides, leading to a switch from propofol to versed. Additionally, the patient is hyponatremic, likely due to hypertriglyceridemia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/65 to 199/123 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is currently 83 kg, down from 84.5 kg at admission. 

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose levels are also elevated. Liver enzymes are slightly elevated as well. The electrolytes show hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypercalcemia. Other lab results indicate an elevated mixed venous oxygen saturation"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Fespiratory distress with vagal episodes
   likely secondary to crusting of ETT; improved with change of tube.
   - wean PS settings and sedation as able
   - off antibiotics for pneumonia
   - cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism; bridge to coumadin
   if no upcoming plan for procedure
   - possibility of trach discussed with family.  Will plan for pursuing
   trach if no improvement by Tuesday.
   Sedation: On propofol gtt and methadone, attempting to wean as possible
   although still with occasional episodes of agitation.
   - Will switch to versed given hypertriglyceridemia
   - continue methadone with Fentanyl boluses
   - continue standing seroquel
   Fevers:  Now improved.  Afebrile for three days although may represent
   suppression on CVVH v. continued improvement in fever curve with
   possible etiology drug fever to Zosyn, now discontinued. WBC/diff
   unremarkable. Sputum cx growing aspergillus but beta
   glucan/galactomannan unremarkable. Vesicles positive for HSV 2 but no
   plans to treat. Blood, urine cx neg. C.diff being treated with PO
   vancomycin. On heparin gtt for RLL segmental PE. LFTs still rising but
   still without son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of cholecystisis, HIDA scan
   negative.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - follow cultures
   - complete vancomycin po course for c.diff
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism (PTT still mildly
   subtherapeutic)
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - consider resiting LIJ if respikes or clinical worsening
   - consider CT chest in 1 week ([**8-11**]) to reevaluate and r/o fungal
   infection given aspergillus in sputum
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Congestive hepatopathy possible but
   increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests a cholestatic picture although
   no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on repeat RUQ u/s. HIDA scan
   negative.  Triglycerides are also high.
   - Continue to trend
   - given elevated triglycerides will switch from propofol to fentanly
   and versed
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
   - will recheck pancreatic enzymes
    Hyponatremia:  Likely due to CVVH and falsely low secondary to
   hypertriglyceridemia.  Also concern that may be related to propofol.
   - switch to versed with methadone and Fentanyl boluses
   - continue to monitor sodium
   Altered mental status:  Patient has not woken up since decreasing
   sedation.  Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is likely.  Also of concern
   that he is on heparin gtt and may have intracranial pathology.
   - monitor for improvement now that ET tube exchange
   - if no improvement will get CT head and consider EEG
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes balance
   - cont CVVH with goal of running net negative as able
   - follow up renal recommendations
   - given minimal UOP, with decrease straight cath to 2x/weekly
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also affected by fluid shifts as Hct
   improved back to baseline after HD yesterday.
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now presenting with respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 81 bpm (with a low of 35 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 111/62 mmHg to 199/123 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is at 50-50.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including propofol, calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, heparin sodium, midazolam, fentanyl, haloperidol, and others. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, lactate, lipase, amylase, triglycerides, and liver enzymes.

The patient's assessment and plan include weaning of sedation and mechanical ventilation as able, discontinuation of antibiotics for pneumonia, continuation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for goal net negative fluid balance, and consideration of a tracheostomy if there is no improvement by Tuesday. The patient also has a history of fevers, which have improved, and positive vesicles for HSV-2 but no plans to treat. Blood and urine cultures are"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now presenting with respiratory failure due to ARDS, PE, and C. difficile infection. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, fever, elevated liver function tests, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, and potential complications such as atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current condition suggests ongoing respiratory compromise, which may require continued mechanical ventilation support.

2. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, a severe lung condition characterized by widespread inflammation and damage to the lung tissue. ARDS can lead to respiratory failure and other complications.

3. PE (Pulmonary Embolism): The patient has been treated with heparin for a right lower lobe segmental pulmonary embolism. Further monitoring and management are required to prevent clot propagation or additional embolic events.

4. C. difficile infection: The patient is being treated for C. difficile colitis with oral vancomycin. Close monitoring for symptoms of worsening infection or complications is necessary.

5. Altered mental status/sedation: The patient is sedated with midazolam, methadone, and seroquel. Weaning of sedatives should be done cautiously to avoid potential withdrawal symptoms or delirium.

6. Elevated liver function tests"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A/H1N1 now with respiratory failure
   c/b ARDS, PE, ARF and c. diff infection.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE.  Now s/p antibiotic/antiviral course.
   - Wean PS settings and sedation as able
   - Cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - Cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism; bridge to coumadin
   if no upcoming plan for procedure
   - Possibility of trach Tuesday discussed with family.
   Altered mental status /Sedation: On versed gtt, methadone and
   seroquel.  Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is likely.  Also of concern
   that he is on heparin gtt and may have intracranial pathology.
   - Wean sedatives as appropriate
   - Trend hypertriglyceridemia off propofol
   - if no improvement will get CT head and consider EEG
   Fevers:  Afebrile for three. Sputum cx growing aspergillus but beta
   glucan/galactomannan unremarkable. Vesicles positive for HSV 2 but no
   plans to treat. C.diff being treated with PO vancomycin. On heparin gtt
   for RLL segmental PE. LFTs still rising but still without son[**Name (NI) 351**]
   evidence of cholecystisis, HIDA scan negative.
   - Cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - Follow cultures
   - Consider resiting LIJ if respikes or clinical worsening
   - Consider CT chest in 1 week ([**8-11**]) to reevaluate and r/o fungal
   infection given aspergillus in sputum
    - ID has signed off
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests
   a cholestatic picture although no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on
   repeat RUQ u/s. HIDA scan negative.  Triglycerides are also high,
   likely [**3-11**] propofol.
   - Continue to trend
    Hyponatremia:  Likely due to CVVH and falsely low secondary to
   hypertriglyceridemia.  Also concern that may be related to propofol.
   - Continue to monitor sodium
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes balance
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - Continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, now with respiratory failure and complications including ARDS, PE, ARF, and C. diff infection. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: The patient initially had influenza A/H1N1 which led to multifocal pneumonia and subsequently developed respiratory failure. This condition is likely causing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), fluid overload, and pulmonary embolism (PE).

2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient is on Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration (CVVH) to manage acute renal failure and optimize fluid and electrolyte balance.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient is being treated with oral vancomycin for C. diff colitis. A 14-day course has been planned.

4. Altered mental status/Sedation: The patient is on midazolam (versed) gtt, methadone, and seroquel for sedation. Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is suspected, and there is concern about the possibility of intracranial pathology due to heparin gtt.

5. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are rising, indicating liver dysfunction. The cause is"

   - given elevated triglycerides he was switched from propofol to versed
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
    Hyponatremia:  Likely due to CVVH and falsely low secondary to
   hypertriglyceridemia.  Also concern that may be related to propofol.
   - switch to versed with methadone and Fentanyl boluses
   - continue to monitor sodium
   Altered mental status:  Patient has not woken up since decreasing
   sedation.  Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is likely.  Also of concern
   that he is on heparin gtt and may have intracranial pathology.
   - monitor for improvement now that ET tube exchange
   - if no improvement will get CT head and consider EEG
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes balance
   - cont CVVH with goal of running net negative as able

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, resulting in respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been experiencing fever, which has resolved, and c.difficile colitis. He also has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and triglycerides. The patient is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for acute renal failure. He is also on antibiotics for pneumonia and heparin for a suspected pulmonary embolism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's ARDS and ongoing mechanical ventilation pose a risk for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires ongoing CVVH to manage fluid and electrolyte balance. There is a risk of worsening renal function or fluid overload.

3. Hepatic Dysfunction: The elevated LFTs and triglycerides indicate possible hepatic dysfunction. This could be due to congestive hepatopathy, cholestasis, or drug-induced liver injury.

4. Infection: The patient has a history of c.difficile colitis and may be at risk for other infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-related bloodstream infection, or fungal infection.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and coronary artery disease. He presented to the hospital with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. Upon arrival, he was found to have atrial flutter and hypotension. The patient underwent an urgent cardiac catheterization and was found to have an occluded right coronary artery with a total occlusion. He was subsequently placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress and intubated.

The patient's condition has been unstable since admission, with fluctuations in vital signs and lab parameters. His renal function has deteriorated, leading to the initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). His liver enzymes are also elevated, indicating possible hepatic dysfunction. The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently high, ranging from 144 to 186 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels show abnormalities, including low potassium and magnesium, as well as elevated phosphorus and bicarbonate levels.

The patient's infection profile includes a urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile colitis. He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Zosyn, and antifungal agents. His antibiotic allergy is documented, specifically to Zosyn.

The patient's respiratory status has been a major concern. He has required increased ventilatory support, transitioning from CPAP to mechanical ventilation. His oxygenation has been maintained with the use of high-flow oxygen and positive end-expiratory"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Fevers:  Resolved.  Afebrile since [**8-6**]. [**Month (only) 51**] have been secondary to
   resolved drug fever to Zosyn although fever possibly masked by CVVH
   given new leukocytosis. [**2143-8-9**] sputum cx with GPC on gram stain. Past
   workup revealed C. diff diarrhea, pulmonary embolism, aspergillus
   colonization.  HIDA scan negative for cholecystitis athough continued
   rise in LFTs and now pancreatic enzymes concerning.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - add diff
   - surveillance blood cx
   - f/u pending sputum, urine, and blood cx
   - complete vancomycin po course for c.diff
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism (PTT still mildly
   subtherapeutic)
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - consider CT chest at 1 week ([**8-11**]) to reevaluate and r/o fungal
   infection given aspergillus in sputum
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Respiratory distress with vagal episodes
   likely secondary to crusting of ETT; improved with change of tube.
   Sputum gram stain with GPCs, cx pending.
   - off antibiotics for pneumonia; will hold off treating for now given
   clinical stability pending sputum cx data
   - wean PS settings and sedation as tolerated
   - cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism
   - currently planning for trach on Tuesday, but will continue to assess
   respiratory function over weekend with daily wakeups, SBT and RSBI
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Congestive hepatopathy possible but
   increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests a cholestatic picture although
   no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on repeat RUQ u/s and HIDA scan
   negative. New rise in amylase and lipase may represent passing stone v.
   delayed response to propofol although triglycerides now trending down
   off propofol.
   - continue to trend
   - hold further use of propofol
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
   Sedation: Switched from propofol to midazolam with standing methadone
   and prn fentanyl secondary to rising LFTs and triglycerides. Appears
   comfortable and more alert. Will try to wean sedation further today.
   - wean versed as tolerated
   - decrease use of propofol and fentanyl boluses as tolerated, try
   haldol prn instead
   - continue standing methadone and seroquel
   Altered mental status: Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is possible and
   also concern for intracranial pathology on heparin gtt, but increased
   alertness yesterday encouraging.
   - cont to monitor for improvement
   - if no improvement, will get CT head and consider EEG
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes balance
   - cont CVVH with goal of running net negative as able
   - follow up renal recommendations
   - given minimal UOP, with decrease straight cath to 2x/weekly
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on
   HD.
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A and respiratory failure due to ARDS. He has a history of C. difficile diarrhea, pulmonary embolism, and aspergillus colonization. The patient is currently on CVVH for acute renal failure, propofol for sedation, and heparin for a segmental pulmonary embolism. He has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and pancreatic enzymes. The patient's sputum gram stain showed GPCs, and blood cultures are pending. He is planned for a tracheostomy on Tuesday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure.
2. Elevated LFTs: The cause of the elevated LFTs needs to be determined and managed appropriately to prevent liver damage.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and the CVVH therapy should be optimized to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance.
4. C. difficile colitis: The patient may develop worsening symptoms of C. difficile colitis, which can lead to severe complications if not treated properly.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's pulmonary embolism may progress, resulting in reduced lung function and potentially causing respiratory failure.
6. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised, increasing the risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Fevers:  Resolved.  Afebrile since [**8-6**]. [**Month (only) 51**] have been secondary to
   resolved drug fever to Zosyn although fever possibly masked by CVVH
   given new leukocytosis. [**2143-8-9**] sputum cx with GPC on gram stain. Past
   workup revealed C. diff diarrhea, pulmonary embolism, aspergillus
   colonization.  HIDA scan negative for cholecystitis athough continued
   rise in LFTs and now pancreatic enzymes concerning.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - add diff
   - surveillance blood cx
   - f/u pending sputum, urine, and blood cx
   - complete vancomycin po course for c.diff
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism (PTT still mildly
   subtherapeutic)
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - consider CT chest at 1 week ([**8-11**]) to reevaluate and r/o fungal
   infection given aspergillus in sputum
   - HD catheter is day 14 and could be source of fevers/leukocytosis ->
   consider re-siting next week with more permanent HD catheter.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Respiratory distress with vagal episodes
   likely secondary to crusting of ETT; improved with change of tube.
   Sputum gram stain with GPCs, cx pending.
   - off antibiotics for pneumonia; will hold off treating for now given
   clinical stability pending sputum cx data
   - wean PS settings and sedation as tolerated
   - cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism
   - currently planning for trach on Tuesday, but will continue to assess
   respiratory function over weekend with daily wakeups, SBT and RSBI
   - If wakes up, would favor trial of extubation.
   Sedation: Switched from propofol to midazolam with standing methadone
   and prn fentanyl secondary to rising LFTs and triglycerides. Appears
   comfortable and more alert. Will try to wean sedation further today.
   - wean versed as tolerated
   - decrease use of fentanyl boluses as tolerated, try haldol prn instead
   - continue standing methadone and seroquel
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Congestive hepatopathy possible but
   increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests a cholestatic picture although
   no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on repeat RUQ u/s and HIDA scan
   negative. New rise in amylase and lipase may represent passing stone v.
   delayed response to propofol although triglycerides now trending down
   off propofol.
   - continue to trend
   - hold further use of propofol
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
   - Likely repeat CT Abd/Pelv when repeating CT chest
   Altered mental status: Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is possible and
   also concern for intracranial pathology on heparin gtt, but increased
   alertness yesterday encouraging.
   - cont to monitor for improvement
   - if no improvement, will get CT head and consider EEG
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes balance
   - cont CVVH with goal of running net negative as able
   - follow up renal recommendations
   - given minimal UOP, with decrease straight cath to 2x/weekly
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on
   HD.
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fluid overload, and pulmonary embolism. The patient has been experiencing various medical complications, including fever, leukocytosis, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and pancreatic enzymes.

The patient's current condition includes being well-nourished with no acute distress, responsive to commands, and alert. The vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 113/59 mmHg to 135/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on mechanical ventilation.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (Zosyn), sedatives (versed, propofol), pain management (fentanyl), anticoagulant (heparin), and others. The patient is also undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and hemodialysis (HD).

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and liver enzymes. The sputum gram stain reveals gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, indicating a possible bacterial infection. Blood cultures are pending.

The patient's plan includes continuing CVVH for goal net negative fluid balance, weaning sedation and PS settings"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism (PE), C. difficile infection (CDiff), renal failure, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to multiorgan dysfunction.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/59 to 135/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 4,176 mL and output of 7,024 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -2,848 mL. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including midazolam (versed), KCl (CRRT), heparin sodium, calcium gluconate (CRRT), fentanyl, and others.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium, elevated BUN and creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's history of PE increases the risk of recurrent PE due to immobility and central venous catheters.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Fespiratory distress with vagal episodes
   likely secondary to crusting of ETT; improved with change of tube.
   - wean PS settings and sedation as tolerated
   - off antibiotics for pneumonia
   - cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism
   - currently planning for trach on Tuesday, but will continue to assess
   respiratory function over weekend with daily wakeups, SBT and RSBI
   Sedation:  Switched from propofol yesterday methadone and midazolam
   secondary to rising LFTs and triglycerides.  Currently looks
   comfortable.  Will try to wean sedation further today.
   - continue methadone
   - continue standing seroquel
   - continue versed
   Fevers:  Resolved.  Afebrile for 4 days.  Unclear etiology.  Workup
   revealed c. diff diarrhea, pulmonary embolism, aspergillus
   colonization.  HIDA scan negative for cholecystitis.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - follow cultures
   - complete vancomycin po course for c.diff
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism (PTT still mildly
   subtherapeutic)
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - consider CT chest in 1 week ([**8-11**]) to reevaluate and r/o fungal
   infection given aspergillus in sputum
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Congestive hepatopathy possible but
   increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests a cholestatic picture although
   no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on repeat RUQ u/s. HIDA scan
   negative.  Triglycerides are also high.
   - Continue to trend
   - given elevated triglycerides he was switched from propofol to versed
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
    Hyponatremia:  Likely due to CVVH and falsely low secondary to
   hypertriglyceridemia.  Also concern that may be related to propofol.
   - switch to versed with methadone and Fentanyl boluses
   - continue to monitor sodium
   Altered mental status:  Patient has not woken up since decreasing
   sedation.  Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is likely.  Also of concern
   that he is on heparin gtt and may have intracranial pathology.
   - monitor for improvement now that ET tube exchange
   - if no improvement will get CT head and consider EEG
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes balance
   - cont CVVH with goal of running net negative as able
   - follow up renal recommendations
   - given minimal UOP, with decrease straight cath to 2x/weekly
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also affected by fluid shifts as Hct
   improved back to baseline after HD yesterday.
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, leading to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient has several medical complications, including fluid overload, right lower lobe pulmonary embolism (PE), c. difficile infection, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), hyponatremia, altered mental status, acute renal failure, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of multifocal pneumonia and ARDS has resulted in severe respiratory distress, requiring mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if not managed properly.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient has fluid overload as indicated by the positive fluid balance and elevated blood pressure. Proper management is necessary to prevent complications such as pulmonary edema or heart failure.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has been diagnosed with a right lower lobe PE, which increases the risk of further thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin is ongoing, but careful monitoring of the coagulation profile is required to avoid bleeding complications.
4. C. difficile Infection: The patient has been treated with oral vancomycin for c. difficile colitis. It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics to effectively eradicate the infection and prevent recurrence.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A/H1N1 now with respiratory failure
   c/b ARDS, PE, ARF and c. diff infection.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE.  Now s/p antibiotic/antiviral course.
   - Wean PS settings and sedation as able
   - Cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - Cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism; bridge to coumadin
   if no upcoming plan for procedure
   - Possibility of trach Tuesday discussed with family.
   Altered mental status /Sedation: On versed gtt, methadone and
   seroquel.  Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is likely.  Also of concern
   that he is on heparin gtt and may have intracranial pathology.
   - Wean sedatives as appropriate
   - Trend hypertriglyceridemia off propofol
   - if no improvement will get CT head and consider EEG
   Fevers:  Afebrile for three. Sputum cx growing aspergillus but beta
   glucan/galactomannan unremarkable. Vesicles positive for HSV 2 but no
   plans to treat. C.diff being treated with PO vancomycin. On heparin gtt
   for RLL segmental PE. LFTs still rising but still without son[**Name (NI) 351**]
   evidence of cholecystisis, HIDA scan negative.
   - Cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - Follow cultures
   - Consider resiting LIJ if respikes or clinical worsening
   - Consider CT chest in 1 week ([**8-11**]) to reevaluate and r/o fungal
   infection given aspergillus in sputum
    - ID has signed off
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests
   a cholestatic picture although no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on
   repeat RUQ u/s. HIDA scan negative.  Triglycerides are also high,
   likely [**3-11**] propofol, now trending down.
   - Continue to trend
    Hyponatremia:  Likely due to CVVH and falsely low secondary to
   hypertriglyceridemia.  Also concern that may be related to propofol.
   - Continue to monitor sodium
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes
   balance. Plan to transition to intermittent HD early next week.
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - Continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, now presenting with respiratory failure. He is also diagnosed with ARDS, PE, ARF, and C. diff infection. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, fevers, elevated LFTs, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, and possible tracheostomy. The patient is on various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, antivirals, sedatives, heparin gtt, CVVH, and propofol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function, potentially resulting in ventilator dependence or the need for long-term oxygen therapy.
2. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): ARDS can progress and lead to severe respiratory compromise, requiring advanced respiratory support measures such as ECMO (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation).
3. PE (Pulmonary Embolism): The patient's segmental pulmonary embolism may worsen, leading to a massive pulmonary embolism and subsequent cardiovascular collapse.
4. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure, necessitating dialysis or kidney transplantation.
5. C. diff infection: The patient's C. difficile"

3. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient is on CVVH (Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration) to optimize fluid and electrolyte balance. If not managed properly, it could lead to worsening renal function.
4. C. diff infection: The patient has been treated with PO vancomycin for C. difficile colitis. There is a risk of treatment failure or recurrence of the infection.
5. Altered Mental Status/Sedation: The patient's mental status/sedation is a concern, and there is a possibility of toxic metabolic encephalopathy or intracranial pathology. Further evaluation with a CT head and EEG may be necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A/H1N1 now with respiratory failure
   c/b ARDS, PE, ARF and c. diff infection.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE.  Now s/p antibiotic/antiviral course.
   Main barrier to extubation at this time is mental status/sedation.
   - Wean PS settings and sedation as able
   - Cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - Cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism
   - Possibility of trach Tuesday discussed with family, but would attempt
   extubation prior to commiting to trach.
   Altered mental status /Sedation: On versed gtt, methadone and
   seroquel.  Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is likely.  Also of concern
   that he is on heparin gtt and may have intracranial pathology.
   Following commands this morning, which is an improvement.
   - Wean sedatives as appropriate
   - Trend hypertriglyceridemia off propofol
   - if no improvement will get CT head and consider EEG
   Fevers:  Afebrile for three. Sputum cx growing aspergillus but beta
   glucan/galactomannan unremarkable. Vesicles positive for HSV 2 but no
   plans to treat. C.diff being treated with PO vancomycin. On heparin gtt
   for RLL segmental PE. LFTs still rising but still without son[**Name (NI) 351**]
   evidence of cholecystisis, HIDA scan negative.
   - Cont to trend fever curve and WBC/bands
   - Follow cultures
   - Consider resiting LIJ if respikes or clinical worsening
   - Consider CT chest in 1 week ([**8-11**]) to reevaluate and r/o fungal
   infection given aspergillus in sputum
    - ID has signed off
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests
   a cholestatic picture although no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on
   repeat RUQ u/s. HIDA scan negative.  Triglycerides are also high,
   likely [**3-11**] propofol, now trending down.  New elevation of amylase and
   lipase.
   - Continue to trend
   - Consider repeat abd CT if not improving (can combine with Chest and
   Head tomorrow)
    Hyponatremia:  Likely due to CVVH and falsely low secondary to
   hypertriglyceridemia.  Also concern that may be related to propofol.
   - Continue to monitor sodium
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes
   balance. Plan to transition to intermittent HD early next week.
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - Continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, now presenting with respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, PE, ARF, and C. difficile infection. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, but shows improvement in mental status by following commands. The patient is on CVVH for acute renal failure, antibiotics, and antivirals. The plan is to wean sedation and attempt extubation prior to considering a tracheostomy. The patient also has elevated LFTs, hyponatremia, and pancreatitis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If the respiratory function does not improve, the patient may require prolonged ventilation or other advanced respiratory support measures.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's condition may progress to severe ARDS, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially death.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient is on heparin for the treatment of a right lower lobe PE. If the condition worsens, there is a risk of recurrent PE or complications such as pulmonary hypertension.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for ARF. If the"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A/H1N1 now with respiratory failure
   c/b ARDS, PE, ARF and c. diff infection.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE.  Now s/p antibiotic/antiviral course.
   Main barrier to extubation at this time is mental status/sedation.
   - Wean PS settings and sedation as able
   - Cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - Cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism
   - Possibility of trach Tuesday discussed with family, but would attempt
   extubation prior to commiting to trach.
   Altered mental status /Sedation: On versed gtt, methadone and
   seroquel.  Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is likely.  Also of concern
   that he is on heparin gtt and may have intracranial pathology.
   Following commands this morning, which is an improvement.
   - Wean sedatives as appropriate
   - Trend hypertriglyceridemia off propofol
   - if no improvement will get CT head and consider EEG
   Fevers:  Afebrile for three. Sputum cx growing aspergillus but beta
   glucan/galactomannan unremarkable. Vesicles positive for HSV 2 but no
   plans to treat. C.diff being treated with PO vancomycin. On heparin gtt
   for RLL segmental PE. LFTs still rising but still without son[**Name (NI) 351**]
   evidence of cholecystisis, HIDA scan negative.
   - Cont to trend fever curve and WBC/bands
   - Follow cultures
   - Consider resiting LIJ if respikes or clinical worsening
   - Consider CT chest in 1 week ([**8-11**]) to reevaluate and r/o fungal
   infection given aspergillus in sputum
    - ID has signed off
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests
   a cholestatic picture although no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on
   repeat RUQ u/s. HIDA scan negative.  Triglycerides are also high,
   likely [**3-11**] propofol, now trending down.  New elevation of amylase and
   lipase.
   - Continue to trend
   - Consider repeat abd CT if not improving (can combine with Chest and
   Head tomorrow)
    Hyponatremia:  Likely due to CVVH and falsely low secondary to
   hypertriglyceridemia.  Also concern that may be related to propofol.
   - Continue to monitor sodium
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes
   balance. Plan to transition to intermittent HD early next week.
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, now experiencing respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with ARDS, PE, ARF, and C. diff infection. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 134/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's mental status is sedated due to medications such as versed, methadone, and seroquel. He is also receiving heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism and CVVH for acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient's respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, leading to further deterioration in lung function and oxygenation.
2. PE (Pulmonary Embolism): The patient is on heparin gtt for a segmental pulmonary embolism, indicating a potential risk of clot formation and embolization to the lungs.
3. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient is on CVVH for acute renal failure, which may lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. C. diff infection: The patient is being treated for C"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Fevers:  Resolved.  Afebrile since [**8-6**]. [**Month (only) 51**] have been secondary to
   resolved drug fever to Zosyn although fever possibly masked by CVVH
   given new leukocytosis. [**2143-8-9**] sputum cx with GPC on gram stain. Past
   workup revealed C. diff diarrhea, pulmonary embolism, aspergillus
   colonization.  HIDA scan negative for cholecystitis athough continued
   rise in LFTs and now pancreatic enzymes concerning.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - add diff
   - surveillance blood cx
   - f/u pending sputum, urine, and blood cx
   - complete vancomycin po course for c.diff
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism (PTT still mildly
   subtherapeutic)
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - consider CT chest at 1 week ([**8-11**]) to reevaluate and r/o fungal
   infection given aspergillus in sputum
   - HD catheter is day 14 and could be source of fevers/leukocytosis ->
   consider re-siting next week with more permanent HD catheter.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Respiratory distress with vagal episodes
   likely secondary to crusting of ETT; improved with change of tube.
   Sputum gram stain with GPCs, cx pending.
   - off antibiotics for pneumonia; will hold off treating for now given
   clinical stability pending sputum cx data
   - wean PS settings and sedation as tolerated
   - cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism
   - currently planning for trach on Tuesday, but will continue to assess
   respiratory function over weekend with daily wakeups, SBT and RSBI
   - If wakes up, would favor trial of extubation.
   Sedation: Switched from propofol to midazolam with standing methadone
   and prn fentanyl secondary to rising LFTs and triglycerides. Appears
   comfortable and more alert. Will try to wean sedation further today.
   - wean versed as tolerated
   - decrease use of fentanyl boluses as tolerated, try haldol prn instead
   - continue standing methadone and seroquel
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Congestive hepatopathy possible but
   increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests a cholestatic picture although
   no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on repeat RUQ u/s and HIDA scan
   negative. New rise in amylase and lipase may represent passing stone v.
   delayed response to propofol although triglycerides now trending down
   off propofol.
   - continue to trend
   - hold further use of propofol
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
   - Likely repeat CT Abd/Pelv when repeating CT chest
   Altered mental status: Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is possible and
   also concern for intracranial pathology on heparin gtt, but increased
   alertness yesterday encouraging.
   - cont to monitor for improvement
   - if no improvement, will get CT head and consider EEG
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes balance
   - cont CVVH with goal of running net negative as able
   - follow up renal recommendations
   - given minimal UOP, with decrease straight cath to 2x/weekly
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on
   HD.
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated. The patient also has elevated leukocyte count, fever, and right lower lobe pulmonary embolism. Other conditions include elevated liver function tests (LFTs), positive pancreatic enzymes, C. difficile infection, anemia, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, and acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial condition of respiratory failure due to ARDS may continue to be a concern, even after extubation. Close monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory effort is necessary.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The presence of a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism increases the risk of further embolic events. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin gtt should be continued to prevent new thrombus formation.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis with a left shift suggests a new infection. Surveillance blood cultures and pending sputum cultures should be evaluated promptly to guide appropriate antibiotic therapy.
4. Elevated LFTs: The persistent rise in LFTs with increased bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) suggests ongoing liver injury. A CT abdomen/p"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Fevers:  Resolved.  Afebrile since [**8-6**]. [**Month (only) 51**] have been secondary to
   resolved drug fever to Zosyn although fever possibly masked by CVVH
   given new leukocytosis. [**2143-8-9**] sputum cx with GPC on gram stain. Past
   workup revealed C. diff diarrhea, pulmonary embolism, aspergillus
   colonization.  HIDA scan negative for cholecystitis athough continued
   rise in LFTs and now pancreatic enzymes concerning.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - add diff
   - surveillance blood cx
   - f/u pending sputum, urine, and blood cx
   - complete vancomycin po course for c.diff
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism (PTT still mildly
   subtherapeutic)
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - consider CT chest at 1 week ([**8-11**]) to reevaluate and r/o fungal
   infection given aspergillus in sputum
   - HD catheter is day 14 and could be source of fevers/leukocytosis ->
   consider re-siting next week with more permanent HD catheter.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Respiratory distress with vagal episodes
   likely secondary to crusting of ETT; improved with change of tube.
   Sputum gram stain with GPCs, cx pending.
   - off antibiotics for pneumonia; will hold off treating for now given
   clinical stability pending sputum cx data
   - wean PS settings and sedation as tolerated
   - cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism
   - currently planning for trach on Tuesday, but will continue to assess
   respiratory function over weekend with daily wakeups, SBT and RSBI
   - If wakes up, would favor trial of extubation.
   Sedation: Switched from propofol to midazolam with standing methadone
   and prn fentanyl secondary to rising LFTs and triglycerides. Appears
   comfortable and more alert. Will try to wean sedation further today.
   - wean versed as tolerated
   - decrease use of fentanyl boluses as tolerated, try haldol prn instead
   - continue standing methadone and seroquel
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Congestive hepatopathy possible but
   increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests a cholestatic picture although
   no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on repeat RUQ u/s and HIDA scan
   negative. New rise in amylase and lipase may represent passing stone v.
   delayed response to propofol although triglycerides now trending down
   off propofol.
   - continue to trend
   - hold further use of propofol
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
   - Likely repeat CT Abd/Pelv when repeating CT chest
   Altered mental status: Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is possible and
   also concern for intracranial pathology on heparin gtt, but increased
   alertness yesterday encouraging.
   - cont to monitor for improvement
   - if no improvement, will get CT head and consider EEG
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes balance
   - cont CVVH with goal of running net negative as able
   - follow up renal recommendations
   - given minimal UOP, with decrease straight cath to 2x/weekly
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on
   HD.
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of unclear past medical history, presenting with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, resulting in respiratory failure complicated by Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient has had various complications including fevers, C. difficile colitis, pulmonary embolism, aspergillus colonization, elevated liver function tests, and acute renal failure. The patient has been on invasive ventilation, but was extubated to face mask at one point. There have been concerns about the patient's mental status, possibly due to toxic metabolic encephalopathy or intracranial pathology. The patient's condition is unstable, and there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is still compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Infection: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient has ongoing infections, including pneumonia, C. difficile colitis, and possible fungal infection. These infections can worsen and lead to sepsis.
3. ARDS: The patient has ARDS, which can progress and lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, indicating possible liver injury or dysfunction. This could be due to various causes, including drug-induced hepatotoxicity, congestive hepatopathy, or cholestatic liver disease.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is"

   given new leukocytosis. [**2143-8-9**] sputum cx with GPC on gram stain. Past
   workup revealed C. diff diarrhea, pulmonary embolism, aspergillus
   colonization.  HIDA scan negative for cholecystitis athough continued
   rise in LFTs and now pancreatic enzymes concerning.

   - f/u pending sputum, urine, and blood cx
   - complete vancomycin po course for c.diff
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism (PTT still mildly
   subtherapeutic)
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - consider CT chest at 1 week ([**8-11**]) to reevaluate and r/o fungal
   infection given aspergillus in sputum
   - HD catheter is day 14 and could be source of fevers/leukocytosis ->
   consider re-siting next week with more permanent HD catheter.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Respiratory distress with vagal episodes
   likely secondary to crusting of ETT; improved with change of tube.
   Sputum gram stain with GPCs, cx pending.
   - off antibiotics for pneumonia; will hold off treating for now given
   clinical stability pending sputum cx data
   - wean PS settings and sedation as tolerated
   - cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism
   - currently planning for trach on Tuesday, but will continue to assess
   respiratory function over weekend with daily wakeups, SBT and RSBI
   - If wakes up, would favor trial of extubation.
   Sedation: Switched from propofol to midazolam with standing methadone
   and prn fentanyl secondary to rising LFTs and triglycerides. Appears
   comfortable and more alert. Will try to wean sedation further today.
   - wean versed as tolerated
   - decrease use of fentanyl boluses as tolerated, try haldol prn instead
   - continue standing methadone and seroquel
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Congestive hepatopathy possible but
   increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests a cholestatic picture although
   no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on repeat RUQ u/s and HIDA scan
   negative. New rise in amylase and lipase may represent passing stone v.
   delayed response to propofol although triglycerides now trending down
   off propofol.

   - hold further use of propofol
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
   - Likely repeat CT Abd/Pelv when repeating CT chest
   Altered mental status: Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is possible and
   also concern for intracranial pathology on heparin gtt, but increased
   alertness yesterday encouraging.
   - cont to monitor for improvement
   - if no improvement, will get CT head and consider EEG
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes balance

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of unclear past medical history presenting with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A and now respiratory failure complicated by ARDS. The patient has had several complications including fevers, leukocytosis, C. difficile diarrhea, pulmonary embolism, aspergillus colonization, and elevated liver function tests and pancreatic enzymes.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 119/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is extubated to face mask and receiving invasive ventilation support.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and vesicles over the left buttock. Neurologic examination shows alertness and follows simple commands.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.3 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 45 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 2.8 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 132 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 4.9 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 94 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) of 8.1 mg/dL, and albumin of 2.4 g/dL.

The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 679 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%, and plateau pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O.

The patient's assessment and plan include multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure secondary to influenza A, ARDS, fluid overload, and right lower lobe pulmonary embolism. The patient's sedation is being weaned, and there are plans for a tracheostomy on Tuesday. The patient is also on CVVH for acute renal failure, po vancomycin for C. difficile colitis, and heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection (such as ventilator-associated pneumonia), bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, further deterioration of renal function, and hepatic dysfunction."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a complex medical history and current presentation. The patient initially presented with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A and subsequently developed respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has had multiple complications including fevers, leukocytosis, C. difficile diarrhea, pulmonary embolism, aspergillus colonization, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and pancreatic enzymes.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation but has been extubated to face mask. They are receiving several medications including heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism, metoprolol for atrial flutter, haldol for agitation, midazolam and fentanyl for sedation, and vancomycin for C. difficile. The patient is also undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for acute renal failure and has a central venous catheter for dialysis.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes, with decreased hemoglobin and albumin levels. The urine culture is negative, while the sputum gram stain shows gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, which could indicate a bacterial infection.

The patient's physical examination reveals vesicles on the left buttock and bronchial breath sounds. Neurologically, the patient is alert, follows simple commands, and moves extremities spontaneously. The patient's vital signs are stable,"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Fevers:  Resolved.  Afebrile since [**8-6**]. [**Month (only) 51**] have been secondary to
   resolved drug fever to Zosyn although fever possibly masked by CVVH
   given new leukocytosis. [**2143-8-9**] sputum cx with GPC on gram stain. Past
   workup revealed C. diff diarrhea, pulmonary embolism, aspergillus
   colonization.  HIDA scan negative for cholecystitis athough continued
   rise in LFTs and now pancreatic enzymes concerning.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - add diff
   - surveillance blood cx
   - f/u pending sputum, urine, and blood cx
   - complete vancomycin po course for c.diff
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism (PTT still mildly
   subtherapeutic)
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - consider CT chest at 1 week ([**8-11**]) to reevaluate and r/o fungal
   infection given aspergillus in sputum
   - HD catheter is day 14 and could be source of fevers/leukocytosis ->
   consider re-siting next week with more permanent HD catheter.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Respiratory distress with vagal episodes
   likely secondary to crusting of ETT; improved with change of tube.
   Sputum gram stain with GPCs, cx pending.
   - off antibiotics for pneumonia; will hold off treating for now given
   clinical stability pending sputum cx data
   - wean PS settings and sedation as tolerated
   - cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism
   - currently planning for trach on Tuesday, but will continue to assess
   respiratory function over weekend with daily wakeups, SBT and RSBI
   - If wakes up, would favor trial of extubation.
   Sedation: Switched from propofol to midazolam with standing methadone
   and prn fentanyl secondary to rising LFTs and triglycerides. Appears
   comfortable and more alert. Will try to wean sedation further today.
   - wean versed as tolerated
   - decrease use of fentanyl boluses as tolerated, try haldol prn instead
   - continue standing methadone and seroquel
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Congestive hepatopathy possible but
   increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests a cholestatic picture although
   no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on repeat RUQ u/s and HIDA scan
   negative. New rise in amylase and lipase may represent passing stone v.
   delayed response to propofol although triglycerides now trending down
   off propofol.
   - continue to trend
   - hold further use of propofol
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
   - Likely repeat CT Abd/Pelv when repeating CT chest
   Altered mental status: Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is possible and
   also concern for intracranial pathology on heparin gtt, but increased
   alertness yesterday encouraging.
   - cont to monitor for improvement
   - if no improvement, will get CT head and consider EEG
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes balance
   - cont CVVH with goal of running net negative as able
   - follow up renal recommendations
   - given minimal UOP, with decrease straight cath to 2x/weekly
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on
   HD.
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A/H1N1 now with respiratory failure
   c/b ARDS, PE, ARF and c. diff infection.  Extubated [**8-10**].
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE.  Now s/p antibiotic/antiviral course.
   Now extubated.
   - Cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - Cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism.
   Altered mental status /Sedation: On haldol, methadone and seroquel with
   prn fentanyl.  Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is likely.  Exam
   improving off versed gtt.
   - Wean sedatives as appropriate
   - Trend hypertriglyceridemia off propofol
   - If does not continue to improve, will get CT head and consider EEG
   Fevers:  Afebrile for three. Sputum cx growing aspergillus but beta
   glucan/galactomannan unremarkable. Vesicles positive for HSV 2 but no
   plans to treat. C.diff being treated with PO vancomycin. On heparin gtt
   for RLL segmental PE. LFTs still rising but still without son[**Name (NI) 351**]
   evidence of cholecystisis, HIDA scan negative.
   - Cont to trend fever curve and WBC/bands
   - Follow cultures
   - Consider resiting LIJ if respikes or clinical worsening
   - Consider CT chest in 1 week ([**8-11**]) to reevaluate and r/o fungal
   infection given aspergillus in sputum
    - ID has signed off
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests
   a cholestatic picture although no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on
   repeat RUQ u/s. HIDA scan negative.  Triglycerides are also high,
   likely [**3-11**] propofol, now trending down.  New elevation of amylase and
   lipase.
   - Continue to trend
   - Consider repeat abd CT if not improving (can combine with Chest and
   Head tomorrow)
    Hyponatremia:  Likely due to CVVH and falsely low secondary to
   hypertriglyceridemia.  Also concern that may be related to propofol.
   - Continue to monitor sodium
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes
   balance. Plan to transition to intermittent HD early next week.
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - Continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now with respiratory failure and suspected ARDS, PE, ARF, and C. difficile infection. He was recently extubated. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status/sedation, fevers, elevated LFTs, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, C. difficile colitis, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, and possible propofol-induced hypertriglyceridemia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to ARDS and fluid overload.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE) due to heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism.
3. C. difficile infection, which is being treated with PO vancomycin.
4. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) with increasing bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and GGT, suggesting a cholestatic picture.
5. Hypertriglyceridemia, likely related to propofol use.
6. Acute renal failure, for which the patient is on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) to optimize fluid and electrolyte balance.
7. Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, which may be related to frequent premature atrial contractions and slow ventricular response compounded by Precedex.

The patient's care plan includes continuing CVV"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A/H1N1 now with respiratory failure
   c/b ARDS, PE, ARF and c. diff infection.  Extubated [**8-10**].
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE.  Now s/p antibiotic/antiviral course.
   Now extubated.  On heparin gtt for RLL segmental PE.
   - Cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - Cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism.
   - Wean O2 as necessary
   Leukocytosis:  Afebrile. Sputum cx growing aspergillus but beta
   glucan/galactomannan unremarkable.  Current sputum GS with GPC,
   speication pending.  C.diff being treated with PO vancomycin.. LFTs
   still rising but still without son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of cholecystisis,
   HIDA scan negative.  ID has signed off
   - Cont to trend fever curve and WBC/bands
   - Follow surveillance cultures and sputum culture speciation
   - C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last
   dose [**2143-8-11**])
   - Repeat CT chest today per ID to reevaluate and r/o fungal infection
   given aspergillus in sputum; also will help to evaluate for VAP
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests
   a cholestatic picture although no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on
   repeat RUQ u/s. HIDA scan negative.  Triglycerides are also high,
   likely [**3-11**] propofol, now trending down.  New elevation of amylase and
   lipase over last couple days.
   - Continue to trend
   - Repeat abd/pelvis CT today
   Altered mental status /Sedation: On haldol, methadone and seroquel with
   prn fentanyl.  Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is likely.  Exam
   minimally improved off versed gtt.
   - Wean sedatives as appropriate
   - D/c methadone/fentanyl and add morphine prn
   - Add ativan for h/o anxiety
   - Head CT head today
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes
   balance. Plan to transition to intermittent HD early next week.
   - Appearing dry with mild hypotension
 will run even today
   - Will need long term HD access
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Flipped back into a.flutter last pm.
   - Continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, now with respiratory failure due to ARDS, PE, and c. diff infection. The patient has been extubated and is currently on heparin gtt for RLL segmental PE.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient was previously on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The plan includes a repeat CT chest today to evaluate for VAP.

2. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The patient is being treated with PO vancomycin for a 14-day course. C. diff infection can lead to colitis, which may present with symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient is on CVVH for acute renal failure. AKI can occur due to various factors, including sepsis, hypotension, or medications.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to ARDS. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure if the underlying causes are not adequately addressed.

5. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a segmental PE in the RLL. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin is being continued.

   Leukocytosis:  Afebrile. Sputum cx growing aspergillus but beta
   glucan/galactomannan unremarkable.  Current sputum GS with GPC,
   speication pending.  C.diff being treated with PO vancomycin.. LFTs
   still rising but still without son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of cholecystisis,
   HIDA scan negative.  ID has signed off

   - Follow surveillance cultures and sputum culture speciation
   - C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last
   dose [**2143-8-11**])
   - Repeat CT chest today per ID to reevaluate and r/o fungal infection
   given aspergillus in sputum; also will help to evaluate for VAP
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests
   a cholestatic picture although no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on
   repeat RUQ u/s. HIDA scan negative.  Triglycerides are also high,
   likely [**3-11**] propofol, now trending down.  New elevation of amylase and
   lipase over last couple days.
   - Continue to trend
   - Repeat abd/pelvis CT today
   Altered mental status /Sedation: On haldol, methadone and seroquel with
   prn fentanyl.  Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is likely.  Exam
   minimally improved off versed gtt.
   - Wean sedatives as appropriate

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, now experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS, PE, and c. diff infection. He has been extubated and is on heparin gtt for RLL segmental PE. His current issues include leukocytosis, elevated LFTs, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. He is being treated with antibiotics and antivirals, and his condition is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to ARDS and fluid overload. Continuous monitoring and management of oxygenation is crucial.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a segmental PE, for which he is receiving heparin gtt. Regular monitoring of clotting parameters is essential to ensure proper anticoagulation.
3. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient is being treated with PO vancomycin for c. diff colitis. Surveillance cultures should be followed to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.
4. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's LFTs are still rising, indicating ongoing liver dysfunction. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's sedation regimen should be carefully managed to minimize toxic metabolic encephalopathy. Weaning off sedatives and conducting a head CT will help determine"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A/H1N1 now with respiratory failure
   c/b ARDS, PE, ARF and c. diff infection.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE.  Now s/p antibiotic/antiviral course.
   Main barrier to extubation at this time is mental status/sedation.
   - Wean PS settings and sedation as able
   - Cont CVVH for goal net negative fluid balacne
   - Cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism
   - Possibility of trach Tuesday discussed with family, but would attempt
   extubation prior to commiting to trach.
   Altered mental status /Sedation: On versed gtt, methadone and
   seroquel.  Toxic metabolic encephalopathy is likely.  Also of concern
   that he is on heparin gtt and may have intracranial pathology.
   Following commands this morning, which is an improvement.
   - Wean sedatives as appropriate
   - Trend hypertriglyceridemia off propofol
   - if no improvement will get CT head and consider EEG
   Fevers:  Afebrile for three. Sputum cx growing aspergillus but beta
   glucan/galactomannan unremarkable. Vesicles positive for HSV 2 but no
   plans to treat. C.diff being treated with PO vancomycin. On heparin gtt
   for RLL segmental PE. LFTs still rising but still without son[**Name (NI) 351**]
   evidence of cholecystisis, HIDA scan negative.
   - Cont to trend fever curve and WBC/bands
   - Follow cultures
   - Consider resiting LIJ if respikes or clinical worsening
   - Consider CT chest in 1 week ([**8-11**]) to reevaluate and r/o fungal
   infection given aspergillus in sputum
    - ID has signed off
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests
   a cholestatic picture although no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on
   repeat RUQ u/s. HIDA scan negative.  Triglycerides are also high,
   likely [**3-11**] propofol, now trending down.  New elevation of amylase and
   lipase.
   - Continue to trend
   - Consider repeat abd CT if not improving (can combine with Chest and
   Head tomorrow)
    Hyponatremia:  Likely due to CVVH and falsely low secondary to
   hypertriglyceridemia.  Also concern that may be related to propofol.
   - Continue to monitor sodium
   Acute Renal Failure: On CVVH to optimize fluid and electrolytes
   balance. Plan to transition to intermittent HD early next week.
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**])
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Had h/o frequent PACs and flips
   in and out of AF/NSR, likely related to slow ventricular response
   compounded by Precedex. Remaining in sinus currently.
   - Continue low dose beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including atrial flutter, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated with antibiotics for CDI, as well as receiving supportive care for ARDS.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 140/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient is also experiencing episodes of apnea.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's platelet count is also low. Other lab results indicate possible electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's physical examination reveals impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and abnormal peripheral pulses. The patient is not assessed for neurologic examination or peripheral vascular examination.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current assessment includes acute pain, herpes zoster, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, airway protection issues, atrial flutter, pulmonary embolism, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is at risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, air"

   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Respiratory distress with vagal episodes
   likely secondary to crusting of ETT; resolved with tube change. Mental
   status improving and extubated successfully [**8-10**]. [**8-9**] sputum cx with
   sparse OP growth and sparse yeast/aspergillis.
   - off antibiotics for pneumonia.
   - wean face mask as tolerated
   - Off CVVH with plan for HD today or tomorrow.
   - cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism
   - hold on tracheostomy for now
   Back Pain:  Unclear etiology.  Appears musculoskeletal.  Likely from
   immobilization.  Improved initially with Fentanyl boluses and lidocaine
   patch.   Was given morphine and ativan but this made him [**Month/Day (4) 8601**].  Now
   just on morphine for pain
   - continue lidocaine patch
   - low dose morphine for pain
   Fevers/leukocytosis:  Low grade fever to 100.4 now that he
s off CVVH
   and now with rising WBC count.  Initial fevers may have been secondary
   to medications versus related to pulmonary embolism.  Now concerned for
   new infection giving rapidly rising WBC count and bandemia.  Low grade
   fever now that he
s off CVVH.  Aspergillus in sputum likely
   contaminant. Continued rise in LFTs/pancreatic enzymes although HIDA
   scan negative for cholecystitis. Urine cx neg.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - surveillance blood cx
   - f/u pending blood cx
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff.  Last day planned for [**8-11**] but

   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism
   - consider re-siting HD line (placed [**2143-7-26**])
   - limit medications as much as possible
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Congestive hepatopathy possible but
   increasing Tbili, alk phos, GGT suggests a cholestatic picture although
   no son[**Name (NI) 351**] e/o cholecystitis on repeat RUQ u/s and HIDA scan
   negative. Still rising with continued rise in amylase and lipase, which
   makes delayed reaction to propofol less likely.
   - continue to trend
   - CT abd/pelvis as above
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
   Altered mental status: Likely large component from toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy. Overall alertness improving with weaning of sedation,
   now s/p extubation.  CT head without acute process.  Combination of
   ativan and morphine made him [**Last Name (LF) 8601**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will avoid ativan.
   - will use morphine for pain and anxiety
   - discontinue methadone
   - continue seroquel and haldol for agitation

   - if no improvement, will consider EEG
   Acute Renal Failure: Now off CVVH  and plan for HD today or tomorrow
   - follow up renal recommendations
   - given minimal UOP, with decrease straight cath to 2x/weekly
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male presenting with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, resulting in respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has acute renal failure, C. difficile infection, and altered mental status. Other conditions include back pain, fevers/leukocytosis, elevated liver function tests, atrial flutter, anemia, and a history of pulmonary embolism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary complications: The patient's history of ARDS, multifocal pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism puts him at risk for further pulmonary complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening of ARDS.
2. Infection: The rising WBC count and bandemia suggest a possible new infection. Additionally, the patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which may require continued treatment.
3. Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure requires close monitoring, and the planned hemodialysis (HD) should be implemented as scheduled.
4. Hepatic complications: The elevated liver function tests and pancreatic enzymes indicate potential hepatic involvement. Further investigation and management are needed to determine the underlying cause.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial flutter needs to be managed with appropriate medication and rate control measures.
6. Hematologic complications: The patient's anemia requires ongoing assessment and management, considering the factors contributing to its development.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient"

   Disposition: ICU
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, resulting in respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has also been diagnosed with c. diff infection, acute renal failure, atrial flutter, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has been noted to have a segmental pulmonary embolism, which requires continuous heparin infusion. There is a risk of further clot formation or progression of the existing embolism.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has an impaired ability to protect the airway, putting him at risk for aspiration, which could lead to aspiration pneumonia.
3. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The patient has been treated with vancomycin for c. diff infection, but since the WBC count is rising, there is a possibility of recurrent infection or incomplete eradication.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a need for close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management.
5. Atrial fibrillation/flutter: The patient is in atrial flutter with rates in the 100s. There is a risk of cardiac complications such as stroke or heart failure if not properly managed.
6. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which needs to be addressed with appropriate transfusions and iron supplementation.
7. Hyperphosphatemia: Due to renal failure, the patient is at risk of hyperphosphatemia, and aluminum hydroxide has been prescribed to manage it.
8. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds, but there is a risk of malnutrition due to prolonged ICU stay and inability to eat normally.
9. Delirium: Although the patient's mental status is improving, there is still a risk of delirium due to the underlying medical conditions and medication effects.

It is important to monitor these potential complications closely and provide appropriate interventions to prevent their progression and ensure the patient's well-being."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fluid overload, and right lower lobe pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient had previously been intubated but was successfully extubated on 8/10. He presented with back pain, fevers, leukocytosis, and altered mental status. The patient also had C. difficile infection and acute renal failure, for which he was on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). He had elevated liver function tests (LFTs) with increasing bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), indicating a cholestatic pattern. The patient's condition improved with the use of fentanyl boluses and a lidocaine patch for back pain. The patient's fever and leukocytosis were initially attributed to medications or PE, but now there is concern for a new infection. Aspergillus species were found in the sputum, but considered a contaminant. The patient will continue on vancomycin for C. difficile infection. The patient's atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter is being managed with beta blockers. The patient has anemia and will be monitored closely, with a transfusion threshold of less than 21. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through tube"

The patient's altered mental status and severe NM weakness are attributed to uremia and ICU neuropathy. The plan includes stopping morphine and seroquel, using PRN haldol and morphine sparingly, initiating HD today, considering long-term HD access, and continuing PO Vanc.

   I have seen and examined Mr [**Known lastname 3002**] and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 691**]
s note reflects my
   thoughts. He is more awake today but severely debilitated and
   profoundly weak after his long illness with ARDS. He will need IR
   guided placement of his HD line and optimization of nutritional
   support. We will check a CPK and possible EMG/ NCS if his weakness does
   not improve over the next few days with HD. I suspect his recovery will
   be long and protracted given his current clinical exam.  He will need
   ICU level care for now till respiratory status has improved
   significantly. We will minimize sedation even during procedures and
   daily care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, now with respiratory failure caused by ARDS, PE, ARF, and C. difficile infection. The patient initially presented with acute pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status (not delirium), airway inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough), atrial flutter (AFLUTTER), pulmonary embolism (PE), acute renal failure (ARF), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's current condition includes being extubated and stable on FiO2 36%. He has leukocytosis, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), elevated triglycerides likely due to propofol, and new elevations in amylase and lipase. The patient also has altered mental status/severe NM weakness, uremic symptoms, and ICU neuropathy. He requires long-term dialysis access due to acute renal failure.

Additionally, the patient has C. difficile colitis with 2L stool output yesterday and is currently being treated with PO vancomycin. The patient's nutrition is being managed with Nutren 2.0 at 45 mL/hour, and he will receive a nutrition consult.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may lead to continued respiratory failure if not properly"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Respiratory distress with vagal episodes
   likely secondary to crusting of ETT; resolved with tube change. Mental
   status improving and extubated successfully [**8-10**]. [**8-9**] sputum cx with
   sparse OP growth and sparse yeast/aspergillis.
   - off antibiotics for pneumonia.
   - wean face mask as tolerated
   - Off CVVH with plan for HD today
   - cont heparin gtt for segmental pulmonary embolism
   - hold on tracheostomy for now
   Back Pain:  Unclear etiology.  Appears musculoskeletal.  Likely from
   immobilization.  Improved initially with Fentanyl boluses and lidocaine
   patch.   Was given morphine and ativan but this made him [**Month/Day (4) 8601**].  Now
   just on morphine for pain
   - continue lidocaine patch
   - low dose morphine for pain
   Fevers/leukocytosis:  Low grade fever to 100.4 now that he
s off CVVH
   with rising WBC count over past 48 hours now trending down.  Initial
   fevers may have been secondary to medications versus related to
   pulmonary embolism.  Low grade fever now that he
s off CVVH.
   Aspergillus in sputum likely contaminant. Continued rise in
   LFTs/pancreatic enzymes although HIDA scan negative for cholecystitis.
   Urine cx neg.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - surveillance blood cx
   - f/u pending blood cx
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff.  Last day planned for [**8-11**] but
   given rising leukocytosis, colonic inflammation on CT, and increased
   stool output will continue for now
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism
   - will resite HD line (placed [**2143-7-26**])
   - limit medications as much as possible
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Slowly trending down.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been
   related to cholestatic medications.  No son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of
   cholecytsitis.  Ct abdomen and pelvis without clear etiology.
   - continue to trend
   - f/u final read of CT abd/pelvis
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
   Altered mental status: Likely large component from toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy. Overall alertness improving with weaning of sedation,
   now s/p extubation.  CT head without acute process.  Combination of
   ativan and morphine made him [**Last Name (LF) 8601**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will avoid ativan.
   - will use fentanyl alone for pain and anxiety
   - will discontinue seroquel and haldol
   - cont to monitor for improvement
   - if no improvement, will consider EEG
   Acute Renal Failure: Now off CVVH  and plan for HD today.
   - follow up renal recommendations
   - given minimal UOP, with decrease straight cath to 2x/weekly
   - will start aluminum hydroxide for hyperphophatemia
   - plan for HD today.
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**]) but will continue given rising WBC count
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Cont to be in aflutter with rates
   in 100s.
   - continue beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on
   HD.
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of pneumonia secondary to influenza A, which has progressed to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He is currently intubated and on invasive ventilation. The patient's mental status has improved, and he was successfully extubated. He has a fever and leukocytosis, but the source of these symptoms is unclear. The patient also has elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and pancreatic enzymes, but a HIDA scan was negative for cholecystitis. He has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis and is being treated with oral vancomycin. The patient's renal function has improved, and he will be starting hemodialysis today. He has atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter and anemia, which is likely due to chronic illness and iron deficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A has progressed to respiratory failure. He required intubation and invasive ventilation due to severe hypoxic respiratory distress. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's condition has been complicated by ARDS, which is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can lead to decreased oxygenation and respiratory failure.
3. Infection: The patient has shown signs of infection, including fever and leukocytosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient required intubation and invasive ventilation due to tachypnea and hypoxic respiratory distress. An arterial line was placed for hemodynamic monitoring, and the patient was started on high-dose heparin.

The patient's allergies include zosyn (piperacillin sodium/tazobactam) and ativan (lorazepam). The patient has a history of rashes and fever associated with these allergies.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.0°F, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/46 mmHg to 81/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever and the need for re-intubation. The patient's physical examination reveals bronchial breath sounds, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and vesicles over the left buttock. Neurologically, the patient moves extremities spontaneously, is alert, and follows simple commands with partly intelligible speech.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal sodium and potassium levels, elevated creatinine, low albumin, and elevated lactate levels. Radiology images are not provided in"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Had respiratory distress relieved by ETT
   change and subsequently extubated [**8-10**] but required reintubation
   yesterday for tachypnea and hypoxemic resp distress; may be [**3-11**] to
   mucous plugging in the setting of profound weakness. Repeat XRAY
   unchanged from priors.  ET tube in good position.  Sputum sample
   yesterday contaminated.   Currently on [**6-11**] at 40% FiO2 with repeat ABG
   improving. Unclear what precipitated this event.
   - Currently on vanc/meropenem (plan on 8 day course of ventilator
   associated pneumonia versus HAP)
   - On versed and fentanyl for sedation; wean down as tolerated
   - will continue to reassess need for trach and PEG, currently on
   schedule for tomorrow
   - Cont heparin gtt for segmental pilmonary embolism
 will need to hold
   in AM for planned procedure
   Hypotension/Shock: Concern for sepsis given fever to 102; now stable of
   vanc and [**Last Name (un) 614**]. Hypovolemia possible in setting of volume shifts with
   HD, may have been exacerbated by sedation needed for reintubation,
   reponded to fluid boluses.
   - Cont vanc and [**Last Name (un) 614**] pending further micro data (if negative will plan
   for 8 day course for VAP vs. HAP)
   - Discuss restarting CVVH with Renal with goal net even
   - Fluid boluses or levophed prn to maintain goal MAP >55
   Fevers:  Previous sources include C. diff, medications, PE. New fever
   to 102 which may have been masked past few days by CVVH. Pan-scan
   unremarkable. Micro only with sparse Aspergillus in sputum, likely
   colonizer. LFTs/pancreatic enzymes stable to improved with neg HIDA
   scan. Urine cx neg.
   - vanc and meropenem pending further micro data
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff for now as restarted on broad
   antibiotics
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism
   - plan to resite HD line (placed [**2143-7-26**])
   - limit medications as much as possible
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Bump in Tbili today but otherwise slowly
   trending down.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been related to cholestatic medications.  No
   son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of cholecytsitis.  CT abdomen and pelvis without
   clear etiology. Does have subcentimeter post right hepatic lobe
   hypodensity thought to be hemangioma on prior imaging.
   - continue to trend
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**]) but will continue given restarting of broad abx
   Altered mental status: Likely large component from toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy. Overall alertness improved with weaning of sedation CT
   head without acute process. Now s/p reintubation and sedated.
   - On versed and fentanyl; wean down as tolerated (able to wean off
   propofol overnight)
   - Consider EEG if no improvement noted over time off sedatives
   Weakness: [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to critical illness myopathy versus central
   process.
   - EMG to evaluate
   Back Pain:  Unclear etiology.  Appears musculoskeletal.  Likely from
   immobilization.  Improved initially with Fentanyl boluses and lidocaine
   patch.   Was given morphine and ativan but this made him apneic.
   - continue lidocaine patch
   - currently on fentanyl gtt
   Acute Renal Failure: Now off CVVH  and plan for HD today.
   - discuss restarting CVVH with Renal
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   - aluminum hydroxide for hyperphophatemia
   - unable to pursue tunneled line today because of new fevers, will
   continue to monitor cultures
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Aflutter with rates in 100s.
   - holding beta blocker for now given hypotension
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on
   HD.
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements

   residual infection.
   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Had respiratory distress relieved by ETT
   change and subsequently extubated [**8-10**] but required reintubation
   yesterday for tachypnea and hypoxemic resp distress; may be [**3-11**] to
   myopathy. 3 sputum cx with sparse OP growth and sparse
   yeast/aspergillis with improved appearance of CT chest.
   - Currently on vanc/meropenem
   - EMG to evaluate weakness
   - On versed, propofol, and fentanyl for sedation; wean down as
   tolerated
   - Plan for IP placed trach/PEG tomorrow
   - Cont heparin gtt for segmental pilmonary embolism
   Hypotension/Shock: Concern for sepsis given fever to 102; now stable of
   vanc and [**Last Name (un) 614**]. Hypovolemia possible in setting of volume shifts with
   HD, may have been exacerbated by sedation needed for reintubation,
   reponded to fluid boluses.
   - Cont vanc and [**Last Name (un) 614**] pending further micro data
   - Discuss restarting CVVH with Renal with goal net even
   - Fluid boluses or levophed prn to maintain goal MAP >55
   Fevers:  Previous sources include C. diff, medications, PE. New fever
   to 102 which may have been masked past few days by CVVH. Pan-scan
   unremarkable. Micro only with sparse Aspergillus in sputum, likely
   colonizer. LFTs/pancreatic enzymes stable to improved with neg HIDA
   scan. Urine cx neg.
   - vanc and meropenem pending further micro data
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff for now as restarted on broad
   antibiotics
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - continue heparin gtt for pulmonary embolism
   - plan to resite HD line (placed [**2143-7-26**])
   - limit medications as much as possible
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Bump in Tbili today but otherwise slowly
   trending down.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been related to cholestatic medications.  No
   son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of cholecytsitis.  CT abdomen and pelvis without
   clear etiology. Does have subcentimeter post right hepatic lobe
   hypodensity thought to be hemangioma on prior imaging.
   - continue to trend
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin for plan 14 day course (last dose
   [**2143-8-11**]) but will continue given restarting of broad abx
   Altered mental status: Likely large component from toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy. Overall alertness improved with weaning of sedation CT
   head without acute process. Now s/p reintubation and sedated.
   - On versed, propofol, and fentanyl; wean down as tolerated (propofol
   first)
   - Consider EEG if no improvement noted over time off sedatives
   - Avoid ativan and morphine as apneic on these
   - Seroquel and haldol discontinued
   # Weakness: [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to critical illness myopathy versus
   central process.
   - EMG to evaluate
   Back Pain:  Unclear etiology.  Appears musculoskeletal.  Likely from
   immobilization.  Improved initially with Fentanyl boluses and lidocaine
   patch.   Was given morphine and ativan but this made him apneic.
   - continue lidocaine patch
   - currently on fentanyl gtt
   Acute Renal Failure: Now off CVVH  and plan for HD today.
   - discuss restarting CVVH with Renal
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   - aluminum hydroxide for hyperphophatemia
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Aflutter with rates in 100s.
   - continue beta blocker and titrate up as tolerated
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on
   HD.
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 65-year-old male presenting with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, which has progressed to respiratory failure complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fluid overload, and right lower lobe pulmonary embolism. The patient had respiratory distress relieved by endotracheal tube (ETT) change and subsequently extubated on [**8-10**] but required reintubation yesterday for tachypnea and hypoxic respiratory distress. The patient also has fever to 102.0, altered mental status, profound weakness, hypotension, and an elevated lactate level of 3.3. 

The patient's medical history is significant for recent hospitalization for community-acquired pneumonia, where he was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and subsequently developed Clostridium difficile colitis. He has been on vancomycin for C. difficile colitis but will continue given the restarting of broad antibiotics. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.3 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 46 mg/dL, creatinine of 3.0 mg/dL, hypoalbuminemia with albumin at 2.7 g/dL, and hyponatremia with sodium at 134 mg/dL. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.1°F, blood pressure ranging from 96/46 mmHg to "

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia, respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, acute kidney injury, and Clostridium difficile infection. He was initially extubated but had to be reintubated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 450 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set of 28, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and SpO2 of 99%. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C (102.5°F), heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 92/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a history of allergies to Zosyn and Ativan. His current medications include midazolam, heparin, fentanyl, meropenem, lansoprazole, and others. The patient's recent lab results show elevated WBC count, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes, while his hemoglobin and platelet count are within normal limits. Imaging shows elevated right hemidiaphragm and bilateral perihilar infiltrates on chest X-ray, as well as slow resolution of panlobar interstitial changes on CT scan. Microbiology tests are pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, who is now experiencing respiratory failure due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Pulmonary Embolism (PE), Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient was initially extubated but had to be reintubated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure and work of breathing. The current plan includes covering with vancomycin and meropenem empiric antibiotics for Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) versus Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia (HAP), considering a tracheostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to prolonged ventilator dependence and tenuous status, continuing heparin gtt for right lower lobe segmental PE, and monitoring for resolution of transaminitis, altered mental status, renal failure, and C. diff colitis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C (102°F), heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 92/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now experiencing respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been intubated multiple times and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has a complicated medical history including hypotension, shock, fevers, altered mental status, weakness, back pain, anion gap metabolic acidosis, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), Clostridium difficile colitis, subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE), atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, anemia, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient has shown signs of hypotension and shock, which could indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of various infections including pneumonia, C. difficile colitis, and a yeast infection in the urine culture. These infections should be closely monitored and treated appropriately.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient has elevated LFTs, which may be due to cholestatic medications or underlying liver disease. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
5. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been started"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now presenting with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient initially required endotracheal intubation but experienced tachypnea and hypoxic respiratory distress, necessitating reintubation. The patient is currently on a ventilator with 40% FiO2 and showing signs of improvement. The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypotension, fever, elevated liver function tests, Clostridium difficile colitis, altered mental status, weakness, back pain, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness can lead to stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract.
4. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's history of hypotension and altered mental status may indicate septic shock.
5. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient's recent antibiotic use and the presence of fever and diarrhea suggest an infection with Clostridium difficile.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate renal dysfunction.

   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Had respiratory distress relieved by ETT
   change and subsequently extubated [**8-10**] but required reintubation [**2143-8-11**]
   for tachypnea and hypoxemic resp distress; may be [**3-11**] to mucous
   plugging in the setting of profound weakness. Repeat XRAY unchanged
   from priors.  ET tube in good position.  Sputum sample without
   microorganisms.   Currently on [**6-11**] at 40% FiO2 with repeat ABG
   improving. Unclear what precipitated this event.
   - Currently on vanc/meropenem (plan on 8 day course to end on [**2143-8-19**]
   for ventilator associated pneumonia versus HAP)
   - On versed and fentanyl for sedation; wean down as tolerated
   - scheduled for trach/PEG today
   - Hold heparin gtt for falling Hct and plan for trach/PEG.
   Hypotension/Shock: Concern for sepsis given fever to 102; now stable of
   vanc and [**Last Name (un) 614**]. Hypovolemia possible in setting of volume shifts with HD
   but has receive a fair amount of IVF, may have been exacerbated by
   sedation needed for reintubation. Has remained off pressors.
   - Cont vanc and [**Last Name (un) 614**] pending further micro data (if negative will plan
   for 8 day course for VAP vs. HAP)
   - Discuss restarting CVVH with Renal with goal net even
   - Fluid boluses or levophed prn to maintain goal MAP >55
   Fevers:  Previous sources include C. diff, medications, PE. New fever
   to 102 which may have been masked past few days by CVVH. Pan-scan
   unremarkable. Micro only with sparse Aspergillus in sputum, likely
   colonizer. LFTs/pancreatic enzymes stable to improved with neg HIDA
   scan. Urine cx neg.
   - vanc and meropenem pending further micro data
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff for now as restarted on broad
   antibiotics
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - plan to resite HD line (placed [**2143-7-26**]) when he is afebrile for > 48
   hr
   - limit medications as much as possible
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source. Bump in Tbili today but otherwise slowly
   trending down.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been related to cholestatic medications.  No
   son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of cholecytsitis.  CT abdomen and pelvis without
   clear etiology. Does have subcentimeter post right hepatic lobe
   hypodensity thought to be hemangioma on prior imaging.
   - continue to trend
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin since [**2143-7-28**]
   - will continue given restarting of broad abx
   Sub-segmental PE: noted on CT Chest on [**8-4**].
   - heparin gtt currently on hold for procedure and for falling Hct in
   setting of grossly guaiac positive stool.
   Altered mental status: Likely large component from toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy. Overall alertness improved with weaning of sedation CT
   head without acute process. Now s/p reintubation and sedated.
   - On versed and fentanyl; wean down as tolerated
   - Consider EEG if no improvement noted over time off sedatives
   Weakness: [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to critical illness myopathy versus central
   process.  EMG prelim read without clear evidence for ICU neuropathy but
   limited by positioning/cooperation
   - f/u EMG final read
   Back Pain:  Unclear etiology.  Appears musculoskeletal.  Likely from
   immobilization.  Improved initially with Fentanyl boluses and lidocaine
   patch.   Was given morphine and ativan but this made him apneic.
   - continue lidocaine patch
   - currently on fentanyl gtt
   Acute Renal Failure: Now off CVVH  and plan for HD today.
   - discuss restarting CVVH with Renal
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   - aluminum hydroxide for hyperphophatemia
   - unable to pursue tunneled line today because of new fevers, will
   continue to monitor cultures
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Aflutter with rates in 100s.
   - holding beta blocker for now given hypotension
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on
   HD.
   - transfusion threshold <21

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, resulting in respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He also has pulmonary embolism (PE), acute kidney injury (ARF), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient was initially extubated but reintubated due to hypoxemic respiratory failure and presumed new sepsis, possibly due to a new pulmonary infection. He is currently being covered with vancomycin, cefepime, and tobramycin empirically for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's renal function is impaired with hyperkalemia and progressive anion gap metabolic acidosis. He received hemodialysis (HD) today and needs re-siting of the HD line with a more permanent line once fevers resolve. The patient also has transaminitis, which is now resolving without a clear source. His mental status is altered, and he is on long-term oral vancomycin for a prior C. diff infection. Other issues include an upcoming tracheostomy/ percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism, and altered mental status. The patient's care involves nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers,"

   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Had respiratory distress relieved by ETT
   change and subsequently extubated [**8-10**] but required reintubation [**2143-8-11**]
   for tachypnea and hypoxemic resp distress; may be [**3-11**] to mucous
   plugging in the setting of profound weakness. Repeat XRAY unchanged
   from priors.  ET tube in good position.  Sputum sample without
   microorganisms.   Currently on [**6-11**] at 40% FiO2 with repeat ABG
   improving. Unclear what precipitated this event.
   - Currently on vanc, tobramycin, cefepime (plan on 8 day course to end
   on [**2143-8-19**] for ventilator associated pneumonia versus HAP)
   - tobramycin and vanc levels today given starting CVVH
   - On versed and fentanyl for sedation; wean down as tolerated
   - scheduled for trach/PEG today
   - Hold heparin gtt for falling Hct and plan for trach/PEG.
   Hypotension/Shock: Improved.  Likely related to infection versus
   medication related in the setting of intubation.
   - Cont vanc, tobramycin, cefepime pending further micro data (if
   negative will plan for 8 day course for VAP vs. HAP)
   - Will restart CVVH with net goal even
   Fevers:  Afebrile overnight.  Previous sources include C. diff,
   medications, PE. New fever to 102 which may have been masked past few
   days by CVVH. Pan-scan unremarkable. Micro only with sparse Aspergillus
   in sputum, likely colonizer. LFTs/pancreatic enzymes stable to improved
   with neg HIDA scan. Urine cx neg.
   - vanc, tobramycin, cefepime per infectious disease pending further
   micro data
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff for now as restarted on broad
   antibiotics
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - plan to resite HD line (placed [**2143-7-26**]) when he is afebrile for > 48
   hr
   - limit medications as much as possible
   Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis:  Likely related to uremia.
   - CVVH today
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source.   Slowly trending down.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been
   related to cholestatic medications.  No son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of
   cholecytsitis.  CT abdomen and pelvis without clear etiology. Does have
   subcentimeter post right hepatic lobe hypodensity thought to be
   hemangioma on prior imaging.
   - continue to trend
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible

   - will continue given restarting of broad abx
   Sub-segmental PE: noted on CT Chest on [**8-4**].
   - heparin gtt currently on hold for procedure and for falling Hct in
   setting of grossly guaiac positive stool.
   - will recheck hct now
   Altered mental status: Likely large component from toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy. Overall alertness improved with weaning of sedation CT
   head without acute process. Now s/p reintubation and sedated.
   - On versed and fentanyl; wean down as tolerated
   - Consider EEG if no improvement noted over time off sedatives
   Weakness: [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to critical illness myopathy versus central
   process.  EMG prelim read without clear evidence for ICU neuropathy but
   limited by positioning/cooperation
   - f/u EMG final read
   Back Pain:  Unclear etiology.  Appears musculoskeletal.  Likely from
   immobilization.  Improved initially with Fentanyl boluses and lidocaine
   patch.   Was given morphine and ativan but this made him apneic.
   - continue lidocaine patch
   - currently on fentanyl gtt
   Acute Renal Failure: Will restart CVVH today.
   - plan to restart CVVH today
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   - two more doses of aluminum hydroxide today for hyperphophatemia
   - increase sevalamer to 1600 mg TID w/meals
   - unable to pursue tunneled line today because of new fevers, will
   continue to monitor cultures
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Aflutter with rates in 100s.
   - holding beta blocker for now given hypotension
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on
   HD.  Received one unit on [**2143-8-14**] with appropriate hematocrit bump.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia, initially caused by influenza A, which has progressed to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient required reintubation due to tachypnea and hypoxemic respiratory distress, possibly due to mucus plugging in the setting of profound weakness. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and showing improvement in ABG results. 

The patient has several medical complications, including acute pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status (not delirium), inability to protect airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex), atrial flutter, pulmonary embolism (PE), Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), and acute renal failure. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: Secondary to influenza A, ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. The patient's respiratory distress was relieved by ETT change and subsequent extubation but required reintubation for tachypnea and hypoxemic respiratory distress. Repeat XRAY unchanged from priors. The patient is currently on vancomycin, tobramycin, and cefepime for ventilator-associated pneumonia versus hospital-acquired pneumonia.

2. Hypotension/Shock: Improved. Likely related to infection versus medication-related in the setting of intubation.

3. Fevers: Afe"

   renal function will discontinue tobramycin.
   - vanc levels given CVVH
   - now off sedation
   - re-started heparin gtt for PE.
   Hypotension/Shock: Improved.  Likely related to infection versus
   medication related in the setting of intubation.

   - Continue CVVH with net goal even
   Fevers:  Afebrile overnight.  Previous sources include C. diff,

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now with respiratory failure due to ARDS. He has been intubated multiple times and has undergone tracheostomy and PEG tube placement. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, and his oxygenation is maintained with 40% FiO2. He has been diagnosed with various complications including acute pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, airway protection issues, atrial flutter, pulmonary embolism, C. difficile infection, renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient has been treated for C. difficile colitis and is still on vancomycin, which increases the risk of recurrence.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and further deterioration could be life-threatening.
5. ARDS: The patient's condition may worsen, leading to progressive respiratory failure and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
6. Pressure ulcers: P"

   -needs re-siting HD line with a more permanent line once fevers
   resolved; will ask IR to re-address tomorrow
   -touch base w/ Renal about transitioning to HD if hemodynamically
   stable
   Transaminitis- now resolving and without a clear source. Were
   considering propofol gtt as a cause and this is now held
   -[**8-11**] CT torso unremarkable
   -continue to trend
   A flutter/ fib- cautious resumption of metoprolol
   Altered mental status- minimize sedatives and monitor
   -may need EEG if still not clearing
   Cdiff colitis- does not appear to be a current active infection but on
   long-term po vancomycin for prior infection.
   Disposition- as we plan for a LTAC or rehab, we would like to come up
   with a pain/ anxiety regimen that is noninvasive, and transition to
   intermit HD. Will involve SW/ Case Mgmt as well.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure due to ARDS, PE, and renal failure. The patient underwent tracheostomy and PEG on 08/14. He is currently tolerating the tracheostomy mask and is being covered with vancomycin and cefepime empirically for VAP or HAP. The patient also has a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism and chronic colonization with Aspergillus.

The patient has fevers, likely secondary to CVVH, and is awaiting fungal isolators and broad culture results. Renal failure with hyperkalemia and progressive anion gap metabolic acidosis has been diagnosed, and the patient received hemodialysis today. The cause of transaminitis is unclear, but propofol infusion was considered and held.

The patient also has atrial flutter/fibrillation and altered mental status. He is currently on long-term po vancomycin for a prior C. diff infection. Disposition planning includes LTAC or rehab, with a focus on pain/anxiety management and transitioning to intermittent hemodialysis.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale and insulin infusion, and various lines such as a PICC line, dialysis catheter, arterial line, and a recent 18-gauge tracheostomy tube placement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, respiratory failure, ARDS, PE, ARF, and C. diff infection. He presented initially with hypoxemic respiratory failure and required reintubation for work of breathing. He also has fevers, renal failure, hyperkalemia, progressive anion gap metabolic acidosis, transaminitis, altered mental status, and a history of C. diff colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to his prolonged mechanical ventilation. Empiric antibiotics covering VAP and HAP have been started.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has an inferior vena cava filter in place due to a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin has been initiated, and plans are to transition to warfarin soon.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and hyperkalemia. Hemodialysis (HD) has been initiated, and further management will involve re-siting the HD line with a more permanent line once fevers resolve.
4. Fungal infection: The patient is chronically colonized with Aspergillus, and fungal blood cultures are pending.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Had respiratory distress relieved by ETT
   change and subsequently extubated [**8-10**] but required reintubation [**2143-8-11**]
   for tachypnea and hypoxemic resp distress; may be [**3-11**] to mucous
   plugging in the setting of profound weakness.  Sputum sample without
   microorganisms.   Currently on [**6-11**] at 40% FiO2 with repeat ABG
   improving. Unclear what precipitated this event.  Trached and PEG on
   [**2143-8-14**].
   - Currently on vanc, cefepime (plan on 8 day course to end on [**2143-8-19**]
   for ventilator associated pneumonia versus HAP).  Given renal function
   discontinued tobramycin.
   - vanc levels given CVVH
   - now off sedation
   - re-started heparin gtt for PE.
   Hypotension/Shock: Improved.  Likely related to infection versus
   medication related in the setting of intubation.
   - Cont vanc, cefepime pending further micro data (if negative will plan
   for 8 day course for VAP vs. HAP)
   - Continue CVVH with net goal even
   Fevers:  Afebrile overnight.  Previous sources include C. diff,
   medications, PE. Pan-scan unremarkable. Micro only with sparse
   Aspergillus in sputum, likely colonizer. LFTs/pancreatic enzymes stable
   to improved with neg HIDA scan. Urine cx neg.
   - vanc, cefepime for treatment of hospital acquired pneumonia
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff for now as restarted on broad
   antibiotics
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - plan to resite HD line (placed [**2143-7-26**]) when he is afebrile for > 48
   hr
   - limit medications as much as possible
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source.   Slowly trending down.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been
   related to cholestatic medications.  No son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of
   cholecytsitis.  CT abdomen and pelvis without clear etiology. Does have
   subcentimeter post right hepatic lobe hypodensity thought to be
   hemangioma on prior imaging.
   - continue to trend
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin since [**2143-7-28**]
   - continue until broad spectrum abx are completed.
   Sub-segmental PE: noted on CT Chest on [**8-4**].
   - heparin gtt.
   - monitor daily Hct
   Altered mental status: Likely large component from toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy. Overall alertness improved with weaning of sedation CT
   head without acute process. Now s/p Trach/PEG and sedated.
   - now off sedation, will reassess mental status as sedation clears
   - Consider EEG if no improvement noted over time off sedatives
   Weakness: [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to critical illness myopathy versus central
   process.  EMG suggests critical illness polyneuropathy is unlikely. Now
   consider deconditioning vs. medication induced.
   - continue to monitor
   Acute Renal Failure: Restarted on CVVH on [**2143-8-14**]. Was given aluminum
   hydroxide for hyperphophatemia
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   - Continue sevalamer to 1600 mg TID w/meals
   - tunneled dialysis catheter when afebrile >48hrs
   - continue aluminum hydroxide x 6 more doses
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Aflutter with rates in 100s.
   - will restart low dose beta blocker (metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**])
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on
   HD.  Received one unit on [**2143-8-14**] with appropriate hematocrit bump.
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Had respiratory distress relieved by ETT
   change and subsequently extubated [**8-10**] but required reintubation [**2143-8-11**]
   for tachypnea and hypoxemic resp distress [**3-11**] enterobacter pneumonia.
   Now on trach.
   - Cont vanc (dosed by level) and cefepime  with plan for 8 day course
   to end on [**2143-8-19**] for VAP v. HAP
   - F/u sputum culture sensitivities, pending micro
   - now off sedation
   - cont heparin gtt for PE
   Hypotension/Shock: Improved.  Likely related to infection versus
   medication related in the setting of intubation.
   - Cont vanc, cefepime pending further micro data (if negative will plan
   for 8 day course for VAP vs. HAP)
   - Continue CVVH with net goal even
   Fevers:  Afebrile overnight.  Previous sources include C. diff,
   medications, PE. Pan-scan unremarkable. Micro only with sparse
   Aspergillus in sputum, likely colonizer. LFTs/pancreatic enzymes stable
   to improved with neg HIDA scan. Urine cx neg.
   - vanc/cefepime for treatment of VAP v. HAP
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff for now as restarted on broad
   antibiotics
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - plan to resite HD line (placed [**2143-7-26**]), hopefully today
   - limit medications as much as possible
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin since [**2143-7-28**]
   - continue until broad spectrum abx are completed.
   Acute Renal Failure: Restarted on CVVH on [**2143-8-14**]. Was given aluminum
   hydroxide for hyperphophatemia
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   - continue sevalamer to 1600 mg TID w/meals
   - likely tunneled dialysis catheter today as afebrile >48hrs
   - f/u renal recs
   Sub-segmental PE: noted on CT Chest on [**8-4**].
   - heparin gtt with plan to start coumadin after HD line placed
   - monitor daily Hct
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Aflutter with rates in 100s.
   - treating pain with fentanyl boluses
   - uptitrate beta blocker (metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**]) prn
   Pain: Unclear but apears to be complaining of back pain, likely
   musculoskeletal
   - cont fentanyl boluses for now
   - reassess more long-term needs after 24-48 hours
   Altered mental status: Likely large component from toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy. Overall alertness improved with weaning of sedation CT
   head without acute process. Now s/p Trach/PEG.
   - cont to monitor neuro status
   - ativan prn to regulate sleep/wake cycle; may need to be placed on
   vent overnight
   Weakness:  EMG suggests critical illness polyneuropathy is unlikely.
   Likely [**3-11**] deconditioning vs. medication induced.
   - continue to monitor
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on
   HD.  Received one unit on [**2143-8-14**] with appropriate hematocrit bump.
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source.   Slowly trending down.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been
   related to cholestatic medications.  No son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of
   cholecytsitis.  CT abdomen and pelvis without clear etiology. Does have
   subcentimeter post right hepatic lobe hypodensity thought to be
   hemangioma on prior imaging.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of pneumonia secondary to influenza A, respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fluid overload, and right lower lobe pulmonary embolism (PE). He has been intubated multiple times and currently has a tracheostomy in place. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) versus hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He also has a history of Clostridium difficile colitis, acute renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH), and sub-segmental PE treated with heparin. The patient is being evaluated for placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter and has an upcoming procedure to replace his central venous catheter. His recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolytes. The patient's mental status is altered likely due to metabolic encephalopathy, and he is at risk for blood clots and infections. He requires close monitoring of his vital signs, fluid balance, and daily weight. The patient's pain is managed with fentanyl boluses, and he is being weaned off sedation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being treated with antibiotics and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing some complications such as atrial flutter, renal failure, and impaired skin integrity. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's immobility and prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of blood clots, which can lead to DVT.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): A potential complication of DVT, PE can occur if a blood clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
4. Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of ARDS increase the risk of sepsis, especially if there is a hospital-acquired infection.
5. Acute Respiratory Failure: Weaning off mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to the patient's underlying lung condition.
6. Delirium: Prolonged sedation and ICU stay can contribute to delirium, which may impact the patient's mental status.
7. Pressure Ulcers: Immobility and impaired skin integrity can lead to pressure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He is currently receiving multiple antibiotics, including tobramycin, vancomycin, and cefepime. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 160/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on the ventilator. The patient is sedated and unresponsive to commands. His extremities show trace edema bilaterally. Neurologically, the patient moves extremities spontaneously but follows commands intermittently. The patient has a tracheostomy in place and a PEG tube. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Potential complications that could arise include pulmonary embolism, C. difficile infection, renal failure, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's nutritional status is of concern, and efforts are being made to improve it. The patient is currently on renal replacement therapy and is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and he is being cared for in the ICU."

   - Currently on vanc, tobramycin, cefepime (plan on 8 day course to end
   on [**2143-8-19**] for ventilator associated pneumonia versus HAP).  Given
   renal function will discontinue tobramycin.
   - vanc levels given CVVH
   - now off sedation
   - re-started heparin gtt for PE.
   Hypotension/Shock: Improved.  Likely related to infection versus
   medication related in the setting of intubation.
   - Cont vanc, tobramycin, cefepime pending further micro data (if
   negative will plan for 8 day course for VAP vs. HAP)
   - Continue CVVH with net goal even
   Fevers:  Afebrile overnight.  Previous sources include C. diff,
   medications, PE. New fever to 102 which may have been masked past few
   days by CVVH. Pan-scan unremarkable. Micro only with sparse Aspergillus
   in sputum, likely colonizer. LFTs/pancreatic enzymes stable to improved
   with neg HIDA scan. Urine cx neg.
   - vanc, cefepime for treatment of hospital acquired pneumonia
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff for now as restarted on broad
   antibiotics
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - plan to resite HD line (placed [**2143-7-26**]) when he is afebrile for > 48
   hr
   - limit medications as much as possible
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source.   Slowly trending down.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been
   related to cholestatic medications.  No son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of
   cholecytsitis.  CT abdomen and pelvis without clear etiology. Does have
   subcentimeter post right hepatic lobe hypodensity thought to be
   hemangioma on prior imaging.
   - continue to trend
   - limit medications that cause cholestasis as much as possible
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin since [**2143-7-28**]
   - continue until broad spectrum abx are completed.
   Sub-segmental PE: noted on CT Chest on [**8-4**].
   - Restarted heparin gtt.
   - monitor daily Hct
   Altered mental status: Likely large component from toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy. Overall alertness improved with weaning of sedation CT
   head without acute process. Now s/p Trach/PEG and sedated.
   - now off sedation, will reassess mental status as sedation clears
   - Consider EEG if no improvement noted over time off sedatives
   Weakness: [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to critical illness myopathy versus central
   process.  EMG suggests critical illness polyneuropathy is unlikely. Now
   consider deconditioning vs. medication induced.
   - continue to monitor
   Acute Renal Failure: Restarted on CVVH on [**2143-8-14**]. Was given aluminum
   hydroxide for hyperphophatemia
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   - Continue sevalamer to 1600 mg TID w/meals
   - tunneled dialysis catheter when afebrile >48hrs
   - continue aluminum hydroxide x 6 more doses
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Aflutter with rates in 100s.
   - will restart low dose beta blocker (metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**])
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on
   HD.  Received one unit on [**2143-8-14**] with appropriate hematocrit bump.
   - transfusion threshold <21

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of pneumonia secondary to influenza A and subsequent respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient had episodes of hypoxemic respiratory distress, leading to reintubation. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy in place.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.5°C (99.5°F)
- Heart rate: 108 bpm (with fluctuations)
- Blood pressure: 160/67 mmHg (with fluctuations)
- Respiratory rate: 31 breaths per minute (with fluctuations)
- Oxygen saturation: 99% on 40% FiO2

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) with elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin (Tbili). The patient also has anemia with a hematocrit of 24.0%.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including multifocal pneumonia, ARDS, fluid overload, right lower lobe pulmonary embolism (PE), and possible mucous plugging. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc, tobramycin, cefepime) for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) versus hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male presenting with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, leading to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism (PE), acute kidney injury (ARF), and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient was initially extubated but reintubated due to work of breathing and hypoxemia. A tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were performed on [**8-14**]. The patient tolerates a tracheostomy mask and is being covered with vancomycin and cefepime empiric course for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) versus healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP); vancomycin levels will be followed. Cultures are pending, and the patient is chronically colonized with Aspergillus. Heparin gtt is administered for right lower lobe segmental PE, and the patient will transition to coumadin in the next few days once hemodialysis (HD) catheter re-siting is done.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has already been reintubated due to work of breathing and hypoxemia. Continuous monitoring and appropriate ventilation support will be required.
2. Sepsis or new infection: The patient is presumed to have either sepsis or a new infection. Cultures are pending, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, which has progressed to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism (PE), acute kidney injury (ARF), and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient was initially extubated on [8-10] but required reintubation on [8-12] due to hypoxemic respiratory failure. A tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were performed on [8-14]. The patient is now tolerating a tracheostomy mask but continues to be monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition may deteriorate further if oxygenation does not improve, leading to worsening respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis or New Infection: The patient's fevers may indicate a new infection or sepsis, which could complicate the clinical picture and require adjustments to the treatment plan.
3. Chronic Colonization with Aspergillus: The patient's chronic colonization with Aspergillus may increase the risk of invasive fungal infections, particularly if his immune system remains compromised.
4. Right Lower Lobe Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's right lower lobe pulmonary embolism may progress or lead to further complications such as pulmonary hypertension or right heart strain.
5. Renal Failure with Hyper"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of pneumonia secondary to influenza A, which has progressed to respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fluid overload, right lower lobe pulmonary embolism (PE), and endotracheal tube crusting. The patient was initially extubated but reintubated for hypoxemic respiratory distress in the setting of enterobacter pneumonia (ventilator-associated pneumonia or VAP versus healthcare-associated pneumonia).

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, resolved likely related to infection versus medication-related in the setting of sedation. He is being treated for VAP or HAP with vancomycin and cefepime, pending further microbiological data. The patient also has C. difficile colitis, for which he is receiving oral vancomycin, which will be continued until 14 days post-completion of the antibiotic course.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure and was restarted on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) on [2143-8-14]. The plan is to initiate hemodialysis (HD) today, and a tunneled dialysis catheter will be placed on Monday. Sevelamer has been discontinued due to normalization of phosphate levels. The patient has a subsegmental PE, for which he is receiving heparin gtt with a plan to start coumadin after the HD line placement.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, which is more controlled. Pain management is being provided with fentanyl boluses, and there is a plan to reassess long-term pain needs after 24-48 hours. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to toxic metabolic encephalopathy, and overall alertness has improved with weaning of sedation. The patient recently underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

Other conditions include weakness, anemia, and critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP). The patient's weakness is most likely due to deconditioning versus medication-induced. Anemia is stable, and frequent phlebotomy is being performed as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron deficiency. The patient received one unit of blood on [2143-8-14] with appropriate hematocrit bump."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of unclear past medical history. He presented with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A and later developed respiratory failure due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), fluid overload, right lower lobe pulmonary embolism (PE), and endotracheal tube crusting. The patient was initially extubated but reintubated due to hypoxemic respiratory distress caused by enterobacter pneumonia (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia, VAP, versus Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia, HAP). He subsequently underwent tracheostomy.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure: Secondary to influenza A, ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE, ETT crusting.
2. Hypotension/Shock: Resolved. Likely related to infection versus medication-related in the setting of sedation.
3. Fevers: Afebrile x 48 hours. Currently treating Clostridium difficile (C. diff), PE, and pneumonia. Likely also had drug fever during the hospital course. No evidence of abdominal process including cholecystitis and pancreatitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now with respiratory failure due to ARDS. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He has developed a pansensitive enterobacter infection, which has resulted in a VAP versus HAP. The patient's other medical issues include c. difficile colitis, acute renal failure, sub-segmental pulmonary embolism, atrial flutter, back pain, altered mental status, weakness, anemia, and elevated liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient has developed a pansensitive enterobacter infection, which may progress to VAP if not treated appropriately.
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) - The patient's respiratory failure could also be due to HAP, which needs to be differentiated from VAP.
3. Acute renal failure - The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a need for ongoing monitoring and management of renal parameters.
4. Sub-segmental pulmonary embolism (PE) - The patient has been diagnosed with a sub-segmental PE, which requires anticoagulation therapy to prevent further clot formation.
5. C. difficile colitis - The patient has an ongoing infection with c. difficile, which may require specific treatment with vancomycin.
6. Atrial flutter - The patient is experiencing atrial flutter, which needs"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE. Had respiratory distress relieved by ETT
   change and subsequently extubated [**8-10**] but required reintubation [**2143-8-11**]
   for tachypnea and hypoxemic resp distress [**3-11**] enterobacter pneumonia.
   Now on trach.
   - Cont vanc (dosed by level) and cefepime  with plan for 8 day course
   to end on [**2143-8-19**] for VAP v. HAP
   - F/u sputum culture sensitivities, pending micro
   - now off sedation
   - cont heparin gtt for PE
   Hypotension/Shock: Improved.  Likely related to infection versus
   medication related in the setting of intubation.
   - Cont vanc, cefepime pending further micro data (if negative will plan
   for 8 day course for VAP vs. HAP)
   - Continue CVVH with net goal even
   Fevers:  Afebrile overnight.  Previous sources include C. diff,
   medications, PE. Pan-scan unremarkable. Micro only with sparse
   Aspergillus in sputum, likely colonizer. LFTs/pancreatic enzymes stable
   to improved with neg HIDA scan. Urine cx neg.
   - vanc/cefepime for treatment of VAP v. HAP
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff for now as restarted on broad
   antibiotics
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - plan to resite HD line (placed [**2143-7-26**]), hopefully today
   - limit medications as much as possible
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin since [**2143-7-28**]
   - continue until broad spectrum abx are completed.
   Acute Renal Failure: Restarted on CVVH on [**2143-8-14**]. Was given aluminum
   hydroxide for hyperphophatemia
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   - continue sevalamer to 1600 mg TID w/meals
   - likely tunneled dialysis catheter today as afebrile >48hrs
   - f/u renal recs
   Sub-segmental PE: noted on CT Chest on [**8-4**].
   - heparin gtt with plan to start coumadin after HD line placed
   - monitor daily Hct
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Aflutter with rates in 100s.
   - treating pain with fentanyl boluses
   - uptitrate beta blocker (metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**]) prn
   Pain: Unclear but apears to be complaining of back pain, likely
   musculoskeletal
   - cont fentanyl boluses for now
   - reassess more long-term needs after 24-48 hours
   Altered mental status: Likely large component from toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy. Overall alertness improved with weaning of sedation CT
   head without acute process. Now s/p Trach/PEG.
   - cont to monitor neuro status
   - ativan prn to regulate sleep/wake cycle; may need to be placed on
   vent overnight
   Weakness:  EMG suggests critical illness polyneuropathy is unlikely.
   Likely [**3-11**] deconditioning vs. medication induced.
   - continue to monitor
   Anemia: Continuing to trend, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent
   phelobotomy as well as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron
   deficiency (iron/ferritin <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on
   HD.  Received one unit on [**2143-8-14**] with appropriate hematocrit bump.
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements
   Elevated LFTs: Unclear source.   Slowly trending down.  [**Month (only) 51**] have been
   related to cholestatic medications.  No son[**Name (NI) 351**] evidence of
   cholecytsitis.  CT abdomen and pelvis without clear etiology. Does have
   subcentimeter post right hepatic lobe hypodensity thought to be
   hemangioma on prior imaging.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient's health progress note indicates several significant events over the past 24 hours. These events include the growth of pan-sensitive enterobacter in sputum culture, discontinuation of sevelamer, cessation of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to filter clogging, planned restart of hemodialysis (HD) in the morning, inability to schedule HD catheter placement, and restart of tube feeds and heparin infusion.

The patient has allergies to Zosyn (Piperacillin Sodium/Tazobactam) and Ativan (Lorazepam). The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin on 08/15/2143 at 12:13 PM and Cefepime on 08/17/2143 at 05:24 AM.

The patient is currently receiving infusions of Heparin Sodium at 2,250 units/hour and other ICU medications such as Pantoprazole (Protonix) on 08/16/2143 at 08:15 PM, Lorazepam (Ativan) on 08/16/2143 at 11:21 PM, and Fentanyl on 08/16/2143 at 11:58 PM.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, now with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism (PE), acute kidney injury (ARF), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient was initially extubated on 8/10 but reintubated on 8/12 for work of breathing and hypoxemia, presumably due to new sepsis or infection. The patient also underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on 8/14.

The patient is currently tolerating the tracheostomy mask but continues to have hypoxemic respiratory failure, which may be due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Empiric coverage with vancomycin and cefepime is being provided for 8 days. The patient's fungal isolators and broad culture results are pending.

The patient has fevers, which are unclear in origin, and may be related to a fungal infection or another source. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.

The patient has renal failure with hyperkalemia and progressive anion gap metabolic acidosis. Hemodialysis (HD) was performed today, and the patient will require re-siting of the HD line with a more permanent line once the fevers resolve. The patient is off continuous veno-"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male presenting with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, now with respiratory failure due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Pulmonary Embolism (PE), Acute Kidney Injury (ARF), and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient was extubated on [**8-10**] but reintubated on [**8-12**] for work of breathing and hypoxemia. He also underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on [**8-14**].

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, presumed either new sepsis or new infection, for which he is being covered with vancomycin and cefepime. He is also on heparin gtt for right lower lobe segmental PE and will need transition to coumadin once the HD catheter is re-sited. The patient has fevers, which are unclear in source, and requires fungal isolators and broad cultures pending. He has renal failure with hyperkalemia and progressive anion gap metabolic acidosis, requiring hemodialysis (HD) today. There is cautious resumption of metoprolol due to atrial flutter/fibrillation, and full anticoagulation is maintained. The patient does not appear to have an active C. difficile colitis but is on"

   Tachypnea:  Since tracheostomy patient has been noticed to have
   tachypnea with irregular respirations.  ABG with respiratory
   alkalosis.  Fentanyl and ativan were attempted without improvement in
   his tachypnea.  He was placed on CPAP overnight with mild improvement.
   - avoid sedating medications for tachypnea
   - will rest on CPAP and give sleep aids at night for now
   Hypotension/Shock: Resolved. Likely related to infection versus
   medication related in the setting of sedation.
   - Cont vanc, cefepime pending further micro data (if negative will plan
   for 8 day course for VAP vs. HAP)
   - Continue CVVH with net goal even
   Fevers: Afebrile x 48 hours. Currently treating C. diff, PE, and
   pneumonia. Likely also had drug fever during hospital course. No
   evidence of abdominal process including cholecystitis and pancreatitis.
   - vanc/cefepime for treatment of VAP v. HAP
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff for 14 days post completion of
   antibiotic course for HAP
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - plan to resite HD line (placed [**2143-7-26**]) on Monday
   - limit medications as much as possible
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin since [**2143-7-28**]

   Acute Renal Failure: Restarted on CVVH on [**2143-8-14**].
   -  will plan for HD reinitiation today; f/u renal recs
   - sevelamer discontinued for now given normalization of phos
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   - tunneled dialysis catheter on Mon
   Sub-segmental PE: noted on CT Chest on [**8-4**].
   - heparin gtt with plan to start coumadin after HD line placed
   - monitor daily Hct
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Rate more controlled
   - treating pain with fentanyl boluses
   - uptitrate beta blocker (metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**]) prn
   Pain: Unclear but apears to be complaining of back pain, likely
   musculoskeletal
   - cont fentanyl boluses for now
   - reassess more long-term needs after 24-48 hours
   Altered mental status: Likely large component from toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy. Overall alertness improved with weaning of sedation CT
   head without acute process. Now s/p Trach/PEG.
   - cont to monitor neuro status
   - will try standing trazodone for sleep wake cycle given that ativan
   appears to have adversely affected his mental status this

   Weakness:  EMG suggests critical illness polyneuropathy is unlikely.
   Likely [**3-11**] deconditioning vs. medication induced.
   - continue to monitor
   Anemia: Stable, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent phelobotomy as well
   as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron deficiency (iron/ferritin
   <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on HD.  Received one unit on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A and respiratory failure, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was initially extubated but reintubated due to hypoxemic respiratory distress caused by enterobacter pneumonia (ventilator-associated pneumonia vs. hospital-acquired pneumonia). The patient underwent tracheostomy placement and is currently on pressure support with mild improvement in ABG stability.

The patient's allergies include a rash and fever from Zosyn and periods of apnea from Ativan. He has received antibiotics such as Vancomycin and Cefepime, with ongoing treatment for VAP vs. HAP.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and fever. His respiratory rate is elevated with irregular respirations and respiratory alkalosis. He has been placed on CPAP overnight with mild improvement.

The patient's physical examination reveals bronchial breath sounds, soft and distended abdomen, and trace edema in both extremities. Neurological examination shows movement of extremities to painful stimuli but no following of commands.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, elevated creatinine, potassium, and lactate levels. The patient's electrolytes and renal function are being closely monitored.

The patient has several medical complications, including acute pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status (not delirium), inability to protect air"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient tolerated head down positioning but had an increased respiratory rate with respiratory alkalosis, which did not respond to fentanyl or Ativan boluses. The patient was placed on pressure support overnight with mild improvement and stable ABG. The patient has a history of allergies to Zosyn and Ativan, as well as a rash and fever. The patient has been on various antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Cefepime. The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion, pantoprazole, lorazepam, and fentanyl. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and an increased respiratory rate. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, and PS of 5 cmH2O. The patient's ABG shows respiratory alkalosis. The patient's peripheral pulses and skin are not assessed. The patient has elevated WBC count, Hct, creatinine, TCO2, and glucose levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. The patient's physical examination reveals altered mental status, atrial flutter, and poor airway protection. The patient has multiple problems including fall in hematocrit, acute pain, impaired skin integrity, altered nutrition, risk for pulmonary embolism, C. difficile infection, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient is receiving proper ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has risk factors for pulmonary embolism, including immobility and the use of heparin. If the patient develops symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or sudden increase in heart rate, it may indicate a potential pulmonary embolism.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics, which increases the risk of C. difficile infection. Symptoms to watch for include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte levels is important.
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient has ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory compromise. Monitoring oxygen saturation and ventilator parameters is crucial.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers. Regular turning and skin assessment is necessary.
6. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter needs to be closely monitored, and anticoagulation may be required to prevent thromboembolic events."

   Pain: Unclear but apears to be complaining of back pain, likely
   musculoskeletal
   - cont fentanyl boluses for now
   - reassess more long-term needs after 24-48 hours
   Altered mental status: Likely large component from toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy. Overall alertness improved with weaning of sedation CT

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A and respiratory failure caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient initially tolerated hospitalization but then developed increased respiratory rate and respiratory alkalosis. Despite receiving fentanyl and Ativan boluses, there was no improvement. The patient was placed on pressure support overnight with mild improvement and stable ABG.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient presented with ARDS, which is characterized by severe lung inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. This condition can lead to respiratory failure and requires immediate medical intervention.
2. Tachypnea: The patient has been experiencing rapid breathing, known as tachypnea. This symptom is often associated with respiratory distress and may be related to the underlying ARDS.
3. Hypotension/Shock: The patient had an episode of hypotension that resolved. It is likely related to infection or medication side effects.
4. Fevers: The patient had persistent fevers, indicating an ongoing infection. The source of the infection could be pneumonia, catheter-related bloodstream infection, or Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis.
5. C. difficile Colitis: The patient was treated for C. diff colitis with oral vancomycin since July 28th. C. diff is a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea and inflammation of the colon.

   tachypnea with irregular respirations.  ABG with respiratory
   alkalosis.  Fentanyl and ativan were attempted without improvement in
   his tachypnea.  He was placed on CPAP overnight with mild improvement.
   - avoid sedating medications for tachypnea
   - will rest on CPAP and give sleep aids at night for now
   Hypotension/Shock: Resolved. Likely related to infection versus
   medication related in the setting of sedation.
   - Cont vanc, cefepime pending further micro data (if negative will plan
   for 8 day course for VAP vs. HAP)
   - Continue HD with net goal even
   Fevers: Currently treating C. diff, PE, and pneumonia. Likely also had
   drug fever during hospital course. No evidence of abdominal process
   including cholecystitis and pancreatitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has several medical complications including acute pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, airway protection issues, atrial flutter, pulmonary embolism (PE), Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a subsegmental PE, indicating a possible DVT. He is being treated with heparin and will start on Coumadin after the HD line is placed.
3. C. difficile infection (C. diff): The patient has been treated for C. diff with vancomycin and will continue until 7 days post completion of the antibiotic course for HAP.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he has been transitioned to hemodialysis (HD).
5. PE: The patient has a subsegmental PE and is receiving heparin.
6. ARDS: The patient has ARDS secondary to multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure.
7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to prolonged bed rest and immobility"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male presenting with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, now with respiratory failure due to ARDS, PE, ARF, and c. diff infection. The patient has been extubated and reintubated multiple times for work of breathing and has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a respiratory rate of 34, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an ABG showing pH 7.48, PaCO2 35, PaO2 388, and Ve 19.3 L/min.

The patient has several medical complications including chronic respiratory failure, tachypnea of unclear source, Enterobacter pan colonization, right lower lobe pulmonary embolism (PE), renal failure, anxiety and pain, and potential C. difficile colitis. The patient is currently receiving treatment with vancomycin and cefepime for VAP/HAP, heparin for PE, and long-term po vancomycin for prior C. difficile infection.

   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE, ETT crusting. Tolerated couple of days
   extubated but reintubated for hypoxemic resp distress in setting of
   Enterobacter PNA (VAP v. HAP), now s/p trach.
   - HD dosing of vanc and cefepime  with plan for 8 day course to end on
   [**2143-8-19**] for VAP v. HAP
   - now off sedation, using fentanyl boluses and ativan PRN for agitation
   - cont heparin gtt for PE
   Tachypnea:  Since tracheostomy, noted to have tachypnea with irregular
   respirations.  ABG with respiratory alkalosis.  No improvement with
   fentanyl and ativan. Placed on CPAP with improvement, now back on trach
   mask.
   - avoid sedating medications for tachypnea
   - observe on trach mask; may need to revert to CPAP if recurs
   Fevers:  Febrile overnight with no new micro data yet. HD line and
   a-line pulled. Currently treating C. diff, PE, and pneumonia. Likely
   also had drug fever during hospital course. No evidence of abdominal
   process including cholecystitis and pancreatitis.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC; f/u pending cx
   - vanc/cefepime for treatment of VAP v. HAP
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff for 7 days post completion of
   antibiotic course for HAP
   - limit medications as much as possible
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin since [**2143-7-28**]
   - continue until 7 days post completion of antibiotic course
   Acute Renal Failure: Trasitioned to HD [**2143-8-17**].
   - d/w IR plan for HD tunneled line (likely when afebrile x 24 h) with
   plan to resume HD tmrw

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, resulting in respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been admitted to the ICU for critical care management. The patient has undergone various interventions including tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and hemodialysis (HD). He is currently being treated for Clostridium difficile colitis, acute renal failure, subsegmental pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation/flutter, pain, altered mental status, weakness, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been reintubated for hypoxemic respiratory distress and has a history of Enterobacter pneumonia. He is receiving HD dosing of vancomycin and cefepime for VAP.
2. Fevers: The patient is febrile overnight with no new microbiological data yet. He has had drug fever during his hospital course. It is important to continue trending the fever curve and wait for pending cultures.
3. Tachypnea: The patient has been experiencing tachypnea with irregular respirations since tracheostomy. ABG shows respiratory alkalosis. He was placed on CPAP with improvement but is now back on tracheal mask.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient transitioned to HD on [**2143-8-17**]. He"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of pneumonia secondary to influenza A and respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient has multiple comorbidities including C. difficile colitis, acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, sub-segmental pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation/flutter, and altered mental status. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube and has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to being intubated for an extended period. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and regular sputum cultures are necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of sub-segmental PE and is on heparin for prophylaxis. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and performing lower limb circulation assessments are important.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient has been treated for C. difficile colitis. It is crucial to continue vancomycin orally for 7 days after completing the antibiotic course for HAP to prevent recurrence.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure and is on hemodialysis. Regular monitoring of renal function and following nephrology"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE, ETT crusting. Tolerated couple of days
   extubated but reintubated for hypoxemic resp distress in setting of
   enterobacter PNA (VAP v. HAP), now s/p trach.
   - HD dosing of vanc and cefepime  with plan for 8 day course to end on
   [**2143-8-19**] for VAP v. HAP
   - F/u pending micro
   - now off sedation, using fentanyl boluses and ativan PRN for agitation
   - cont heparin gtt for PE
   Tachypnea:  Since tracheostomy patient has been noticed to have
   tachypnea with irregular respirations.  ABG with respiratory
   alkalosis.  Fentanyl and ativan were attempted without improvement in
   his tachypnea.  He was placed on CPAP overnight with mild improvement.
   - avoid sedating medications for tachypnea
   - will rest on CPAP and give sleep aids at night for now
   - will check CXR this morning
   - given low grade fevers will culture today
   Fevers:  Low grade fever this morning. Currently treating C. diff, PE,
   and pneumonia. Likely also had drug fever during hospital course. No
   evidence of abdominal process including cholecystitis and
   pancreatitis.
   - vanc/cefepime for treatment of VAP v. HAP
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff for 7 days post completion of
   antibiotic course for HAP
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC
   - will resend cultures today (blood, urine, sputum)
   - plan to resite HD line (placed [**2143-7-26**]) on [**Last Name (LF) 1088**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] discontinue
   temporary HD line today
   - limit medications as much as possible
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin since [**2143-7-28**]
   - continue until 7 days post completion of antibiotic course
   Acute Renal Failure: Trasitioned to HD [**2143-8-17**].
   -  f/u renal recs
   - sevelamer discontinued for now given normalization of phos
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   - tunneled dialysis catheter on Mon
   Sub-segmental PE: noted on CT Chest on [**8-4**].
   - heparin gtt with plan to start coumadin after HD line placed
   - monitor daily Hct
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Rate more controlled
   - treating pain with fentanyl boluses
   - continue beta blocker (metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**]) prn
   Pain: Unclear but apears to be complaining of back pain, likely
   musculoskeletal
   - cont fentanyl boluses for now
   - reassess more long-term needs after 24-48 hours
   Altered mental status: Likely large component from toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy. Overall alertness improved with weaning of sedation CT
   head without acute process. Now s/p Trach/PEG.
   - cont to monitor neuro status
   - will schedule trazodone for sleep
   Weakness:  EMG suggests critical illness polyneuropathy is unlikely.
   Likely [**3-11**] deconditioning vs. medication induced.
   - continue to monitor
   Anemia: Stable, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent phelobotomy as well
   as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron deficiency (iron/ferritin
   <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on HD.  Received one unit on
   [**2143-8-14**] with appropriate hematocrit bump.
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of unclear medical problems who presented with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, leading to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was initially extubated but reintubated for hypoxemic respiratory distress due to enterobacter pneumonia (ventilator-associated pneumonia versus hospital-acquired pneumonia), and now has a tracheostomy.

The patient has been on hemodialysis (HD) since [2143-8-17] due to acute renal failure. He also has a subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE) and is being treated with heparin gtt. The patient's atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter is being managed with beta-blockers. He has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile colitis and is receiving vancomycin orally for 7 days after completing the antibiotic course for HAP. The patient's pain is being managed with fentanyl boluses, and his altered mental status is attributed to toxic metabolic encephalopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient may be susceptible to acquiring new infections while in the hospital.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Given the presence of a subsegmental PE, there is a risk of developing DVT"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure secondary to aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, tracheostomy tube in place, and receiving supplemental oxygen. He has been febrile since August 18th with a maximum temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 118/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows pH 7.20, PaCO2 40 mmHg, PaO2 60 mmHg, and HCO3- 20 mEq/L. The patient's neurological status is described as altered mental status but not delirium. Physical examination reveals tachypnea, using abdominal muscles, bronchial breath sounds, and no wheezing. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place and is receiving nutrition through a PEG tube. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and persistent fever may indicate an ongoing or worsening infection in the lungs.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications and conditions. The note mentions that the patient has a fever of 101.1°F and was pan cultured for fevers off CVVH, bronchoscoped with patent trach and airways, and had an arterial line and dialysis catheter removed. The patient also had a previous episode of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (89 bpm) and low blood pressure (118/57 mmHg). The respiratory rate is within normal limits (27 breaths per minute). The patient's oxygen saturation remains at 100% with the use of a tracheostomy tube and supplemental oxygen.

The patient's labs indicate an elevated white blood cell count (243 K/uL), slightly low hemoglobin level (6.8 g/dL), elevated blood urea nitrogen (300 mg/dL), low sodium level (130 mg/dL), and elevated potassium level (4.7 mEq/L). The creatinine level is also elevated (6.7 mg/dL). Other lab results show abnormalities in liver function tests, kidney function, and electrolyte levels.

The patient has multiple comorbidities including acute pain, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, impaired ability to protect airway, atr"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, now with respiratory failure due to ARDS, PE, ARF, and C. diff infection. The patient was initially extubated but reintubated for breathing difficulties. A tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were performed on [8-14].

The patient's current conditions include chronic respiratory failure, treating for Enterobacter pneumonia, colonized with Aspergillus, and receiving heparin gtt for a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism. The patient is also being treated for anxiety and pain, using a tracheal mask during the day and PSV overnight.

The patient's fevers have returned after discontinuing CVVH, and the source is unclear. Fungal isolators and pan-culture are pending, and a chest X-ray and possible repeat pan-culture may be done. The patient's temporary line was pulled, and another temporary line will be placed tomorrow. The patient is also being treated for C. diff infection.

The patient has renal failure, tolerating HD sat, with the next session planned for Tuesday. There is a concern about atrial flutter/fibrillation, and cautious resumption of metoprolol is recommended. Full anticoagulation as previously mentioned will continue.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, now with respiratory failure caused by ARDS, PE, ARF, and C. diff infection. The patient was extubated on 08/10 but reintubated on 08/12 for breathing difficulties. A tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were performed on 08/14. The patient is currently being treated for Enterobacter pneumonia, chronic respiratory failure, and a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism. He is also being treated for anxiety and pain, fevers, C. diff infection, renal failure, and flutter/fibrillation. The patient's disposition is planned for LTAC/rehab with a physical therapy consult.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being intubated for an extended period.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism, indicating a possible DVT.
3. C. diff infection: Although the patient does not currently appear to have an active C. diff infection, he is on long-term vancomycin for a prior infection.
4. Renal failure: The patient is undergoing hemodialysis sessions and needs to be monitored for further deterioration of renal function.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE, ETT crusting. Tolerated couple of days
   extubated but reintubated for hypoxemic resp distress in setting of
   Enterobacter PNA (VAP v. HAP), now s/p trach.
   - HD dosing of vanc and cefepime  with plan for 8 day course to end
   today
   - now off sedation, using fentanyl boluses and ativan PRN for agitation
   - cont heparin gtt for PE
   - PT consult today
   Tachypnea:  Since tracheostomy, noted to have tachypnea with irregular
   respirations.  ABG with respiratory alkalosis.  No improvement with
   fentanyl and ativan. Placed on CPAP with improvement, now back on trach
   mask.
   - avoid sedating medications for tachypnea
   - observe on trach mask; may need to revert to CPAP if recurs
   Fevers:  Febrile overnight with no new micro data yet. HD line and
   a-line pulled. Currently treating C. diff, PE, and pneumonia. Likely
   also had drug fever during hospital course. No evidence of abdominal
   process including cholecystitis and pancreatitis.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC; f/u pending cx
   - vanc/cefepime for treatment of VAP v. HAP to end today
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff for 7 days post completion of
   antibiotic course for HAP
   - limit medications as much as possible
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin since [**2143-7-28**]
   - continue until 7 days post completion of antibiotic course
   Acute Renal Failure: Trasitioned to HD [**2143-8-17**].
   - d/w IR plan for HD tunneled line (likely when afebrile x 24 h) with
   plan to resume HD tmrw
   - f/u renal recs
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   Sub-segmental PE: noted on CT Chest on [**8-4**].
   - heparin gtt with plan to start coumadin after HD line placed
   - monitor daily Hct
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Rate more controlled
   - treating pain with fentanyl boluses
   - continue beta blocker (metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**]) prn
   Pain: Unclear but apears to be complaining of back pain, likely
   musculoskeletal
   - cont fentanyl boluses for now
   - reassess more long-term needs after 24-48 hours
   Altered mental status: Likely large component from toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy. Overall alertness improved with weaning of sedation. CT
   head without acute process. Now s/p Trach/PEG.
   - cont to monitor neuro status
   - will increase trazodone for sleep
   Weakness:  EMG suggests critical illness polyneuropathy is unlikely.
   Likely [**3-11**] deconditioning vs. medication induced.
   - continue to monitor
   Anemia: Stable, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent phelobotomy as well
   as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron deficiency (iron/ferritin
   <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on HD.  Received one unit on
   [**2143-8-14**] with appropriate hematocrit bump.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of pneumonia secondary to influenza A, resulting in respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has a tracheostomy in place. He has been treated with antibiotics for both ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). He is currently on hemodialysis due to acute renal failure. The patient has a subsegmental pulmonary embolism (PE) and is receiving heparin therapy. He has atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, which are being managed with beta-blockers. The patient's pain is being treated with fentanyl boluses, and he is also receiving vancomycin for Clostridium difficile colitis. His mental status is improving after weaning off sedation, but he is experiencing tachypnea with irregular respirations, possibly due to ARDS. The patient has anemia that is being managed with iron supplements and blood transfusions as needed. His nutritional needs are being met through tube feeds, although they are currently held. The patient's glycemic control is being monitored, and he is on stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of pneumonia secondary to influenza A, resulting in respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fluid overload, right lower lobe pulmonary embolism (PE), and endotracheal tube (ETT) crusting. The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for the pneumonia and is currently on vancomycin for Clostridium difficile colitis. He has acute renal failure and is on hemodialysis. The patient also has subsegmental PE, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, back pain, altered mental status, weakness, and anemia. He is being treated with various medications including fentanyl, ativan, heparin, and metoprolol. The patient is currently on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) via tracheostomy mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. It is important to monitor for signs of infection and adjust the treatment accordingly.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE, and there is a risk of developing another one. Anticoagulation therapy should be continued, and the patient should be monitored for any signs of DVT or PE.
3. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient is being treated"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, leading to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He initially tolerated a couple of days of extubation but was reintubated due to hypoxemic respiratory distress caused by Enterobacter pneumonia (ventilator-associated pneumonia versus hospital-acquired pneumonia). The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, continuous heparin infusion for pulmonary embolism, hemodialysis, and treatment for Clostridium difficile colitis.

The patient's current issues include tachypnea, fevers, acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, subsegmental pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, pain, altered mental status, weakness, and anemia. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain management with fentanyl boluses, sedation with ativan, and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia, further episodes of fever, progression of acute renal failure, recurrence of pulmonary embolism, cardiac arrhythmias, persistent pain, changes in mental status, muscle weakness, and exacerbation of anemia. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to address these potential complications."

   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Multifocal pneumonia/Respiratory failure:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE, ETT crusting. Tolerated couple of days
   extubated but reintubated for hypoxemic resp distress in setting of
   Enterobacter PNA (VAP v. HAP), now s/p trach.
   - now completed a course of vancomycin and cefepime for 8 day course
   - now off sedation, using fentanyl boluses and ativan PRN for agitation
   - cont heparin gtt for PE once line is placed
   - cont PT
   - Seen by Speech and now has Passy-Muir valve
   Tachypnea:  Since tracheostomy, noted to have tachypnea with irregular
   respirations.  ABG with respiratory alkalosis.  No improvement with
   fentanyl and ativan.
   - avoid sedating medications for tachypnea
   - cont trach mask during day; rest on CPAP at night
   Fevers:  Afebrile overnight with no new micro data. HD line and a-line
   pulled. Currently treating C. diff, PE. Antibiotics for pneumonia now
   completed.  Likely also had drug fever during hospital course. No
   evidence of abdominal process including cholecystitis and
   pancreatitis.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC; f/u pending cx
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff for 7 days post completion of
   antibiotic course for HAP (to end [**2143-8-27**])
   - limit medications as much as possible
   C.difficile colitis: On po vancomycin since [**2143-7-28**]
   - continue until 7 days post completion of antibiotic course until
   [**2143-8-27**]
   Acute Renal Failure: Trasitioned to HD [**2143-8-17**].
   - plan for new temp line today given temp 100 today
   - f/u renal recs
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   Sub-segmental PE: noted on CT Chest on [**8-4**].
   - heparin gtt with plan to start coumadin after HD line placed
   - monitor daily Hct
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Rate more controlled
   - treating pain with fentanyl boluses
   - continue beta blocker (metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**]) prn
   Pain: Unclear but appears to be complaining of back pain, likely
   musculoskeletal
   - cont fentanyl boluses for now
   - reassess more long-term needs after 24-48 hours
   Altered mental status: Likely large component from toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy.   Signiticantly improved over past 48 hours. CT head
   without acute process. Now s/p Trach/PEG.
   - cont to monitor neuro status
   - will increase trazodone for sleep
   Depression:
   - Start celexa 10mg daily

   Weakness:  EMG suggests critical illness polyneuropathy is unlikely.
   Likely [**3-11**] deconditioning vs. medication induced.
   - continue to monitor
   Anemia: Stable, no e/o active bleeding.  Frequent phelobotomy as well
   as renal failure, chronic illness, and iron deficiency (iron/ferritin
   <10). Also sensitive to fluid shifts when on HD.  Received one unit on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of pneumonia secondary to influenza A, resulting in respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient underwent endotracheal intubation but was reintubated due to hypoxemic respiratory distress caused by Enterobacter pneumonia (ventilator-associated pneumonia or VAP versus hospital-acquired pneumonia). The patient has now undergone tracheostomy.

The patient completed a course of vancomycin and cefepime for 8 days. He is off sedation and using fentanyl boluses and ativan PRN for agitation. Continuous heparin gtt is being administered for pulmonary embolism (PE) once the line is placed. The patient has been seen by physical therapy and is now using a Passy-Muir valve.

The patient's current concerns include tachypnea with irregular respirations since tracheostomy, fevers, acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD), Clostridium difficile colitis, sub-segmental PE, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, pain, altered mental status, depression, weakness, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tachypnea: The patient is experiencing tachypnea with irregular respirations since the tracheostomy. This could be due to various factors such as respiratory muscle weakness, underlying lung disease, or an adverse reaction to medications. Monitoring the patient's respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, resulting in respiratory failure due to ARDS, PE, ARF, and C. difficile infection. The patient has been intubated multiple times and underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Chronic respiratory failure is present, and the patient is being treated for anxiety, pain, and renal failure. There are concerns about atrial flutter/fibrillation, renal failure, and potential complications from heparin. The patient is also being monitored for C. difficile colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged mechanical ventilation: The patient's need for repeated intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of ventilator-associated complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Infection: The patient's history of multiple hospital-acquired infections, including pneumonia, PE, and C. difficile colitis, indicates an increased risk for further infections while in the ICU.
3. ARDS: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure and has a high mortality rate.
4. PE: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and may be complicated by right heart strain or failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism (PE), acute kidney injury (ARF), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient underwent extubation but required reintubation for breathing difficulties. A tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were performed on [**8-14**]. The patient is currently on chronic respiratory support, including a tracheostomy and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), and is planned to transition to a tracheal mask during the day and PSV at night. The patient also has renal failure and is undergoing hemodialysis sessions. There is a concern about atrial flutter/fibrillation, and cautious resumption of metoprolol is recommended. The patient is being treated for anxiety and pain, and there is ongoing management of Enterobacter pneumonia, Aspergillus colonization, and C. diff colitis. The patient's disposition is planned for a long-term acute care (LTAC) facility for rehabilitation, including physical therapy, speech therapy, and social work consultation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Chronic respiratory failure: The patient's prolonged need for respiratory support increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further respiratory deterioration.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. 

The patient has undergone temporary HD line placement with IR and received hemodialysis, indicating potential kidney dysfunction or failure. A Passy Muir valve has been inserted, which is often used for patients who are unable to effectively clear secretions from their airway. The patient's temperature spiked to 101 degrees Fahrenheit, prompting blood and sputum cultures to be sent, suggesting a possible infection.

The patient has a history of allergies to Zosyn (Intraven) and Ativan (Injection). The last dose of antibiotics was Cefipime on [2143-8-18] at 06:00 AM, and Vancomycin was started on [2143-8-20] at 12:30 PM. The patient is currently on heparin sodium infusion at a rate of 2,250 units per hour.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 105/50 to 117/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's weight has decreased from 84.5 kg at admission to 78.3 kg currently. Fluid balance shows a total intake"

   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Respiratory failure/multifocal pneumonia:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE, ETT crusting. Tolerated couple of days
   extubated but reintubated for hypoxemic resp distress in setting of
   Enterobacter PNA (VAP v. HAP), now s/p trach.
   - completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and cefepime
   - on trach mask during day, CPAP overnight
   - now off sedation, on fentanyl boluses and ativan PRN for agitation
   - cont heparin gtt, start coumadin if Hct stable
   - has Passy-Muir valve
   - cont PT
   Tachypnea:  Noted to have tachypnea with irregular respirations s/p
   trach with ABG c/w respiratory alkalosis.  No improvement with fentanyl
   and ativan. Now improved.
   - avoid sedating medications for tachypnea
   Fevers:  Febrile overnight. S/p placement of new temp HD line.
   Currently treating C. diff, PE. Antibiotics for pneumonia now
   completed.  Likely also had drug fever during hospital course. No
   evidence of abdominal process including cholecystitis and
   pancreatitis.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC; f/u pending blood and sputum cx
   - continue vancomycin po for c.diff for 7 days post completion of
   antibiotic course for HAP (to end [**2143-8-27**])
   - limit medications as much as possible
   C. difficile colitis: On po vancomycin since [**2143-7-28**]

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, leading to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was initially extubated but reintubated due to hypoxemic respiratory distress caused by Enterobacter pneumonia (ventilator-associated pneumonia vs. hospital-acquired pneumonia). The patient underwent tracheostomy placement.

The patient completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and cefepime. Currently, the patient is on tracheostomy mask during the day and CPAP overnight. The patient is off sedation and receiving fentanyl boluses and Ativan as needed for agitation. Heparin infusion is being administered, and Coumadin may be started if hematocrit (Hct) levels stabilize. The patient has a Passy-Muir valve and is continuing with heparin gtt. Prothrombin time (PT) is also being monitored.

The patient has been febrile overnight and has been placed on a new temporary hemodialysis (HD) line. The patient is currently being treated for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection and pneumonia. Antibiotics for pneumonia have been completed, and it is likely that the patient also had a drug fever during the hospital course. There is no evidence of an abdominal process, including cholecystitis and pancreatitis.

The patient's tachypnea has improved, and the ABG shows respiratory alkalosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of multiple medical problems including heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. Upon admission, the patient was found to have an elevated temperature, increased heart rate, and low blood pressure. He was started on hemodialysis and received a temporary HD line with an infusion of heparin sodium. The patient also received a Passy Muir valve and was ordered for one unit of blood due to a hematocrit of 20. 

During the 24-hour period, the patient's temperature spiked to 101 degrees Fahrenheit, and blood and sputum cultures were sent. The patient is allergic to Zosyn (piperacillin sodium/tazobactam) and Ativan (lorazepam), both of which are intravenous medications. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was cefipime on 08/18/2143 at 06:00 AM, and he started receiving vancomycin on 08/20/2143 at 12:30 PM. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium at a rate of 2,250 units per hour.

Other medications being administered include pantoprazole (Protonix) since 08/20/2143 at 08:30 AM and insulin - regular since 08/21/2143 at 12:00"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia, respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism (PE), acute kidney injury (ARF), and Clostridium difficile infection. He was initially intubated but extubated on 08/10 and reintubated on 08/12 due to difficulty breathing. A tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were performed on 07/08. The patient has chronic respiratory failure, and his current plan is to transition to coumadin for PE treatment. He also has an unclear source of fever, and cultures are pending. The patient's anemia is likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), anemia of chronic disease, and possible renal failure. He received a blood transfusion today with a transfusion threshold of Hct < 21. The patient has renal failure and received a temporary hemodialysis catheter in the right internal jugular vein. There is a concern for cautious resumption of metoprolol due to atrial flutter/fibrillation. The patient is being treated for C. difficile colitis, although it does not appear to be an active infection at present. The patient's disposition is planned for long-term acute care (LTAC)/rehabilitation, with physical, speech, and social work consultations. Rest of the note is per housestaff.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, now with respiratory failure due to ARDS, PE, ARF, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient was extubated on 8/10 and reintubated on 8/12 for work of breathing. A tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were performed on 7/8. The patient completed an antibiotic course for Enterobacter pneumonia but is chronically colonized with Aspergillus. He will continue heparin gtt for a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism and transition to coumadin starting tonight. The patient is being treated for anxiety and pain, and will use a tracheostomy mask by day and pressure support ventilation (PSV) overnight.

The patient has multiple medical issues including chronic respiratory failure, anemia likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), renal failure, and atrial flutter/fibrillation. Anemia management includes erythropoietin with hemodialysis (HD), iron supplementation, and a transfusion threshold of hematocrit (Hct) < 21. Renal failure management involves HD through a new right internal jugular (RIJ) temporary HD catheter. Caution is advised in resuming metoprolol due to atrial flutter/fibrillation. The patient has completed a 5"

","The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of renal failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on dialysis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 106/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's current medications include Heparin sodium, Pantoprazole, Coumadin, and Insulin. 

The patient has a history of allergies to Zosyn and Ativan. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin and Cefepime, administered on 08/21/2143 at 05:30 PM and 08:00 PM respectively.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for new left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, for which he has been started on Vanc/cefipime.

The patient's labs show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and potassium. The patient also has leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. 

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is not assessed for peripheral vascular status, skin condition, neurologic status, or movement. 

The patient has multiple potential medical complications, including impaired physical mobility, anemia, altered mental status, acute pain, impaired skin integrity, and others. These conditions need to be closely monitored and managed to ensure the patient's well-being."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with multiple medical complications. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and has since developed several other conditions including renal failure, atrial flutter, and altered mental status. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place. He has a history of anemia, acute pain, impaired physical mobility, altered nutrition, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, and decreased oxygen saturation. His laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient is also at risk for aspiration due to altered gag reflex and airway clearance.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's immobilization and risk factors, there is a potential for developing a pulmonary embolism.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): With the presence of multiple central lines, there is a risk of developing a catheter-related bloodstream infection.
4. Pressure ulcers: Due to the patient's impaired physical mobility and prolonged bed rest, there is a risk of developing pressure ulcers.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobil"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Respiratory failure/multifocal pneumonia:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE, ETT crusting. Tolerated couple of days
   extubated but reintubated for hypoxemic resp distress in setting of
   Enterobacter PNA (VAP v. HAP), now s/p trach. Restarted on abx for new
   LLL infiltrate, VAP v. HAP.
   - completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and cefepime on [**2143-8-19**], now
   restarted on same abx with plan for 14-day course to end [**2143-9-4**]
   - on trach mask during day, CPAP overnight
   - fentanyl boluses and ativan PRN for agitation
   - cont heparin gtt, holding coumadin with plans for possible tunneled
   line prior to discharge
   - has Passy-Muir valve; cont speech therapy
   - cont PT
   Fevers: Evidence of new pneumonia but afebrile x 24 hrs with stable WBC
   on abx. Also currently treating C. diff, PE. LFTs and amylase now
   increasing; unclear etiology although prior work-up 2 weeks ago with no
   evidence of abdominal process including cholecystitis and pancreatitis.
   Likely also had drug fever to zosyn in past.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC; f/u pending blood and sputum cx
   - vanc/cefepime as above pending culture data
   - cont vancomycin po for c.diff for 7 days post completion of
   antibiotic course for PNA
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - will discuss with PICC nurse whether could get new PICC today
   - will repeat RUQ ultrasound
   C. difficile colitis: On po vancomycin since [**2143-7-28**]
   - continue until 7 days post completion of antibiotic course, now
   [**2143-9-11**]
   Vagal episode:  Had been secondary to ETT plugging in past. Had brief
   episode yesterday, likely in setting of mucous plug
   - treating new pneumonia
   - suction prn
   Acute Renal Failure: Transitioned to HD [**2143-8-17**] and s/p new temp HD
   line placement [**2143-8-20**].
   - transition to HD on M/W/F
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   - f/u renal recs
   - will start sodium bicarbonate for acidosis per renal
   Anemia: Received 1U pRBC with Hct today likely reflecting appropriate
   bump although decreased from yesterday PM. Is on heparin gtt with
   persistently guaiac positive stools attributed to C. diff colitis; no
   other evidence of bleed or hemolysis. Anemia likely [**3-11**] frequent
   phelobotomy, renal failure, chronic illness, iron deficiency
   (iron/ferritin <10), and fluid shifts on HD.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements
   Sub-segmental PE: noted on CT Chest on [**8-4**].
   - cont heparin gtt while bridging to coumadin
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Rate more controlled
   - treating pain with fentanyl boluses (minimal requirement)
   - continue beta blocker (metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**])
   Pain: Unclear but appears to be complaining of back pain, likely
   musculoskeletal
   - cont fentanyl boluses prn
   Altered mental status: Likely large component from toxic metabolic
   encephalopathy. CT head without acute process. Now s/p Trach/PEG with
   significant improvement for past few days.
   - cont to monitor neuro status
   - cont trazodone to regulate sleep cycle, CPAP to rest overnight
   - OOB to chair, PT
   Weakness:  EMG suggests critical illness polyneuropathy is unlikely.
   Likely [**3-11**] deconditioning vs. medication induced.
   - Minimize sedating meds
   - PT
   Depression:
   - cont celexa 10mg daily

   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Respiratory failure/multifocal pneumonia:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE, ETT crusting. Tolerated couple of days
   extubated but reintubated for hypoxemic resp distress in setting of
   Enterobacter PNA (VAP v. HAP), now s/p trach. Restarted on abx for new
   LLL infiltrate, VAP v. HAP.
   - completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and cefepime on [**2143-8-19**], now
   restarted on same abx with plan for 14-day course to end [**2143-9-4**]
   - on trach mask during day, CPAP overnight
   - fentanyl boluses and ativan PRN for agitation
   - cont heparin gtt while bridging to coumadin
   - has Passy-Muir valve; cont speech therapy
   - cont PT
   Fevers: Evidence of new pneumonia but afebrile x 24 hrs with stable WBC
   on abx. Also currently treating C. diff, PE. LFTs and amylase now
   increasing; unclear etiology although prior work-up 2 weeks ago with no
   evidence of abdominal process including cholecystitis and pancreatitis.
   Likely also had drug fever to zosyn in past.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC; f/u pending blood and sputum cx
   - vanc/cefepime as above
   - cont vancomycin po for c.diff for 7 days post completion of
   antibiotic course for PNA
   - limit medications as much as possible
   C. difficile colitis: On po vancomycin since [**2143-7-28**]
   - continue until 7 days post completion of antibiotic course, now

   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   - f/u renal recs
   Anemia: Received 1U pRBC with Hct today likely reflecting appropriate
   bump although decreased from yesterday PM. Is on heparin gtt with
   persistently guaiac positive stools attributed to C. diff colitis; no
   other evidence of bleed or hemolysis. Anemia likely [**3-11**] frequent
   phelobotomy, renal failure, chronic illness, iron deficiency
   (iron/ferritin <10), and fluid shifts on HD.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, which has progressed to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was initially extubated but required reintubation due to hypoxemic respiratory distress caused by Enterobacter pneumonia (ventilator-associated pneumonia vs. hospital-acquired pneumonia). The patient underwent tracheostomy placement and is currently on a tracheal mask during the day and CPAP overnight.

The patient's recent events include receiving 1 unit of packed red blood cells, a new left lower lobe infiltrate, and an increase in liver function tests (LFTs) and amylase levels. The patient also has a history of Clostridium difficile colitis and is being treated with oral vancomycin. There is an ongoing investigation into the cause of the rising LFTs and amylase levels, with no evidence of abdominal process including cholecystitis and pancreatitis. The patient may have had a drug fever to Zosyn in the past.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition is complicated by ARDS, fluid overload, right lower lobe pulmonary embolism (PE), and endotracheal tube crusting. The patient has been reintubated and is currently on a tracheal mask with CPAP support.
2. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient has secondary to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, resulting in respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism (PE), acute kidney injury (ARF), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient was extubated on 08/10 but reintubated on 08/12 for work of breathing. A tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were performed on 07/08. The patient completed an antibiotic (ABX) course for Enterobacter pneumonia and now presents with new fever and left lower lobe infiltrate, being empirically treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is chronically colonized with Aspergillus. Heparin gtt is being administered for right lower lobe segmental PE, transitioning to warfarin after addressing the hemodialysis (HD) catheter. The patient is on tracheal mask ventilation during the day and pressure support ventilation (PSV) overnight. Fevers are presumed to be due to possible pneumonia, line infection, or gastrointestinal pathology. Vancomycin is being given for persistent C. diff coverage for 7 days after the last IV ABX. Anemia is likely due to prior gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), anemia of chronic disease, and possible renal failure. Hematoc"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A/H1N1, now presenting with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism (PE), acute kidney injury (ARF), and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient was extubated on 8/10 but required reintubation on 8/12 for work of breathing. A tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were performed on 7/8. The patient completed an antibiotic course for Enterobacter pneumonia but developed a new fever and left lower lobe infiltrate on 8/21, leading to empirical treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and cefepime. The patient is also being treated for chronic colonization with Aspergillus. He has a right lower lobe segmental PE and is on heparin infusion, which will transition to warfarin after addressing the hemodialysis catheter. The patient is on tracheal mask ventilation by day and pressure support ventilation (PSV) overnight. Fevers are being treated with antibiotics for possible pneumonia versus line versus gastrointestinal pathology. Persistent Clostridium difficile infection is being covered with oral vancomycin for 7 days after the last intravenous antibiotic. Anemia is likely due to gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia of chronic disease, and possible renal failure"

   Critical Care
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   He appears more lucid today and clearly has improving strength in his
   extremities. His secretions have decreased and he remains afebrile on
   new course of antibiotics.
   He will have a tunneled HD catheter today as well as a new PICC line
   placed. Hopefully this will allow transition to an LTAC early next week
   if there are no setbacks hemodynamically over the weekend. He will an
   8-10 days course of antibiotics for his VAP
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now with respiratory failure caused by ARDS. He has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, placement of a dialysis catheter, and administration of antibiotics for VAP. The patient's condition remains critical, and he continues to require life support measures such as CPAP and tracheal suctioning. His current medical issues include acute renal failure, C. difficile colitis, sub-segmental PE, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, pain, altered mental status, weakness, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration leading to respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. This condition requires close monitoring and prompt treatment.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of worsening renal failure, which may require ongoing dialysis support.
4. Clostridium Difficile Infection (CDI): The patient has been treated for CDI, and there is a risk of recurrence or complications related to this infection.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial flutter, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal failure, impaired physical mobility, anemia, acute pain, altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, altered nutrition, and risk for aspiration.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.0 C (100.4 F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/65 mmHg to 136/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient is on heparin sodium infusion and receives pantoprazole (Protonix) as part of their ICU medications.

The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, glucose levels, and lactic acid. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, but there are abnormalities in their liver function tests and kidney function.

Imaging studies reveal persistent gallbladder sludge without gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. There are no signs of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The portable chest X-ray shows no relevant changes, with monitoring and support devices in constant position. There is a small left basal pleural effusion present.

Microbiology tests indicate no microorganisms seen on gram stain of the sputum sample"

   65 year old male without clear PMH presenting with multifocal pneumonia
   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Respiratory failure/multifocal pneumonia:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE, ETT crusting. Tolerated couple of days
   extubated but reintubated for hypoxemic resp distress in setting of
   Enterobacter PNA (VAP v. HAP), now s/p trach. Restarted on abx for new
   LLL infiltrate, VAP v. HAP.
   - completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and cefepime on [**2143-8-19**], now
   restarted on same abx with plan for 14-day course to end [**2143-9-4**]
   - on trach mask during day, CPAP overnight
   - fentanyl boluses and ativan PRN for agitation
   - cont heparin gtt, holding coumadin with plans for possible tunneled
   line prior to discharge
   - has Passy-Muir valve; cont speech therapy
   - cont PT
   Fevers:  Low grade fever again yesterday.  RUQ ultrasound again
   negative.  Being treated for possible new pneumonia.  Would like to
   remove PICC line but unable to obtain new access yesterday.  Also
   currently treating previous clostridium difficile infection.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC; f/u pending blood and sputum cx
   - vanc/cefepime as above pending culture data
   - cont vancomycin po for c.diff for 7 days post completion of
   antibiotic course for PNA
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - will continue to attempt to obtain new PICC line
   - hepatitis serologies are pending given elevated LFTs
   C. difficile colitis: On po vancomycin since [**2143-7-28**]
   - continue until 7 days post completion of antibiotic course, now
   [**2143-9-11**]
   Acute Renal Failure: Transitioned to HD [**2143-8-17**] and s/p new temp HD
   line placement [**2143-8-20**].  Will ultimately need new tunneled line which
   likely will not be able to happen today given low grade fevers
   overnight.
   - transition to HD on M/W/F
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue start sodium bicarbonate for acidosis
   Anemia:  Stable over past 24 hours.  Does have persistently guaiac
   positive stools in the setting of heparin gtt.  No evidence of frank
   bleeding.  Anemia likely multifactorial secondary to  frequent
   phelobotomy, renal failure, chronic illness, iron deficiency
   (iron/ferritin <10), and fluid shifts on HD.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements
   Sub-segmental PE: noted on CT Chest on [**8-4**].
   - cont heparin gtt
   - currently holding coumadin given plans for tunneled line
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Rate more controlled
   - treating pain with fentanyl boluses (minimal requirement)
   - continue beta blocker (metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**])
   Pain: Unclear but appears to be complaining of back pain, likely
   musculoskeletal
   - cont fentanyl boluses prn
   Altered mental status: Significantly improved.  Likely large component
   from toxic metabolic encephalopathy. CT head without acute process.
   - cont to monitor neuro status
   - cont trazodone to regulate sleep cycle, CPAP to rest overnight
   - OOB to chair, PT
   Weakness:  EMG suggests critical illness polyneuropathy is unlikely.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fluid overload, right lower lobe pulmonary embolism (PE), endotracheal tube (ETT) crusting, and tracheostomy. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management. The patient's current condition includes low-grade fever, stable hematocrit, persistent gallbladder sludge, altered mental status, anemia, acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis (HD), atrial flutter, back pain, critical illness polyneuropathy, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A and now has a new left lower lobe infiltrate. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) versus hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics for both possibilities.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure has progressed to ARDS, which is a serious condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a subsegmental PE noted on the CT chest. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin is being continued.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's"

   Acute Renal Failure: Transitioned to HD [**2143-8-17**] and s/p new temp HD
   line placement [**2143-8-20**].  Will ultimately need new tunneled line which
   likely will not be able to happen today given low grade fevers
   overnight.
   - transition to HD on M/W/F
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue start sodium bicarbonate for acidosis
   Anemia:  Stable over past 24 hours.  Does have persistently guaiac
   positive stools in the setting of heparin gtt.  No evidence of frank
   bleeding.  Anemia likely multifactorial secondary to  frequent
   phelobotomy, renal failure, chronic illness, iron deficiency
   (iron/ferritin <10), and fluid shifts on HD.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and other medical conditions. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for different infections, including influenza A, VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), and C. difficile infection. He also has acute renal failure and is undergoing hemodialysis. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on tracheal mask. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal persistent gallbladder sludge and a small left basal pleural effusion. The patient's medications include heparin, pantoprazole, fentanyl, ativan, and vancomycin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. C. difficile infection: The patient has been treated for C. difficile infection and is on vancomycin to prevent recurrence.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he requires hemodialysis. There is a risk of further"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fluid overload, right lower lobe pulmonary embolism (PE), and endotracheal tube (ETT) crusting. The patient was initially extubated but reintubated for hypoxemic respiratory distress. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for new left lower lobe infiltrate, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) versus hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient also has a history of Clostridium difficile infection, acute renal failure, atrial flutter, sub-segmental PE, back pain, altered mental status, weakness, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired physical mobility due to prolonged bed rest and muscle weakness.
2. Anemia, other, due to frequent phlebotomy, renal failure, chronic illness, iron deficiency, and fluid shifts on hemodialysis (HD).
3. Alteration in nutrition due to limited oral intake and dependence on tube feeds.
4. Acute pain from various causes such as musculoskeletal back pain and potential post-procedural pain.
5. Impaired skin integrity due to prolonged immobility and pressure ulcers.

   - f/u renal recs
   - continue start sodium bicarbonate for acidosis
   Anemia:  Stable over past 24 hours.  Does have persistently guaiac
   positive stools in the setting of heparin gtt.  No evidence of frank
   bleeding.  Anemia likely multifactorial secondary to  frequent
   phelobotomy, renal failure, chronic illness, iron deficiency

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, which led to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was reintubated due to hypoxemic respiratory distress.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) vs. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP or HAP. The current treatment involves restarting antibiotics to cover for new pneumonia.

3. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient is being treated for a previous C. difficile infection and will continue taking oral vancomycin for an additional 7 days after completing the antibiotic course for pneumonia.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, which is likely multifactorial in origin, including fluid overload, sepsis, and nephrotoxic medications. The patient has transitioned to hemodialysis (HD) and requires a new tunneled line for ongoing renal support.

5. Subsegmental Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has evidence of a subsegmental PE on a CT chest scan, and anticoagulation therapy with heparin has been initiated.

6. Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter: The patient has had episodes of atrial flutter"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fluid overload, right lower lobe pulmonary embolism (PE), and endotracheal tube (ETT) crusting. He was initially extubated but reintubated due to hypoxemic respiratory distress. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for both ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He also has a history of Clostridium difficile infection and renal failure. The patient's current condition includes impaired physical mobility, anemia, altered mental status, acute pain, herpes zoster, impaired skin integrity, atrial flutter, pulmonary embolism, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is expected to stay in the ICU for an extended period.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's history of ARDS, pneumonia, and PE increases the risk of further pulmonary complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), aspiration pneumonia, or worsening of ARDS.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, which increases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and the need for continued dialysis.
3. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate hepatic dysfunction, which can be caused by sepsis, medication toxicity, or other underlying conditions"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of H1N1 infection, which led to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including pneumonia, enterococcal bacteremia, acute kidney injury, pancreatitis, Clostridium difficile infection, and hepatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and ARDS put him at risk for developing pneumonia. His current infection with Enterobacter species indicates a potential bacterial infection in the lungs.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest AKI, which may be due to sepsis or direct renal injury from ARDS.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase levels indicate possible pancreatitis, which could be related to his recent infections or other factors.
4. Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI): The patient's history of antibiotic use and symptoms suggest CDI, which is a common cause of colitis in hospitalized patients.
5. Hepatitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes suggest hepatitis, possibly secondary to sepsis or another underlying cause.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and central venous catheters"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of H1N1 flu, CAP complicated by ARDS, who underwent a tracheostomy and is currently on a tracheal mask. The patient has been admitted with chronic respiratory failure and has experienced multiple complications during his hospitalization.

The patient initially presented with superinfection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) twice, and pulmonary embolism (PE) while on anticoagulation therapy. He also had transaminitis, pancreatitis without a clear etiology, Clostridium difficile colitis, acute renal failure (ARF) with dense acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

The patient's current condition shows improvement in respiratory failure as he is afebrile for 36 hours and has a SpO2 of 98% on the tracheal mask. His blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits. However, the patient still requires ongoing critical care support.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The creatinine levels are fluctuating, with a highest value of 8.8 on 8/22 and a current value of 6.7. The glucose levels are elevated, ranging from 300 to 166 mg/dL. Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase,"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of H1N1 flu, secondary superinfection, respiratory failure, and previous ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on day 4 of empiric therapy for VAP. The patient also has pulmonary embolism (PE) on anticoagulation, elevated INR, transaminitis, pancreatitis, Clostridium difficile colitis, acute kidney injury (ARF) with dense acute tubular necrosis (ATN) on hemodialysis (HD), atrial fibrillation (Afib/aflutter), and critical care myopathy.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/39 to 148/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on tracheostomy mask. The patient's general appearance is well appearing and not in distress.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine, hyperglycemia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. Imaging studies show no evidence of pericardial effusion on CT chest.

The assessment and plan include the patient's ongoing respiratory failure due to ARDS secondary to Enterobacter VAP, which has been completed with previous courses of antibiotics. The patient is currently on day 4 of empiric therapy for VAP. If there is evidence of treatment failure, consideration will be given to resistance to cephalosporins due to the previous Enterobacter isolate. The patient also has PE, for which he is on anticoagulation. Transaminitis is trending down, but remnant alkaline phosphatase elevation persists. Pancreatitis enzymes remain elevated but do not seem to be consistently increasing. There is no clear etiology from the review of medications. C. difficile colitis is being treated with p.o. vancomycin, and the plan is to complete 7 days post-cefepime. ARF is caused by dense ATN, and the patient is on HD. Atrial fibrillation/aflutter is stable on rate control and anticoagulation. Critical care myopathy is improving. Depression management involves citalopram (celexa)."

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of H1N1 infection, chronic respiratory failure, and ARDS. He underwent a tracheostomy and is tolerating the tracheal mask. The patient has experienced several medical complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), acute renal failure (ARF), atrial flutter (AFLUTTER), and a fall in hematocrit. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117/39 mmHg to 168/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the tracheal mask. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter, and he has a weight loss of 13.5 kg since admission. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, amylase, and lipase levels. 

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including antibiotics for VAP, pain management, and antipsychotic medication. He is also on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to acute renal failure"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of H1N1 flu, chronic respiratory failure, and previous hospitalizations. The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments, including tracheostomy, PICC line placement, and antibiotic therapy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 148/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on tracheostomy mask. The patient is also on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (9.5 K/uL), elevated hematocrit (25.3%), elevated platelet count (246 K/uL), and elevated creatinine level (6.7 mg/dL). Other lab values indicate elevated liver enzymes, elevated lipase, and elevated lactate levels.

The patient's medical history is significant for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) twice, pulmonary embolism (PE), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and cefepime.

The patient's current assessment includes ongoing respiratory failure, possible ventilator-associated complications, potential antibiotic resistance, elevated INR, pancreatitis, Clostridium difficile colitis, chronic kidney disease requiring hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and depression.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory deterioration, development of multi-drug resistant organisms, worsening kidney function, Clostridium difficile infection, and cardiovascular events related to atrial fibrillation.

Overall, the patient presents with multiple comorbidities and ongoing medical issues requiring close monitoring and management in the ICU setting."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, which has progressed to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was initially extubated but reintubated due to hypoxemic respiratory distress and enterobacter pneumonia (ventilator-associated pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia). The patient underwent tracheostomy placement and is currently on invasive ventilation.

The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, for the pneumonia. However, new infiltrates have developed, leading to the restart of these antibiotics along with the addition of ciprofloxacin for double coverage. The patient's condition is being monitored through frequent chest X-rays and mini bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) versus bronchoscopy.

The patient also has a diagnosis of Clostridium difficile colitis, for which he has been on oral vancomycin since July 28th. This treatment will continue until seven days post completion of the antibiotic course.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure and is undergoing hemodialysis three times a week. He will need a new tunneled line placement in the future.

The patient's anemia is multifactorial, including frequent phlebotomy, renal failure, chronic illness, iron deficiency, and fluid shifts during hemodialysis. He is being managed with daily hematocrit monitoring, transfusion threshold of less than"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of renal failure, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. He has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial flutter, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple other medical complications. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 162/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on tracheal mask ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's prolonged use of invasive ventilation increases the risk of developing pneumonia due to potential colonization or aspiration of bacteria.
2. Ventilator-associated events: Given the patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of ventilator-associated events such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), or ventilator disconnection leading to hypoxemia.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of DVT formation, which may lead to a potentially life-threatening PE if a clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.
4. C. difficile infection: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and use of antibiotics may increase the risk of developing a C. difficile infection,"

   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Respiratory failure/multifocal pneumonia:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE, ETT crusting. Tolerated couple of days
   extubated but reintubated for hypoxemic resp distress in setting of
   Enterobacter PNA (VAP v. HAP), now s/p trach. Restarted on abx for new
   LLL infiltrate, VAP v. HAP.
   - completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and cefepime on [**2143-8-19**], now
   restarted on same abx with plan for 8-day course to end [**2143-8-28**]
   - on trach mask tolerating well 24 hours a day
   - fentanyl boluses and ativan PRN for agitation
   - cont heparin gtt, holding coumadin with plans for possible tunneled
   line prior to discharge
   - has Passy-Muir valve; cont speech therapy
   - cont PT
   Fevers:  Low grade fever again yesterday.   Being treated for possible
   new pneumonia.  Tunnelled line changed [**8-19**] and PICC changed [**8-23**].
   Also currently treating previous clostridium difficile infection.
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC; f/u pending blood and sputum cx
   - vanc/cefepime as above until [**2143-8-28**]
   - cont vancomycin po for c.diff for 7 days post completion of
   antibiotic course for PNA
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - hepatitis serologies are negative
   Elevated transaminases/pancreatic enzymes:   Unclear etiology.  No
   abdominal pain.  Hepatitis serologies negative.  Multiple RUQ
   ultrasounds and HIDA scan negative.  Likely related to medications
   versus feedings.
   - review medication list
   - discuss with nutrition
   - trend
   - hepatitis serologies are negative
   - consider hepatology curbside for elevated transaminases
   C. difficile colitis: On po vancomycin since [**2143-7-28**]
   - continue until 7 days post completion of antibiotic course, now
   [**2143-9-11**]
   Acute Renal Failure: Transitioned to HD [**2143-8-17**] and s/p new temp HD
   line placement [**2143-8-20**].  Will ultimately need new tunneled line.
   - transition to HD on M/W/F
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   - f/u renal recs
   Anemia:  Stable over past 24 hours.  Does have persistently guaiac
   positive stools in the setting of heparin gtt.  No evidence of frank
   bleeding.  Anemia likely multifactorial secondary to  frequent
   phelobotomy, renal failure, chronic illness, iron deficiency
   (iron/ferritin <10), and fluid shifts on HD.

   Pain: Unclear but appears to be complaining of back pain, likely
   musculoskeletal
   - cont fentanyl boluses prn
   Altered mental status: Significantly improved.  Likely large component
   from toxic metabolic encephalopathy. CT head without acute process.
   - cont to monitor neuro status
   - cont trazodone to regulate sleep cycle, no longer receiving CPAP
   overnight

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a complex medical history, presenting with multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now with respiratory failure due to ARDS. He has been intubated multiple times, including a recent reintubation for hypoxemic respiratory distress. The patient has been treated for possible new pneumonia, with ongoing antibiotic therapy, and also has a history of Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's condition is further complicated by acute renal failure, for which he is on hemodialysis three times a week. He also has anemia, likely multifactorial in origin, and requires iron supplements. The patient has a sub-segmental pulmonary embolism, for which he is being treated with heparin.

He is experiencing pain, likely musculoskeletal in nature, and has had low-grade fevers, which may indicate a new pneumonia. His mental status has improved significantly, but he is still at risk for toxic metabolic encephalopathy. He also has weakness, which is likely due to deconditioning or medication-induced factors.

The patient's medications include vancomycin and cefepime for pneumonia, heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and trazodone for sleep regulation.

Overall, the patient's medical complications include ARDS, acute renal failure, anemia, sub-segmental pulmonary embolism, and potential new pneumonia."

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now with respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fluid overload, right lower lobe pulmonary embolism (PE), and endotracheal tube crusting. The patient was extubated but reintubated for hypoxemic respiratory distress in the setting of Enterobacter pneumonia (ventilator-associated pneumonia versus hospital-acquired pneumonia). He is currently tolerating a tracheostomy and has had low-grade fevers, on antibiotics for pneumonia given chest X-ray infiltrate. The patient also has Clostridium difficile infection and is on oral vancomycin since July 28th. He transitioned to hemodialysis (HD) on August 17th and had a new temporary HD line placement on August 20th. The patient will ultimately need a new tunneled line. He has stable anemia, sub-segmental PE, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, back pain (likely musculoskeletal), altered mental status (improved), weakness (likely deconditioning vs. medication-induced), and depression. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including pain management with fentanyl boluses, sedation with lorazepam, and antianxiety medication with citalopram.

   performed an independent physical exam.  I would agree with the
   findings above and would add the following comments.
   Pt is a 65 yo male  with H1N1 influenza now s/p trach with hospital
   course complicated by acute renal failure.
   Recently
Patient has had persistent fevers and diagnosed [**8-19**] with
   VAP
Enterobacter on BAL and Vanco/Cefepime Rx in place patient has had
   continued improvement in fever curve over past days.

   WBC-11
   In summary
Pt is 65 yo male with prolonged hospitalization now with
   tracheostomy and off of mechanical ventilation support with trach
   mask.
   1)Renal Failure-
   -Await placement of dialysis access with tunneled line
   2)Fever-Multiple possible sources, fever, clinical status has improved
   but patient with increase in WBC count across time.
   -Continue Antibiotics
   -CVL
s are new since ABX
   -No evidence of DVT on exam and is with anticoagulation
   -No evidence of sinus discharge
   -Will have to follow fever curve trend across time on restart of
   antibiotics
   -Will resend U/A
   -Re-check LFT
s and Amylase, Lipase
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a hospitalization history of H1N1 flu, secondary superinfection, respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) twice, and pulmonary embolism on anticoagulation. The patient is currently experiencing low-grade fevers, mild leukocytosis, and a new left lower lobe infiltrate.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure - The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is still dependent on a tracheostomy and trach mask.
2. VAP - The patient has had two previous episodes of VAP, and there is a concern for treatment failure. Resistance to cephalosporins given prior to the Enterobacter isolate may be considered.
3. PE - The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is on anticoagulation. INR levels are currently elevated, and plans are in place to bridge on heparin when subtherapeutic.
4. Transaminitis - The patient has transaminitis, which may be due to various causes such as viral hepatitis or drug-induced liver injury.
5. Pancreatitis - The patient's amylase and lipase levels are elevated, suggesting pancreatitis. However, no clear etiology has been identified.
6. C. difficile colitis - The patient is being treated with oral vancomycin for C. difficile colitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with H1N1 flu, secondary superinfection, and respiratory failure. He has a history of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) twice and pulmonary embolism (PE), for which he is on anticoagulation. The patient presents with low-grade fever, mild leukocytosis, and a new left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate on chest X-ray. He is currently on invasive ventilation and has been weaned off sedation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 165/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the tracheostomy mask.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with normal potassium and sodium levels. His liver function tests (LFTs) are slightly elevated, and his kidney function tests indicate acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 8.8 mg/dL and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 16.4 mL/min/1.73m2. The patient also has elevated levels of lactate, lactic acid, and lipase.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted with H1N1 flu, secondary superinfection, respiratory failure. He has a history of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) twice and pulmonary embolism (PE) on anticoagulation. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has low-grade fevers, mild leukocytosis, and new left lower lobe infiltrate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has had VAP twice before and is now showing signs of a new LLL infiltrate. This could indicate another episode of VAP, which can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of mortality.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE and is currently on anticoagulation. There is a risk of recurrence or complications related to PE.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, indicating potential liver dysfunction. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's amylase and lipase levels are oscillating in the 300s and 600s range, respectively. This suggests ongoing inflammation in the pancreas, although no clear etiology has been identified yet.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of H1N1 flu, secondary superinfection, respiratory failure, VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) twice, and PE (pulmonary embolism) on anticoagulation. The patient is currently intubated and receiving invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 165/61 to 138/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a tracheostomy mask.

Physical examination reveals well-appearing patient speaking with pressured speech, clear lungs bilaterally, 1+ lower extremity edema, and mild abdominal distension. The tracheostomy site appears clean and dry.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 4.7 to 11.2 thousand/mm3, elevated hematocrit levels between 16.4 and 25.3%, and platelet count between 233 and 285 thousand/mm3. Blood chemistry values indicate elevated creatinine levels ranging from 4.1 to 8.8 mg/dL, blood glucose levels between 145 and 166 mg/dL, and liver enzymes ALT/AST ranging from 39 to 75 units/L.

   secondary initially to influenza A now with respiratory failure c/b
   ARDS.
   Respiratory failure/multifocal pneumonia:  Secondary to influenza A,
   ARDS, fluid overload, RLL PE, ETT crusting. Tolerated couple of days
   extubated but reintubated for hypoxemic resp distress in setting of
   Enterobacter PNA (VAP v. HAP), now s/p trach. Restarted on abx for new
   LLL infiltrate, VAP v. HAP.  Given persistant low grade fevers would
   add FQ for double coverage.
   - completed an 8-day course of vancomycin and cefepime on [**2143-8-19**],
   - new infiltrate on [**8-20**] re-started on Vanc/cefepime
   - Start Ciprofloxacin for double coverage
   - CXR and if worsening infiltrate would get MINI BAL vs BRONCH
   - tolerating trach mask x 24 hr/d
   - fentanyl boluses and ativan PRN for agitation
   - cont heparin gtt, holding coumadin given plan for possible tunneled
   line prior to discharge
   - has Passy-Muir valve; cont speech therapy
   - cont PT
   Fevers: Cont to have low-grade fever; on abx for pneumonia given CXR
   infiltrate. Cont treatment for C. diff while on abx.  Tunnelled line
   changed [**8-19**] and PICC changed [**8-23**].
   - cont to trend fever curve and WBC; f/u pending cx
   - vanc/cefepime/Cipro as above
   - cont vancomycin po for c.diff for 7 days post completion of
   antibiotic course for PNA
   - CXR and mini BAL vs bronch as above.
   - limit medications as much as possible
   - hepatitis serologies are negative
   Elevated transaminases/pancreatic enzymes:   Unclear etiology.  No
   abdominal pain.  Hepatitis serologies negative.  Multiple RUQ
   ultrasounds and HIDA scan negative.  Likely related to medications
   versus feedings.
   - review medication list
   - discuss tube feeds with nutrition
   - trend labs
   - hepatitis serologies are negative, iron labs nl
   - f/u AMA, [**Doctor First Name **], cerruloplasmin
   - consider hepatology curbside for elevated transaminases
   C. difficile colitis: On po vancomycin since [**2143-7-28**]
   - continue until 7 days post completion of antibiotic course, now
   [**2143-9-11**]
   Acute Renal Failure: Transitioned to HD [**2143-8-17**] and s/p new temp HD
   line placement [**2143-8-20**].  Will ultimately need new tunneled line.
   - transition to HD on M/W/F
   - given minimal UOP, straight cath 2x/weekly
   - f/u renal recs
   Anemia:  Stable.  Does have persistently guaiac positive stools in the
   setting of heparin gtt.  No evidence of frank bleeding.  Anemia likely
   multifactorial secondary to  frequent phelobotomy, renal failure,
   chronic illness, iron deficiency (iron/ferritin <10), and fluid shifts
   on HD.
   - daily Hct
   - transfusion threshold <21
   - cont iron supplements
   Sub-segmental PE: noted on CT Chest on [**8-4**].
   - cont heparin gtt
   - currently holding coumadin given plans for tunneled line
   Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter: Rate more controlled
   - treating pain with fentanyl boluses (minimal requirement)
   - continue beta blocker (metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 7**])
   Pain: Unclear but appears to be complaining of back pain, likely
   musculoskeletal
   - transition to PO regimen for pain
   Altered mental status: Significantly improved.  Likely large component
   from toxic metabolic encephalopathy. CT head without acute process.
   - cont to monitor neuro status
   - cont trazodone to regulate sleep cycle, no longer receiving CPAP
   overnight
   - OOB to chair, PT
   Weakness:  Likely [**3-11**] deconditioning vs. medication induced. Improving.
   - Minimize sedating meds

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS. He was initially extubated but reintubated for hypoxemic respiratory distress. The patient has undergone tracheostomy and is currently on antibiotics for a new left lower lobe infiltrate, which may be ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). He also has C. difficile colitis, acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, anemia, subsegmental pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, back pain, altered mental status, weakness, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of developing VAP. The new left lower lobe infiltrate may indicate VAP or HAP.
2. C. difficile colitis: The patient has been treated with vancomycin for C. difficile infection since July 28th and will continue until 7 days post completion of the antibiotic course.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, requiring hemodialysis. He needs a tunneled line placement due to frequent phlebotomy and chronic illness.
4. Anemia: The patient has guaiac positive stools while on heparin gtt, suggesting possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Anemia may be multif"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of multifocal pneumonia secondary to influenza A, now with respiratory failure due to ARDS. He was initially extubated but reintubated for hypoxemic respiratory distress caused by Enterobacter pneumonia (VAP vs. HAP). The patient underwent tracheostomy and is currently on antibiotics for new left lower lobe infiltrate, VAP vs. HAP. Ciprofloxacin was added for double coverage. A mini-BAL or bronch will be performed if there is worsening infiltrate. The patient is tolerating tracheostomy and is on speech therapy. He is receiving fentanyl boluses and ativan PRN for agitation, and heparin gtt is being continued. A tunneled line has been placed, and a PICC line was changed on 08/23. The patient has had multiple episodes of acute renal failure, requiring hemodialysis. He also has anemia, sub-segmental PE, atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, pain, altered mental status, weakness, and depression. The patient's condition is complex, involving multiple organ systems, including the respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular systems. Potential complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia, further deterioration of renal function, progression of anemia, thromboembolic events, cardiac arrhythmias, and potential infections related to indwelling"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted with H1N1 flu, secondary superinfection, respiratory failure, and other complications. He has a history of chronic respiratory failure, multiple ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) episodes, pulmonary embolism (PE), and other medical conditions.

24-hour events include fever with increased white blood cell count and left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and his vital signs are stable.

The patient has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics for presumed VAP, proton pump inhibitors, and anticoagulation therapy for PE.

Lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, creatinine, blood glucose, and liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal a new LLL infiltrate on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Chronic respiratory failure due to H1N1 influenza and multiple VAP episodes.
   - The patient is stable on the tracheostomy mask and pulmonary toilet.
   - Consider bronchoscopy to evaluate the new LLL infiltrate.
   - Broaden antibiotic coverage to include extended gram-negative rod coverage.
2. Probable urinary tract infection (UTI) with pending cultures.
   - Adding ciprofloxacin for extended GNR coverage.
3. Transaminitis, likely due to sludging, which is now downtrending.
   - Continue trend monitoring.
4. Right lower lobe ("

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. 

1. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has an ongoing urinary tract infection as indicated by the positive urine analysis. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.

2. Impaired Physical Mobility: The patient's physical mobility may be limited due to being bedridden in the ICU. This can lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pressure ulcers, and muscle weakness.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. This could be due to chronic disease or blood loss. Monitoring for symptoms of anemia and providing appropriate treatment is important.

4. Acute Pain: The patient is experiencing acute pain, which could be caused by various factors such as wounds, procedures, or underlying conditions. Managing the patient's pain is crucial for their comfort and recovery.

5. Impaired Skin Integrity: Prolonged bed rest and immobility can lead to skin breakdown and pressure ulcers. Regular turning and pressure relief measures should be implemented to prevent skin complications.

6. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to medication side effects, sepsis, or other underlying conditions. Close monitoring of mental status changes is essential to identify any potential deterioration.

7. Airway Protection: The patient has difficulty protecting their airway,"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure secondary to influenza, bacterial pneumonia, ARDS, and other complications. The patient has been admitted to the MICU for over a month and has undergone several interventions.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the current status and history include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to the underlying influenza and bacterial pneumonia. Continued monitoring and management of the patient's ventilation support and oxygenation are essential.

2. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient has been treated with vancomycin and cefepime for an extended period. It is crucial to monitor the patient's response to the antibiotic therapy and ensure appropriate coverage for any potential antibiotic-resistant organisms.

3. Central venous catheter-related infections: The patient has had multiple central venous catheters placed, including a tunneled line and PICC line. Regular surveillance for signs of infection, such as fever and elevated white blood cell count, should be conducted.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a subsegmental PE noted on CT Chest. To prevent further thrombotic events, systemic anticoagulation with heparin and initiation of warfarin for long-term anticoagulation are recommended.

5. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): The patient is on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). Close monitoring of renal function,"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male admitted with H1N1 flu, secondary superinfection, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, repeated ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), pulmonary embolism (PE), transaminitis, C. difficile colitis, acute renal failure/chronic kidney disease (ARF/ESRD), atrial fibrillation/aflutter, critical illness myopathy, depression, and anemia.

The patient's current condition includes being on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube, hemodynamic monitoring, and intravenous (IV) fluids. The patient is also receiving multiple medications for various conditions, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, proton pump inhibitors, and renal replacement therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and medical history include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of repeated VAP episodes. Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing another episode of VAP.

2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE. The risk of another PE may be increased due to immobilization, central venous catheters, and other risk factors.

3. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a diagnosis of C. difficile colitis. There is a risk of recurrence or worsening of symptoms if appropriate measures are not taken to"

   I was physically present with the MICU housestaff team on this date for
   discussion of the above history, exam and assessment and plan with
   which I agree.  I independently examined the patient and would add the
   following comments: 65 yo male admitted with H1N1 flu /PNA complicated
   by secondary infection, ARDS, respiratory failure now s/p trach,
   multiorgan failure including ARF, several VAP's, PE's. He underwent
   placement of a tunneled line yesterday. Issues include:
   1. Acute respiratory failure: improving, pt on Trach collar without
   mech.ventilation for the past several days, has PMV.
   2. VAP- To complete a course of Cefipime  and Cipro today for
   Enterobacter
   3.  PE- on Coumadin, INR adjusted as needed
   4. ARF: receiving HD with tunneled line placed yesterday.
   Appears appropriate for transfer to long term facility.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male admitted with H1N1 flu and secondary superinfection, respiratory failure. The patient has a history of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) twice, pulmonary embolism (PE), and repeated VAP. The patient's current conditions include chronic respiratory failure, presumed VAP, probable urinary tract infection (UTI), transaminitis, right lower lobe (RLL) segmental PE, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis, acute renal failure/chronic kidney disease (ARF/ESRD), atrial fibrillation (aflutter), critical illness myopathy, depression, and anemia.

The patient's ongoing ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and various prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with systemic anticoagulation, stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and VAP prevention with head-of-bed elevation and oral care.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include worsening respiratory failure, progression of VAP, development of antibiotic resistance, worsening of UTI, exacerbation of C. diff colitis, further deterioration of renal function, thromboembolic events, progression of atrial fibrillation, worsening of myopathy, and worsening of anemia.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs"
