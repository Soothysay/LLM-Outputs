   Assessment and Plan
   # Dyspnea: Given the gradual worsening of his DOE and SOB over [**5-18**]
   months time, I feel that his underlying SOB is [**1-12**] worsening AS as well
   as CHF. His BNP is markedly elevated above last month (8462 today, 3822
   [**12-19**]). Unfortunately, we do not have recent EF information. There may
   be a component of PNA on top of this (given fever to 102 and dry
   cough); however, his CXR is not particularly impressive for infiltrate.
   Although he is wheezy on exam and COPD exacerbation +/- bronchitis are
   on the differential, I feel that this is less likely. His wheezes are
   more likely cardiogenic.  PE remains on the differential; however, no
   clinical signs of pleuritic chest pain or DVT

   atypical pna

   sepsis. He has had no new changes in BP meds recently. Per his wife, he
   has recently lost 5 pounds, so intravascular depletion is also
   possible. Low clinical suspicion for ACS.
   - hold on further IVF for now given pulm edema

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of dyspnea. He has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, and rheumatic heart disease. He is currently on multiple medications including lasix, piperacillin, and coumadin.

24-hour events include the placement of a right internal jugular (RIJ) line and the initiation of a lasix drip. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 17 mmHg. He has a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit and dry cough, which may indicate pneumonia (PNA). The patient also has hypotension, with a baseline blood pressure in the 110s and today being more hypotensive. He has lost 5 pounds recently, suggesting intravascular depletion.

The patient's blood work shows elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, indicating worsening congestive heart failure (CHF). His creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, indicating possible chronic kidney disease (CRF). The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on coumadin for anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to worsening COPD exacerbation, bronchitis, or cardiogenic causes.
2. Sepsis secondary to PNA or other infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of COPD, emphysema, asbestos exposure, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, rheumatic heart disease with moderate aortic stenosis, and possible congestive heart failure (CHF) based on BNP levels. He has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hypotension, and possible sepsis. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 111/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His physical examination reveals crackles on auscultation of the chest, right upper extremity weakness, and muscle wasting. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. The patient's plan includes treating pneumonia empirically, monitoring diuresis, repeating echocardiogram, and consulting with cardiology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed. It is essential to provide appropriate respiratory support and monitor oxygenation levels.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fever may indicate the possibility of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and timely administration of antibiotics are crucial in managing sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. On admission, he was placed on a rapid infusion jugular (RIJ) and started on a furosemide (Lasix) drip. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is currently 17. The patient has not experienced any known drug allergies.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is in the ICU for acute respiratory failure. This condition can be potentially life-threatening and may require mechanical ventilation support.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, with readings ranging from 74/42 mmHg to 111/62 mmHg. Hypotension can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke. It may also cause hemodynamic instability.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's CVP is elevated at 17, indicating possible fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's labs show imbalances in sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO43-) levels. These imbalances need to be corrected to maintain proper cellular function.
6. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's serum creatinine level is elevated at 1.4, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly is important.
7. Coagulation Abnormalities: The patient's PT/PTT/INR values are outside the normal range, suggesting coagulation abnormalities. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.
8. Infection Risk: Prolonged mechanical ventilation and ICU stay increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other infections. Prophylactic measures should be implemented to reduce the risk.
9. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings or pharmacological therapy, should be considered.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential medical complications. The patient's clinical status should be continuously monitored and managed appropriately."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Dyspnea: Given the gradual worsening of his DOE and SOB over [**5-18**]
   months time, I feel that his underlying SOB is [**1-12**] worsening AS as well
   as CHF. His BNP is markedly elevated above last month (8462 today, 3822
   [**12-19**]). Unfortunately, we do not have recent EF information. There may
   be a component of PNA on top of this (given fever to 102 and dry
   cough); however, his CXR is not particularly impressive for infiltrate.
   Although he is wheezy on exam and COPD exacerbation +/- bronchitis are
   on the differential, I feel that this is less likely. His wheezes are
   more likely cardiogenic.  PE remains on the differential; however, no
   clinical signs of pleuritic chest pain or DVT
   - would treat empirically for PNA with Vanc/Zosyn. Low suspicion for
   atypical pna
   - check urine legionella, but would not cover for now
   - lasix gtt tonight with goal I/O 1L tonight as tolerated by BP (he may
   need pressors to diurese)
   - nebs as needed, advair
   - needs echo in AM
   - cards consult in AM (email Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in AM)
   - d/w pulmonary (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 712**]
   - guaifen and tessalon perles for cough
   .
   # Hypotension: Baseline BP in 110's and today has been more hypotensive
   than baseline. He has had one temp to 102 and concern for sepsis given
   minimal improvement with 1.5L NS. He has had no new changes in BP meds
   recently. Per his wife, he is 5 pounds down today compared to
   yesterday, so intravascular depletion is also possible. Low clinical
   suspicion for ACS
   - hold on further IVF for now given pulm edema
   - continue to monitor with goal MAP>60
   - if persistantly hypotensive, would start pressors and use levophed if
   needed for diuresis as above
   - CVL placed in RIJ
   .
   # ARF: Per wife, recently 1.3 at OSH a few weeks ago. Likely
   intravascularly dry but total body overloaded or [**1-12**] poor forward flow
   - trend creatinine
   - urine lytes
   .
   # AS: from rheumatic heart disease. Echo in [**Hospital1 **] last year with moderate
   AS (1-1.2 cm), EF 55%
   - repeat echo in AM
   - would avoid nitrates and venodilators as he is preload dependent
   - d/w cards
   .
   # CAD: No clinical signs today of ACS.
   - continue statin
   - hold BP meds for now, but consider restarting ACEI to reduce
   afterload before BB
   - clarify with cards why no ASA!
   .
   # Afib on coumadin:
   - holding BB for now given BP
   - continue coumadin
   .
   # Emphysema/asbestos exposure:
   - continue nebs
   - continue advair
   - d/w pulmonary in AM

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including rheumatic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, which is not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/62 mmHg to 112/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. He is currently on a furosemide (Lasix) drip and has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15 mmHg. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (191 K/uL), low hemoglobin (10.3 g/dL), elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, and abnormal kidney function with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the bilateral lower lung fields, weakness in the right upper extremity, muscle wasting, and warm skin without rash. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary concerns include dyspnea, hypotension, acute renal failure, aortic stenosis, and possible coronary artery disease. The physician suspects congestive heart failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 73 yo M c dyspnea and O2 requirement [**1-12**] worsening AS and
   resultant CHF and COPD AE. Vol sensitive hypotension on lasix ggt.
   # Dyspnea: Given the gradual worsening of his DOE and SOB over [**5-18**]
   months time, I feel that his underlying SOB is [**1-12**] worsening AS as well
   as CHF. His BNP is markedly elevated above last month (8462 today, 3822
   [**12-19**]). Although he is wheezy on exam and COPD exacerbation +/-
   bronchitis are on the differential, I feel that this is less likely.
   His wheezes are more likely cardiogenic. Stopped Vanc/Zosyn bc no
   evidence of PNA. Significant element of pulmonary edema.
   - lasix gtt titrate to BP with goal 1-2L neg for pulm edema (no lasix
   bolus bc of sensitivity and concern for HoTN)
   - cont nebs of advair, ipratropium, albuterol
   - Azithromycin and steriods for COPD exacerbation
   - tapering steroids now Prednisone 60mg PO daily
   - guaifen and tessalon perles for cough
   .
   # dCHF / AS
 [**1-12**] rheumatic heart disease. elevated BNP and EF 50% with
   interval worsening of AS (1.0 cm2), mild AR/MR, new pHTN
   - vol dependent cardiac status bc moderate AS
   - f/u cards recs
   .
   # Hypotension: Baseline BP in 110's and today has been more hypotensive
   than baseline. He has had one temp to 102 and   could be concerning for
   sepsis. He has had no new changes in BP meds recently. Per his wife, he
   has recently lost 5 pounds, so intravascular depletion is also
   possible. Low clinical suspicion for ACS.
   - hold on further IVF for now given pulm edema
   - continue to monitor diuresis with goal MAP>60
   - if persistantly hypotensive, would start pressors and use levophed if
   needed for diuresis as above
   - CVL placed in RIJ
   .
   #CRF: Per wife, recently 1.3 at OSH a few weeks ago. Likely
   intravascularly dry but total body overloaded or [**1-12**] poor forward flow.
   Cr at baseline.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Dyspnea: Given the gradual worsening of his DOE and SOB over [**5-18**]
   months time, I feel that his underlying SOB is [**1-12**] worsening AS as well
   as CHF. His BNP is markedly elevated above last month (8462 today, 3822
   [**12-19**]). Unfortunately, we do not have recent EF information. There may
   be a component of PNA on top of this (given fever to 102 and dry
   cough); however, his CXR is not particularly impressive for infiltrate.
   Although he is wheezy on exam and COPD exacerbation +/- bronchitis are
   on the differential, I feel that this is less likely. His wheezes are
   more likely cardiogenic.  PE remains on the differential; however, no
   clinical signs of pleuritic chest pain or DVT
   - would treat empirically for PNA with Vanc/Zosyn. Low suspicion for
   atypical pna
   - f/u urine legionella
   - lasix gtt titrate to BP with goal 1-2L neg
   - Azithromycin and solumedrol for COPD exacerbation

   sepsis. He has had no new changes in BP meds recently. Per his wife, he
   has recently lost 5 pounds, so intravascular depletion is also
   possible. Low clinical suspicion for ACS.
   - hold on further IVF for now given pulm edema
   - continue to monitor diuresis with goal MAP>60
   - if persistantly hypotensive, would start pressors and use levophed if
   needed for diuresis as above

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note. However, there are several significant events that have occurred over the past 24 hours.

Firstly, the patient was started on steroids and azithromycin for a COPD exacerbation. An echocardiogram (ECHO) was performed, revealing a valve area of 1 cm2, unchanged aortic insufficiency (AI), unchanged mitral stenosis (MS), moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), moderate pulmonary hypertension at 50 mmHg, and inferior wall hypokinesis consistent with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), with an ejection fraction (EF) of 50%.

The patient also experienced oozing from the radial insertion site (RIJ) and around the Foley catheter, prompting the discontinuation of coumadin and a recheck of the International Normalized Ratio (INR) in the morning.

Additionally, the patient's fasting blood sugar levels were measured at 170 mg/dL at 4 PM and 290 mg/dL at 10 PM. Humalog insulin was started as a result.

Furthermore, the patient's blood pressure has been in the range of 80-90s, necessitating two 250 cc normal saline (NS) boluses for mean arterial pressure (MAP) stabilization between 58-62.

Non-invasive ventilation was initiated at 09:10 AM, and a transthoracic echo was performed at"

The patient has been experiencing gradual worsening of his shortness of breath over the past five months, which is likely due to worsening AS and CHF. His B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are markedly elevated, indicating significant cardiac stress.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury (AKI) and is experiencing hypotension. There is concern for sepsis, but no new changes in blood pressure medications have been made recently. The patient's wife reports that he has recently lost 5 pounds, which could suggest intravascular depletion.

The patient's renal function has recently worsened, as indicated by a decrease in creatinine clearance. It is likely that the patient is intravascularly dry but has total body overload or poor forward flow.

There are no clinical signs of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), so the patient's blood pressure medications will be held for now. However, consideration will be given to restarting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) to reduce afterload before starting a beta-blocker. Aspirin (ASA) has been started at a dose of 81 mg daily.

The patient is currently on coumadin for atrial fibrillation ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics due to an infection. He is currently on CPAP for respiratory support and has been given Lasix to manage fluid balance. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 115/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His central venous pressure is within normal range, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation.

Potential Complications:
1. Prolonged use of antibiotics may lead to antibiotic-associated diarrhea or Clostridium difficile infection.
2. The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen due to the use of nephrotoxic medications or inadequate fluid management.
3. Respiratory failure can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if the patient develops increased pulmonary edema or other complications.
4. Hypotension may indicate poor cardiac function or septic shock if there is evidence of systemic infection and inadequate organ perfusion.
5. Atrial fibrillation may result in thromboembolic events if anticoagulation is not properly managed.
6. Stress ulcer prophylaxis may mask symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be a complication of critical illness or medications"

The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and is currently on CPAP for respiratory support. The patient experienced poor urine output and was given pyridium for dysuria. Lasix drip was reduced due to hypotension and acute renal failure (ARF), and potassium was given at 5:30 am. The patient's INR was restarted after stopping coumadin due to antibiotic interaction. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for dysuria. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 115/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 15 mmHg, with total input of 1,366 mL and total output of 1,630 mL. Fluid balance is negative 264 mL. Respiratory support includes CPAP with a tidal volume of 239 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. ABG results are available but not provided in the note. Physical examination reveals a thin and anxious appearance, with pupils that are not dilated, and no conjunctival pallor or scleral ed"

   Assessment and Plan
 Pt is a 73 yo M c dyspnea and O2 requirement [**1-12**] worsening AS and
   resultant CHF and COPD AE. Vol sensitive hypotension on lasix ggt.
   # Dyspnea: Given the gradual worsening of his DOE and SOB over [**5-18**]
   months time, I feel that his underlying SOB is [**1-12**] worsening AS as well
   as CHF. His BNP is markedly elevated above last month (8462 today, 3822
   [**12-19**]). Although he is wheezy on exam and COPD exacerbation +/-
   bronchitis are on the differential, I feel that this is less likely.
   His wheezes are more likely cardiogenic. Stopped Vanc/Zosyn bc no
   evidence of PNA. Significant element of pulmonary edema.
   - lasix gtt titrate to BP with goal 1-2L neg for pulm edema (no lasix
   bolus bc of sensitivity and concern for HoTN)
   - cont nebs of advair, ipratropium, albuterol
   - Azithromycin and steriods for COPD exacerbation
   - tapering steroids now Prednisone 60mg PO daily
   - guaifen and tessalon perles for cough, cough syrup with codeine at
   night for cough
   - there appears to be an element of anxiety with the cough, starting
   Ativan 0.5 mg PO TID and floor team to consider long acting
   anxietolytic at the time of discharge
   .
   # dCHF / AS
 [**1-12**] rheumatic heart disease. elevated BNP and EF 50% with
   interval worsening of AS (1.0 cm2), mild AR/MR, new pHTN
   - vol dependent cardiac status bc moderate AS
   - f/u cards recs
   .
   # Hypotension: Baseline BP in 110's and today has been more hypotensive
   than baseline. He has had one temp to 102 and   could be concerning for
   sepsis. He has had no new changes in BP meds recently. Per his wife, he
   has recently lost 5 pounds, so intravascular depletion is also
   possible. Low clinical suspicion for ACS.
   - hold on further IVF for now given pulm edema
   - continue to monitor diuresis with goal MAP>60
   - if persistantly hypotensive, would start pressors and use levophed if
   needed for diuresis as above
   - CVL placed in RIJ, will discuss with c-med service if they want the
   patient to go to the floor with the line
   # Acute on CRF: Per wife, recently 1.3 at OSH a few weeks ago. Likely
   intravascularly dry but total body overloaded or [**1-12**] poor forward flow.
   Cr now 1.5 and worsening BUN in the setting of lasix drip.
   - trend creatinine
   - urine/serum  lytes
   - d/c lasix drip, c-med service to consider restarting once ARF
   resolves
   - since no longer on lasix drip, d/c foley
   .
   # CAD: No clinical signs today of ACS.
   - continue statin
   - hold BP meds for now, but consider restarting ACEI to reduce
   afterload before BB
   - started ASA 81mg PO daily
   .
   # Afib on coumadin:
   - continue coumadin
   .
   # Emphysema/asbestos exposure:
   - continue nebs
   - continue advair
   - d/w pulmonary in AM
   .
   # Recent GIB: unclear etiology, Per wife, nl EGD at OSH
   - guaiac all stools
   - H2 blocker for now
   - transfuse for Hct <21
   .
   # CVA:
   - ? why not on ASA for 2dary ppx for stroke
   .
   # FEN:
   - hold IVF for now
   - replete electrolytes
   - regular diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   - on coumadin
   - bowel PRN

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of dyspnea, oxygen requirement, worsening AS (Aortic Stenosis), resultant CHF (Congestive Heart Failure), and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) exacerbation. The patient presents with symptoms of pulmonary edema and is on CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) support. He has been experiencing dysuria and poor urine output, for which he has been started on Pyridium. The patient also has a history of rheumatic heart disease, elevated BNP (B-type Natriuretic Peptide), and an ejection fraction of 50% with worsening AS. He is currently being treated for dCHF (decompensated Congestive Heart Failure) and AS. The patient is also hypotensive and has had one episode of fever, raising concerns for sepsis. He has lost 5 pounds recently, suggesting intravascular depletion. There is low clinical suspicion for ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome). The patient has a history of CRF (Chronic Renal Failure) and is showing signs of worsening renal function. He is also on coumadin for atrial fibrillation. The patient has a history of emphysema and asbestos exposure. He has had an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding of unclear etiology. There are concerns about his recent CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident) and the need for secondary prevention with ASA"
