","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), prior myocardial infarction (MI), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and left leg percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). She presented today after undergoing a procedure for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AFib) called pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). The patient developed a right groin/thigh hematoma, likely caused by elevated INR and the use of an arterial line. The hematoma is contained within the groin, as shown on CT scan, but there is a suspected fistula seen on ultrasound. The patient's INR has been corrected to 1.5 after receiving 5 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and she has received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and will undergo an evacuation procedure in the operating room (OR) today. She will also have further monitoring of her hemoglobin and coagulation parameters every 6 hours, as well as a final CT read. The patient's blood pressure is low, so she is being held on metoprolol and Diovan is being held as well. Additional peripheral intravenous (PIV) access is needed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, peripheral vascular disease, carotid endarterectomy, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient presented today after undergoing a percutaneous vascular intervention (PVI) procedure for atrial fibrillation but experienced a groin and thigh hematoma as a complication.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/58 mmHg to 134/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including hemorrhage/hematoma, retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed), anxiety, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and neuropathy of both feet. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease with multiple myocardial infarctions, peripheral vascular disease, and diverticulosis.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab values such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented with minimal pain in the right groin. An ultrasound revealed a large hematoma in the right groin, along with a small vessel arteriovenous (AV) fistula involving the greater saphenous vein and a small branch artery in the groin. There was no involvement of the common femoral artery. The patient received one unit of blood due to a low hematocrit level of 29 from 35.

The patient has a history of allergy to Plavix (Clopidogrel Bisulfate) and is currently taking Furosemide, Haloperidol, and Morphine sulfate. Other medications and vital signs are mentioned in the flow sheet data.

Physical examination findings include absent peripheral pulses on the right side, present pulses on the left side, clear respiratory sounds, soft abdomen, and a hematoma in the right groin with increased tenseness in a smaller area, tracking through the thigh. Neurologic assessment was not performed.

Laboratory results show abnormal values for hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, total carbon dioxide, glucose, PT/PTT/INR, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hematoma in the setting of arterial line-related bleeding vs continued venous bleeding. Vascular surgery input is planned for hematoma evacuation later today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), prior myocardial infarction (MI) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and left leg percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). She presented today after undergoing a procedure for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PVI) and now has a right groin and thigh hematoma.

The patient has several medical complications and potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hematoma, R groin/thigh - This is a complication from the PVI procedure, likely caused by elevated INR and the need for a 5F arterial line. The hematoma is contained within the groin, as shown on a CT scan. A femoral ultrasound (US) showed a possible fistula. The patient's most recent INR is 1.5 after receiving 5 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). She has received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) - The patient has a history of AFib, which dates back to [**2191**]. She underwent a PVI procedure for AFib but developed a right groin and thigh hematoma afterward. She is currently in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) following"

   for afib c/b R inguinal and thigh hematoma
   # Hematoma, R groin/thigh- complication from PVI procedure. Likely
   caused from elevated INR and required 5F arterial line. CT shows
   hematoma is contained within the groin.  Now evacuated and
   pseudoaneursym repaired. Hct dropped from 34.9 to 29 yesterday. Now
   improved at 32.2.
   - will check Hct and INR q8 now
   - cont to hold home HCTZ 25 and Diovan 80 given hypotension
   - f/u vascular recs
   # Rhythm- h/o atrial fibrillation, s/p DC cardioversions, the last in
   [**4-25**]. Now in NSR s/p PVI.  This AM pt went into a narrow complex
   tachycardia to 150s, EP cardioverted and required a couple chest
   compressions.
   - goal is to have pt extubated and start amio gtt
   - if pt goes back into RVR will try electrical cardioversion again
   - moniter on tele
   # Coronaries- known CAD w/ multiple MI and prior hx of angioplasty and
   stenting. Currently pt denies CP, and EKG was unchanged prior/post
   procedure. Do not suspect ACS or demand.
   - hold Metop given BP
   - ASA 162 in AM
   - cont to hold diovan
   .
   # Pump- LVEF 60%. no significant valve disease. Euvolemic.
   - will monitor volume status given blood products, lasix prn
   .
   # HTN- BP have remained low.
   - hold anti-HTNsives for now, restart if stable.
   #  Respiratory status- currently on AC. Currently on propofol.
   - will d/c propofol
   - will use versed and fentanyl boluses
   - goal is to wean sedation and to extubate today as long as rhythm
   remains stable
   # Delirium/ [**Name (NI) 6603**] Pt confused and delirius . Requiring total of 11mg
   haldol and zyprexa the night before. Also required restraints.  Pt
   still disoriented this AM.
   - check ECG to check QT
   - haldol 5mg IV prn and/or zyprexa
   - remove restraints as causing more agitation
   - consider 1:1 sitter
   .
   # PVD- s/p left leg stenting with subsequent thrombotic occlusion
   requiring ? thrombectomy/PTA - current pulses in feet doplerable
   - continue to moniter
   # CRI ?baseline 1.3- likely near baseline will continue to monitor Cr
   1.4. yesterday. Awaiting AM labs
   -          cont to trend Cr
   - avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds
   .
   # Neuropathy of b/l feet- stable, sensation is unchanged currently.
   # Hx of GIB/diverticulosis- currently no reason to suspect GIB, will

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She presented today for a pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) procedure but experienced complications, including a hematoma in the groin/thigh area caused by the elevated INR and required evacuation and pseudoaneurysm repair.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hematoma, R groin/thigh - complication from PVI procedure. The hematoma is contained within the groin, as confirmed by a CT scan, and has been evacuated with repair of the pseudoaneurysm. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 34.9 to 29 yesterday but has improved to 32.2. Continuous monitoring of Hct and INR is recommended.

2. Atrial fibrillation (AFib) - The patient has a history of AFib and underwent DC cardioversions in the past. Recently, she was in NSR after a PVI procedure but experienced a narrow complex tachycardia at 150 beats per minute, which required an EP cardioversion and chest compressions. The goal is to have the patient extubated and start amiodarone gargle. If the patient goes back into rapid ventricular response (RVR), another attempt at electrical cardioversion will be made.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, prior myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, and carotid endarterectomy. She presented today after undergoing a procedure for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with intent to ablate (PVI). 

The patient has experienced multiple medical complications since admission. Firstly, she required cardioversion/defibrillation due to narrow complex tachycardia and later developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She received amiodarone, atropine, adenosine, and metoprolol for rate control. Secondly, she developed oliguria/anuria, fever (hypothermia), airway inability to protect (risk for aspiration), delirium/confusion, and hemodynamic instability. Thirdly, she had a hematoma in the groin/thigh as a complication from the PVI procedure, which required evacuation and pseudoaneurysm repair. Her hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 34.9 to 29 yesterday but improved to 32.2 now.

The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, which has been managed with DC cardioversions. She is currently in sinus rhythm after undergoing PVI. However, she experienced another episode of narrow complex tachycardia and required additional DC cardioversions. She is currently on amiodarone infusion for rhythm control. If she goes"

She presented today after undergoing a percutaneous vascular intervention (PVI) for AF, which resulted in a right groin/thigh hematoma.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a right groin/thigh hematoma, which is a surgical site infection and requires proper wound care.
2. Oliguria/anuria: The patient has reduced urine output, indicating possible kidney dysfunction or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
3. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin): The patient had a fever yesterday, suggesting an underlying infection or inflammatory response.
4. Airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough): The patient's recent extubation and transition to CPAP indicate a need for ongoing respiratory support and monitoring for aspiration.
5. Delirium/confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium or confusion, which can be attributed to multiple factors such as sedation, pain, or underlying medical conditions.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, peripheral vascular disease, carotid endarterectomy, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She presented today after undergoing a pulmonary vein isolation procedure for atrial fibrillation, but developed a hematoma in the groin/thigh area, likely due to an elevated INR. The hematoma was evacuated and pseudoaneurysm repaired by vascular intervention. Her hemoglobin concentration dropped from 32.7 to 27.8 g/dL. She is still draining from the wound site. 

She has a history of atrial fibrillation and was loaded on digoxin. However, she went back into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which responded to intravenous lopressor and oral lopressor. She will continue with digoxin at a low dose. 

The patient's coronary arteries are known to have multiple blockages, but she denies chest pain and her EKG was unchanged prior and post procedure. 

Her left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%, and she has no significant valve disease. She appeared volume overloaded on chest X-ray, so Lasix was given, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 1 liter. 

The patient is suspected to have aspiration pneumonia due to opacity seen on CXR, so she was started on levofloxacin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She presented today after undergoing a pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) procedure for atrial fibrillation, which resulted in a right groin/thigh hematoma. The hematoma was evacuated and a pseudoaneurysm was repaired by a vascular specialist. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 32.7 to 27.8 due to the blood loss, and she is still draining from the wound site. 

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was loaded on digoxin. She experienced a recurrence of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which responded to intravenous metoprolol. 

Her coronary arteries are known to have multiple blockages, and she has a history of angioplasty and stenting. She denies chest pain, and her electrocardiogram (EKG) was unchanged prior and post procedure. There is no suspicion of acute coronary syndrome or demand.

The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 60%, with no significant valve disease. She appears volume overloaded on chest X-ray, and Lasix was given intravenously, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 1 liter. The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of 500 to 100"

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, and carotid endarterectomy presenting with atrial fibrillation. She underwent a percutaneous vascular intervention (PVI) procedure, which resulted in a groin/thigh hematoma due to elevated INR and the use of an arterial line. The hematoma was evacuated and pseudoaneurysm repaired by vascular surgery. 

The patient's current conditions include impaired skin integrity, oliguria/anuria, fever, airway compromise risk for aspiration, delirium/confusion, hemorrhage/hematoma (procedure-related), retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed) procedure-related, anxiety, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and hypertension.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate ranging from 99 to 110 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 130/67 to 153/94 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 23 to 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin levels decreasing from 33.2 to 27.8, platelet count within normal range, creatinine levels within normal range, blood glucose levels ranging from 136 to 159 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including low potassium and magnesium levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), prior myocardial infarction (MI), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTA), carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). She presented today after undergoing a pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) procedure for AF, which resulted in the development of a right groin/thigh hematoma. The hematoma was evacuated, and a pseudoaneurysm was repaired by vascular intervention. Her hematocrit (Hct) is stable overnight.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including impaired skin integrity, oliguria/anuria, fever, airway obstruction risk, delirium/confusion, hemorrhage/ hematoma, retroperitoneal bleed, anxiety, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and neuropathy of bilateral feet.

Plan:

1. Continue Hct and INR q12.
2. Follow-up with vascular recommendations regarding when to start anticoagulation on right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
3. Hold home hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 and Diovan 80 due to hypotension.
4. Load digoxin at 0.125 mcg daily and titrate metoprolol to 37.5 mg TID.
5. Discuss with vascular regarding when to start anti"
