","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of diverticulitis and previous sigmoid resection. He presented with painless rectal bleeding on multiple occasions. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

Upon admission, the patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 29% to 35%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/69 to 129/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress and normal findings in all systems except for trace edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, the patient has elevated creatinine levels at 0.8 mg/dL, possibly indicating some degree of kidney dysfunction.

The patient's medical history includes a total hip replacement (THR) performed in [**2136**], for which he is currently experiencing right hip pain thought to be due to loosening of the prosthesis. He is being followed by orthopedics as an outpatient and is prescribed tylenol for pain relief as needed.

Additionally, the patient has a history of depression and is continued on"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of diverticulitis who underwent sigmoid resection. He presented with painless rectal bleeding on four occasions. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) increased from 29% to 35% after receiving 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). No further episodes of bleeding were observed overnight. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3Â°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the cardiovascular, respiratory, or abdominal systems. The patient's laboratory results indicate normal values for white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient had episodes of rectal bleeding prior to admission, and there is a possibility of re-bleeding despite the transfusion of PRBCs.
2. Infection: As the patient is in the ICU, he is at risk for developing infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections due to prolonged invasive lines.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can increase the risk of developing DVT, especially considering the patient's recent hip surgery.
4. Loosening of Hip Prosthesis: The patient's recent hip surgery and new-onset pain suggest the possibility of loosening of the hip prosthesis, which requires further evaluation by orthopedics.
5. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is being treated with bupropion. Monitoring for any worsening of depressive symptoms is important.
6. Fluid Balance: The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored due to the recent transfusion of PRBCs, which can impact his overall fluid status."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diverticulitis who underwent sigmoid resection in 2014. He presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed) and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient required blood transfusions overnight and continues to have GI bleeding. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is well-nourished and overweight/obese. His abdomen is soft with no tenderness or guarding, and he has positive bowel sounds. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and low platelet count. The assessment and plan include suspected lower gastrointestinal bleed, likely due to diverticular disease. The patient's hematocrit is stable, with only a small amount of bleeding overnight. Serial hematocrit checks are planned, and the patient will undergo GI follow-up. If bleeding recurs, a tagged red blood cell scan/angiogram will be obtained, and a surgery consult will be requested. The patient also has right hip pain, possibly related to hip prosthesis loosening, and will be given periodic pain medication. The patient is also being treated for depression with bupropion. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and has well-controlled blood sugar levels. The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of diverticulitis who underwent sigmoid resection in 2013. He is currently admitted to the ICU for management of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), likely secondary to diverticular disease. The patient has received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight and has a stable hematocrit level. He has also experienced small amounts of dark blood in his stools. His vital signs are stable, and he is receiving appropriate respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient's current condition of GIB, possibly due to diverticular disease, can lead to further complications such as hypotension, shock, and organ dysfunction.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to surgery and ICU admission puts him at risk for infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not managed properly.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's current laboratory values show an elevated creatinine level, indicating potential renal dysfunction. This can be exacerbated by the use of nephrotoxic medications or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
5. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobilization in the ICU can increase the risk of pressure ulcers"

   In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 494**] is a 51 year old male male with history of
   diverticulitis s/p sigmoid resection now presenting with painless
   rectal bleeding likely secondary to diverticular bleed.
   .
   1.  Lower GI bleed.  Had maroon blood per rectum yesterday.  Hct is
   stable, but did not appropriately bump with 4 units of PRBCs.  Tagged
   RBC scan yesterday was negative for localization of bleed.  Initial
   plan was for colonoscopy  today; however, bowel prep was stopped due to
   ongoing GI bleed.
   - q 6 hour Hcts
   - touch base with GI re: plans for scope
   - consider repeat tagged RBC scan if patient rebleeds versus surgical
   intervention if significant bleed
   - appreciate GI, Surgery recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of diverticulitis and sigmoid resection. He presents with painless rectal bleeding, which is likely secondary to diverticular bleeding. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels have been stable, but did not appropriately increase after receiving 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). A tagged red blood cell scan yesterday was negative for localizing the source of the bleed. Initial plans for a colonoscopy were halted due to ongoing bleeding, and bowel prep was stopped as well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Lower GI bleed: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding poses a significant risk. If the bleeding continues or worsens, it can lead to further decreases in Hct levels, potentially causing hypovolemic shock and organ failure. Surgical intervention may be necessary if the bleeding is significant and cannot be controlled endoscopically.
2. Loosening of hip prosthesis: The patient has pain in his right hip, which is suspected to be due to loosening of the prosthetic hip replacement. This can cause discomfort and potentially lead to complications such as infection or dislocation if not properly managed.
3. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is currently being treated with bupropion. While depression itself is not an immediate medical complication, inadequate management of depression can have long-term effects on the patient's overall health and well-being.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of GI bleed. The patient had ongoing large volume bleeding, leading to a negative bleeding scan and the decision to stop bowel prep. The patient's hemoglobin levels have remained stable. There are no known drug allergies, and the patient has received infusions and other ICU medications. The review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the ongoing GI bleed. 

Vital signs show a slightly low temperature, stable blood pressure, normal heart rate, and respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation is within normal range. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with a net positive input of 650 mL and output of 1,490 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 611 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate a low white blood cell count, stable hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated potassium levels, and normal glucose levels. Other lab values, including platelets, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, are within normal range. 

Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient's unstable condition. 

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is not mentioned in the progress note. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include ongoing GI bleeding leading to hypovolemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   In summary, Mr. [**Known lastname 494**] is a 51 year old male male with history of
   diverticulitis s/p sigmoid resection now presenting with painless
   rectal bleeding likely secondary to diverticular bleed.
   .
   1.  Lower GI bleed.  Had maroon blood per rectum yesterday.  Hct is
   stable, but did not appropriately bump with 4 units of PRBCs.  Tagged
   RBC scan yesterday was negative for localization of bleed.  Initial
   plan was for colonoscopy  today; however, bowel prep was stopped due to
   ongoing GI bleed.  Now will be monitored in ICU for now with plan for
   colonoscopy on Monday.
   - q 8 hour hcts
   - colonoscopy on Monday
   - consider repeat tagged RBC scan if patient rebleeds versus surgical
   intervention if significant bleed
   - appreciate GI, Surgery recs
   - NPO

   2.  Right hip pain. S/p THR in [**2136**].  Recent pain thought to be due to
   loosening of prosthesis. Being followed by orthopedics as outpt

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of diverticulitis and sigmoid resection, presenting with painless rectal bleeding. The bleeding is likely secondary to diverticular bleeding. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) but did not appropriately increase in hemoglobin concentration (Hct). A tagged red blood cell scan yesterday was negative for localizing the source of the bleed. Initially, a plan for colonoscopy today was made, but it was stopped due to ongoing gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient will now be monitored in the ICU and the colonoscopy will be performed on Monday. Other issues include right hip pain following total hip replacement (THR) in [**2136**], which is thought to be due to loosening of the prosthesis, and depression for which he is taking bupropion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient may continue to experience GI bleeding, which could require additional interventions such as repeat tagged RBC scan or surgical intervention if the bleeding is significant.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to the indwelling lines and the immunocompromised state caused by the bleeding and subsequent blood transfusion.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and surgery increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylaxis with pneumatic boots is being used to prevent this complication"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of diverticulitis who underwent sigmoid resection. He presents with painless rectal bleeding, likely secondary to diverticular bleeding. His hematocrit (Hct) level remains stable, and he continues to have maroon stools. The initial plan for colonoscopy was halted due to ongoing lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and now he will be monitored in the ICU before proceeding with the procedure on Monday. The patient also has a history of right hip pain following total hip replacement (THR) surgery in [**2136**], which is being evaluated by orthopedics as an outpatient. Additionally, the patient has a history of depression and is on bupropion. In the ICU, the patient is receiving IV fluids and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current vital signs are within normal range, but he has a slight decrease in oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 94%. His laboratory results indicate some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hb), and platelet count (Plt). The patient's electrolyte levels, renal function tests (Cr), and glucose levels are within normal limits. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to be called out.

","Summary:
Mr. [Known lastname 494] is a 51-year-old male with a history of diverticulitis and sigmoid resection, presenting with painless rectal bleeding likely secondary to diverticular bleed. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8 C (98.2 F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/83 to 130/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has received 4 units of packed red blood cells but has not shown an appropriate bump in hematocrit. A tagged red blood cell scan yesterday was negative for localization of the bleed. The initial plan for colonoscopy today was stopped due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient will be monitored in the ICU with plans for colonoscopy on Monday. He will have his hematocrit levels checked every 8 hours and may undergo repeat tagged RBC scan or surgical intervention if significant bleeding occurs. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Lower GI bleed: The patient's current condition involves ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. If not properly managed, this can lead to further blood loss, hypotension, shock, and potentially death.
2. Right hip pain: The patient has pain in his right hip, which is believed to be due"

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) remains stable, and he continues to have maroon stools. The initial plan for colonoscopy today was stopped due to ongoing lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient will be monitored in the ICU and will undergo colonoscopy on Monday. He is also being monitored for right hip pain, which is thought to be due to loosening of the prosthesis following total hip replacement surgery. The patient is also being treated for depression with bupropion. In the ICU, the patient is receiving IV fluids and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a code status of full code and may be transferred to the floor if his Hct remains stable and there are no further episodes of bloody stool.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Lower GI bleed: The patient's ongoing lower GI bleed poses a potential risk of significant blood loss and hemodynamic instability. Continuous monitoring and management are crucial.
2. Right hip pain: The patient's right hip pain suggests a possible complication related to the loosening of the prosthesis after total hip replacement surgery. Close follow-up by orthopedics is necessary for appropriate management.
3. Depression: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of diverticulitis post sigmoid resection who presented with multiple episodes of bloody brown pigment rectal bleeding (BRBPR), likely due to left gastrointestinal bleeding (L GIB). The patient has experienced a significant drop in hematocrit levels but remains hemodynamically stable with a current hemoglobin level of 12.7 g/dL.

The patient has a history of hip prosthesis loosening and is experiencing right hip pain. He is also diagnosed with depression and is currently taking bupropion.

On review of systems, the patient's symptoms remain unchanged from admission except for the GI bleed. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.1Â°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/84 mmHg to 130/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress. The cardiovascular examination is normal, and there are no murmurs or peripheral edema noted. The respiratory system is clear, with symmetric chest expansion and breath sounds bilaterally. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities show absent pulses in both lower extremities. The neurologic examination is also normal.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC)"
