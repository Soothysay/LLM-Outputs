","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer who underwent an open low anterior resection. He is now in the ICU following surgical repair for a small anastomotic leak. The patient experienced episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) overnight, which were controlled with calcium gluconate and Tylenol. His fever persisted, and he was given antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but he has an elevated temperature and his heart rate is within normal limits. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and his ABG results show normal values. The patient's peripheral vascular pulses are not assessed, and his skin and neurologic examinations are also not assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anastomotic leak: The patient has a history of anastomotic leak, which can lead to peritonitis and potentially result in sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he may be at risk for acute renal failure due to pre-renal failure or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from perioperative hypotension.
3. Catheter-related infections: The patient has multiple lines and tubes, increasing the risk of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer that underwent open low anterior resection. The patient is now in the ICU following surgical repair for a small anastomotic leak.

The patient experienced episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) overnight in the setting of pain and fever. This was treated with calcium gluconate and Tylenol, and the patient's EKG and electrolytes were monitored. The patient responded well to a diltiazem push and metoprolol, which broke the tachycardia.

The patient has been febrile since admission, with a fever of 101.6 F. The fever is likely due to peritonitis in the setting of an anastomotic leak, which has since been surgically repaired. The patient is currently on vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole for infection coverage. Blood cultures have been obtained, and there is also concern for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, for which the patient is receiving treatment with Flagyl.

The patient has a history of rectosigmoid cancer that underwent surgical excision. Lymph node biopsies and further outpatient planning are pending.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer. The patient underwent open low anterior resection for rectosigmoid cancer but experienced fevers due to a small anastomotic leak. He is now in the ICU following surgical repair.

The patient had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) overnight, with heart rates reaching 190 beats per minute. This was likely due to pain and fever. The patient was given calcium gluconate and Tylenol, and his heart rhythm was monitored. The patient responded well to a diltiazem push of 10 mg IV and metoprolol x2, which helped break the SVT.

The patient has no known drug allergies. His last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin on 04/14/2168 at 07:30 PM, vancomycin on 04/14/2168 at 10:30 PM, and metronidazole on 04/15/2168 at 12:00 AM.

The patient is currently on several medications, including hydromorphone (Dilaudid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), diltiazem, and metoprolol. He is also receiving other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 81 bpm (range: 72-143 bpm), blood pressure of 117/62 mmHg (range: 76-132/89 mmHg), respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute (range: 10-21 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. His heart rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of 2,770 mL total in, 1,655 mL total out, with a net intake of 2,775 mL and a net output of 805 mL. His urine output is 285 mL, and his nasogastric tube output is 5 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, hematocrit of 33.6%, platelet count of 222 K/uL, creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 138 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Post-operative tachycardia/a.fib: The patient's episodes of SVT were likely due to pain and fever. He responded well to diltiazem and metop"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer that underwent open low anterior resection. The patient is now in the ICU following surgical repair for a small anastomotic leak. The patient's current conditions include atrial flutter, fevers, anastomotic leak, rectosigmoid cancer, acute renal failure, and BPH.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Flutter: The patient has been experiencing atrial flutter, which has been controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol. The goal is to maintain a stable heart rhythm and prevent any further complications.

2. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, and Gram stain positive for GNR in peritoneal sample suggests an infection, likely from peritonitis in the setting of anastomotic leak. The patient is currently on antibiotics (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole), but further monitoring and management are required.

3. Anastomotic Leak: The patient had an anastomotic leak, which was surgically repaired. Close monitoring of drain output and continued co-management with general surgery are necessary to prevent further complications.

4. Rectosigmoid Cancer: The patient recently underwent surgical excision for rectosigmoid cancer. Further outpatient plan will be determined based on lymph node biopsies.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer who underwent an open low anterior resection. He is currently in the ICU following surgical repair for a small anastomotic leak. The patient is experiencing fevers, atrial flutter, acute renal failure, and potential complications from the surgical procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter needs to be closely monitored and managed with medication to maintain a stable heart rhythm.
2. Fevers: The patient's fevers may indicate an infection, likely due to the anastomotic leak. It is important to continue monitoring his temperature trend and follow up with blood cultures to identify the source of infection.
3. Anastomotic Leak: Although the patient has undergone surgical repair, there is a risk of further complications related to the anastomotic leak. Monitoring drain output and ensuring proper pain management are essential.
4. Rectosigmoid Cancer: Further evaluation of lymph node biopsies and outpatient plans are necessary to determine the extent of the cancer and guide further treatment.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure requires careful management to avoid nephrotoxic medications and ensure adequate fluid balance. Trending urine output is important for monitoring renal function.
6. BPH: It is important to hold hytrin (an antihyp"

- The patient is now in the ICU following surgical repair for a small anastomotic leak.
- The patient presented with fevers, and gram stain positive for GNR in peritoneal sample. This suggests an infection, likely from peritonitis in the setting of anastomotic leak.
- The patient's atrial flutter was initially paroxysmal but has become consistent, with a maximum heart rate of 190 bpm. It was controlled with diltiazem and metoprolol IV, but required increasing doses. The patient was eventually converted to a 3:1 block with diltiazem bolus.
- The patient's TSH levels are normal, indicating no thyroid dysfunction.
- The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to pre-renal failure or ATN from perioperative hypotension. Fluids have helped improve the condition.
- The patient has a history of BPH and will hold hytrin if they become septic.
- The patient's current medications include vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, diltiazem, heparin sodium, lorazepam, and metoprolol.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure ranging from 116/70 to 130/80 mmHg, heart rate ranging from 79 to 151 bpm, respiratory rate of 10-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient has a Foley catheter in place with a bladder pressure of 16-20 mmHg.
- The patient's blood cultures were obtained on 04/15/2168 at 03:33 PM, urine culture was also obtained, and a trans-thoracic echo was performed on 04/15/2168 at 02:00 PM.
- The patient has a history of rectosigmoid cancer and underwent surgical excision. Further outpatient plan will be provided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2998**].
- The patient's NG tube is on suction, and drain output is being monitored.
- The patient is receiving pain control through dilaudid PCA.
- The patient's electrolytes are being repleted, and IV fluids are being administered at 75 cc/hr.
- Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications.
- The patient's code status is full code.
- The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement, and they will be called out when stable on bolus dosing."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 54 year old male with a history of BPH, HTN, and
   recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer s/p open low anterior resection,
   complicated by fevers in the setting of a small anastomotic leak now in
   the ICU following surgical repair.
   A-FLUTTER -- persistent.  Would hold on DC cardioversion in context of
   sepsis/peritonitis (likely precipitant for A-Flutter).
   Anastomotic leak --
   PERITONITIS --
   # post-op tachycardia/a.fib: never symptomatic, went as high as 190.
   controlled by dilt and metoprolol IV.
   - per surgery: rec: metoprolol iv 5mg q 4h with holding parameters.
   Will clarify need for standing dose with surgery and cards consult
   given pt is now in sinus rhythm.
   - likely will just monitor, patient responded well to diltiazem without
   too much of an effect on his BP.
   # Fevers:  Likely from peritonitis in the setting of anastomotic leak
   seen on fluoroscopy, now s/p surgical repair.  Had been dosed
   vanc/zosyn yesterday, and currently on vanc/cipro/flagyl.  With also a
   potential concern for c.diff, flagyl will also cover.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - c.diff
 negative, on flagyl
   - trend fever curve, tylenol PRN
   - CIS
   .
   # Anastomotic leak: now s/p surgical repair.  Continued co-management
   w/ general surgery.
   - NGT on suction
   - monitor drain output.
   - dilaudid PCA for pain control
   .
   # Rectosigmoid cancer: s/p surgical excision.
   - f/u lymphnode biopsies and further outpatient plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2998**].
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Most likely etiologies include pre-renal failure
   vs. ATN from perioperative hypotension.  Will continue with IVF, and
   reassess in am.  If not improving, can send off urine studies.
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - trend UOP.
   .
   # BPH: will hold hytrin in case becomes septic.
   .

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer status post open low anterior resection, complicated by fevers in the setting of a small anastomotic leak now in the ICU following surgical repair. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. A-Flutter: The patient has persistent atrial flutter, which may be precipitated by sepsis or peritonitis. It is important to monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider cardioversion if necessary.

2. Anastomotic leak: The patient has an anastomotic leak, which has led to peritonitis. Surgical repair has been performed, but the patient remains at risk for further complications such as infection and abscess formation. Close monitoring and continued co-management with general surgery are necessary.

3. Fevers: The patient has persistent fevers, likely due to peritonitis in the setting of the anastomotic leak. Antibiotics have been initiated, but the source of infection should be identified through blood cultures. Tylenol can be given as needed to manage fever, and the possibility of Clostridium difficile infection should be considered and covered with appropriate medication.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient is at risk for acute renal failure, possibly due to pre-renal failure or acute tubular necrosis from perioperative hypotension"

   54 yom recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer s/p open low anterior
   resection, complicated by anastomotic leak.
   A-FLUTTER -- persistent.  Would hold on DC cardioversion in context of
   sepsis/peritonitis (likely precipitant for A-Flutter), continue
   pharmacological treatment.  Cardiology to assess need and timing of
   cardioversion.
   ANASTOMOTIC LEAK
 s/p surgical repair.  Dilaudid for pain control.
   Maintain NGT.
   PERITONITIS
 clinically improving with antimicrobials.
   FEVERS -- Likely from peritonitis in the setting of anastomotic leak
   seen on fluoroscopy, now s/p surgical repair.  Continue antimicrobial.
   RECTOSIGMOID CA -- s/p surgical excision.  f/u lymphnode biopsies and

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of rectosigmoid cancer who underwent an open low anterior resection. The patient developed an anastomotic leak, which was surgically repaired. He is currently experiencing tachycardia due to atrial flutter and peritonitis. The patient also has acute renal failure and an anastomotic leak.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Flutter (A-FLUTTER): The patient has persistent atrial flutter, which is an abnormal heart rhythm. If not properly managed, it can lead to complications such as arrhythmias, stroke, or heart failure.
2. Anastomotic Leak: The patient had a surgical complication of an anastomotic leak following the low anterior resection. If not addressed promptly, the leak can result in peritonitis, sepsis, and further complications.
3. Peritonitis: The patient's fever and clinical presentation suggest peritonitis, which is an inflammation of the peritoneum. If left untreated, peritonitis can progress to severe infection and sepsis.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, likely due to pre-renal causes such as hypotension during surgery or postoperative complications. If not managed appropriately, acute renal failure can lead to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
5. Sepsis: The combination of anastomotic leak, periton"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer status post open low anterior resection, complicated by fevers in the setting of a small anastomotic leak now in the ICU following surgical repair.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Atrial Flutter: The patient has been experiencing paroxysmal atrial flutter, which is now consistent but never symptomatic. It is important to continue the diltiazem drip and discuss possible cardioversion with surgery.

2. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, and gram stain positive for gram-negative rods (GNR) in peritoneal sample. This indicates a likely infection from peritonitis in the setting of anastomotic leak. The patient has been started on vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole for coverage.

3. Anastomotic leak: The patient had an anastomotic leak, which has been surgically repaired. Close monitoring of drain output and ongoing co-management with general surgery is necessary.

4. Rectosigmoid cancer: The patient has a history of rectosigmoid cancer, for which he underwent surgical excision. Further outpatient plan will be discussed with Dr. [Last Name (STitle)].

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer that underwent open low anterior resection. The patient is currently in the ICU following surgical repair for a small anastomotic leak.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Atrial Flutter: The patient has paroxysmal atrial flutter, which is now consistent but never symptomatic. It is controlled by diltiazem (dilt) and metoprolol IV at first but requiring increasing doses. The patient will continue on a diltiazem drip, plan to convert to bolus doses once able to take oral medications, and cardioversion is planned for Monday. The patient is on heparin gtt.

2. Fevers: The patient has fevers due to Gram-negative rods (GNR) in the peritoneal sample, likely from peritonitis in the setting of anastomotic leak seen on fluoroscopy, now s/p surgical repair. The patient was previously dosed with vancomycin and Zosyn, and currently on vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl. Blood cultures will be followed up, and the fever curve will be trended. Cooling techniques (bath, blanket), Tylenol when the GI tract is not off-limits, and cisapride will be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yom recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer s/p open low anterior
   resection, complicated by anastomotic leak.
   A-FLUTTER -- persistent.  Would hold on DC cardioversion in context of
   sepsis/peritonitis (likely precipitant for A-Flutter), continue
   pharmacological treatment.  Cardiology to assess need and timing of
   cardioversion --> planned for tomorrow AM if remains in a-flutter.
   ANASTOMOTIC LEAK
 s/p surgical repair.  Dilaudid PCA pump for pain
   control.
   PERITONITIS
 clinically improving with antimicrobials.
   FEVERS -- Persistent, likely from peritonitis in the setting of
   anastomotic leak, now s/p surgical repair.  Continue antimicrobials.
   Consider repeat imaging with ABD/Pelvic CT.
   RECTO-SIGMOID CA -- s/p surgical excision.  f/u lymphnode biopsies and
   further outpatient plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2998**].
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Most likely pre-renal failure vs. ATN from
   perioperative hypotension.  Will continue with IVF, and reassess in
   am.  If not improving, can send off urine studies.  Avoid nephrotoxic
   meds
   FLUIDS
 continue to net volume expand in context of sepsis (3rd
   spacing).  Monitor I/O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- remains NPO.  [**Month (only) 8**] require replacing NGT if ileus
   remains.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of rectosigmoid cancer who underwent an open low anterior resection. However, the surgery was complicated by an anastomotic leak. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial flutter and is currently being treated with diltiazem infusion. Cardiology plans to assess the need and timing of cardioversion, which is scheduled for tomorrow morning if the patient remains in atrial flutter.

The patient also has peritonitis, which is clinically improving with antimicrobials. The patient has been surgically repaired for the anastomotic leak and continues to receive pain control through a dilaudid PCA pump. The patient's fever is persistent, likely due to peritonitis in the setting of anastomotic leak. Antimicrobials will be continued, and repeat imaging with an abdominal/pelvic CT may be considered.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure, most likely pre-renal failure or acute tubular necrosis from perioperative hypotension. The patient will continue with intravenous fluids and reassessment in the morning. If not improving, urine studies may be sent off to avoid nephrotoxic medications.

The patient's nutritional support remains nil per os (NPO), and a nasogastric tube may need to be replaced if ileus persists. The patient's fluid balance will continue to be monitored, and input/output will be monitored as well. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yom recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer s/p open low anterior
   resection, complicated by anastomotic leak.
   A-FLUTTER -- persistent.  Would hold on DC cardioversion in context of
   sepsis/peritonitis (likely precipitant for A-Flutter), continue
   pharmacological treatment.  Cardiology to assess need and timing of
   cardioversion --> planned for tomorrow AM if remains in a-flutter.
   ANASTOMOTIC LEAK
 s/p surgical repair.  Dilaudid PCA pump for pain
   control.
   PERITONITIS
 clinically improving with antimicrobials.  Monitor exam.
   FEVERS -- Persistent, likely from peritonitis in the setting of
   anastomotic leak, now s/p surgical repair.  Continue antimicrobials.
   Consider repeat imaging with ABD/Pelvic CT.
   RECTO-SIGMOID CA -- s/p surgical excision.  f/u lymphnode biopsies and
   further outpatient plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2998**].
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Most likely pre-renal failure vs. ATN from
   perioperative hypotension.  Will continue with IVF, and reassess in
   am.  If not improving, can send off urine studies.  Avoid nephrotoxic
   meds
   FLUIDS
 continue to net volume expand in context of sepsis (3rd
   spacing).  Monitor I/O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- remains NPO.  [**Month (only) 8**] require replacing NGT if ileus
   remains.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer who underwent open low anterior resection surgery. The patient is currently in the ICU following surgical repair due to complications such as fevers in the setting of a small anastomotic leak.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 C (100.7 F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 132/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is in sinus rhythm with no atrial flutter.

The patient has been receiving various medications including heparin, diltiazem, pantoprazole, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, while creatinine levels are within normal range. Troponin-T levels are below detectable limits.

Assessment and plan include:
1. Atrial Flutter: Spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR) likely due to post-operative inflammation and infection. Heparin was stopped.
2. Fevers: Gram stain positive for Gram-negative rods (GNR) in peritoneal sample."

   54 year old male with a history of BPH, HTN, and recently diagnosed
   rectosigmoid cancer s/p open low anterior resection, complicated by
   fevers in the setting of a small anastomotic leak now in the ICU
   following surgical repair.
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: It was paroxysmal at first and now consistent, never
   symptomatic; fib vs flutter with variable block, went as high as 190.
   controlled by dilt and metoprolol IV at first but requiring increasing
   doses. Ultimately controlled with Dilt Basal/Bolus at 3:1 block. TTE
   with mild dilation of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 12515**] suitable protoplasm for SVT. Normal

   - continue Dilt drip
   - convert to bolus, likely 60 QID PO once able to take POs
   - Cards following
   - cardioversion planned for Monday
   - on heparin gtt
   .
   # Fevers:  Gram stain positive for GNR in peritoneal sample. Likely
   from peritonitis in the setting of anastomotic leak seen on
   fluoroscopy, now s/p surgical repair.  Had been dosed vanc/zosyn
   yesterday, and currently on vanc/cipro/flagyl.  With also a potential
   concern for c.diff, flagyl will also cover.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - trend fever curve; cooling techniques (bath, blanket), Tylenol when
   GI tract is not off-limits
   - CIS
   - consider re-imaging abdomen
   .
   # Anastomotic leak: now s/p surgical repair.  Continued co-management
   w/ general surgery.
   - NGT on suction
   - monitor drain output.
   - dilaudid PCA for pain control
   .
   # Rectosigmoid cancer: s/p surgical excision.
   - f/u lymph node biopsies and further outpatient plan per Dr.

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer status post open low anterior resection. He is currently in the ICU following surgical repair for a small anastomotic leak.

The patient has been experiencing atrial flutter, which has been well-controlled with diltiazem. Cardioversion is planned for Monday. He is also on a heparin drip.

The patient has fevers, and Gram stain of the peritoneal sample shows positive results for Gram-negative rods (GNR). This is likely due to peritonitis in the setting of an anastomotic leak seen on fluoroscopy, and the patient has undergone surgical repair. He is currently on vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl. There is a concern for Clostridium difficile infection, so flagyl will also cover this potential concern.

The patient has had an anastomotic leak that has been surgically repaired. He will continue to be managed in collaboration with general surgery.

The patient's rectosigmoid cancer has been surgically excised, and further outpatient planning will be done per Dr. [Last Name].

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, most likely due to pre-renal failure or acute tubular necrosis from perioperative hypotension. He has shown improvement with fluids. It is important to avoid nephrotoxic medications"

   54 yom recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer s/p open low anterior
   resection, complicated by anastomotic leak
 peritonitis.
   A-FLUTTER -- Converted.  Would hold on DC cardioversion in context of
   sepsis/peritonitis (likely precipitant for A-Flutter), continue
   pharmacological treatment.  Cardiology to assess need and timing of
   cardioversion --> planned for tomorrow AM if remains in a-flutter.
   ANASTOMOTIC LEAK
 s/p surgical repair.  Dilaudid PCA pump for pain
   control.
   PERITONITIS
 clinically stable, with limited progress.  Continue with
   antimicrobials.  Monitor exam.
   FEVERS -- Persistent, likely from peritonitis in the setting of
   anastomotic leak, now s/p surgical repair.  Continue antimicrobials.
   Consider repeat imaging with ABD/Pelvic CT.
   RECTO-SIGMOID CA -- s/p surgical excision.  f/u lymphnode biopsies and
   further outpatient plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2998**].
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Most likely pre-renal failure vs. ATN from
   perioperative hypotension.  Continue with IV fliuids.  Avoid
   nephrotoxic meds.  Monitor urine output, BUN, creat.
   FLUIDS
 continue to net volume expand in context of sepsis (3rd
   spacing).  Monitor I/O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- remains NPO.  [**Month (only) 8**] require replacing NGT if ileus

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male who was recently diagnosed with rectosigmoid cancer and underwent an open low anterior resection. Postoperatively, the patient developed an anastomotic leak and peritonitis, which led to sepsis. The patient is currently in the ICU and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anastomotic leak: The patient had a surgical complication involving a leak at the site of the surgical anastomosis. This can lead to peritonitis and ongoing infection.
2. Peritonitis: The patient developed peritonitis as a result of the anastomotic leak. This is an inflammation of the peritoneum, the lining of the abdominal cavity, and can be a life-threatening condition if not treated promptly.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute renal failure, possibly due to pre-renal causes such as hypotension during surgery or postoperative period. It is important to monitor urine output, BUN, and creatinine levels.
4. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers, which could be attributed to the ongoing infection and inflammation caused by the anastomotic leak and peritonitis.
5. Cardiac arrhythmia (A-flutter): The patient converted from atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. It is important to continue pharmacological treatment and assess the need and timing of cardioversion in the context of sepsis/peritonitis"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yom recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer s/p open low anterior
   resection, complicated by anastomotic leak.
   A-FLUTTER -- Converted.  Would hold on DC cardioversion in context of
   sepsis/peritonitis (likely precipitant for A-Flutter), continue
   pharmacological treatment.  Cardiology to assess need and timing of
   cardioversion --> planned for tomorrow AM if remains in a-flutter.
   ANASTOMOTIC LEAK
 s/p surgical repair.  Dilaudid PCA pump for pain
   control.
   PERITONITIS
 clinically stable, with limited progress.  Continue with
   antimicrobials.  Monitor exam.
   FEVERS -- Persistent, likely from peritonitis in the setting of
   anastomotic leak, now s/p surgical repair.  Continue antimicrobials.
   Consider repeat imaging with ABD/Pelvic CT.
   RECTO-SIGMOID CA -- s/p surgical excision.  f/u lymphnode biopsies and
   further outpatient plan per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2998**].
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Most likely pre-renal failure vs. ATN from
   perioperative hypotension.  Will continue with IVF, and reassess in
   am.  If not improving, can send off urine studies.  Avoid nephrotoxic
   meds.
   FLUIDS
 continue to net volume expand in context of sepsis (3rd
   spacing).  Monitor I/O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- remains NPO.  [**Month (only) 8**] require replacing NGT if ileus
   remains.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male who was recently diagnosed with rectosigmoid cancer and underwent an open low anterior resection. However, the surgery was complicated by an anastomotic leak, which has since been surgically repaired. The patient is currently in the ICU due to multiple complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is experiencing atrial flutter, which has been pharmacologically treated. There is a plan for cardioversion if the patient remains in atrial flutter.

2. Anastomotic leak: Although the leak has been surgically repaired, there is still a risk of infection and further complications.

3. Peritonitis: The patient is showing signs of peritonitis, likely due to the anastomotic leak. This condition requires continuous monitoring and treatment with antimicrobials.

4. FEVERS: The patient's persistent fever is likely related to peritonitis and may require repeat imaging with an abdominal/pelvic CT.

5. Rectosigmoid cancer: The patient's recent cancer diagnosis will require follow-up lymph node biopsies and further outpatient plan.

6. Acute renal failure: The patient is at risk of acute renal failure, possibly due to pre-renal failure or acute tubular necrosis from perioperative hypotension. IV fluids and avoiding nephrotoxic medications are recommended.

7. Fluid management: The patient requires ongoing fluid management to address third"

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old male with a history of BPH, HTN, and recently diagnosed
   rectosigmoid cancer s/p open low anterior resection, complicated by
   fevers in the setting of a small anastomotic leak now in the ICU
   following surgical repair.
   .
   # Atrial Flutter
 now spontaneously converted to NSR.  Likely [**2-9**]
   post-operative inflammation, infection.
   - stopped anticoagulation
   - Cards recs: low dose PO BB + ASA when [**Doctor First Name **] comfortable
   .

   from peritonitis in the setting of anastomotic leak seen on
   fluoroscopy, now s/p surgical repair.  Had been dosed vanc/zosyn
   yesterday, and currently on vanc/cipro/flagyl.  With also a potential
   concern for c.diff, flagyl will also cover.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - trend fever curve; cooling techniques (bath, blanket), Tylenol when
   GI tract is not off-limits
   - CIS
   - consider re-imaging abdomen
   .
   # Anastomotic leak: now s/p surgical repair.  Continued co-management
   w/ general surgery.
   - monitor drain output.
   - dilaudid PCA for pain control
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of BPH, HTN, and recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer who underwent an open low anterior resection. The patient is now in the ICU following surgical repair for a small anastomotic leak and subsequent fevers.

The patient's current medical complications include atrial flutter (now converted to NSR), fevers, anastomotic leak, rectosigmoid cancer, acute renal failure, and BPH.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers and gram stain positive for GNR in peritoneal sample, indicating a possible infection. This could be due to peritonitis in the setting of an anastomotic leak. The patient is already on antibiotics, but close monitoring and further intervention may be required.

2. C. difficile infection: The patient is at risk for developing Clostridium difficile infection due to the use of antibiotics. Flagyl has been started to cover this potential concern.

3. Anastomotic leak: Although the leak has been surgically repaired, there is a possibility of recurrent or new leaks. Monitoring drain output and continued co-management with general surgery will be important.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient is showing signs of acute renal failure, most likely due to pre-renal failure or ATN from perioperative hypotension. Fluids have improved the condition, and it"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer. He underwent open low anterior resection surgery for the rectosigmoid cancer but developed complications including fevers and an anastomotic leak. The patient was subsequently admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient experienced 1 liter of bilious output, and an NG tube was placed due to concerns of obstruction. This could be related to the recent surgery or a possible anastomotic leak.

2. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, and gram stain positive for gram-negative rods (GNR) in peritoneal samples. This suggests an infection, likely from peritonitis secondary to the anastomotic leak. The patient has already received vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole.

3. Anastomotic leak: The patient had an anastomotic leak post-surgery, which was surgically repaired. Close monitoring of drain output is recommended.

4. Atrial Flutter: The patient experienced atrial flutter, which spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm. It is likely due to post-operative inflammation and infection.

5. Acute Renal Failure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of BPH, HTN, and recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer who underwent open low anterior resection. The patient is now in the ICU following surgical repair for a small anastomotic leak.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Nausea/vomiting: The patient has experienced 1L of bilious output, leading to the placement of an NG tube. There is concern for obstruction.

2. Fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, and gram stain results show positive for GNR in peritoneal samples. This suggests a likely infection due to peritonitis caused by the anastomotic leak. The patient is currently on antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) and will continue with f/u blood cultures, trend fever curve, cooling techniques, Tylenol when the GI tract is not off-limits, CIS, re-image abdomen, IV Vanco per surgery, and adding diff to CBC.

3. Anastomotic leak: The patient had an anastomotic leak, which has been surgically repaired. Continued co-management with general surgery is recommended, including monitoring drain output and providing pain control with dilaudid PCA.

4. Atrial Flutter: The patient experienced atrial flutter but has spontaneously converted to NSR. This is likely due to post-operative inflammation and infection. Anticoagulation has been stopped, and low dose"

","The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer who underwent an open low anterior resection. He is currently in the ICU following surgical repair for a small anastomotic leak.

The patient's current conditions include nausea and vomiting, fevers, anastomotic leak, atrial flutter, rectosigmoid cancer, acute renal failure, and BPH.

Assessment and plan:
1. Nausea/vomiting: The patient has experienced 1 liter of bilious output, and an NG tube has been placed. There is concern for obstruction. A CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast is ordered, and the NGT placement with over 1.5 liters drained.
2. Fevers: The patient has fevers, and the gram stain is positive for gram-negative rods (GNR) in the peritoneal sample. This is likely due to peritonitis in the setting of anastomotic leak seen on fluoroscopy, which has been surgically repaired. The patient is currently on vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl. Blood cultures are to be followed up, and fever curve trends are monitored. Cooling techniques such as a bath or blanket will be used, along with Tylenol when the GI tract is not off-limits.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male who was recently diagnosed with rectosigmoid cancer and underwent an open low anterior resection. However, the surgery was complicated by an anastomotic leak and subsequent peritonitis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing sepsis, likely due to the peritonitis. He is also in a-flutter, which is a type of abnormal heart rhythm. The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, and he is at risk for acute renal failure. His nutritional support is currently inadequate as he remains NPO (nothing by mouth). The patient's condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anastomotic leak: The patient had a surgical complication known as an anastomotic leak following his cancer surgery. This can lead to peritonitis and sepsis if not promptly addressed.
2. Sepsis: Due to the anastomotic leak and subsequent peritonitis, the patient has developed sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by systemic inflammation and infection.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient is at risk for acute renal failure, which can be caused by factors such as perioperative hypotension or pre-renal failure.
4. Malnutrition: As the patient is unable to eat orally, he is at risk for malnutrition, which can further compromise his immune system and recovery.
5. A-flutter: The patient is experiencing a-flutter"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male who has been diagnosed with rectosigmoid cancer and underwent an open low anterior resection. Unfortunately, the surgery was complicated by an anastomotic leak leading to peritonitis. The patient underwent surgical repair for the anastomotic leak and is currently in the ICU.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. A-Flutter: The patient has been experiencing atrial flutter, which has been converted to normal sinus rhythm. Cardioversion was planned for the next day if the patient remains in a-flutter.

2. Anastomotic leak: The patient had a postoperative anastomotic leak that required surgical repair. The patient is currently on pain control with Dilaudid PCA pump.

3. Peritonitis: The patient is showing limited progress in terms of clinical stability due to peritonitis. Antimicrobials are being continued, and the patient's exam is being closely monitored.

4. Fever: The persistent fever is likely related to the peritonitis in the setting of the anastomotic leak, which has now been surgically repaired. Antimicrobials are being continued, and repeat imaging with an abdominal/pelvic CT may be considered.

5. Rectosigmoid cancer: The patient underwent surgical excision of the rectosigmoid cancer, and further outpatient plans are pending lymph node biopsies.

   Assessment and Plan
   54 year old male with a history of BPH, HTN, and recently diagnosed
   rectosigmoid cancer s/p open low anterior resection, complicated by
   fevers in the setting of a small anastomotic leak now in the ICU
   following surgical repair.
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting: 1L of bilious output with NG tube placement. Concern
   for obstruction.
   - Per surgery: CT abd/pelvis with contrast
   - NGT placed with over 1.5 lt drained
   .
   # Fevers:  Gram stain positive for GNR in peritoneal sample. Likely
   from peritonitis in the setting of anastomotic leak seen on
   fluoroscopy, now s/p surgical repair.  Had been dosed vanc/zosyn
   yesterday, and currently on vanc/cipro/flagyl.  With also a potential
   concern for c.diff, flagyl will also cover.  Sacral abcess s/p
   drainage.
   - f/u blood cultures
   - trend fever curve; cooling techniques (bath, blanket), Tylenol when
   GI tract is not off-limits
   - re-image abdomen to eval abcess progression
   - IV Vanco per surgery
   - Add diff to CBC
   .
   # Anastomotic leak: now s/p surgical repair.  Continued co-management
   w/ general surgery.
   - monitor drain output.
   - dilaudid PCA for pain control
   .
   # Atrial Flutter
 now spontaneously converted to NSR.  Likely [**2-9**]
   post-operative inflammation, infection.
   - stopped anticoagulation
   - Cards recs: low dose PO BB + ASA when [**Doctor First Name **] comfortable
   .
   # Rectosigmoid cancer: s/p surgical excision.
   - f/u lymph node biopsies and further outpatient plan per Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 2998**].
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Most likely etiologies include pre-renal failure
   vs. ATN from perioperative hypotension.  Improved with fluids.
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - trend UOP.
   .
   # BPH: will hold hytrin in case he becomes hypotensive.
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypertension (HTN), and recently diagnosed rectosigmoid cancer who underwent an open low anterior resection. The patient is currently in the ICU following surgical repair for a small anastomotic leak.

The patient's chief complaint is nausea/vomiting, with 1 liter of bilious output prompting the placement of a nasogastric tube. There is concern for obstruction. The patient also has fevers, and Gram stain positive for Gram-negative rods (GNR) in the peritoneal sample suggests possible infection related to peritonitis in the setting of anastomotic leak. Surgical repair has been performed, and the patient is currently on vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and flagyl. A sacral abscess was also drained.

The patient is now post-operative and has experienced atrial flutter, which has spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). This may be related to post-operative inflammation and infection. Anticoagulation has been stopped, and low-dose oral beta-blocker (BB) and aspirin are recommended when the doctor is comfortable.

The patient has a history of rectosigmoid cancer, which was surgically excised. Further outpatient plan will be determined by Dr. [Last Name (Title)]. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely due to pre-renal failure or acute"
