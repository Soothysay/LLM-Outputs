","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of metastatic head and neck cancer, who presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), severe sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a background of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and drug use. There are concerns about possible endocarditis, and further testing will be done to investigate this. The patient's respiratory failure is due to primary respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. He is also experiencing renal failure, as indicated by an increasing creatinine level. The patient's coagulation profile shows signs of DIC with a low platelet count and elevated D-dimer levels. He is receiving cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets to address the coagulopathy. A repeat head CT scan is planned in 24 hours to monitor for any changes in the subdural hematoma. The patient's condition is critical, and he remains in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. worsening of the subarachnoid hemorrhage leading to increased intracranial pressure and neurological deterioration.
2. progression of sepsis and organ dysfunction, potentially resulting in multiple organ failure.
3. further deterioration of renal function, leading to acute kidney injury.
4. development of new thrombotic events due to ongoing DIC.

","The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of metastatic head and neck cancer, who was found unconscious. A CT scan revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has splinter hemorrhages on his fingernail beds, suggestive of infective endocarditis. The patient also has a history of hepatitis C and cirrhosis, and is a drug user.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 100/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 13 mmHg, and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is not assessable.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 7.4 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 29 K/uL, elevated troponin-T level of 0.25 ng/mL, elevated lactate level of 6.0 mmol/L, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 996 IU/L.

   ID was concerned about the possibility of mycotic aneurysm, and wanted
   CTA or angiogram. Given elevated Creatinine, CTA was ordered. Pt was
   given Mucomyst, Bicarb before and after. No obvious mycotic aneurysm on
   CTA and subdural hematome appears stable.
   Pt noted to be hyperventalating when off propofol.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer who is currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. The patient was found confused and complaining of chest pain by his sister. The patient has multiple infarcts and labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.9°F, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/62 to 127/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 530 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.56, pCO2 of 29, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 350, and bicarbonate (HCO3) level of 27.

The patient's physical examination reveals rales in the lungs, osler nodes on extremities, and [Last Name] lesions. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 26.8%, platelet count (Plt) of 29 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.5 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.37, total bilirubin (T Bili) of 4.1 mg/dL, and liver enzymes (AST and ALT) of 83 and 45 U/L, respectively.

The patient's imaging includes a chest X-ray (CXR) showing hazy opacities in the left lung, suggestive of consolidation. The patient meets the Duke criteria for endocarditis, and there is a concern for septic emboli.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Septic emboli: Due to the presence of endocarditis, there is a risk of septic emboli causing further complications such as strokes, organ damage, or other systemic infections.

2. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS): Given the patient's DIC, sepsis, and respiratory distress, there is a potential risk of MODS, where multiple organ systems fail due to inadequate perfusion and oxygenation.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, with hypoxemia and hypercapnia. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to respiratory failure.

4. Cardiovascular collapse: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia indicate potential cardiovascular instability. There is a risk of cardiovascular collapse if the underlying causes, such as sepsis or end"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. He was found by his sister to be confused, complaining of chest pain, and diagnosed with multiple infracts and labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient has been intubated for respiratory failure and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He also meets criteria for sepsis with septic emboli, likely due to infective endocarditis. The patient has several other medical issues, including respiratory alkalosis, DIC, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infective Endocarditis: The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate a possible infection of the heart valves, which could lead to further complications such as septic emboli and systemic infection.
2. Sepsis with Septic Emboli: The patient's fever, increased respiratory rate, and likely septic emboli suggest an ongoing infection that may spread throughout the body, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially death.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): DIC is a serious condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body. It can lead to multiple organ failure and may result in bleeding or clotting disorders.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever and hypotension. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical complications, including an enlarged liver, positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci in clusters, suspected mycotic aneurysm, hyperventilation, and subdural hematoma. The patient has allergies to penicillins and ampicillin. The patient's vital signs show elevated temperature, tachycardia, and normal blood pressure. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 530 mL, PS of 20 cmH2O, RR set at 16, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI deferred due to RR >35. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci in clusters suggest a bacterial infection. This may lead to sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.
2. Mycotic aneurysm: The concern for a mycotic aneurysm raised by the ID physician indicates a possible infection-related aneurysm, which can lead to life-threatening bleeding if ruptured.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's hyperventilation and elevated RSBI indicate respiratory distress. This could be due to the underlying infection or the effects of mechanical ventilation.
4. Liver dysfunction: The enlarged liver observed on ultrasound and abnormal liver function tests suggest possible liver dysfunction, which can be associated with sepsis or other systemic complications.
5. Coagulopathy: The low platelet count and elevated D-dimer may indicate a coagulopathy, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Organ dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level indicates possible kidney dysfunction, while the abnormal liver function tests suggest liver dysfunction. These organ dysfunctions can further complicate the patient's condition and recovery.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's condition and implement appropriate interventions to prevent and manage these potential complications."

","The patient is a 58-year-old male who presented to the hospital with chest pain and shortness of breath. On admission, the patient was hypotensive and tachycardic, with a fever of 101.9°F. Blood cultures were drawn from Hospital1 872 and grew gram-positive cocci in clusters in two bottles. The ID physician was concerned about the possibility of a mycotic aneurysm and recommended either a CT angiogram or an angiogram. Due to the elevated creatinine levels, a CT angiogram was ordered. The patient was given Mucomyst and bicarb before and after the procedure. No obvious mycotic aneurysm was found on the CT angiogram, and the subdural hematoma appears stable. The ID physician recommends covering with vancomycin and checking cultures at Hospital1 7. The patient was noted to be hyperventilating when off propofol, so 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) were given. An ultrasound of the right upper quadrant (RUQ) showed an enlarged liver but no ductal dilation. 

The patient has allergies to penicillins and ampicillin, with the last dose of antibiotics being gentamicin at 06:20 AM on 02/15/2153, cefepime at 08:00 AM on 02/15/2153, and vancomycin at 08:45 PM on 02/15/2153. The patient is currently on pantoprazole (Protonix) at 04:00 PM on 02/15/2153. 

Vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.8°C (101.9°F) at 08:00 PM on 02/15/2153, current temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 105 beats per minute with a range of 88-105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/61 mmHg to 129/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute with a range of 27-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia, central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) is not available. The total fluid input since 54 AM is 8,641 mL, including 735 mL of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 435 mL of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The total fluid output is 1,569 mL, consisting of 520 mL of urine output, 300 mL of chest tube drainage, and 899 mL of PRBCs. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set tidal volume (Vt) of 530 mL, peak inspiratory pressure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 530 mL, PS of 20 cmH2O, RR set at 16, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI deferred due to RR >35. His vital signs include a temperature of 102.3°F (39.1°C), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 147/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's CVP is 9 mmHg, with total input of 3,374 mL and total output of 1,355 mL. Fluid balance is positive at 2,019 mL. The patient's ABG shows pH of 7.55, PaCO2 of 30 mmHg, HCO3- of 113 mEq/L, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 283, Ve of 17.2 L/min, and SpO2 of 96%. The patient's labs reveal WBC count of 6.2 K/uL, Hct of 26.3%, Plt of 32 K/uL, Cr of 1.4 mg/dL, TropT of 0.37 ng/mL, TCO2 of 27 mEq/L, Glucose of 169 mg/dL, and various other lab values within normal range or showing mild abnormalities. The patient has a history of penicillin allergy and has received antibiotics including gentamicin, cefepime, and vancomycin. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical condition and prolonged ICU stay may increase the risk of stress ulcer development.
4. Fluid overload: The positive fluid balance and low urine output suggest the possibility of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure.
5. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated WBC count indicate the possibility of an ongoing infection.
6. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine level suggests the possibility of AKI, which can be caused by various factors such as hypotension, nephrotoxic medications, or sepsis."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Events: OSH confirmed Staph bacteremia.  Received FFP.

   PS20/8 TV 530s RR 30 FiO2 40% sats 96%
   I/O 3.3/2.3 out
   Exam notable for being responsive to sternal rub and withdrawing to all
   4
s off of propofol.  [**1-27**] SM.  Decreased BS at bases. 2+ edema
   throughout.  Stigmata of septic emboli.
   Hct 26.3 Plt 32, from 46.
   Chem-7 with bicarb of 21, Cr 1.7 (trending up)
   Tbili up to 4.3

   7.55/30/113   from 7.52/31
   [**Month/Day (4) 339**] level 36
   Meds include: [**Month/Day (4) 339**] (held), Propofol, RISS, acetylcysteine, pantoprozole
   51 y/o with h/o IVDU with staph endocarditis and septic emboli with
   subdural / subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   Agree with plan to [**Last Name (LF) 339**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] discuss potential desensitization for
   nafcillin if we confirm MSSA.  Not a CT surgical candidate currently
   due to subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   Continue support with FFP and Platelets per recs from neuro exam.
   Profound respiratory alkalosis seems likely centrally driven, though
   consider pain / agitation.  Remains on vent due to mental status and
   minute ventilation requirements.  ARF and rising LFTs
 will need to
   follow closely.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer who is currently receiving chemotherapy and radiation. The patient was found confused and complaining of chest pain, with multiple infracts and labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient meets the criteria for endocarditis on echo and sepsis with septic emboli. He has an alkalosis, likely respiratory alkalosis due to overbreathing the ventilator, and DIC, which is likely due to sepsis and malignancy.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.3 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 147/76 to 98/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 32,000 cells per microliter, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 32,000 cells per microliter, elevated creatinine of 1.7 mg/dL, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated lactate level of 2.3 mmol/L. The patient's coagulation profile indicates a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 31.4 seconds and a low fibrin"

The patient meets the Duke Criteria for endocarditis, which is confirmed on echo. There is concern for sepsis with septic emboli due to fever, increased respiratory rate, and likely septic emboli. The patient's blood pressures have been maintained with fluids only, and lactate is improving, indicating improved perfusion.

The patient also has respiratory alkalosis, possibly due to overbreathing the vent or opioid withdrawal. He has thrombocytopenia, likely due to liver disease or DIC, and evidence of schistocytes on smear. The patient's neurologic status is nonfocal, and a CT scan showed subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but no aneurysm was seen. The patient's cardiac status includes a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with elevated troponin levels.

The patient requires ongoing supportive care, including treatment for sepsis, DIC, and respiratory failure. The patient should be kept on mechanical ventilation, and sedation should be continued. The patient's INR should be maintained at 1.4, and platelets should be increased to 50. Blood cultures should be"

   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt and low fibrinogen,
   with occasional schistocytes on smear. Thrombocytopenia may be due to
   liver disease or DIC.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. He was found confused and complaining of chest pain, with multiple infracts and labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Assessment and plan:
1. Endocarditis: Confirmed on echo meeting Duke Criteria. ID consulting, recs appreciated.
2. Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Meets sepsis criteria fever, increase RR, and likely septic emboli. Given history of IV drug use per report, there is concern for endocarditis. Blood pressures have been maintained with fluids only. CVP at 12 and lactate improving which implies improved perfusion.
3. Alkalosis: Respiratory alkalosis, still outbreathing the vent, pCO2 stable.
4. DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt, and low fibrinogen, with occasional schistocytes on smear. Thrombocytopenia may be due to liver disease or DIC.
5. SAH: Unclear of spontaneous or in the setting of fall. Neuro exam nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat imaging yesterday showing continued interval slight decrease in density of SAH since earlier in the day. No aneurysm seen but final pending reformats.
6. Respiratory failure: Intubated for poor mental status. Oxygenating and ventilating well.
7. NSTEMI: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress. Likely due to SAH and hemolysis. EKG unremarkable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Endocarditis: This is already confirmed on echo meeting Duke Criteria, and the patient is receiving appropriate treatment with antibiotics.
2. Sepsis with Septic Emboli: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, which can lead to further deterioration in organ function and potentially death if not managed appropriately.
3. Alkalosis: The respiratory alkalosis may persist if the patient continues to breathe too rapidly or if the ventilator settings are not adjusted accordingly.
4. DIC: The patient is already showing signs of DIC, which can progress to more severe complications such as organ failure and bleeding.
5. SAH: If the SAH is spontaneous, there is a risk of rebleeding or development of an aneurysm. If it is due to trauma, there is a risk of complications related to the injury.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring, as there is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
7. NSTEMI: Although the EKG is unremarkable, the elevated troponin levels indicate myocardial injury. Close monitoring of cardiac enzymes and cardiac function is necessary"

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer, currently receiving chemotherapy and radiation. He was found confused and complaining of chest pain, with multiple infracts and labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient meets the Duke criteria for endocarditis, and there is concern for sepsis with septic emboli due to his history of IV drug use. The patient's blood pressures have been maintained with fluids only, and lactate levels are improving, indicating improved perfusion.

The patient has respiratory alkalosis due to overbreathing on the ventilator, and there is evidence of DIC likely secondary to sepsis and malignancy. Supportive care should be continued, and sepsis treatment should be pursued as mentioned earlier. The patient's platelet count is low, which may be due to liver disease or DIC.

The patient has subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), with unclear spontaneous or traumatic origin. Neurological examination is nonfocal, and CT imaging shows a slight decrease in density of SAH since earlier in the day. No aneurysm was seen, but final pending reformats are expected.

The patient is currently intubated for poor mental status and is oxygenating and ventilating well. Propofol sedation should be resumed as needed, and head of bed elevation should be considered. The patient likely had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction ("

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Events notable for persistent fevers; persistent tachypnea, did not
   change with propofol.

   following simple commands
 reportedly moved b/l toes, though not to my
   exam.  PERRL, scleral icterus.  Lungs CTA B/L, tachy, RR.  Abd
   distended and diffusely tender.  2+ edema.
   Labs notable for WBC 6 down from 8, Hct 25.3 (from 25) Plt 73, INR 1.7,

   Meds: RISS, protonix, vanc, PRN morphine.
   51 yo man with h/o IVDU here with endocarditis with multiple foci of
   septic emboli (lungs, spleen, likely brain, kidneys) and subdural
   hemorrhage, respiratory failure.  Not a candidate for surgical
   intervention given hemorrhage.  Today though mental status overall
   appears slightly better concerning abdominal exam,?abcess; also remains
   with rising LFTs, respiking fevers.  Agree with plan to abdominal CT
   and consider RUQ U/S, plan for nafcillin desensitization.  Severe resp
   alkalosis (?centrally driven, not really responsive to propofol or pain
   medication) and mental status possibly volume overload, barriers to
   extubation; would also consider keeping intubated for imaging and in
   setting of desensitization.  Remainder of plan as above.
   Pt is critically ill: CC time 40 min.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA currently
   receiving chemo and radiation was found by his sister today to be
   confused and complaining of chest pain, and found to have multiple
   infracts and labs consistent with DIC.
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo meeting Duke Criteria.  PSH blood
   cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - continue vanc
    - blood cx qday
    - follow up speciation of all cultures
    - discuss nafcillin desensitization with ID
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Meets sepsis criteria fever, increase RR,
   and likely septic emboli. Given history of IV drug use per report,
   there is concern for endocarditis. Blood pressures have been maintained
   with fluids only. CVP at 12 and lactate improving which implies
   improved perfusion.
   - Continue vanco; possible nafcillin desensitization as above
   - Continue fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate to document improvement
   - Follow up culture data here
   # Alkalosis: respiratory alkalosis, still overbreathing the vent, pCO2
   stable.  Initially unable to tolerate RSBI.  Potentially component of
   opioid withdrawal
 unclear when he stopped methadone
 up to 1 week
   without.  ABG roughly the same off propofol.  Mental status is
   improving, on CPAP trial.
    - continue to wean vent as MS improves
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt and low fibrinogen,
   with occasional schistocytes on smear. Thrombocytopenia may be due to
   liver disease or DIC.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as above
   - Cycle DIC labs
   - Platelet goal is 30 and INR goal is < 1.4
   # SAH: Unclear of spontaneous or in the setting of fall. Neuro exam
   nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat imaging [**2-16**]
   showing continued interval slight decrease in density of SAH since
   earlier in the day. No aneursym seen but final pending reformats. MS is
   now improving, following some simple commands.
   - Appreciate Neurosurgery input
   - Goal INR 1.4, Plts 50
   - Goal SBP less than 150
   - Q2H neuro checks
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for poor mental status. Oxygenating
   and ventilating well.
   - Continue AC ventilation with CPAP trials
   - Propofol as needed for sedation, currently on hold
   - HOB evaluation, mouth care
   # NSTEMI: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress. Likely due to
   SAH and hemolysis. EKG unremarkable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer who is currently receiving chemotherapy and radiation. He was found confused, complaining of chest pain, and had multiple infracts and labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient meets the criteria for endocarditis and sepsis with septic emboli. He also has respiratory alkalosis, DIC, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient meets the Duke criteria for endocarditis, which is a serious infection of the heart valves. If left untreated, it can lead to valve damage, embolic events, and systemic infection.
2. Sepsis with Septic Emboli: The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection. Septic emboli can lead to organ damage and failure.
3. DIC: Disseminated intravascular coagulation is a serious condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body. It can lead to multiple organ failure and death if not promptly treated.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Improper oxygenation or ventilation can lead to respiratory failure and subsequent hypoxia.
5. SAH: Subarachnoid hemorrhage"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer currently receiving chemotherapy and radiation. He was found confused, complaining of chest pain, and had multiple infracts and labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient meets the criteria for endocarditis and sepsis with septic emboli. He has respiratory alkalosis and is overbreathing the ventilator. There is evidence of DIC, thrombocytopenia, and schistocytes on smear. The patient also has subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), possibly spontaneous or due to a fall. Neurological exam is nonfocal, and CT imaging shows continued interval decrease in density of SAH. No aneurysm seen but final pending reformats. The patient is intubated for poor mental status, oxygenating and ventilating well. He has elevated troponin in the setting of distress, likely due to SAH and hemolysis. EKG unremarkable. The patient has a history of head and neck cancer and hepatitis C. He is currently receiving prophylactic medications and has an arterial line and multi-lumen access. The next of kin has been informed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient meets the Duke criteria for endocarditis, which is an infection of the heart valves. If left untreated, it can lead to further complications such as septic emboli, heart failure, or even death.
2. Sepsis with Septic Emboli: The patient's presentation with fever, increased respiratory rate, and likely septic emboli suggests sepsis. If not treated promptly and effectively, sepsis can progress to septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), or death.
3. DIC: The patient's lab results indicate DIC, a condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting. DIC can lead to bleeding complications, organ dysfunction, and potentially death if not managed appropriately.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If the underlying cause is not addressed, there is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, leading to respiratory arrest and death.
5. SAH: The patient has evidence of SAH, which can be a life-threatening condition if the underlying cause, such as an aneurysm rupture, is not identified and treated promptly. SAH can lead to neurological deficits, seizures, and increased intracranial pressure.
6. NSTEMI: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest a possible non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). If left untreated, it can lead to heart damage, heart failure, or arrhythmias.

The patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and prompt management of potential complications to improve his health outcome."

   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Meets sepsis criteria fever, increase RR,
   and likely septic emboli. Given history of IV drug use per report,
   there is concern for endocarditis. Blood pressures have been maintained
   with fluids only. CVP at 12 and lactate improving which implies
   improved perfusion.

   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt and low fibrinogen,
   with occasional schistocytes on smear. Thrombocytopenia may be due to
   liver disease or DIC.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as above
   - Cycle DIC labs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer, currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. He was found confused and complaining of chest pain, with multiple infracts and labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient meets the criteria for endocarditis, sepsis with septic emboli, respiratory alkalosis, DIC, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), respiratory failure, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient has been confirmed to have endocarditis meeting the Duke criteria. This condition can lead to further complications such as heart valve damage, infection spreading to other parts of the body, and embolic events.
2. Sepsis with Septic Emboli: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis with septic emboli. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ dysfunction, and septic emboli can cause blockages in blood vessels, leading to organ damage or failure.
3. DIC: The patient has signs of DIC, which is a serious complication characterized by abnormal blood clotting throughout the body. DIC can result in bleeding or blood clots, organ damage, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If not managed appropriately,"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA currently
   receiving chemo and radiation was found by his sister today to be
   confused and complaining of chest pain, and found to have multiple
   infracts and labs consistent with DIC.
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo meeting Duke Criteria.  PSH blood
   cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - continue vanc
    - blood cx qday
    - follow up speciation of all cultures
    - discuss nafcillin desensitization with ID
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Meets sepsis criteria fever, increase RR,
   and likely septic emboli. Given history of IV drug use per report,
   there is concern for endocarditis. Blood pressures have been maintained
   with fluids only. CVP at 12 and lactate improving which implies
   improved perfusion.
   - Continue vanco; nafcillin desensitization as above
   - Continue fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate to document improvement
   - Follow up culture data here
   # Alkalosis: respiratory alkalosis, still overbreathing the vent, pCO2
   stable.  Initially unable to tolerate RSBI.  Potentially component of
   opioid withdrawal
 unclear when he stopped methadone
 up to 1 week
   without.  ABG roughly the same off propofol.  Mental status is
   improving, on CPAP trial.
    - continue to wean vent as MS improves
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt and low fibrinogen,
   with occasional schistocytes on smear. Thrombocytopenia may be due to
   liver disease or DIC.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as above
   - Cycle DIC labs
   - Platelet goal is 30 and INR goal is < 1.4, will confirm w/ neurosurg
   # SAH: Unclear of spontaneous or in the setting of fall. Neuro exam
   nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat imaging [**2-16**]
   showing continued interval slight decrease in density of SAH since
   earlier in the day. No aneursym seen but final pending reformats. MS is
   now improving, following some simple commands.
   - Appreciate Neurosurgery input
   - Goal INR 1.4, Plts 50
   - Goal SBP less than 150
   - Q2H neuro checks
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for poor mental status. Oxygenating
   and ventilating well.
   - Continue AC ventilation with CPAP trials
   - Propofol as needed for sedation, currently on hold
   - HOB evaluation, mouth care
   - will keep intubated through nafcillin desensitization
   # NSTEMI: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress. Likely due to
   SAH and hemolysis. EKG unremarkable.
   - Trend CE

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer who is currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. The patient presented with confusion, chest pain, multiple infracts, and laboratory findings consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Endocarditis: The patient meets the Duke criteria for endocarditis, which is confirmed by an echocardiogram. Blood cultures with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) are sensitive to vancomycin. Consultation with an infectious disease specialist and cardiovascular surgery has been requested.

2. Sepsis with Septic Emboli: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, including fever, increased respiratory rate, and likely septic emboli. Given the history of intravenous drug use, there is concern for endocarditis. Blood pressures have been maintained with fluids only, and lactate levels are improving, indicating improved perfusion.

3. Alkalosis: The patient has respiratory alkalosis due to overbreathing on the ventilator. This may be related to opioid withdrawal or other causes. ABG results are stable, and the patient's mental status is improving.

4. DIC: The patient likely has DIC in the setting of sepsis and malignancy. Laboratory findings include elevated D-dimer, prolonged PTT and PT, low fibr"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA currently
   receiving chemo and radiation was found by his sister today to be
   confused and complaining of chest pain, and found to have multiple
   infarcts and labs consistent with DIC.
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - discontinue vancomycin
    - blood cx q day, begin to space as possible.
    - Nafcillin desentisization complete; likely discontinue vancomycin
   and continue nafcillin.
   - daily EKGs
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Meets sepsis criteria fever, increase RR,
   and likely septic emboli. Given history of IV drug use per report,
   there was concern for endocarditis. Blood pressures have been
   maintained with fluids only. CVP at 12 and lactate improving which
   implies improved perfusion.
   - Continue nafcillin as above
   - Continue fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate to document improvement
   - Follow up culture data here
   # Alkalosis: respiratory alkalosis, still overbreathing the vent, pCO2
   stable.  Initially unable to tolerate RSBI.  Potentially component of
   opioid withdrawal
 unclear when he stopped methadone
 up to 1 week
   without.  ABG roughly the same off propofol.  Mental status is
   improving, on CPAP trial.
    - continue to wean vent as MS improves
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt and low fibrinogen,
   with occasional schistocytes on smear. Thrombocytopenia may be due to
   liver disease or DIC.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as above
   - Cycle DIC labs
   - Platelet goal is 30 and INR goal is < 1.4, will confirm w/ neurosurg
   # SAH: Unclear of spontaneous or in the setting of fall. Neuro exam
   nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat imaging [**2-16**]
   showing continued interval slight decrease in density of SAH since
   earlier in the day. No aneursym seen but final pending reformats. MS is
   now improving, following some simple commands.
   - Appreciate Neurosurgery input
   - Goal INR 1.4, Plts 50
   - Goal SBP less than 150
   - Q2H neuro checks
   # Acute Renal Failure
   - likely elevated after dye load yesterday, in conjunction with sepsis
   in low flow state.  Monitor UOP.
   - renally dose medications
   - check urine lytes/sediment/eophils.
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for poor mental status. Oxygenating
   and ventilating well.
   - Continue PS ventilation, drop settings to [**7-1**] and then down to 5/5 as
   tolerated.
   - Propofol as needed for sedation, currently on hold
   - HOB evaluation, mouth care
   # NSTEMI: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress. Likely due to
   SAH and hemolysis. EKG unremarkable.
   - Trend CE
   - Tele
   - No heparin or aspirin given above hematologic derangements
   # Head and neck cancer: Follow up with outpatient oncologist
   # Hep C: Unknown baseline. Will attempt to obtain records.
   # FEN: NS 75 cc/hr, replete electrolytes, restart tube feeds as patient
   not to be extubated today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer currently receiving chemotherapy and radiation. The patient was found confused and complaining of chest pain, and subsequent tests revealed multiple infarcts and laboratory results consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient also meets Duke criteria for endocarditis, which is confirmed on echo involving the aortic and tricuspid valves. There is concern for sepsis with septic emboli, and the patient has been maintained on fluids with goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) over 60 and central venous pressure (CVP) 8-12. The patient's mental status is improving, and they are being weaned off the ventilator.

The patient has several other medical conditions and complications, including alkalosis, DIC, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), acute renal failure, respiratory failure, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient requires ongoing supportive care, including blood product transfusions, antibiotics, and close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of sepsis and septic shock, progression of DIC, further decline in renal function, development of new embolic events, worsening of respiratory status, and potential cardiac complications."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer, currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. He was found confused and complaining of chest pain, with multiple infarcts and labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient has been diagnosed with endocarditis, confirmed by echocardiogram, meeting Duke criteria. There is concern for sepsis with septic emboli, as the patient meets sepsis criteria with fever, increased respiratory rate, and likely septic emboli. The patient has respiratory alkalosis, potentially due to overbreathing the vent or opioid withdrawal. He also has acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis and dye load from imaging studies. The patient has been intubated for poor mental status but is oxygenating and ventilating well. There are concerns about a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), elevated troponin levels, and small subdural hematoma with a possible evolving left basal ganglia infarct. The patient has a history of intravenous drug use and falls, which may contribute to his current condition. He is currently receiving nafcillin for MSSA infection, as well as other medications for his various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient has confirmed endocarditis, which can lead to further complications such as septic emboli, heart failure, and systemic infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA currently
   receiving chemo and radiation was found by his sister today to be
   confused and complaining of chest pain, and found to have multiple
   infarcts and labs consistent with DIC.
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - Vancomycin stopped yesterday, now continues on nafcillin
   (desensitization complete) (day 1 abx = [**2-15**], clear blood cultures
   since [**2-18**])
    - blood cx q day, begin to space as possible
    - daily EKGs
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Meets sepsis criteria fever, increase RR,
   and likely septic emboli; history of IV drug use. Blood pressures have
   been maintained with fluids only. CVP at 9 and lactate improving which
   implies improved perfusion.
   - Continue nafcillin as above
   - Continue fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate to document improvement
   - Follow up culture data here
   # Acute Renal Failure. Likely elevated after dye load, in conjunction
   with sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing (also with multiple
   likely septic renal infarcts but unlikely a large contributor).
   Monitor UOP. Creatinine rising, UOP remains low despite three boluses
   X500cc on [**2-20**]. Urine negative for Eos, FeNa 0.4.
   - renally dose medications
   - I L of IVF for possible prerenal etiology
 monitor UOP
   - Check urine sediment given endocarditis/concern for immune complex
   deposition (bland sediment on [**2-20**])
   - Renal consult
   - Not currently meeting criteria for urgent HD though will monitor
   volume status closely; considerations prior to line placement would
   include checking coags/platelets with FFP PRN
   #Cholestatic LFT abnormalities. LDH elevated, indirect bilirubinemia
   (as of [**2-16**]); [**2-15**] RUQ u/s negative for biliary dilatation; lipase wnl
   on [**2-14**]
   - RUQ ultrasound
   - Add on direct bilirubin
   # Alkalosis: respiratory alkalosis, still overbreathing the vent, pCO2
   stable.  Initially unable to tolerate RSBI.  Potentially component of
   opioid withdrawal
 unclear when he stopped methadone
 up to 1 week
   without (wife states pt previously on methadone 30 and morphine 30
   qd).  ABG roughly the same off propofol.  Mental status is improving,
   on CPAP trial.
    - continue to wean vent as MS improves
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt and low fibrinogen,
   with occasional schistocytes on smear. Thrombocytopenia may be due to
   liver disease or DIC.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as above
   - Cycle DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Platelet goal is 30 and INR goal is < 1.4, will confirm w/ neurosurg
   # SAH/?left basal infarct: Unclear if spontaneous or in the setting of
   fall. Neuro exam nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat
   imaging [**2-16**] showing continued interval slight decrease in density of
   SAH since earlier in the day. No aneursym seen but final pending
   reformats. MS improving, following some simple commands yesterday.
   - Appreciate Neurosurgery input
   - ID concerned for possible mycotic aneurysm, recommend angiogram
   - Goal INR 1.4, Plts 50
   - Goal SBP less than 150
   - Q2H neuro checks
 will confirm that patient able to move extremities
   when more alert
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for poor mental status. Oxygenating
   and ventilating well.
   - Continue PS ventilation, drop settings to [**3-28**] as tolerated.
   - Propofol as needed for sedation, currently on hold
   - HOB evaluation, mouth care
   # NSTEMI/troponinemia: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress,
   continues to rise. Likely due to SAH and hemolysis and sepsis. EKG
   unremarkable.
   - Trend CE
   - Tele
   - No heparin or aspirin given above hematologic derangements
   #Abdominal pain/bowel wall thickening on CT (stable thickening of the
   ascending colon, new thickening of the sigmoid
   colon, possibly other portions. Ddx includes infectious and
   inflammatory etiologies, but ischemia cannot be excluded.)
   - C. Diff sent [**2-19**] negative (final); two more stool cultures to be
   sent
   - Bladder pressure 9 makes abdominal compartment syndrome less likely
   # Head and neck cancer: Follow up with outpatient oncologist
   # Hep C: Unknown baseline. Will attempt to obtain records. HCV VL 743K
   on [**2-17**].
   # FEN: Bolus 1 L IVF, replete electrolytes, restart tube feeds as
   patient not to be extubated today. Tighten SSI.

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer, currently receiving chemotherapy and radiation. He presented with confusion, chest pain, and multiple infarcts, along with laboratory findings consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He was found to have endocarditis, confirmed on echocardiogram, meeting Duke criteria. The patient's blood cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), which is sensitive to vancomycin and nafcillin.

The patient also meets criteria for sepsis with septic emboli, likely secondary to IV drug use. He has been maintained on fluids only for blood pressure support, with a central venous pressure (CVP) at 9 and improving lactate levels indicating improved perfusion.

Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure, likely due to sepsis and low flow state, as well as multiple renal infarcts. His urine output remains low despite three boluses of 500cc on [**2-20**], and he has a FeNa of 0.4. He is currently receiving renal dose medications and IV fluids for a possible pre-renal etiology.

The patient also has cholestatic liver function abnormalities with elevated LDH and indirect bilirubinemia, as well as respiratory alkalosis due to overbreathing the vent.

Further medical complications include suspected DIC, likely secondary to sepsis"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA currently
   receiving chemo and radiation was found by his sister today to be
   confused and complaining of chest pain, and found to have multiple
   infarcts and labs consistent with DIC.
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - Vancomycin stopped yesterday, now continues on nafcillin
   (desensitization complete)
    - blood cx q day, begin to space as possible
    - daily EKGs
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Meets sepsis criteria fever, increase RR,
   and likely septic emboli; history of IV drug use. Blood pressures have
   been maintained with fluids only. CVP at 9 and lactate improving which
   implies improved perfusion.
   - Continue nafcillin as above
   - Continue fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate to document improvement
   - Follow up culture data here
   # Acute Renal Failure. Likely elevated after dye load, in conjunction
   with sepsis in low flow state, multiple likely septic renal infarcts.
   Monitor UOP. Creatinine rising, UOP remains low despite three boluses
   X500cc. Urine negative for Eos, FeNa 0.4.
   - renally dose medications
   #Cholestatic LFT abnormalities. LDH elevated, indirect bilirubinemia
   (as of [**2-16**]); [**2-15**] RUQ u/s negative for biliary thickening; lipase wnl
   on [**2-14**]
   # Alkalosis: respiratory alkalosis, still overbreathing the vent, pCO2
   stable.  Initially unable to tolerate RSBI.  Potentially component of
   opioid withdrawal
 unclear when he stopped methadone
 up to 1 week
   without (wife states pt previously on methadone 30 and morphine 30
   qd).  ABG roughly the same off propofol.  Mental status is improving,
   on CPAP trial.
    - continue to wean vent as MS improves
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt and low fibrinogen,
   with occasional schistocytes on smear. Thrombocytopenia may be due to
   liver disease or DIC.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as above
   - Cycle DIC labs
   - Platelet goal is 30 and INR goal is < 1.4, will confirm w/ neurosurg
   # SAH/?left basal infarct: Unclear if spontaneous or in the setting of
   fall. Neuro exam nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat
   imaging [**2-16**] showing continued interval slight decrease in density of
   SAH since earlier in the day. No aneursym seen but final pending
   reformats. MS improving, following some simple commands yesterday.
   - Appreciate Neurosurgery input
   - ID concerned for possible mycotic aneurysm, recommend angiogram
   - Goal INR 1.4, Plts 50
   - Goal SBP less than 150
   - Q2H neuro checks
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for poor mental status. Oxygenating
   and ventilating well.
   - Continue PS ventilation, drop settings to [**3-28**] as tolerated.
   - Propofol as needed for sedation, currently on hold
   - HOB evaluation, mouth care
   # NSTEMI/troponinemia: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress,
   continues to rise. Likely due to SAH and hemolysis. EKG unremarkable.
   - Trend CE
   - Tele
   - No heparin or aspirin given above hematologic derangements
   #Abdominal pain/bowel wall thickening on CT (stable thickening of the
   ascending colon, new thickening of the sigmoid
   colon, possibly other portions. Ddx includes infectious and
   inflammatory etiologies, but ischemia cannot be excluded.)
   - C. Diff sent [**2-19**] negative (final)
   - Bladder pressure 9 makes abdominal compartment syndrome less likely
   # Head and neck cancer: Follow up with outpatient oncologist
   # Hep C: Unknown baseline. Will attempt to obtain records.
   # FEN: NS 75 cc/hr, replete electrolytes, restart tube feeds as patient
   not to be extubated today.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer, currently receiving chemotherapy and radiation. He was found confused, complaining of chest pain, and had multiple infarcts and labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient met the Duke criteria for endocarditis and had positive blood cultures with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), sensitive to vancomycin and nafcillin. The patient is now on nafcillin and fluids only for blood pressure maintenance. The patient also has sepsis with septic emboli, acute renal failure, cholestatic liver function abnormalities, respiratory alkalosis, DIC, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), left basal infarct, respiratory failure, and NSTEMI/troponinemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Endocarditis: The patient has confirmed endocarditis meeting the Duke criteria. This condition requires ongoing treatment and close monitoring for possible complications such as septic emboli, heart failure, or further spread of infection.
2. Sepsis with septic emboli: The patient's sepsis is associated with septic emboli, which may lead to further organ dysfunction or embolic events.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, indicated by an increasing creatinine level and low urine output despite fluid boluses. Close monitoring"

   confused and complaining of chest pain, and found to have multiple
   infarcts and labs consistent with DIC.
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - discontinue vancomycin
    - blood cx q day, begin to space as possible
    - Nafcillin desentisization complete; likely discontinue vancomycin
   and continue nafcillin.
   - daily EKGs
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Meets sepsis criteria fever, increase RR,
   and likely septic emboli. Given history of IV drug use per report,
   there was concern for endocarditis. Blood pressures have been
   maintained with fluids only. CVP at 12 and lactate improving which
   implies improved perfusion.
   - Continue nafcillin as above
   - Continue fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate to document improvement
   - Follow up culture data here
   # Acute Renal Failure
   - likely elevated after dye load yesterday, in conjunction with sepsis
   in low flow state.  Monitor UOP.
   - renally dose medications
   - check urine lytes/sediment/eophils.
   #Cholestatic LFT abnormalities
   # Alkalosis: respiratory alkalosis, still overbreathing the vent, pCO2
   stable.  Initially unable to tolerate RSBI.  Potentially component of
   opioid withdrawal
 unclear when he stopped methadone
 up to 1 week
   without.  ABG roughly the same off propofol.  Mental status is
   improving, on CPAP trial.
    - continue to wean vent as MS improves
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt and low fibrinogen,
   with occasional schistocytes on smear. Thrombocytopenia may be due to
   liver disease or DIC.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as above
   - Cycle DIC labs
   - Platelet goal is 30 and INR goal is < 1.4, will confirm w/ neurosurg
   # SAH/?left basal infarct: Unclear of spontaneous or in the setting of
   fall. Neuro exam nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat
   imaging [**2-16**] showing continued interval slight decrease in density of
   SAH since earlier in the day. No aneursym seen but final pending
   reformats. MS is now improving, following some simple commands.
   - Appreciate Neurosurgery input
   - ID concerned for possible mycotic aneurysm, recommend angiogram
   - Goal INR 1.4, Plts 50
   - Goal SBP less than 150
   - Q2H neuro checks
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for poor mental status. Oxygenating
   and ventilating well.
   - Continue PS ventilation, drop settings to [**7-1**] and then down to 5/5 as
   tolerated.
   - Propofol as needed for sedation, currently on hold
   - HOB evaluation, mouth care
   # NSTEMI/troponinemia: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress.
   Likely due to SAH and hemolysis. EKG unremarkable.
   - Trend CE
   - Tele
   - No heparin or aspirin given above hematologic derangements
   #Abdominal pain/bowel wall thickening on CT
   - C. Diff sent [**2-19**] negative (final)
   # Head and neck cancer: Follow up with outpatient oncologist
   # Hep C: Unknown baseline. Will attempt to obtain records.
   # FEN: NS 75 cc/hr, replete electrolytes, restart tube feeds as patient
   not to be extubated today.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. The patient was found confused and complaining of chest pain, and further evaluation revealed multiple infarcts and laboratory findings consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient also meets the criteria for endocarditis confirmed by an echocardiogram.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:
1. Sepsis with septic emboli: The patient has fever, increased respiratory rate, and likely septic emboli. This is supported by his history of IV drug use, and blood pressures have been maintained with fluids only.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, as indicated by an increasing creatinine level. This could be due to the recent dye load, sepsis, and low flow state.
3. Cholestatic liver function abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, suggesting possible liver dysfunction.
4. Alkalosis: The patient is experiencing respiratory alkalosis due to overbreathing on the ventilator, but this is expected to improve as the patient's mental status improves.
5. DIC: The patient likely has DIC, supported by elevated d-dimer, prolonged PTT and PT, low fibrinogen, and occasional schistocytes on smear. Thrombocytopenia may be due to liver disease or DIC.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer, currently receiving chemotherapy and radiation. He was found confused and complaining of chest pain, with multiple infarcts and labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He meets the criteria for endocarditis, which has been confirmed by echocardiogram. He also has sepsis with septic emboli, acute renal failure, cholestatic liver function abnormalities, respiratory alkalosis, DIC, a possible stroke, and NSTEMI/troponinemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient's clinical presentation and positive Duke criteria indicate endocarditis. This condition can lead to further septic emboli, worsening sepsis, and potentially heart failure if not treated appropriately.
2. Sepsis with Septic Emboli: The patient's vital signs, including fever and increased respiratory rate, suggest ongoing sepsis. If not managed promptly, sepsis can progress to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's worsening renal function, indicated by the increasing creatinine levels, may progress to complete renal failure if not addressed. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for dialysis.
4. Cholestatic LFT Abnormalities: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and bilir"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA currently
   receiving chemo and radiation was found by his sister today to be
   confused and complaining of chest pain, and found to have multiple
   infarcts and labs consistent with DIC.

   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - Vancomycin stopped yesterday, now continues on nafcillin
   (desensitization complete) (day 1 abx = [**2-15**], clear blood cultures
   since [**2-18**])

   implies improved perfusion.
   - Continue nafcillin as above
   - Continue fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate to document improvement
   - Follow up culture data here
   # Acute Renal Failure. Likely elevated after dye load, in conjunction
   with sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing (also with multiple
   likely septic renal infarcts but unlikely a large contributor).

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer, currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. He was found confused and in chest pain, with multiple infarcts and labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient meets the Duke criteria for endocarditis and has positive blood cultures with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) sensitive to vancomycin/nafcillin. He was previously on vancomycin, which was stopped due to worsening renal function. The patient is now on nafcillin and fluids only for blood pressure maintenance. He also has sepsis with septic emboli, acute renal failure, cholestatic liver function abnormalities, respiratory alkalosis, DIC, SAH/left basal infarct, respiratory failure, NSTEMI/troponinemia, abdominal pain/bowel wall thickening, and head and neck cancer. The patient's mental status is improving, and he is on CPAP trial.

Potential medical complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient meets the Duke criteria for endocarditis, which is a serious infection of the heart valves or the inner lining of the heart. It can lead to septic emboli, organ damage, and even death if not treated promptly and appropriately.
2. Sepsis with septic emboli: The patient's presentation of fever, increased respiratory rate, and likely septic emboli suggests"

   receiving chemo and radiation was found by his sister today to be
   confused and complaining of chest pain, and found to have multiple
   infarcts and labs consistent with DIC.
   # Acute Renal Failure. Renal consult believes ARF likely from
   combination of dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing,
   and multiple likely septic renal infarcts, now also with evolving ATN
   (saw casts on urine sediment, FeNa increased from 0.4 to 1.5%). Low UOP
   despite repeat bolus yesterday and overnight, creatinine still rising.
   Urine negative for Eos X2
   - renally dose medications
   - HD ordered by renal consult for volume overload in setting of
   evolving ATN, to begin after temporary dialysis line placed by IR
   - ddavp, 2units plts prior to line placement (plt 55, INR 2.2)
   - Appreciate renal recs, continue to monitor for AIN on nafcillin,
   check urine protein/Cr, recheck eos; complement C4 5.3, C3 less than
   assay
   - Recheck K q6h prior to dialysis; check EKG if elevated
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending

   and likely septic emboli; history of IV drug use. Blood pressures have
   been maintained with fluids only. CVP at 12 and lactate initially
   improving but worse yesterday (however, ARF)
   - Continue nafcillin as above
   - Continue fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate
   - Follow up culture data here
   #Cholestatic LFT abnormalities. Wosening indirect bilirubinemia; [**2-15**]
   and [**2-20**] RUQ u/s negative for biliary dilatation; lipase wnl on [**2-14**].
   AST increasing. Likely intrahepatic cholestasis in setting of sepsis
   and multiorgan dysfunction.
   - Follow for now; trend LFTs
   # Alkalosis: respiratory alkalosis, still overbreathing the vent, pCO2
   stable.  Uable to tolerate SBT.  Potentially component of opioid
   withdrawal
 unclear when he stopped methadone
 up to 1 week without
   (wife states pt previously on methadone 30 and morphine 30 qd).  ABG
   roughly the same off propofol.  Mental status is improving.
    - continue to wean vent as MS improves once volume status normalized
   after HD
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt and low fibrinogen,

","The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer, currently receiving chemotherapy and radiation. He presented with confusion, chest pain, and multiple infarcts, along with laboratory findings consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient also has acute renal failure, sepsis with septic emboli, cholestatic liver function abnormalities, respiratory alkalosis, and possible opioid withdrawal.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelets, and liver enzymes. His renal function is impaired, with elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. The urine sediment analysis reveals muddy brown casts, coarse granular casts, and red blood cells. Imaging studies show stable appearance of the liver with no new intra-or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation, as well as massive splenomegaly.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including acute renal failure, DIC, endocarditis, sepsis with septic emboli, cholestatic liver function abnormalities, respiratory alkalosis, and possible opioid withdrawal. He requires ongoing supportive care, including hemodialysis, antibiotics, and fluid management."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA currently
   receiving chemo and radiation was found by his sister today to be
   confused and complaining of chest pain, and found to have multiple
   infarcts and labs consistent with DIC.
   # Acute Renal Failure. Renal consult believes ARF likely from
   combination of dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing,
   and multiple likely septic renal infarcts, now also with evolving ATN
   (saw casts on urine sediment, FeNa increased from 0.4 to 1.5%). Low UOP
   despite repeat bolus yesterday and overnight, creatinine still rising.
   Urine negative for Eos X2
   - renally dose medications
   - HD ordered by renal consult for volume overload in setting of
   evolving ATN, to begin after temporary dialysis line placed by IR
   - ddavp, 2units plts prior to line placement (plt 55, INR 2.2)
   - Appreciate renal recs, continue to monitor for AIN on nafcillin,
   check urine protein/Cr, recheck eos; complement C4 5.3, C3 less than
   assay
   - Recheck K q6h prior to dialysis; check EKG if elevated
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - Continues on nafcillin (desensitized) (day 1 abx = [**2-15**], clear blood
   cultures since [**2-18**])

    - daily EKGs
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Meets sepsis criteria fever, increase RR,
   and likely septic emboli; history of IV drug use. Blood pressures have
   been maintained with fluids only. CVP at 12 and lactate initially
   improving but worse yesterday (however, ARF). WBC count trending up
   over past 24 hours. Has been pan-cultured, CXR without interval change.
   Line source considered.

   AST increasing. Likely intrahepatic cholestasis in setting of sepsis
   and multiorgan dysfunction.
   - Follow for now; trend LFTs
   - consider lactulose if worsening mental status

   stable.  Uable to tolerate SBT.  Potentially component of opioid
   withdrawal
 unclear when he stopped methadone
 up to 1 week without
   (wife states pt previously on methadone 30 and morphine 30 qd).  ABG
   roughly the same off propofol.  Mental status is improving.

   after HD
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt and low fibrinogen,

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer, currently receiving chemotherapy and radiation. He was found confused and complaining of chest pain, with multiple infarcts and labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He also has acute renal failure, endocarditis, sepsis with septic emboli, cholestatic liver function abnormalities, respiratory alkalosis, and likely DIC in the setting of malignancy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, indicated by rising creatinine levels and low urine output. This may require further interventions such as hemodialysis.

2. DIC: The patient's elevated d-dimer, prolonged PTT, low fibrinogen, and occasional schistocytes on smear suggest a diagnosis of DIC. This condition can lead to bleeding and thrombosis throughout the body.

3. Endocarditis: The patient has confirmed endocarditis, which can result in further septic emboli and complications if not properly treated.

4. Sepsis with Septic Emboli: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis and is at risk for ongoing septic emboli, which can cause organ damage and systemic inflammation.

5. Cholestatic LFT abnormalities: The patient's liver function tests indicate cholestasis, which may be due to sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction. Monitoring liver enzymes and considering"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA currently
   receiving chemo and radiation was found by his sister today to be
   confused and complaining of chest pain, and found to have multiple
   infarcts and labs consistent with DIC.
   # Acute Renal Failure. Renal consult believes ARF likely from
   combination of dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing,
   and multiple likely septic renal infarcts, now also with evolving ATN
   (saw casts on urine sediment, FeNa increased from 0.4 to 1.5%). Low UOP
   despite repeat bolus yesterday and overnight, creatinine still rising.
   Urine negative for Eos X2
   - renally dose medications
   - HD ordered by renal consult for volume overload in setting of
   evolving ATN, to begin after temporary dialysis line placed by IR
   - ddavp, 2units plts prior to line placement (plt 55, INR 2.2)
   - Appreciate renal recs, continue to monitor for AIN on nafcillin,
   check urine protein/Cr, recheck eos; complement C4 5.3, C3 less than
   assay
   - Recheck K q6h prior to dialysis; check EKG if elevated
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - Cntinues on nafcillin (desensitized) (day 1 abx = [**2-15**], clear blood
   cultures since [**2-18**])
    - blood cx q day
    - daily EKGs
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Meets sepsis criteria fever, increase RR,
   and likely septic emboli; history of IV drug use. Blood pressures have
   been maintained with fluids only. CVP at 12 and lactate initially
   improving but worse yesterday (however, ARF)
   - Continue nafcillin as above
   - Continue fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate
   - Follow up culture data here
   #Cholestatic LFT abnormalities. Wosening indirect bilirubinemia; [**2-15**]
   and [**2-20**] RUQ u/s negative for biliary dilatation; lipase wnl on [**2-14**].
   AST increasing. Likely intrahepatic cholestasis in setting of sepsis
   and multiorgan dysfunction.
   - Follow for now; trend LFTs
   # Alkalosis: respiratory alkalosis, still overbreathing the vent, pCO2
   stable.  Uable to tolerate SBT.  Potentially component of opioid
   withdrawal
 unclear when he stopped methadone
 up to 1 week without
   (wife states pt previously on methadone 30 and morphine 30 qd).  ABG
   roughly the same off propofol.  Mental status is improving.
    - continue to wean vent as MS improves once volume status normalized
   after HD
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt and low fibrinogen,
   with occasional schistocytes on smear. Thrombocytopenia may be due to
   liver disease or DIC.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as above
   - Cycle DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Platelet goal is 30 and INR goal is < 1.4
   #Abdominal pain/bowel wall thickening on CT (stable thickening of the
   ascending colon, new thickening of the sigmoid
   colon, possibly other portions. Ddx includes infectious and
   inflammatory etiologies, but ischemia cannot be excluded.)
   - C. Diff sent [**2-19**] and [**2-20**] negative (final); one more stool culture
   to be sent
   - Bladder pressure 17 increased from 9 yesterday
   # SAH/?left basal infarct: Unclear if spontaneous or in the setting of
   fall. Neuro exam nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat
   imaging [**2-16**] showing continued interval slight decrease in density of
   SAH since earlier in the day. No aneursym seen. MS stable, following
   some simple commands yesterday and this morning.
   - Appreciate Neurosurgery input
   - ID concerned for possible mycotic aneurysm, recommend angiogram
   (reconsider after dialyzed)
   - Goal INR 1.4, Plts 50
   - Goal SBP less than 150
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for poor mental status. Oxygenating
   and ventilating well.
   - Continue PS ventilation, drop settings to [**3-28**] as tolerated.
   - Propofol as needed for sedation, currently on hold
   - HOB evaluation, mouth care
   # NSTEMI/troponinemia: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress,
   continues to rise. Likely due to SAH and hemolysis and sepsis. EKG
   unremarkable.
   - Trend CE
   - Tele
   - No heparin or aspirin given above hematologic derangements
   # Head and neck cancer: Follow up with outpatient oncologist
   # Comfort: Morphine for pain/dypsnea
   # Hep C: Unknown baseline. Will attempt to obtain records. HCV VL 743K
   on [**2-17**].
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes (not K or phos as has ARF), tube feeds on
   hold for procedure; nutrition recs to restart TF with Novasource Renal
   35 mL/h4 + 28g Beneprotein, begin at 10 mL/hr and increase by 10 ml/hr

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer currently undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. He was found confused and complaining of chest pain, with multiple infarcts and labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The patient's current medical conditions include acute renal failure, endocarditis, sepsis with septic emboli, cholestatic liver function abnormalities, respiratory alkalosis, DIC, abdominal pain/bowel wall thickening on CT, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and respiratory failure. 

The patient has several ongoing treatments and interventions, including dialysis, administration of blood products (FFP), antibiotics (nafcillin), and morphine sulfate for pain and dyspnea. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal failure, progression of endocarditis, development of further septic emboli, exacerbation of cholestatic LFT abnormalities, respiratory complications, worsening of DIC, progression of abdominal pain and bowel wall thickening, potential mycotic aneurysm, ongoing respiratory failure, and potential complications related to head and neck cancer. 

Please note that this summary is based solely on the provided progress note, and additional information or tests may be required for a more accurate assessment and management of the patient's conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA was found by
   his sister to be confused and complaining of chest pain, and found to
   have multiple infarcts, MSSA bacteremia, endocarditis, labs consistent
   with DIC, SAH, now with ARF.
   # Acute Renal Failure. Renal team believes ARF likely from combination
   of dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing, and multiple
   likely septic renal infarcts, now also with evolving ATN (saw casts on
   urine sediment, FeNa increased from 0.4 to 1.5%). Urine negative for
   Eos X2. Continues with low UOP. Now on CVVH since [**2-21**], rate 100-200 cc
   negative/hr. Complement low; ?immune complex GLN, but may be low solely
   in setting of coagulopathy/embolizations.
   - renally dose medications: Nafcillin dose in setting of LFT changes
   and CVVH: ""Not dialyzable (0% to 5%) via hemodialysis. Supplemental
   dose is not necessary with hemo- or peritoneal dialysis or continuous
   arteriovenous or venovenous hemofiltration; in patients with both
   hepatic and renal impairment, modification of dosage may be necessary;
   no data available.""
   - Appreciate renal recs, continue to monitor for AIN on nafcillin
   - Follow electrolytes, replete Ca as needed (on SS)
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt and low fibrinogen,
   with schistocytes on smear. Thrombocytopenia may be due to liver
   disease or DIC. No evidence of bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer. He was found confused and complaining of chest pain, and multiple infarcts were found. The patient has MSSA bacteremia, endocarditis, labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and acute renal failure (ARF). He is currently on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to MSSA infection. The patient also has an ascending infection, including a possible mycotic aneurysm. He is intubated for respiratory failure and has a history of IV drug use.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is currently on CVVH due to ARF. This could be attributed to multiple factors such as dye load, sepsis, third-spacing, and renal infarcts.
2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's lab results indicate low fibrinogen levels, elevated D-dimer, prolonged PT/PTT, and schistocytes on smear, which suggest DIC. This condition is associated with sepsis and malignancy.
3. Endocarditis: The patient has confirmed endocarditis, as evidenced by positive blood cultures with MSSA"

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with Septic Emboli: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis with septic emboli, including fever, increased respiratory rate, and likely septic emboli. Blood pressures have been maintained with fluids only, and lactate is improving now on CVVH. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and follow-up cultures are necessary. The ID team recommends repeat transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) if the patient re-spikes with no clear source.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA was found by
   his sister to be confused and complaining of chest pain, and found to
   have multiple infarcts, MSSA bacteremia, endocarditis, labs consistent
   with DIC, SAH, now with ARF.
   # Acute Renal Failure. Renal team believes ARF likely from combination
   of dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing, and multiple
   likely septic renal infarcts, now also with evolving ATN (saw casts on
   urine sediment, FeNa increased from 0.4 to 1.5%). Urine negative for
   Eos X2. Continues with low UOP. Now on CVVH since [**2-21**], rate 100-200 cc
   negative/hr. Complement low; ?immune complex GLN, but may be low solely
   in setting of coagulopathy/embolizations.
   - renally dose medications: Nafcillin dose in setting of LFT changes
   and CVVH: ""Not dialyzable (0% to 5%) via hemodialysis. Supplemental
   dose is not necessary with hemo- or peritoneal dialysis or continuous
   arteriovenous or venovenous hemofiltration; in patients with both
   hepatic and renal impairment, modification of dosage may be necessary;
   no data available.""
   - Appreciate renal recs, continue to monitor for AIN on nafcillin
   - Follow electrolytes, replete Ca as needed (on SS)
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt and low fibrinogen,
   with occasional schistocytes on smear. Thrombocytopenia may be due to
   liver disease or DIC.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as above
   - Cycle DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Platelet goal is 30 and INR goal is < 1.4; consider FFP/cryo
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - Continues on nafcillin (desensitized) (day 1 abx = [**2-15**], clear blood
   cultures since [**2-18**])
    - blood cx q day
    - daily EKGs
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Meets sepsis criteria fever, increase RR,
   and likely septic emboli; history of IV drug use. Blood pressures have
   been maintained with fluids only. CVP at 9 and lactate improving now on
   CVVH. CBC trending up, febrile [**2-20**]; pancultured. Line source
   considered.
   - Continue nafcillin as above
   - Continue CVVH/fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate
   - Follow up cultures
   - ID recommend repeat TEE if pt re-spikes with no clear source.
   - Consider removing CVL and re-seating Aline if pt spikes again
   # SBP. Pt tapped, ascites with prominent neutrophils, culture pending.
   - Broaden abx: start cefotaxime CVVH dosing for five day course, and
   give albumin 1.5 g/kg X 1 and 1 g/kg on day 3
   #Cholestatic LFT abnormalities. Worsening indirect bilirubinemia; [**2-15**]
   and [**2-20**] RUQ u/s negative for biliary dilatation; lipase wnl on [**2-14**].
   AST increasing. Likely intrahepatic cholestasis in setting of sepsis
   and multiorgan dysfunction.
   - Follow for now; trend LFTs
   - Lactulose begun [**2-21**]
   #Abdominal pain/bowel wall thickening on CT (stable thickening of the
   ascending colon, new thickening of the sigmoid
   colon, possibly other portions. Ddx includes infectious and
   inflammatory etiologies, but ischemia cannot be excluded.)
   - C. Diff sent [**2-19**] and [**2-20**] negative (final); one more stool culture
   to be sent
   # SAH/?left basal infarct: Unclear if spontaneous or in the setting of
   fall. Neuro exam nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat
   imaging [**2-16**] showing continued interval slight decrease in density of
   SAH since earlier in the day. No aneursym seen. MS stable, following
   simple commands.
   - Appreciate Neurosurgery input; neurosurg fellow to come today to eval
   with tentative plan for angio Friday [**1-23**]
   - ID concerned for possible mycotic aneurysm, recommend angiogram
   (reconsider after dialyzed)
   - Goal INR 1.4, Plts 50, goal SBP less than 150
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for poor mental status. Oxygenating
   and ventilating well.
   - Continue PS ventilation, drop settings to [**3-28**] as tolerated.
   - Propofol as needed for sedation, currently on hold
   - HOB evaluation, mouth care
   # NSTEMI/troponinemia: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress,
   continues to rise. Likely due to SAH and hemolysis and sepsis. EKG
   unremarkable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer. He was found confused, complaining of chest pain, and had multiple infarcts. He was diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia, endocarditis, labs consistent with DIC, SAH, and now ARF. The patient's current conditions include acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), septic emboli, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), cholestatic liver function abnormalities, abdominal pain/bowel wall thickening, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)/left basal infarct, respiratory failure, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)/troponinemia, and head and neck cancer.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is impaired, and further deterioration could lead to complete renal failure.
2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient has low platelets, prolonged clotting times, and elevated D-dimer, indicating a risk for bleeding or clotting complications.
3. Septic emboli: The patient's sepsis may lead to the release of emboli, causing further organ damage or leading to new infections.
4. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient's ascites fluid shows signs of infection, which can progress rapidly and become life"

   negative/hr. Complement low; ?immune complex GLN, but may be low solely
   in setting of coagulopathy/embolizations.
   - renally dose medications: Nafcillin dose in setting of LFT changes
   and CVVH: ""Not dialyzable (0% to 5%) via hemodialysis. Supplemental
   dose is not necessary with hemo- or peritoneal dialysis or continuous
   arteriovenous or venovenous hemofiltration; in patients with both
   hepatic and renal impairment, modification of dosage may be necessary;

   - Appreciate renal recs, continue to monitor for AIN on nafcillin
   - Follow electrolytes, replete Ca as needed (on SS)
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt and low fibrinogen,
   with occasional schistocytes on smear. Thrombocytopenia may be due to
   liver disease or DIC.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer. He was found confused and in chest pain, with multiple infarcts, MSSA bacteremia, endocarditis, labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to ARF. He also has sepsis with septic emboli, likely due to MSSA bacteremia and IV drug use. The patient has several medical complications, including DIC, endocarditis, sepsis with septic emboli, SBP, cholestatic LFT abnormalities, abdominal pain/bowel wall thickening, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has deteriorated, leading to ARF. This may be due to a combination of factors such as dye load, sepsis, and renal infarcts. CVVH is being used to manage ARF, but the patient's condition needs close monitoring.
2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient shows signs of DIC, evidenced by elevated D-dimer levels, prolonged PTT/PT, low fibrinogen, and occasional schistocytes on smear. This condition can lead"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA was found by
   his sister to be confused and complaining of chest pain, and found to
   have multiple infarcts, MSSA bacteremia, endocarditis, labs consistent
   with DIC, SAH, now with ARF.
   # Acute Renal Failure. Renal team believes ARF likely from combination
   of dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing, and multiple
   likely septic renal infarcts, now also with evolving ATN (saw casts on
   urine sediment, FeNa increased from 0.4 to 1.5%). Urine negative for
   Eos X2. Continues with low UOP. Now on CVVH since [**2-21**], rate 100-200 cc
   negative/hr. Complement low; ?immune complex GLN, but may be low solely
   in setting of coagulopathy/embolizations.
   - renally dose medications: Nafcillin dose in setting of LFT changes
   and CVVH: ""Not dialyzable (0% to 5%) via hemodialysis. Supplemental
   dose is not necessary with hemo- or peritoneal dialysis or continuous
   arteriovenous or venovenous hemofiltration; in patients with both
   hepatic and renal impairment, modification of dosage may be necessary;
   no data available.""
   - Appreciate renal recs, continue to monitor for AIN on nafcillin
   - Follow electrolytes, replete Ca as needed (on SS)
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt and low fibrinogen,
   with schistocytes on smear. Thrombocytopenia may be due to liver
   disease or DIC. No evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as above
   - Cycle DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Platelet goal is 30 and INR goal is < 1.4; consider FFP/cryo if
   fibrinogen <100 and bleeding
   - discuss with neurosurgery coagulation threshold for angio
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - Continues on nafcillin (desensitized) (day 1 abx = [**2-15**], clear blood
   cultures since [**2-18**])
    - blood cx q day
    - daily EKGs
   -  repeat echo
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Meets sepsis criteria fever, increase RR,
   and likely septic emboli; history of IV drug use. Blood pressures have
   been maintained with fluids only. CVP at 9 and lactate improving now on
   CVVH. CBC trending up, febrile [**2-20**]; pancultured. Line source
   considered.
   - Continue nafcillin as above
   - Continue CVVH/fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate
   - Follow up cultures
   - ID recommend repeat TEE if pt re-spikes with no clear source.
   - Consider removing CVL and re-seating Aline if pt spikes again
   # SBP. Pt tapped, ascites with prominent neutrophils, culture pending.
   - Broaden abx: start zosyn CVVH dosing, and give albumin 1.5 g/kg X 1
   and 1 g/kg on day 3
   #Cholestatic LFT abnormalities. Worsening indirect bilirubinemia; [**2-15**]
   and [**2-20**] RUQ u/s negative for biliary dilatation; lipase wnl on [**2-14**].
   AST increasing. Likely intrahepatic cholestasis in setting of sepsis
   and multiorgan dysfunction.
   - Follow for now; trend LFTs
   - Lactulose begun [**2-21**]
   #Abdominal pain/bowel wall thickening on CT (stable thickening of the
   ascending colon, new thickening of the sigmoid
   colon, possibly other portions. Ddx includes infectious and
   inflammatory etiologies, but ischemia cannot be excluded.)
   - C. Diff sent [**2-19**] and [**2-20**] negative (final); one more stool culture
   to be sent
   # SAH/?left basal infarct: Unclear if spontaneous or in the setting of
   fall. Neuro exam nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat
   imaging [**2-16**] showing continued interval slight decrease in density of
   SAH since earlier in the day. No aneursym seen. MS stable, following
   simple commands.
   - Appreciate Neurosurgery input; neurosurg fellow to come today to eval
   with tentative plan for angio Friday [**1-23**]
   - ID concerned for possible mycotic aneurysm, recommend angiogram
   (reconsider after dialyzed)
   - Goal INR 1.4, Plts 50, goal SBP less than 150
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for poor mental status. Oxygenating
   and ventilating well.
   - Continue PS ventilation, drop settings to [**3-28**] as tolerated.
   - Propofol as needed for sedation, currently on hold
   - HOB evaluation, mouth care
   # NSTEMI/troponinemia: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress,
   continues to rise. Likely due to SAH and hemolysis and sepsis. EKG
   unremarkable.
   - Trend CE
   - Tele
   - No heparin or aspirin given above hematologic derangements
   # Head and neck cancer: Follow up with outpatient oncologist
   # Comfort: Morphine for pain/dypsnea
   # Hep C: Unknown baseline. HCV VL 743K on [**2-17**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer. He was found confused, complaining of chest pain, and had multiple infarcts. He was diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia, endocarditis, labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient continues to be on CVVH since February 21st, with a rate of 100-200 cc negative/hr. He is also on nafcillin, vancomycin, and zosyn for MSSA bacteremia and endocarditis. His renal medications are being dosed appropriately considering his renal impairment and CVVH.

The patient meets criteria for sepsis, likely due to MSSA bacteremia and endocarditis. He is being treated with antibiotics and CVVH. The source of the infection is still unclear, and further investigation is needed.

The patient has a positive blood culture with MSSA sensitive to vancomycin and nafcillin. He is being monitored closely for any signs of bleeding due to DIC. The goal is to maintain a platelet count of 30 and INR less than 1.4. Fibrinogen levels are being monitored, and cryoprecipitate may be given if fibrinogen is less than 100 and bleeding occurs.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA was found by
   his sister to be confused and complaining of chest pain, and found to
   have multiple infarcts, MSSA bacteremia, endocarditis, labs consistent
   with DIC, SAH, now with ARF.
   # Acute Renal Failure. Renal team believes ARF likely from combination
   of dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing, and multiple
   likely septic renal infarcts, now also with evolving ATN (saw casts on
   urine sediment, FeNa increased from 0.4 to 1.5%). Urine negative for
   Eos X2. Continues with low UOP. Now on CVVH since [**2-21**], rate 100-200 cc
   negative/hr. Complement low; ?immune complex GLN, but may be low solely
   in setting of coagulopathy/embolizations.
   - renally dose medications: Nafcillin dose in setting of LFT changes
   and CVVH: ""Not dialyzable (0% to 5%) via hemodialysis. Supplemental
   dose is not necessary with hemo- or peritoneal dialysis or continuous
   arteriovenous or venovenous hemofiltration; in patients with both
   hepatic and renal impairment, modification of dosage may be necessary;
   no data available.""
   - Appreciate renal recs, continue to monitor for AIN on nafcillin
   - Follow electrolytes, replete Ca as needed (on SS)
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. Supported by elevated d-dimer, ptt, pt and low fibrinogen,
   with schistocytes on smear. Thrombocytopenia may be due to liver
   disease or DIC. No evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as above
   - Cycle DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Platelet goal is 30 and INR goal is < 1.4; consider FFP/cryo if
   fibrinogen <100 and bleeding
   - discuss with neurosurgery coagulation threshold for angio
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending

   cultures since [**2-18**])
    - blood cx q day
    - daily EKGs
   -  repeat echo
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Meets sepsis criteria fever, increase RR,
   and likely septic emboli; history of IV drug use. Blood pressures have
   been maintained with fluids only. CVP at 9 and lactate improving now on
   CVVH. CBC trending up, febrile [**2-20**]; pancultured. Line source
   considered.
   - Continue nafcillin as above
   - Continue CVVH/fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate
   - Follow up cultures
   - ID recommend repeat TEE if pt re-spikes with no clear source.
   - Consider removing CVL and re-seating Aline if pt spikes again
   # SBP. Pt tapped, ascites with prominent neutrophils, culture pending.
   - Broaden abx: start zosyn CVVH dosing, and give albumin 1.5 g/kg X 1
   and 1 g/kg on day 3
   #Cholestatic LFT abnormalities. Worsening indirect bilirubinemia; [**2-15**]
   and [**2-20**] RUQ u/s negative for biliary dilatation; lipase wnl on [**2-14**].
   AST increasing. Likely intrahepatic cholestasis in setting of sepsis
   and multiorgan dysfunction.
   - Follow for now; trend LFTs
   - Lactulose begun [**2-21**]
   #Abdominal pain/bowel wall thickening on CT (stable thickening of the
   ascending colon, new thickening of the sigmoid
   colon, possibly other portions. Ddx includes infectious and
   inflammatory etiologies, but ischemia cannot be excluded.)
   - C. Diff sent [**2-19**] and [**2-20**] negative (final); one more stool culture
   to be sent
   # SAH/?left basal infarct: Unclear if spontaneous or in the setting of
   fall. Neuro exam nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat
   imaging [**2-16**] showing continued interval slight decrease in density of
   SAH since earlier in the day. No aneursym seen. MS stable, following
   simple commands.
   - Appreciate Neurosurgery input; neurosurg fellow to come today to eval
   with tentative plan for angio Friday [**1-23**]
   - ID concerned for possible mycotic aneurysm, recommend angiogram
   (reconsider after dialyzed)
   - Goal INR 1.4, Plts 50, goal SBP less than 150
   # Respiratory failure: Intubated for poor mental status. Oxygenating
   and ventilating well.
   - Continue PS ventilation, drop settings to [**3-28**] as tolerated.
   - Propofol as needed for sedation, currently on hold
   - HOB evaluation, mouth care
   # NSTEMI/troponinemia: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress,
   continues to rise. Likely due to SAH and hemolysis and sepsis. EKG
   unremarkable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer. He was found confused and complaining of chest pain, with multiple infarcts, MSSA bacteremia, endocarditis, labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) and has been diagnosed with sepsis with septic emboli, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), cholestatic liver function abnormalities, abdominal pain/bowel wall thickening on CT, SAH/left basal infarct, respiratory failure requiring intubation, NSTEMI/troponinemia, and head and neck cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis: The patient has confirmed endocarditis meeting Duke criteria, which requires ongoing treatment and monitoring.
2. Sepsis with Septic Emboli: The patient meets criteria for sepsis with septic emboli due to MSSA bacteremia, fever, increased respiratory rate, and possible septic emboli. Close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary.
3. ARF: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to sepsis, dye load, low flow state, and multiple septic renal infarcts. CVVH has been initiated, and renal function should be closely monitored.

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis secondary to an abscess in the abdomen. He has a history of intravenous drug use and has been experiencing fever, chills, and shortness of breath. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 148/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's blood cultures were obtained, and he is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed an abscess in the abdomen. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated at 16.2 K/uL, and his blood glucose level is high at 181 mg/dL. Other lab results include a hematocrit level of 23.7%, platelet count of 33 K/uL, creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL, and liver enzymes showing elevation in ALT and AST levels. The patient's kidney function is impaired with a decreased urine output. He is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to manage his renal failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by the development of a mycotic aneurysm in the head, which was confirmed by a CT angiogram."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA was found by
   his sister to be confused and complaining of chest pain, and found to
   have multiple infarcts, MSSA bacteremia, endocarditis, labs consistent
   with DIC, SAH, now with ARF.
   # Acute Renal Failure. Renal team believes ARF likely from combination
   of dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing, and multiple
   likely septic renal infarcts, now also with evolving ATN. Urine
   negative for Eos X2. Continues with low UOP to anuria. Now on CVVH
   since [**2-21**], rate 100-200 cc negative/hr.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Appreciate renal recs: check vanc trough level daily to guide dose,
   goal 15-20; will resume CVVH when returns from procedure
   - Follow electrolytes, replete Ca as needed (on SS)
   # Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for poor MS, now passed SBT
   well on [**2-22**]. Oxygenating and ventilating well, though quite Tachypneic
   today. Extubated yesterday [**2-23**].
   - Trend ABG off of vent
   - HOB evaluation, mouth care
   - Pt extubated; monitor respiratory status closely
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. No evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as below
   - Cycle DIC labs daily
   - Platelet goal is >20 and INR goal is < 1.8 for any interventional
   procedure
   - Consider FFP/cryo if fibrinogen <100 and bleeding
   # Anemia
 decreasing hematocrit with 9 point drop over 2 days.
   Patient s/p transfusion of 3 units pRBCs yesterday and HCT bumped
   appropriately to 32.  Blood loss likely due to clotted blood being lost
   in CVVH.
   - Monitor HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Guaiac stools
   - CT yesterday with no RP bleed or source of bleeding in abd/head.
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated;  Had recommending discontinuing
   Zosyn in favor of Cipro.  For now, will continue Zosyn for a total
   course of 8 days. If stable, will transition to cipro for 14 days.
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - Vanc/zosyn for abx now given SBP (day 1 abx = [**2-15**], clear blood
   cultures since [**2-18**])
    - blood cx q day
    - daily EKGs
   -  repeat echo
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Blood pressures have been maintained with
   fluids only. Febrile [**2-20**]; pancultured; since afebrile but on CVVH. Pt
   with SBP by tap. Line source, PNA also considered.
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Continue CVVH/fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate
   - Follow up cultures
   - Consider removing CVL and re-seating Aline if pt spikes again
   - will need PICC when afebrile
   # SBP. Pt tapped, ascites with prominent neutrophils, culture NGTD.
   - Broaden abx: zosyn CVVH dosing day 1 = [**2-22**] (with vanc for MSSA
   coverage). Again, ID recommending de-escalation of abx by discontinuing
   Zosyn.  Previous de-escalation attempts have resulted in clinical
   worsening; will continue zosyn for 8 day course and then transition to
   ciprofloxacin.
   - Follow cultures
   # NSTEMI/troponinemia: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress,
   SBP. Likely due to SAH and hemolysis and sepsis. EKG unremarkable.
   Stopped trending CE after troponin peak.
   - Tele
   - Re-check CE in setting of new cardiac symptoms
   - No heparin or aspirin given above hematologic derangements
   #Cholestatic LFT abnormalities. Direct bilirubinemia; [**2-15**] and [**2-20**] RUQ
   u/s negative for biliary dilatation; lipase wnl on [**2-14**]. Likely
   intrahepatic cholestasis in setting of sepsis and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - Follow for now; trend LFTs
   - Lactulose begun [**2-21**]
   #Abdominal pain resolving, bowel wall thickening on CT (stable
   thickening of the ascending colon, new thickening of the sigmoid
   colon, possibly other portions. Ddx includes infectious and
   inflammatory etiologies, but ischemia cannot be excluded.)
   - C. Diff negative X3
   # SAH/?left basal infarct: Unclear if spontaneous or in the setting of
   fall. Neuro exam nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat
   imaging [**2-16**] showing continued interval slight decrease in density of
   SAH since earlier in the day. No aneursym seen. MS stable, following
   simple commands.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer. He was found confused and complaining of chest pain, with multiple infarcts, MSSA bacteremia, endocarditis, labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and acute renal failure (ARF).

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute Renal Failure: Renal team believes ARF is likely due to a combination of dye load, sepsis in a low flow state with third-spacing, and multiple likely septic renal infarcts. The patient is on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) since 2/21, with a rate of 100-200 cc negative/hr. Renally dose medications are being given, and electrolytes are being followed. Calcium repletion is needed as required.
2. Respiratory Failure: Initially intubated for poor mental status, the patient passed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) well on 2/22 and was extubated yesterday. Oxygenation and ventilation are being closely monitored.
3. DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis and malignancy, there is no evidence of bleeding. Supportive care, treatment of sepsis, and daily cycle DIC labs are being done. Platelet goal is >20 and INR goal is < 1.8 for"

   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA was found by
   his sister to be confused and complaining of chest pain, and found to
   have multiple infarcts, MSSA bacteremia, endocarditis, labs consistent
   with DIC, SAH, now with ARF.
   # Acute Renal Failure. Renal team believes ARF likely from combination
   of dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing, and multiple
   likely septic renal infarcts, now also with evolving ATN. Urine
   negative for Eos X2. Continues with low UOP to anuria. Now on CVVH
   since [**2-21**], rate 100-200 cc negative/hr.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Appreciate renal recs: check vanc trough level daily to guide dose,
   goal 15-20; will resume CVVH when returns from procedure
   - Follow electrolytes, replete Ca as needed (on SS)
   # Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for poor MS, now passed SBT
   well on [**2-22**]. Oxygenating and ventilating well. Extubated yesterday [**2-23**].
   - Trend ABG off of vent
   - Propofol as needed for sedation, currently on hold
   - HOB evaluation, mouth care
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. No evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as below
   - Cycle DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Platelet goal is >20 and INR goal is < 1.8 for angio procedure per
   neurosurgery
   - Consider FFP/cryo if fibrinogen <100 and bleeding
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development

   cultures since [**2-18**])
    - blood cx q day
    - daily EKGs
   -  repeat echo
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Blood pressures have been maintained with
   fluids only. Febrile [**2-20**]; pancultured; since afebrile but on CVVH. Pt
   with SBP by tap. Line source, PNA also considered.
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Continue CVVH/fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate
   - Follow up cultures
   - Consider removing CVL and re-seating Aline if pt spikes again
   - will need PICC when afebrile
   # SBP. Pt tapped, ascites with prominent neutrophils, culture NGTD.
   - Broaden abx: zosyn CVVH dosing day 1 = [**2-22**] (with vanc for MSSA
   coverage)
   - Follow cultures
   # NSTEMI/troponinemia: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress,
   SBP. Likely due to SAH and hemolysis and sepsis. EKG unremarkable.
   Stopped trending CE after troponin peak.
   - Tele
   - Re-check CE in setting of new cardiac symptoms
   - No heparin or aspirin given above hematologic derangements
   #Cholestatic LFT abnormalities. Direct bilirubinemia; [**2-15**] and [**2-20**] RUQ
   u/s negative for biliary dilatation; lipase wnl on [**2-14**]. Likely
   intrahepatic cholestasis in setting of sepsis and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - Follow for now; trend LFTs
   - Lactulose begun [**2-21**]
   #Abdominal pain resolving, bowel wall thickening on CT (stable
   thickening of the ascending colon, new thickening of the sigmoid
   colon, possibly other portions. Ddx includes infectious and
   inflammatory etiologies, but ischemia cannot be excluded.)
   - C. Diff negative X3
   # SAH/?left basal infarct: Unclear if spontaneous or in the setting of
   fall. Neuro exam nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat
   imaging [**2-16**] showing continued interval slight decrease in density of
   SAH since earlier in the day. No aneursym seen. MS stable, following
   simple commands.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer. He was found confused, complaining of chest pain, and diagnosed with multiple infarcts, MSSA bacteremia, endocarditis, labs consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed ARF, likely due to a combination of dye load from imaging studies, sepsis in a low flow state with third-spacing, and multiple likely septic renal infarcts. He is currently on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) with a rate of 100-200 cc negative/hr.

2. Respiratory Failure: Initially intubated for poor mental status, the patient passed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) well on 2/22 and was extubated yesterday. He is currently on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and receiving propofol for sedation.

3. DIC: The patient likely has DIC in the setting of sepsis and malignancy. There is no evidence of bleeding, but his platelet count is low, and INR is elevated. The goal is to maintain platelet count above 20,000/mm³ and INR below 1.8 for an upcoming angiogram.

4. Endocarditis: The patient has confirmed endocarditis on echo, meeting Duke criteria. Blood cultures with MSSA are sensitive to vancomycin and nafcillin. The Infectious Disease department is consulting, and Cardiothoracic surgery has been consulted as well.

5. Sepsis with Septic Emboli: The patient has been febrile on 2/20 and pancultured. He has maintained blood pressures with fluids only and has had multiple infarcts. He is currently on CVVH and receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam).

6. SBP: The patient has had a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) episode, with ascites showing prominent neutrophils. He has been tapped, and the ascitic fluid is cultured. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started.

7. NSTEMI/troponinemia: The patient has elevated troponin levels due to SAH, hemolysis, and sepsis. His EKG is unremarkable.

8. Cholestatic LFT abnormalities: The patient has cholestatic liver function test abnormalities, likely due to intrahepatic cholestasis in the setting of sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction. Bilirubin continues to rise, and lactulose has been started.

9. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is resolving, but he has bowel wall thickening on"

   Studies:
    - TTE ([**2-24**]): Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
   systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
   aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is a
   moderate-sized vegetation (1.0 cm long) on the aortic valve. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. There is a modreate to large vegetation
   (1.7 cm long) on the tricuspid valve. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion
Compared with the prior
   study (images reviewed) of [**2153-2-15**], the degree of TR and pulmonary
   hypertension detected have increased. The valve vegetations appear
   similar. If indicated, a TEE would better characterize the valvular
   vegetations.
    -  CTA head ([**2-23**])
   1. Multiple scattered small hypodense foci involving the subcortical
   and deep
   white matter of both hemispheres, more conspicuous compared to [**2-18**], [**2152**]
   and new compared to the CT from [**2153-2-14**] consistent with subacute
   embolic infarcts.
   2. Left thalamus hypodensity is increased compared to [**2-18**] and
   significantly increased compared to [**2153-2-14**], consistent with
   evolution
   of a left thalamic subacute infarct.
   3. Evolution of the right mainly parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage with
   decreased density of the blood products. No evidence of new
   intracranial
   hemorrhage or mass effect.
   4. Normal CTA of the head without evidence of aneurysm.
   -CT abdomen ([**2-23**])
   1. Numerous cavitated pulmonary nodules, renal and splenic infarcts,
   all
   compatible with septic emboli.
   2. Findings consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
   3. Marked increase in amount of ascites, but no loculated fluid
   collection.
   4. Marked thickening of the cecum and proximal ascending colon, in the
   setting of antibacterial therapy, this may be due to pseudomembranous
   colitis.
   Alternative possibility would be typhlitis, if the patient is immune
   compromised.
   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA was found by
   his sister to be confused and complaining of chest pain found to have
   endocarditis (aortic, tricuspid), MSSA Bacteremia, SAH, multiple septic
   infarcts to brain, liver, spleen, kidneys with hospital course
   complicated by DIC, ARF, and C.difficile associated disease, SBP.
   # Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for poor MS but passed SBT
   and extubated on [**2-23**].  Respiratory status declined overnight with
   stabilization s/p suction of thick secretions.
   - close monitoring given limited ability to protect airway, low
   threshold for re-intubation
   - Trend ABG off of vent
   - HOB evaluation, mouth care
   # Acute Renal Failure. Renal team believes ARF likely from combination
   of dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing, and multiple
   likely septic renal infarcts, also evidence of evolving ATN. Urine
   negative for Eos X2. Continues with low UOP to anuria.  CVVH started on
   [**2-21**] but filter clotted. UF at rate 100-200 cc negative/hr.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Appreciate renal recs: check vanc trough level daily to guide dose,
   goal 15-20;
   - Follow electrolytes, replete Ca as needed (on SS)
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. No evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as below
   - Cycle DIC labs daily
   - Platelet goal is >20 and INR goal is < 1.8 for any interventional
   procedure
   - Consider FFP/cryo if fibrinogen <100 and bleeding
   # Anemia
 decreasing hematocrit with 9 point drop over 2 days.
   Patient s/p transfusion of 3 units pRBCs yesterday and HCT bumped
   appropriately to 32.  Blood loss likely due to clotted blood being lost
   in CVVH.
   - Monitor HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Guaiac stools
   - CT yesterday with no RP bleed or source of bleeding in abd/head.
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin.
   Most recent TTE with evidence of worsening tricuspid regurgitation.
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated;  Had recommending discontinuing
   Zosyn in favor of Cipro.  For now, will continue Zosyn for a total
   course of 8 days. If stable, will transition to cipro for 14 days.
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - Vanc/zosyn for abx now given SBP (day 1 abx = [**2-15**], clear blood
   cultures since [**2-18**])
    - blood cx q day
    - daily EKGs
   -
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Blood pressures have been maintained with
   fluids only. Febrile [**2-20**]; pancultured; since afebrile but on CVVH. Pt
   with SBP by tap. Line source, PNA also considered.
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Continue CVVH/fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate
   - Follow up cultures
   - Consider removing CVL and re-seating Aline if pt spikes again
   - will need PICC when afebrile
   # SBP. Pt tapped, ascites with prominent neutrophils, culture NGTD.
   - Broaden abx: zosyn CVVH dosing day 1 = [**2-22**] (with vanc for MSSA
   coverage). Again, ID recommending de-escalation of abx by discontinuing
   Zosyn.  Previous de-escalation attempts have resulted in clinical
   worsening; will continue zosyn for 8 day course and then transition to
   ciprofloxacin.
   - Follow cultures
   #C. Diff associated disease: Patient with abdominal pain, although
   improving, found to have Bowel wall thickening on CT.
   - continue PO vanc (started [**2-24**]/)
   - continue IV flagyl (started [**2-25**])
   # NSTEMI/troponinemia: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress,
   SBP. Likely due to SAH and hemolysis and sepsis. EKG unremarkable.
   Stopped trending CE after troponin peak.
   - Tele
   - Re-check CE in setting of new cardiac symptoms
   - No heparin or aspirin given above hematologic derangements
   #Cholestatic LFT abnormalities. Direct bilirubinemia; [**2-15**] and [**2-20**] RUQ
   u/s negative for biliary dilatation; lipase wnl on [**2-14**]. Likely
   intrahepatic cholestasis in setting of sepsis and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - Follow for now; trend LFTs
   - Lactulose begun [**2-21**]
   #Abdominal pain resolving, bowel wall thickening on CT (stable
   thickening of the ascending colon, new thickening of the sigmoid
   colon, possibly other portions. Ddx includes infectious and
   inflammatory etiologies, but ischemia cannot be excluded.)
   # SAH/?left basal infarct: Unclear if spontaneous or in the setting of
   fall. Neuro exam nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat
   imaging [**2-16**] showing continued interval slight decrease in density of
   SAH since earlier in the day. No aneursym seen. MS stable, following
   simple commands.
   - Appreciate Neurosurgery input
   - f/u final CT-A read
   # Head and neck cancer: Follow up with outpatient oncologist
   # Comfort: Morphine for pain/dypsnea
   # Hep C: Unknown baseline. HCV VL 743K on [**2-17**].

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer. He was found confused and complaining of chest pain, and it was discovered that he has endocarditis involving both the aortic and tricuspid valves. He also has MSSA bacteremia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, multiple septic infarcts to the brain, liver, spleen, and kidneys, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute renal failure (ARF), and Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD).

The patient's respiratory status has been declining, and he is currently intubated due to poor mouth secretion clearance. He has a history of NSTEMI/troponinemia, cholestatic liver function abnormalities, and abdominal pain with bowel wall thickening on CT. The patient's neurological exam is nonfocal, and he is following simple commands.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 152/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 50% FiO2 via aerosolized therapy. His physical examination reveals scleral icterus, diffuse rhonchi bilaterally, marked jaundice, and pitting edema in both lower extremities.

   Studies:
    - TTE ([**2-24**]): Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
   systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
   aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is a
   moderate-sized vegetation (1.0 cm long) on the aortic valve. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. There is a modreate to large vegetation
   (1.7 cm long) on the tricuspid valve. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion
Compared with the prior
   study (images reviewed) of [**2153-2-15**], the degree of TR and pulmonary
   hypertension detected have increased. The valve vegetations appear
   similar. If indicated, a TEE would better characterize the valvular
   vegetations.
    -  CTA head ([**2-23**])
   1. Multiple scattered small hypodense foci involving the subcortical
   and deep
   white matter of both hemispheres, more conspicuous compared to [**2-18**], [**2152**]
   and new compared to the CT from [**2153-2-14**] consistent with subacute
   embolic infarcts.
   2. Left thalamus hypodensity is increased compared to [**2-18**] and
   significantly increased compared to [**2153-2-14**], consistent with
   evolution
   of a left thalamic subacute infarct.
   3. Evolution of the right mainly parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage with
   decreased density of the blood products. No evidence of new
   intracranial
   hemorrhage or mass effect.
   4. Normal CTA of the head without evidence of aneurysm.
   -CT abdomen ([**2-23**])
   1. Numerous cavitated pulmonary nodules, renal and splenic infarcts,
   all
   compatible with septic emboli.
   2. Findings consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
   3. Marked increase in amount of ascites, but no loculated fluid
   collection.
   4. Marked thickening of the cecum and proximal ascending colon, in the
   setting of antibacterial therapy, this may be due to pseudomembranous
   colitis.
   Alternative possibility would be typhlitis, if the patient is immune
   compromised.

   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA was found by
   his sister to be confused and complaining of chest pain found to have
   endocarditis (aortic, tricuspid), MSSA Bacteremia, SAH, multiple septic
   infarcts to brain, liver, spleen, kidneys with hospital course
   complicated by DIC, ARF, and C.difficile associated disease.
   # Acute Renal Failure. Renal team believes ARF likely from combination
   of dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing, and multiple
   likely septic renal infarcts, also evidence of  evolving ATN. Urine
   negative for Eos X2. Continues with low UOP to anuria.  CVVH started on
   [**2-21**] but filter clotted. UF at rate 100-200 cc negative/hr.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Appreciate renal recs: check vanc trough level daily to guide dose,
   goal 15-20; will resume CVVH when returns from procedure
   - Follow electrolytes, replete Ca as needed (on SS)
   # Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for poor MS, now passed SBT
   well on [**2-22**]. Extubated on [**2-23**].  Oxygenating and ventilating well,
   though quite Tachypneic today.
   - Trend ABG off of vent
   - HOB evaluation, mouth care
   - Pt extubated; monitor respiratory status closely
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. No evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as below
   - Cycle DIC labs daily
   - Platelet goal is >20 and INR goal is < 1.8 for any interventional
   procedure
   - Consider FFP/cryo if fibrinogen <100 and bleeding
   # Anemia
 decreasing hematocrit with 9 point drop over 2 days.
   Patient s/p transfusion of 3 units pRBCs yesterday and HCT bumped
   appropriately to 32.  Blood loss likely due to clotted blood being lost
   in CVVH.
   - Monitor HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Guaiac stools
   - CT yesterday with no RP bleed or source of bleeding in abd/head.
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin.
   Most recent TTE with evidence of worsening tricuspid regurgitation.
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated;  Had recommending discontinuing
   Zosyn in favor of Cipro.  For now, will continue Zosyn for a total
   course of 8 days. If stable, will transition to cipro for 14 days.
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - Vanc/zosyn for abx now given SBP (day 1 abx = [**2-15**], clear blood
   cultures since [**2-18**])
    - blood cx q day
    - daily EKGs
   -
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Blood pressures have been maintained with
   fluids only. Febrile [**2-20**]; pancultured; since afebrile but on CVVH. Pt
   with SBP by tap. Line source, PNA also considered.
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Continue CVVH/fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate
   - Follow up cultures
   - Consider removing CVL and re-seating Aline if pt spikes again
   - will need PICC when afebrile
   # SBP. Pt tapped, ascites with prominent neutrophils, culture NGTD.
   - Broaden abx: zosyn CVVH dosing day 1 = [**2-22**] (with vanc for MSSA
   coverage). Again, ID recommending de-escalation of abx by discontinuing
   Zosyn.  Previous de-escalation attempts have resulted in clinical
   worsening; will continue zosyn for 8 day course and then transition to
   ciprofloxacin.
   - Follow cultures
   #C. Diff associated disease: Patient with abdominal pain, although
   improving, found to have Bowel wall thickening on CT.
   - continue PO vanc (started [**2-24**]/)
   - continue IV flagyl (started [**2-25**])
   # NSTEMI/troponinemia: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress,
   SBP. Likely due to SAH and hemolysis and sepsis. EKG unremarkable.
   Stopped trending CE after troponin peak.
   - Tele
   - Re-check CE in setting of new cardiac symptoms
   - No heparin or aspirin given above hematologic derangements
   #Cholestatic LFT abnormalities. Direct bilirubinemia; [**2-15**] and [**2-20**] RUQ
   u/s negative for biliary dilatation; lipase wnl on [**2-14**]. Likely
   intrahepatic cholestasis in setting of sepsis and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - Follow for now; trend LFTs
   - Lactulose begun [**2-21**]
   #Abdominal pain resolving, bowel wall thickening on CT (stable
   thickening of the ascending colon, new thickening of the sigmoid
   colon, possibly other portions. Ddx includes infectious and
   inflammatory etiologies, but ischemia cannot be excluded.)
   # SAH/?left basal infarct: Unclear if spontaneous or in the setting of
   fall. Neuro exam nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat
   imaging [**2-16**] showing continued interval slight decrease in density of
   SAH since earlier in the day. No aneursym seen. MS stable, following
   simple commands.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer. He was found confused and complaining of chest pain, and subsequent evaluations revealed endocarditis involving the aortic and tricuspid valves, MSSA bacteremia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, multiple septic infarcts in various organs, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute renal failure, and Clostridium difficile-associated disease.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has confirmed endocarditis involving the aortic and tricuspid valves, meeting Duke criteria. Blood cultures are sensitive to vancomycin and nafcillin.

2. Sepsis with septic emboli: The patient has had multiple episodes of sepsis with evidence of septic emboli to various organs, including the brain, liver, spleen, and kidneys.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to a combination of factors such as dye load, sepsis in a low-flow state with third-spacing, and multiple septic renal infarcts.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient initially required intubation for poor mental status but has since passed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) well and was extubated. However, he remains tachypneic.

5. DIC: The patient likely has disseminated intravascular co"

   # Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for poor MS but passed SBT
   and extubated on [**2-23**].  Respiratory status declined overnight with
   stabilization s/p suction of thick secretions.
   - Close monitoring given limited ability to protect airway, low

   of dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing, and multiple
   likely septic renal infarcts, also evidence of evolving ATN. Urine
   negative for Eos X2. Continues with low UOP to anuria.  CVVH started on
   [**2-21**] but filter clotted. UF at rate 100-200 cc negative/hr.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Appreciate renal recs: check vanc trough level daily to guide dose,
   goal 15-20;
   - Follow electrolytes, replete Ca as needed (on SS)
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. No evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as below
   - Cycle DIC labs daily
   - Platelet goal is >20 and INR goal is < 1.8 for any interventional
   procedure
   - Consider FFP/cryo if fibrinogen <100 and bleeding
   # Anemia
 decreasing hematocrit with 9 point drop over 2 days.
   Patient s/p transfusion of 3 units pRBCs yesterday and HCT bumped
   appropriately to 32.  Blood loss likely due to clotted blood being lost
   in CVVH.
   - Monitor HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Guaiac stools
   - CT yesterday with no RP bleed or source of bleeding in abd/head.
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin.
   Most recent TTE with evidence of worsening tricuspid regurgitation.
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated;  Had recommending discontinuing
   Zosyn in favor of Cipro.  For now, will continue Zosyn for a total
   course of 8 days. If stable, will transition to cipro for 14 days.
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - Vanc/zosyn for abx now given SBP (day 1 abx = [**2-15**], clear blood
   cultures since [**2-18**])
    - Blood cx q day
    - Daily EKGs
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Blood pressures have been maintained with
   fluids only. Febrile [**2-20**]; pancultured; since afebrile but on CVVH. Pt
   with SBP by tap. Line source, PNA also considered.
   - Continue vanc/zosyn (define course)
   - Continue CVVH/fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate
   - Follow up cultures
   - Consider removing CVL and re-seating Aline if pt spikes again
   - will need PICC when afebrile
   - F/U with neurosurgery re: plan for angiogram in setting of CTA
   results (no evidence of aneurysm)
   # SBP. Pt tapped, ascites with prominent neutrophils, culture NGTD.
   - Broaden abx: zosyn CVVH dosing day 1 = [**2-22**] (with vanc for MSSA
   coverage). Again, ID recommending de-escalation of abx by discontinuing
   Zosyn.  Previous de-escalation attempts have resulted in clinical
   worsening; will continue zosyn for 8 day course and then transition to
   ciprofloxacin.
   - Follow cultures
   #C. Diff associated disease: Patient with abdominal pain, although
   improving, found to have Bowel wall thickening on CT.
   - continue PO vanc (started [**2-24**]/)
   - continue IV flagyl (started [**2-25**])
   # NSTEMI/troponinemia: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress,
   SBP. Likely due to SAH and hemolysis and sepsis. EKG unremarkable.
   Stopped trending CE after troponin peak.
   - Tele
   - Re-check CE in setting of new cardiac symptoms
   - No heparin or aspirin given above hematologic derangements
   #Cholestatic LFT abnormalities. Direct bilirubinemia; [**2-15**] and [**2-20**] RUQ
   u/s negative for biliary dilatation; lipase wnl on [**2-14**]. Likely
   intrahepatic cholestasis in setting of sepsis and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - Follow for now; trend LFTs
   - Lactulose begun [**2-21**]
   #Abdominal pain resolving, bowel wall thickening on CT (stable
   thickening of the ascending colon, new thickening of the sigmoid
   colon, possibly other portions. Ddx includes infectious and
   inflammatory etiologies, but ischemia cannot be excluded.)
   # SAH/?left basal infarct: Unclear if spontaneous or in the setting of
   fall. Neuro exam nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat
   imaging [**2-16**] showing continued interval slight decrease in density of
   SAH since earlier in the day. No aneursym seen. MS stable, following
   simple commands.
   - Appreciate Neurosurgery input
   - f/u final CT-A read
   # Head and neck cancer: Follow up with outpatient oncologist
   # Comfort: Morphine for pain/dypsnea
   # Hep C: Unknown baseline. HCV VL 743K on [**2-17**].

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer. He was found confused and complaining of chest pain, and further evaluation revealed endocarditis involving the aortic and tricuspid valves, MSSA bacteremia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, multiple septic infarcts to the brain, liver, spleen, and kidneys, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute renal failure, and Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's current medical issues include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, DIC, anemia, endocarditis, sepsis with septic emboli, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and Clostridium difficile-associated disease. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to the patient's limited ability to protect his airway, further deterioration of renal function, progression of DIC, worsening anemia, worsening endocarditis, development of septic emboli, worsening SBP, and complications related to Clostridium difficile infection.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, renal function, coagulation profile, hemoglobin levels, blood cultures, and liver function tests. Additionally, appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and the patient's fluid and electrolyte balance should be closely monitored. The patient's nutritional needs should also be assessed and managed appropriately."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. He has a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, sepsis, acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, has multiple lines inserted, and is receiving renal replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for mechanical ventilation indicate a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's history of sepsis, along with ongoing positive stool cultures, increases the risk of sepsis recurrence.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output suggest ongoing kidney dysfunction, which could progress to acute kidney injury.
4. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's elevated D-dimer levels and prolonged PT/INR indicate a risk for DIC, which can lead to bleeding or clotting complications.
5. Endocarditis: The presence of vegetations on the aortic and tricuspid valves suggests a high risk of endocarditis, which can lead to further complications like septic emboli.
6. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
7. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity indicates a high risk of developing pressure ulcers due"

   -          Blood CX ([**2-22**]), ([**2-23**]), ([**2-20**]): NGTD
   Studies:
    - TTE ([**2-24**]): Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
   systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
   aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is a
   moderate-sized vegetation (1.0 cm long) on the aortic valve. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. There is a modreate to large vegetation
   (1.7 cm long) on the tricuspid valve. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
   regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion
Compared with the prior
   study (images reviewed) of [**2153-2-15**], the degree of TR and pulmonary
   hypertension detected have increased. The valve vegetations appear
   similar. If indicated, a TEE would better characterize the valvular
   vegetations.
    -  CTA head ([**2-23**])
   1. Multiple scattered small hypodense foci involving the subcortical
   and deep
   white matter of both hemispheres, more conspicuous compared to [**2-18**], [**2152**]
   and new compared to the CT from [**2153-2-14**] consistent with subacute
   embolic infarcts.
   2. Left thalamus hypodensity is increased compared to [**2-18**] and
   significantly increased compared to [**2153-2-14**], consistent with
   evolution
   of a left thalamic subacute infarct.
   3. Evolution of the right mainly parietal subarachnoid hemorrhage with
   decreased density of the blood products. No evidence of new
   intracranial
   hemorrhage or mass effect.
   4. Normal CTA of the head without evidence of aneurysm.
   -CT abdomen ([**2-23**])
   1. Numerous cavitated pulmonary nodules, renal and splenic infarcts,
   all
   compatible with septic emboli.
   2. Findings consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
   3. Marked increase in amount of ascites, but no loculated fluid
   collection.
   4. Marked thickening of the cecum and proximal ascending colon, in the
   setting of antibacterial therapy, this may be due to pseudomembranous
   colitis.
   Alternative possibility would be typhlitis, if the patient is immune
   compromised.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications. Here are some potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has vegetations on both the aortic and tricuspid valves, indicating possible infective endocarditis. This condition can lead to further spread of infection and embolic events.

2. Sepsis: The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, suggesting an ongoing infection. The presence of sepsis can result in organ dysfunction and potentially lead to septic shock.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels indicate impaired kidney function. Acute renal failure can occur due to various factors such as sepsis, hypotension, or nephrotoxic medications.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has marked jaundice and marked skin lesions distal lower extremities and feet, which may suggest impaired skin integrity. This could be due to several factors, including poor perfusion, infection, or underlying systemic disease.

5. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: The CT scan shows evidence of a subarachnoid hemorrhage, indicating bleeding into the space between the brain and the thin tissues that cover the brain. This could be a result of trauma or an aneurysm rupture.

6. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The elevated D-dimer level and decreased fibrinogen suggest the possibility of DIC."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA was found by
   his sister to be confused and complaining of chest pain found to have
   endocarditis (aortic, tricuspid), MSSA Bacteremia, SAH, multiple septic
   infarcts to brain, liver, spleen, kidneys with hospital course
   complicated by DIC, ARF, and C.difficile associated disease, SBP.
   # Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for poor MS but passed SBT
   and extubated on [**2-23**].  Respiratory status declined with stabilization
   s/p suction of thick secretions.
   - Close monitoring given limited ability to protect airway, pt now DNI
   - Trend ABG off of vent
   - HOB evaluation, mouth care
   - Consider therapeutic paracentesis
   - NTS as needed (though cautiously given coagulopathy)
   - Check bladder pressure to determine intra-abdominal pressure
   (currently bladder pressure of 24)
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   - Consider trial of BIPAP (would need to remove NGT)
   # Acute Renal Failure. Renal team believes ARF likely from combination
   of dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing, and multiple
   likely septic renal infarcts, also evidence of evolving ATN. Urine
   negative for Eos X2. Continues with low UOP to anuria.  CVVH started on
   [**2-21**] but filter clotted. UF at rate 100-200 cc negative/hr.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Appreciate renal recs: check vanc trough level daily to guide dose,
   goal 15-20;
   - Follow electrolytes, replete Ca as needed (on SS)
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. No evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as below
   - Cycle DIC labs daily
   - Platelet goal is >20 and INR goal is < 1.8 for any interventional
   procedure
   - Consider FFP/cryo if fibrinogen <100 and bleeding
   # Anemia
 decreasing hematocrit with 9 point drop over 2 days.
   Patient s/p transfusion of 3 units pRBCs yesterday and HCT bumped
   appropriately to 32.  Blood loss likely due to clotted blood being lost
   in CVVH.
   - Monitor HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Guaiac stools
   - CT yesterday with no RP bleed or source of bleeding in abd/head.
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin.
   Most recent TTE with evidence of worsening tricuspid regurgitation.
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated;  Had recommending discontinuing
   Zosyn in favor of Cipro.  For now, will continue Zosyn for a total
   course of 8 days. If stable, will transition to cipro for 14 days.
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - ceftazidime/zosyn for abx now given SBP (day 1 abx = [**2-15**], clear
   blood cultures since [**2-18**])
    - Blood cx q day
    - Daily EKGs
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Blood pressures have been maintained with
   fluids only. Febrile [**2-20**]; pancultured; since afebrile but on CVVH. Pt
   with SBP by tap. Line source, PNA also considered.
   - Continue vanc/zosyn (define course)
   - Continue CVVH/fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate
   - Follow up cultures
   - Consider removing CVL and re-seating Aline if pt spikes again
   - will need PICC when afebrile
   - F/U with neurosurgery re: plan for angiogram in setting of CTA
   results (no evidence of aneurysm)
   # SBP. Pt tapped, ascites with prominent neutrophils, culture NGTD.
   - Broaden abx: zosyn CVVH dosing day 1 = [**2-22**] (with vanc for MSSA
   coverage). Again, ID recommending de-escalation of abx by discontinuing
   Zosyn.  Previous de-escalation attempts have resulted in clinical
   worsening; will continue zosyn for 8 day course and then transition to
   ciprofloxacin.
   - Follow cultures
   #C. Diff associated disease: Patient with abdominal pain, although
   improving, found to have Bowel wall thickening on CT.
   - continue PO vanc (started [**2-24**]/)
   - continue IV flagyl (started [**2-25**])
   # NSTEMI/troponinemia: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress,
   SBP. Likely due to SAH and hemolysis and sepsis. EKG unremarkable.
   Stopped trending CE after troponin peak.
   - Tele
   - Re-check CE in setting of new cardiac symptoms
   - No heparin or aspirin given above hematologic derangements
   #Cholestatic LFT abnormalities. Direct bilirubinemia; [**2-15**] and [**2-20**] RUQ
   u/s negative for biliary dilatation; lipase wnl on [**2-14**]. Likely
   intrahepatic cholestasis in setting of sepsis and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - Follow for now; trend LFTs
   - Lactulose begun [**2-21**]
   #Abdominal pain resolving, bowel wall thickening on CT (stable
   thickening of the ascending colon, new thickening of the sigmoid
   colon, possibly other portions. Ddx includes infectious and

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer. He was found confused, complaining of chest pain, and subsequently diagnosed with endocarditis, MSSA bacteremia, SAH, multiple septic infarcts to the brain, liver, spleen, and kidneys. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by DIC, ARF, and C. difficile-associated disease. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to poor mental status but was later extubated. However, his respiratory status has declined, and he is now do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI). Close monitoring is necessary due to the limited ability to protect his airway.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed ARF likely from a combination of factors including dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing, multiple septic renal infarcts, and evolving acute tubular necrosis (ATN). CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) has been initiated, but the filter clotted. Renal dosing medications need to be adjusted, and electrolytes should be followed closely.

3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient likely has DIC in the setting of sepsis and malignancy. Although"

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA was found by
   his sister to be confused and complaining of chest pain found to have
   endocarditis (aortic, tricuspid), MSSA Bacteremia, SAH, multiple septic
   infarcts to brain, liver, spleen, kidneys with hospital course
   complicated by DIC, ARF, and C.difficile associated disease, SBP.
   # Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for poor MS but passed SBT
   and extubated on [**2-23**].  Respiratory status declined with stabilization
   s/p suction of thick secretions.
   - Close monitoring given limited ability to protect airway, pt now DNI
   - Trend ABG off of vent
   - HOB evaluation, mouth care
   - Defer therapeutic paracentesis for now
   - NTS as needed (though cautiously given coagulopathy)
   - Follow bladder pressure to determine intra-abdominal pressure
   (currently bladder pressure of 24)
   - Continue broad spectrum Abx
   - Consider trial of BIPAP (would need to remove NGT)
   # Acute Renal Failure. Renal team believes ARF likely from combination
   of dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing, and multiple
   likely septic renal infarcts, also evidence of evolving ATN. Urine
   negative for Eos X2. Continues with low UOP to anuria.  CVVH started on
   [**2-21**] but filter clotted. UF at rate 100-200 cc negative/hr.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Appreciate renal recs: check vanc trough level daily to guide dose,
   goal 15-20;
   - Follow electrolytes, replete Ca as needed (on SS)
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. No evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue supportive care
   - Treat sepsis as below
   - Cycle DIC labs daily
   - Platelet goal is >20 and INR goal is < 1.8 for any interventional
   procedure
   - Consider FFP/cryo if fibrinogen <100 and bleeding
   # Anemia
 Earlier in admission had decreasing hematocrit with 9 point
   drop over 2 days.  Patient s/p transfusion of 3 units pRBCs yesterday
   and HCT bumped appropriately to 32.  Blood loss likely due to clotted
   blood being lost in CVVH.
   - Monitor HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Guaiac stools
   - CT yesterday with no RP bleed or source of bleeding in abd/head.
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin.
   Most recent TTE with evidence of worsening tricuspid regurgitation.
    - ID consulting, recs appreciated;  Had recommending discontinuing
   Zosyn in favor of Cipro.  For now, will continue Zosyn for a total
   course of 8 days. If stable, will transition to cipro for 14 days.
    - CT surgery consulted, appreciate recs, now signed off pending
   further clinical development
    - ceftazidime/zosyn for abx now given SBP (day 1 abx = [**2-15**], clear
   blood cultures since [**2-18**])
    - Blood cx q day
    - Daily EKGs
   # Sepsis with Septic Emboli: Blood pressures have been maintained with
   fluids only. Febrile [**2-20**]; pancultured; since afebrile but on CVVH. Pt
   with SBP by tap. Line source, PNA also considered.
   - Continue vanc/zosyn (define course)
   - Continue CVVH/fluids with Goal MAP over 60 and CVP 8-12
   - Trend lactate
   - Follow up cultures
   - Consider removing CVL and re-seating Aline if pt spikes again
   - will need PICC when afebrile
   - F/U with neurosurgery re: plan for angiogram in setting of CTA
   results (no evidence of aneurysm)
   # SBP. Pt tapped, ascites with prominent neutrophils, culture NGTD.
   - Broaden abx: zosyn CVVH dosing day 1 = [**2-22**] (with vanc for MSSA
   coverage). Again, ID recommending de-escalation of abx by discontinuing
   Zosyn.  Previous de-escalation attempts have resulted in clinical
   worsening; will continue zosyn for 8 day course and then transition to
   ciprofloxacin.
   - Follow cultures
   #C. Diff associated disease: Patient with abdominal pain, although
   improving, found to have Bowel wall thickening on CT.
   - continue PO vanc (started [**2-24**]/)
   - continue IV flagyl (started [**2-25**])
   # NSTEMI/troponinemia: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress,
   SBP. Likely due to SAH and hemolysis and sepsis. EKG unremarkable.
   Stopped trending CE after troponin peak.
   - Tele
   - Re-check CE in setting of new cardiac symptoms
   - No heparin or aspirin given above hematologic derangements
   #Cholestatic LFT abnormalities. Direct bilirubinemia; [**2-15**] and [**2-20**] RUQ
   u/s negative for biliary dilatation; lipase wnl on [**2-14**]. Likely
   intrahepatic cholestasis in setting of sepsis and multiorgan
   dysfunction. Bilirubin continues to rise.
   - Follow for now; trend LFTs
   - Lactulose begun [**2-21**]
   #Abdominal pain resolving, bowel wall thickening on CT (stable
   thickening of the ascending colon, new thickening of the sigmoid
   colon, possibly other portions. Ddx includes infectious and
   inflammatory etiologies, but ischemia cannot be excluded.)
   # SAH/?left basal infarct: Unclear if spontaneous or in the setting of
   fall. Neuro exam nonfocal, and CT unchanged between here at OSH. Repeat
   imaging [**2-16**] showing continued interval slight decrease in density of
   SAH since earlier in the day. No aneursym seen. MS stable, following

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old male with h/o hepatitis C and head and neck CA was found by
   his sister to be confused and complaining of chest pain found to have
   endocarditis (aortic, tricuspid), MSSA Bacteremia, SAH, multiple septic
   infarcts to brain, liver, spleen, kidneys with hospital course
   complicated by DIC, ARF, and C.difficile associated disease, SBP.
   Goals of care readdressed yesterday ([**2153-2-26**]) and patient now CMO.
   # Goals of Care: In light of patient
s worsening condition
   (specifically liver function), change in mental status, and respiratory
   distress, a family meeting was held and goals of care were addressed.
   The patient
s mother and HCP decided to make the patient comfort
   measures only.
   - Morphine gtt for comfort/respiratory distress
   - small doses of ativan prn agitation
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Initially intubated for poor MS but passed SBT
   and extubated on [**2-23**].  Respiratory status declined with stabilization
   s/p suction of thick secretions.
   - Antibiotics discontinued as patient is CMO.
   # Acute Renal Failure. Renal team believes ARF likely from combination
   of dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing, and multiple
   likely septic renal infarcts, also evidence of evolving ATN. Urine
   negative for Eos X2. Continues with low UOP to anuria.  CVVH started on
   [**2-21**] but filter clotted. UF at rate 100-200 cc negative/hr.
   - No longer following laboratory data.
   # DIC: Likely in the setting of sepsis, but also in the setting of
   malignancy. No evidence of bleeding.
   # Anemia
 Earlier in admission had decreasing hematocrit with 9 point
   drop over 2 days.  Patient s/p transfusion of 3 units pRBCs yesterday
   and HCT bumped appropriately to 32.  Blood loss likely due to clotted
   blood being lost in CVVH.
   # Endocarditis: confirmed on echo (aortic/tricuspid) meeting Duke
   Criteria.  PSH blood cultures with MSSA sensitive to vanco/nafcillin.
   Most recent TTE with evidence of worsening tricuspid regurgitation.

   fluids only. Febrile [**2-20**]; pancultured; since afebrile but on CVVH. Pt
   with SBP by tap. Line source, PNA also considered.
   # SBP. Pt tapped, ascites with prominent neutrophils, culture NGTD.
   #C. Diff associated disease: Patient with abdominal pain, although
   improving, found to have Bowel wall thickening on CT.
   # NSTEMI/troponinemia: Elevated troponin in the setting of distress,
   SBP. Likely due to SAH and hemolysis and sepsis. EKG unremarkable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of hepatitis C and head and neck cancer. He was found confused, complaining of chest pain, and diagnosed with aortic and tricuspid endocarditis, MSSA bacteremia, SAH, multiple septic infarcts to the brain, liver, spleen, and kidneys. His hospital course has been complicated by DIC, ARF, and C. difficile-associated disease. The patient's condition has worsened, leading to respiratory distress and liver function deterioration. A family meeting was held, and the decision was made to focus on comfort measures only. The patient is currently on a morphine drip for comfort and is demonstrating agonal breathing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to poor mental status but passed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and was extubated. However, his respiratory status declined with the suctioning of thick secretions. Antibiotics have been discontinued as the patient is now comfort measures only.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The renal team believes ARF is likely due to a combination of factors including dye load, sepsis in low flow state with third-spacing, multiple septic renal infarcts, and evolving acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient's urine output has been low to anuria, and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) was"
