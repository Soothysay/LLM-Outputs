","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of lung adenocarcinoma and alcohol abuse, presenting intoxicated and hypoxic. He is currently in the ICU for EtOH intoxication and hypoxemia. The patient has received Valium for withdrawal symptoms. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 144/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 49 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and has an ABG result of /29. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normocephalic head, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. Neurologic examination is not assessed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of COPD and current hypoxemia put him at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and exacerbation of COPD.
2. Infection: Due to the patient's compromised immune system from cancer and alcohol abuse, he is at an increased risk of developing infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI).
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypertension, which may lead to cardiovascular complications such as heart failure or myocardial infarction.

   # Hypoxia: unclear etiology at this time; likely is secondary to
   underlying lung cancer or COPD.  Does not seem to be in respiratory
   stress and was weaned from 4 to 2LNC.  Patient unable to tolerate PIV
   and get CTA.  Could potentially have a PE as his DDimer was elevated
   and he has a hx of cancer.  Was given lovenox in the ED.  Pt. is no
   longer tachycardic or hypertensive.
   - continue NC, wean as tolerated
   - obtain PICC today
   - hold on lovenox for now
   .
   # Unsteady gait: likely from etoh use.  PT when through withdrawing.

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of lung adenocarcinoma and ethanol abuse who presents intoxicated and hypoxic. The patient's main concerns include ETOH withdrawal, hypoxia, unsteady gait, anemia, and potential pulmonary embolism (PE). 

For ETOH withdrawal, the patient is tremulous, hypertensive, and tachycardic with a CIWA score of 16 down from 22. The plan is to stop IV valium and continue PO valium 10 mg for CIWA >10. A social work consult and psych consult have been ordered.

Regarding hypoxia, the etiology is unclear at this time, but it may be secondary to underlying lung cancer or COPD. The patient does not seem to be in respiratory distress and has been weaned from 4 to 2LNC. The patient was given lovenox in the ED and is no longer tachycardic or hypertensive. The plan is to wean as tolerated today, obtain PICC today, and hold on lovenox for now.

The unsteady gait is likely due to etoh use, and the patient's PT/INR values have been fluctuating during withdrawal. The patient has mild anemia, slightly below his baseline but not concerning as he has been at this level before. 

There are also concerns about a potential PE, with an elevated D-dimer and history of cancer."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of alcohol intoxication and withdrawal. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with ineffective coping, dyspnea (shortness of breath), and possible respiratory distress. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his condition. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 164/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient is receiving supportive care in the ICU, including fluid management and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: Alcohol withdrawal can cause seizures, which can be a medical emergency. Close monitoring for any signs of seizure activity is essential.
2. Delirium Tremens: This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by hallucinations, agitation, and autonomic instability. It requires prompt recognition and management.
3. Respiratory Complications: Alcohol intoxication can impair respiratory function and lead to respiratory distress or failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.
4. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines increase the risk of healthcare-associated infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or bloodstream infections.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of lung adenocarcinoma and ethanol abuse. He presented to the hospital intoxicated and hypoxic, and unable to provide reliable history. The patient has been showing signs of alcohol withdrawal and has been on valium for management. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 164/91 mmHg, heart rate of 81 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's lab results show a slightly low white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and platelet count. His creatinine and glucose levels are within normal range. The patient's electrolytes are also within normal limits. The patient's D-dimer level was elevated, but the likelihood of pulmonary embolism seems low. The patient's unsteady gait is likely due to long-term alcohol use. The patient has mild anemia and is receiving prophylactic subcutaneous heparin. The patient's access for IV fluids is through a midline catheter. The patient's next of kin needs to be contacted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms: The patient has shown signs of withdrawal, which can include tremors, hallucinations, seizures, and delirium tremens. It is important to continue providing valium as prescribed and monitor for any worsening symptoms.
2. Hypoxia: The patient initially presented with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of lung adenocarcinoma and alcohol abuse who presented intoxicated and hypoxic. The patient has been showing active signs of withdrawal from alcohol and has been receiving Valium for symptom management. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but there have been fluctuations in blood pressure and heart rate. The patient's oxygen saturation is within normal range. The patient's physical examination reveals tremors, decreased breath sounds at the bases with fine crackles, and no other significant findings. The patient's lab results show mild anemia and slightly low potassium levels, but otherwise, the results are within normal range. The patient's mental status is alert and oriented with no focal deficits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has shown signs of withdrawal and continues to receive Valium for symptom management. It is important to monitor the patient closely for further withdrawal symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.
2. Hypoxia: Although the cause of hypoxia is unclear, it could be secondary to underlying lung cancer or COPD. Monitoring the patient's oxygen saturation levels and providing supplemental oxygen if necessary will be crucial.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's D-dimer was elevated, but the likelihood of PE seems low. Monitoring for any signs or symptoms of DVT/PE and considering further diagnostic tests if indicated is important.

   72 hours since last drink. Over last several days showed active signs
   of withdrawal on exam. CIWAs have decreased and his need for valium has
   also decreased.  No valium since 11pm.  Pt. verbalizes wanting to leave
   the hospital today.  Per psych eval, unclear if appropriate for Section
   12, but they want to re-evaluate today. Physicians from health care for
   the homeless evaluating him today as well.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of lung adenocarcinoma and alcohol abuse. He presented intoxicated and hypoxic, and an unreliable history was obtained. The patient has been showing signs of alcohol withdrawal and has been on valium for CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment) scores greater than 10. His need for valium has decreased over the last several days, indicating improvement. The patient expresses a desire to leave the hospital, but his mental status is still being evaluated for potential sectioning under psychiatric evaluation. He is also being evaluated by physicians from healthcare for the homeless.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has shown active signs of withdrawal, which can lead to severe complications such as seizures, delirium tremens, and autonomic instability.
2. Hypoxia: The patient presented hypoxic and it is unclear at this time what the exact cause is. It could be secondary to underlying lung cancer, COPD, or another respiratory condition. The patient's oxygen saturation is currently at 94%.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has an elevated D-dimer level, and although the likelihood of PE seems low, further monitoring and assessment are necessary to rule out any potential clot formation.
4. Unsteady Gait: The patient likely has an unsteady gait due to chronic alcohol use. This could increase the risk"
