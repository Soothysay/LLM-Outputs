   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8077**] is a 47n year old female with progressive recurrent stage
   IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal
   cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens presenting
   with acute respiratory distress after recieving placitaxel.
   .
   #) Respiratory Distress: Not completely clear what triggered her acute
   respiratory distress. She does have underlying pleural effusions, so
   likely has poor reserve to tolerate any additional demand. Differential
   includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to
   paclitaxel versus pulmonary embolism or any of the above with possible
   underlying infection given history of fevers and cough. Anaphylaxis
   appears to be less likely given lack of vasodilatory response (no
   hives, hypotension, edema), however other types of reactions are
   possible such as ARDS-like reaction. Also could have been primary
   cardiac arrhythmia leading to poor forward flow given SVT versus sinus
   tachycardia on 2nd ED EKG.
   Currently appears to be comfortable on pressure support with
   satisfactory ABG. No history of CHF with relatively unremarkable [**Name (NI) **] in
   3/[**2114**].
   - Plan to extubate today
   - Hold off on further IVF given enlarging pleural effusions
   - Diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for now given leukocytosis, report of
   fevers, elevated lactate for possible PNA
   - Repeat ABG after extubation
   - Would consider repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] if above unrevealing, given question of CHF
   with IVF today.
   .
   #) Hypotension: After increasing sedation, MAP currently at 60 with
   systolic of 80. Suspect this is in part due to sedation, however must
   be mindful of other causes.
   - Evaluate BP after extubation
   - Follow lactate, urine output, unable to follow CVP but can check SvO2
   off of her port.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] place a-line for better monitoring of BP and ABG's.
   - If MAP not at goal, would then consider IVF versus pressors.
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Resolved. Suspect this was due to stress of respiratory
   event versus SVT, though sinus appears more likely. She was initially
   tachycardic upon presentation to the outpatient clinic which may have
   been due to respiratory distress, possible intra-vascular hypovolemic
   state.
   - Working to reserve above causing, treating pain, PRBCs for Hct<25
   .
   #) Reported fevers, leukocytosis: Differential includes secondary to
   progressive disease versus infectious process. Differential on WBC is
   more suggestive of infectious process, however no bands and is lower
   than previous leukocytosis dating from [**Month (only) 319**]. She does have indwelling
   port as another potential source of infection, as well as cough and
   atelectasis versus consolidation on CT.
   - Blood, urine, and sputum cultures pending
   - Continue empiric broad coverage given leukocytosis as noted above
   - Continue vancomycin and cefepime for now given indwelling port and
   frequent healthcare visits.
   .
   #) Anemia: Given elevated lactate, tachycardia, will transfuse given
   question of demand ischemia with tropnin leak and borderline blood
   pressure. Suspect due to chronic disease and chemotherapy.
   - 1 unit PRBCs for now, re-check HCT in AM
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #) Stage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: Status-post
   numerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens. Discussed events at
   clinic, her course, and her social situation with her oncology fellow
   tonight. They will follow along with us; they reported the family is
   very involved and communication with parents is best via Russian
   interpreter.
   - Appreciate oncology assistance.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Suggestive of liver injury, not obstructive picture.
   Earlier in the day, were close to normal range aside from elevated
   alkaline phosphate. Elevation this evening suggestive of low flow state
   with possible hepatic injury, though creatinine is improved as compared
   to earlier today (however did have elevated lactate). She has known
   liver metaseses as well.
   - Follow trend
   - Holding hepatotoxic agents
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: CK remains flat. In setting of marked tachycardia
   and respiratory distress, suspect this is due to demand with subsequent
   troponin leak.
   - Will continue to trend enzymes
   - Monitor pain, fluid status to improve HR (currently in 90's)
   - Follow up EKG
   - ASA 325 mg daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of stage IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, who presented with acute respiratory distress after receiving paclitaxel. She has underlying pleural effusions and poor reserve to tolerate additional demand. The differential diagnosis for her respiratory distress includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion, reaction to paclitaxel, pulmonary embolism, or infection. She is currently comfortable on pressure support with satisfactory ABG values. The plan is to extubate her today, hold off on further IVF due to enlarging pleural effusions, and continue antibiotic coverage given leukocytosis, report of fevers, and elevated lactate for possible pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Distress: The patient's acute respiratory distress could be due to flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion, reaction to paclitaxel, pulmonary embolism, or infection. Monitoring ABG values, chest X-ray, and considering further diagnostic tests such as CT scan or echocardiogram may be necessary.
2) Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be attributed to sedation, but other causes should also be evaluated, including fluid status, cardiac function, and possible sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, lactate levels, urine output, and SvO2 is important.
3) Tachycardia: The patient's elevated heart rate may"

   likely has poor reserve to tolerate any additional demand. Differential
   includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to
   paclitaxel versus pulmonary embolism or any of the above with possible
   underlying infection given history of fevers and cough. Anaphylaxis
   appears to be less likely given lack of vasodilatory response (no
   hives, hypotension, edema), however other types of reactions are
   possible such as ARDS-like reaction. Also could have been primary
   cardiac arrhythmia leading to poor forward flow given SVT versus sinus
   tachycardia on 2nd ED EKG.
   Currently appears to be comfortable on pressure support with
   satisfactory ABG. No history of CHF with relatively unremarkable [**Name (NI) **] in
   3/[**2114**].
   - Plan to extubate today
   - Hold off on further IVF given enlarging pleural effusions
   - Diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for now given leukocytosis, report of
   fevers, elevated lactate for possible PNA
   - Repeat ABG after extubation
   - Consider repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] if above unrevealing, given question of CHF with
   IVF today.
   .
   #) Hypotension: After increasing sedation, MAP currently at 60 with
   systolic of 80. Suspect this is in part due to sedation, however must
   be mindful of other causes.
   - Evaluate BP after extubation
   - Follow lactate, urine output, unable to follow CVP but can check SvO2
   off of her port.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] place a-line for better monitoring of BP and ABG's.
   - If MAP not at goal, would then consider IVF versus pressors.
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Resolved. Suspect this was due to stress of respiratory
   event versus SVT, though sinus appears more likely. She was initially
   tachycardic upon presentation to the outpatient clinic which may have
   been due to respiratory distress, possible intra-vascular hypovolemic
   state.
   - Continue pain control
   - Maintain Hct>25
   .
   #) Reported fevers, leukocytosis: Differential includes secondary to
   progressive disease versus infectious process. Differential on WBC is
   more suggestive of infectious process, however no bands and is lower
   than previous leukocytosis dating from [**Month (only) 319**]. She does have indwelling
   port as another potential source of infection, as well as cough and
   atelectasis versus consolidation on CT.
   - Continue vancomycin and cefepime for now given indwelling port and
   frequent healthcare visits
   - Blood, urine, and sputum cultures pending
   .
   #) Anemia: Given elevated lactate, tachycardia, will transfuse given
   question of demand ischemia with tropnin leak and borderline blood
   pressure. Suspect due to chronic disease and chemotherapy. Hct goal
   >25.
   - Monitor Hb/Hct
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #) Stage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: Status-post
   numerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens. Discussed events at
   clinic, her course, and her social situation with her oncology fellow
   tonight. They will follow along with us; they reported the family is
   very involved and communication with parents is best via Russian
   interpreter.
   - Appreciate oncology assistance.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Suggestive of liver injury, not obstructive picture.
   Earlier in the day, were close to normal range aside from elevated
   alkaline phosphate. Elevation this evening suggestive of low flow state
   with possible hepatic injury, though creatinine is improved as compared
   to earlier today (however did have elevated lactate). She has known
   liver metaseses as well.
   - Follow trend
   - Holding hepatotoxic agents
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: CK remains flat. In setting of marked tachycardia
   and respiratory distress, suspect this is due to demand with subsequent
   troponin leak.
   - Will continue to trend enzymes
   - Monitor pain, fluid status to improve HR (currently in 90's)
   - Follow up EKG
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Holding off on IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet

   Communication:  Comments: [**Name (NI) **] father, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8080**]
   [**Name2 (NI) 129**] status: Full (as discussed with patient by primary oncology team)
   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 47-year-old female with stage IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer.
- She presented with acute respiratory distress after receiving paclitaxel.
- The differential diagnosis for her respiratory distress includes flash pulmonary edema, reaction to paclitaxel, pulmonary embolism, or infection.
- She has underlying pleural effusions, which may have contributed to her poor respiratory reserve.
- The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but she has a history of hypotension.
- Her tachycardia resolved, and it is believed to be due to stress or a possible SVT.
- She has reported fevers and leukocytosis, which could be due to an infectious process or progression of her disease.
- The patient has anemia, likely due to chronic disease and chemotherapy.
- She has elevated liver function tests, suggestive of possible hepatic injury or low flow state.
- Her troponin levels are elevated, but CK remains flat, suggesting a possible demand ischemia with subsequent troponin leak.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: Given her acute respiratory distress and underlying pleural effusions, there is a risk of further respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.

2. Infection: The patient's reported fevers, leukocytosis, and positive findings on laboratory tests"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8077**] is a 47n year old female with progressive recurrent stage
   IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal
   cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens presenting
   with acute respiratory distress after recieving placitaxel.
   .
   #) Respiratory Distress: Not completely clear what triggered her acute
   respiratory distress. She does have underlying pleural effusions, so
   likely has poor reserve to tolerate any additional demand. Differential
   includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to
   paclitaxel versus pulmonary embolism or any of the above with possible
   underlying infection given history of fevers and cough. Anaphylaxis
   appears to be less likely given lack of vasodilatory response (no
   hives, hypotension, edema), however other types of reactions are
   possible such as ARDS-like reaction. Also could have been primary
   cardiac arrhythmia leading to poor forward flow given SVT versus sinus
   tachycardia on 2nd ED EKG.
   Currently appears to be comfortable on pressure support with
   satisfactory ABG. No history of CHF with relatively unremarkable [**Name (NI) **] in
   3/[**2114**].
   - Continue pressure support ventilation overnight, weaning Fi02 and
   PEEP as tolerated.
   - Lighten her current minimal sedation for SBT and RSB in AM for
   possible extubation
   - Hold off on further IVF given enlarging pleural effusions
   - Diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP, sending BNP
   - Trending cardiac enzymes
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for now given leukocytosis, report of
   fevers, elevated lactate for possible PNA
   - Likely thoracentesis for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes (given
   leukocytosis, question of pulmonary infection given cough, fevers),
   either tonight or possibly post-extubation
   - Repeat ABG now
   - Would consider repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] if above unrevealing, given question of CHF
   with IVF today.
   .
   #) Hypotension: After increasing sedation, MAP currently at 60 with
   systolic of 80. Suspect this is in part due to sedation, however must
   be mindful of other causes.
   - Infectious work up as noted below.
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Would consider stress dose steroids, though does not appear that she
   has been on continuous steroids
   - Follow lactate, urine output, unable to follow CVP but can check SvO2
   off of her port.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] place a-line for better monitoring of BP and ABG's.
   - PRBCs for now in lieu of IVF to help expand intravascular space for
   goal MAP >65. If MAP not at goal, would then consider IVF versus
   pressors.
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Resolved. Suspect this was due to stress of respiratory
   event versus SVT, though sinus appears more likely. She was initially
   tachycardic upon presentation to the outpatient clinic which may have
   been due to respiratory distress, possible intra-vascular hypovolemic
   state.
   - Working to reserve above causing, treating pain, PRBCs as discussed
   below
   .
   #) Reported fevers, leukocytosis: Differential includes secondary to
   progressive disease versus infectious process. Differential on WBC is
   more suggestive of infectious process, however no bands and is lower
   than previous leukocytosis dating from [**Month (only) 319**]. She does have indwelling
   port as another potential source of infection, as well as cough and
   atelectasis versus consolidation on CT.
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures if possible.
   - Continue empiric broad coverage given leukocytosis as noted above;
   will need to determine further details of PCN allergy. Vancomycin for
   now given indwelling port and frequent healthcare visits.
   .
   #) Anemia: Given elevated lactate, tachycardia, will transfuse given
   question of demand ischemia with tropnin leak and borderline blood
   pressure. Suspect due to chronic disease and chemotherapy.
   - 1 unit PRBCs for now, re-check HCT in AM
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #) Stage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: Status-post
   numerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens. Discussed events at
   clinic, her course, and her social situation with her oncology fellow
   tonight. They will follow along with us; they reported the family is
   very involved and communication with parents is best via Russian
   interpreter.
   - Appreciate oncology assistance.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Suggestive of liver injury, not obstructive picture.
   Earlier in the day, were close to normal range aside from elevated
   alkaline phosphate. Elevation this evening suggestive of low flow state
   with possible hepatic injury, though creatinine is improved as compared
   to earlier today (however did have elevated lactate). She has known
   liver metaseses as well.
   - Follow trend
   - Holding hepatotoxic agents
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: CK remains flat. In setting of marked tachycardia
   and respiratory distress, suspect this is due to demand with subsequent
   troponin leak.
   - Will continue to trend enzymes
   - Monitor pain, fluid status to improve HR (currently in 90's)
   - Follow up EKG
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   .
   #) FEN: Holding off on IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, PPI (on at home and for while
   intubated)
   .
   #) Access: Right-sided chest port, right groin triple lumen placed in
   ED, one peripheral line
   .
   #) Code:  Full (as discussed with patient by primary oncology team)
   .
   #) Communication: [**Name (NI) **] father, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8080**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with stage IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens. She presented with acute respiratory distress after receiving paclitaxel.

The patient's current assessment includes respiratory distress, hypotension, tachycardia, reported fevers, and leukocytosis. The differential diagnosis for these symptoms includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to paclitaxel versus pulmonary embolism or any of the above with possible underlying infection. Anaphylaxis appears to be less likely.

The plan includes continuing pressure support ventilation overnight, weaning FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated. The patient will be lightened up from minimal sedation for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and respiratory system assessment (RSB) in the morning for possible extubation. Holding off on further IVF due to enlarging pleural effusions is recommended. Diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP, sending B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is also advised. Trending cardiac enzymes, continuing antibiotic coverage for now given leukocytosis, report of fevers, elevated lactate for possible pneumonia, likely thoracentesis for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes (given leukocytosis, question of pulmonary infection), repeat ABG now, and considering repeat chest X-ray if above unrevealing are all part"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8077**] is a 47n year old female with progressive recurrent stage
   IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal
   cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens presenting
   with acute respiratory distress after recieving placitaxel.
   .
   #) Respiratory Distress: Not completely clear what triggered her acute
   respiratory distress. She does have underlying pleural effusions, so
   likely has poor reserve to tolerate any additional demand. Differential
   includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to
   paclitaxel versus pulmonary embolism or any of the above with possible
   underlying infection given history of fevers and cough. Anaphylaxis
   appears to be less likely given lack of vasodilatory response (no
   hives, hypotension, edema), however other types of reactions are
   possible such as ARDS-like reaction. Also could have been primary
   cardiac arrhythmia leading to poor forward flow given SVT versus sinus
   tachycardia on 2nd ED EKG.
   Currently appears to be comfortable on pressure support with
   satisfactory ABG. No history of CHF with relatively unremarkable [**Name (NI) **] in
   3/[**2114**].
   - Plan to extubate today
   - Hold off on further IVF given enlarging pleural effusions
   - Diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for now given leukocytosis, report of
   fevers, elevated lactate for possible PNA
   - Repeat ABG after extubation
   - Would consider repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] if above unrevealing, given question of CHF
   with IVF today.
   .
   #) Hypotension: After increasing sedation, MAP currently at 60 with
   systolic of 80. Suspect this is in part due to sedation, however must
   be mindful of other causes.
   - Infectious work up as noted below.
   - Would consider stress dose steroids, though does not appear that she
   has been on continuous steroids
   - Follow lactate, urine output, unable to follow CVP but can check SvO2
   off of her port.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] place a-line for better monitoring of BP and ABG's.
   - PRBCs for now in lieu of IVF to help expand intravascular space for
   goal MAP >65. If MAP not at goal, would then consider IVF versus
   pressors.
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Resolved. Suspect this was due to stress of respiratory
   event versus SVT, though sinus appears more likely. She was initially
   tachycardic upon presentation to the outpatient clinic which may have
   been due to respiratory distress, possible intra-vascular hypovolemic
   state.
   - Working to reserve above causing, treating pain, PRBCs as discussed
   below
   .
   #) Reported fevers, leukocytosis: Differential includes secondary to
   progressive disease versus infectious process. Differential on WBC is
   more suggestive of infectious process, however no bands and is lower
   than previous leukocytosis dating from [**Month (only) 319**]. She does have indwelling
   port as another potential source of infection, as well as cough and
   atelectasis versus consolidation on CT.
   - Blood, urine, sputum cultures if possible.
   - Continue empiric broad coverage given leukocytosis as noted above;
   will need to determine further details of PCN allergy. Vancomycin for
   now given indwelling port and frequent healthcare visits.
   .
   #) Anemia: Given elevated lactate, tachycardia, will transfuse given
   question of demand ischemia with tropnin leak and borderline blood
   pressure. Suspect due to chronic disease and chemotherapy.
   - 1 unit PRBCs for now, re-check HCT in AM
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #) Stage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: Status-post
   numerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens. Discussed events at
   clinic, her course, and her social situation with her oncology fellow
   tonight. They will follow along with us; they reported the family is
   very involved and communication with parents is best via Russian
   interpreter.
   - Appreciate oncology assistance.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Suggestive of liver injury, not obstructive picture.
   Earlier in the day, were close to normal range aside from elevated
   alkaline phosphate. Elevation this evening suggestive of low flow state
   with possible hepatic injury, though creatinine is improved as compared
   to earlier today (however did have elevated lactate). She has known
   liver metaseses as well.
   - Follow trend
   - Holding hepatotoxic agents
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: CK remains flat. In setting of marked tachycardia
   and respiratory distress, suspect this is due to demand with subsequent
   troponin leak.
   - Will continue to trend enzymes
   - Monitor pain, fluid status to improve HR (currently in 90's)
   - Follow up EKG
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   .
   #) FEN: Holding off on IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, PPI (on at home and for while
   intubated)
   .
   #) Access: Right-sided chest port, right groin triple lumen placed in
   ED, one peripheral line
   .
   #) Code:  Full (as discussed with patient by primary oncology team)
   .
   #) Communication: [**Name (NI) **] father, [**Name (NI) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8080**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of stage IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens. She presented with acute respiratory distress after receiving paclitaxel and was intubated.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure in the low 80s with a MAP around 65, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2. Her physical examination shows coarse breath sounds with decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the bases, no wheezes, occasional ronchi, transmitted upper airway noises, and a right chest wall port without erythema or induration.

Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.9 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and elevated troponin levels. The pleural fluid analysis shows no organisms seen on gram stain. The patient has an indwelling port, which could be a potential source of infection.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include respiratory distress due to flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion, reaction to paclitaxel, pulmonary embolism, or underlying infection. There is also a possibility of anaphylaxis"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8077**] is a 47n year old female with progressive recurrent stage
   IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal
   cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens presenting
   with acute respiratory distress after recieving placitaxel.
   .
   #) Respiratory Distress: Not completely clear what triggered her acute
   respiratory distress. She does have underlying pleural effusions, so
   likely has poor reserve to tolerate any additional demand. Differential
   includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to
   paclitaxel versus pulmonary embolism or any of the above with possible
   underlying infection given history of fevers and cough. Anaphylaxis
   appears to be less likely given lack of vasodilatory response (no
   hives, hypotension, edema), however other types of reactions are
   possible such as ARDS-like reaction. Also could have been primary
   cardiac arrhythmia leading to poor forward flow given SVT versus sinus
   tachycardia on 2nd ED EKG. Pt was extubated successfully yesterday.
   Currently appears to be comfortable on NC. No history of CHF with
   relatively unremarkable [**Name (NI) **] in 3/[**2114**].
   - diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP
   - d/c abx given no signs/symptoms of infection and cx NTD
   - consider repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] at future date.
   .
   #) Hypotension: mostly resolved, SBP in 90-100s now.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Resolved. Suspect this was due to stress of respiratory
   event versus SVT, though sinus appears more likely. She was initially
   tachycardic upon presentation to the outpatient clinic which may have
   been due to respiratory distress, possible intra-vascular hypovolemic
   state.
   - Continue pain control
   - Maintain Hct>25
   .
   #) Reported fevers, leukocytosis: Differential includes secondary to
   progressive disease versus infectious process. Differential on WBC is
   more suggestive of infectious process, however no bands and is lower
   than previous leukocytosis dating from [**Month (only) 319**]. She does have indwelling
   port as another potential source of infection, as well as cough and
   atelectasis versus consolidation on CT.  Now resolved, except for low
   temp this AM (100.2).
   - no abx for now
   - f/u blood, urine, and sputum cultures
   .
   #) Anemia: Suspect due to chronic disease and chemotherapy. Hct goal
   >25.
   - Monitor Hb/Hct
   .
   #) Stage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: Status-post
   numerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens. Onc  following along;
   they reported the family is very involved and communication with
   parents is best via Russian interpreter.
   - follow onc recs

   #) Elevated LFTs: Suggestive of liver injury, not obstructive picture.
   Diff icl low flow state with possible hepatic injury; also has known
   liver metaseses.
   - trending down
   - holding hepatotoxic agents
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: CK remains flat. In setting of marked tachycardia
   and respiratory distress, suspect this is due to demand with subsequent
   troponin leak.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old female with stage IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens. She presented with acute respiratory distress after receiving paclitaxel and has underlying pleural effusions. The patient has been extubated successfully and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/65 mmHg to 117/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on NC. The patient has a history of progressive recurrent cancer, chemotherapy, and surgical procedures. She is currently experiencing hypotension, tachycardia, reported fevers, leukocytosis, anemia, elevated liver function tests, and elevated troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's acute respiratory distress could be due to flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion, reaction to paclitaxel, pulmonary embolism, or underlying infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is mostly resolved and in the range of 90-100s.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia has resolved, but it may have been caused by stress or a possible SVT.
4. Reported Fevers"

   IIIC ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer, status-post optimal
   cytoreductive surgery and numerous chemotherapy regimens presenting

   .
   #) Respiratory Distress: Not completely clear what triggered her acute
   respiratory distress. She does have underlying pleural effusions, so
   likely has poor reserve to tolerate any additional demand. Differential
   includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion versus reaction to

   possible such as ARDS-like reaction. Also could have been primary
   cardiac arrhythmia leading to poor forward flow given SVT versus sinus
   tachycardia on 2nd ED EKG.
   Currently appears to be comfortable on pressure support with
   satisfactory ABG. No history of CHF with relatively unremarkable [**Name (NI) **] in
   3/[**2114**].
   - Plan to extubate today
   - Hold off on further IVF given enlarging pleural effusions
   - Diuresis if needed and tolerated by BP
   - Continue antibiotic coverage for now given leukocytosis, report of
   fevers, elevated lactate for possible PNA
   - Repeat ABG after extubation
   - Consider repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] if above unrevealing, given question of CHF with
   IVF today.
   .
   #) Hypotension: After increasing sedation, MAP currently at 60 with
   systolic of 80. Suspect this is in part due to sedation, however must
   be mindful of other causes.
   - Evaluate BP after extubation
   - Follow lactate, urine output, unable to follow CVP but can check SvO2
   off of her port.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] place a-line for better monitoring of BP and ABG's.
   - If MAP not at goal, would then consider IVF versus pressors.
   .
   #) Tachycardia: Resolved. Suspect this was due to stress of respiratory
   event versus SVT, though sinus appears more likely. She was initially
   tachycardic upon presentation to the outpatient clinic which may have
   been due to respiratory distress, possible intra-vascular hypovolemic
   state.
   - Continue pain control

   more suggestive of infectious process, however no bands and is lower
   than previous leukocytosis dating from [**Month (only) 319**]. She does have indwelling
   port as another potential source of infection, as well as cough and
   atelectasis versus consolidation on CT.
   - Continue vancomycin and cefepime for now given indwelling port and
   frequent healthcare visits
   - Blood, urine, and sputum cultures pending
   .
   #) Anemia: Given elevated lactate, tachycardia, will transfuse given
   question of demand ischemia with tropnin leak and borderline blood
   pressure. Suspect due to chronic disease and chemotherapy. Hct goal
   >25.
   - Monitor Hb/Hct
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   #) Stage IIIC Ovarian versus fallopian tube cancer: Status-post
   numerous procedures and chemotherapy regimens. Discussed events at
   clinic, her course, and her social situation with her oncology fellow
   tonight. They will follow along with us; they reported the family is
   very involved and communication with parents is best via Russian
   interpreter.
   - Appreciate oncology assistance.
   .
   #) Elevated LFTs: Suggestive of liver injury, not obstructive picture.
   Earlier in the day, were close to normal range aside from elevated
   alkaline phosphate. Elevation this evening suggestive of low flow state
   with possible hepatic injury, though creatinine is improved as compared
   to earlier today (however did have elevated lactate). She has known
   liver metaseses as well.
   - Follow trend
   - Holding hepatotoxic agents
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: CK remains flat. In setting of marked tachycardia
   and respiratory distress, suspect this is due to demand with subsequent
   troponin leak.
   - Will continue to trend enzymes
   - Monitor pain, fluid status to improve HR (currently in 90's)
   - Follow up EKG

There is also an opacity in both lower lungs, which could be due to volume loss or underlying infiltrate. The patient's oncology recommendations are unknown. She has advanced to a regular diet, her WBC count has been bumped up to 30, now 20, and she has been afebrile. Her central line has been discontinued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's underlying pleural effusions may have contributed to her acute respiratory distress. The differential diagnosis includes flash pulmonary edema from IVF and infusion, reaction to paclitaxel, pulmonary embolism, or any of the above with possible underlying infection. Anaphylaxis seems less likely, but other types of reactions such as ARDS-like reaction are possible. Primary cardiac arrhythmia leading to poor forward flow is also a consideration."
