   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with PMHx of biventricular heart failure and moderate pulm
   hypertension presents with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia and DOE
   transferred to the MICU for hemoptysis following thoracentesis.
   .
   # Hemoptysis:  Concern for pneumonic laceration during the procedure.
   Patient was intubated on arrival to the MICU for airway protection and
   ease of bronchoscopy, continues to remain on mechanical ventilation.
   - Bronchoscopy showed RLL bleeding, however not brisk, plan to perform
   bronchial blockade for tamponade of bleeding, will likely remove
   balloon today if remains stable
   - IR on board, may require angiography if bleeding does not stop
   - Thoracic Surgery made aware as she may require chest tube placement
   or surgical intervention if hemostasis not achieved by bronchoscopy
   - Continue Q 4h Hct
s, if stable can spread out
   - Monitor O2 sats
   - Maintain mechanical ventilation and wean after balloon removed and
   diuresis
   .
   # Hypoxia/DOE:  Most likely secondary to volume overload.  Pt with
   known biventricular heart failure, pulm htn and new pleural effusion.
   Imaging was less consistent with PNA.  No evidence of PE on CTA on
   admission.  Pt is due for work-up of pulm hypertension including PFTs
   and may also benefit from trial of sildenafil.
   - Diuresis was initiated with lasix 40mg IV initially, then titrated up
   to 80mg [**Hospital1 **], on hold since admission to the MICU, however will start
   lasix drip for volume removal
   - Will discontinue antibiotics as unlikely to be infectious given
   afebrile and no increase in WBC count, follow cultures, trend fever
   curve and WBCs and start as needed
   - continue to monitor strict i/os
   - Alb/atro nebs PRN
   - Will check ABG following balloon removal, attempt to wean to PSV
   following
   .
   # Hypotension:  CVP elevated.  Most likely cardiogenic failure,
   worsened by sedation.  Will continue levophed as needed, attempt to
   titrate.
   -          Lasix drip today for volume removal in the setting of
   cardiogenic shock
   -          Check PM lytes
   -          Attempt to wean sedation after balloon removed
   .
   # Chest pain:  Most likely pleurtic in nature.  Resolved.  EKGs
   essentially unchanged, CE's ruled out and cardiac cath in [**10-28**] was
   normal.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Hold Aspirin, will hold metoprolol for now, and restart when
   hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypertension: hold toprol & lasix until hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Ulcerative Colitis: currently asymptomatic, continue home regimen
   - restart Asacol 800mg TID when taking PO
   .
   # Afib:  The patient was not anticoagulated previously secodnary to
   recent Dx of Duodenal Ulcer.  Will not start anticoagulation in the
   setting of acute bleed.
   - Hold toprol for now, will use IV lopressor as needed overnight.
   .
   # FEN:  start tube feeds today, replete lytes PRN
   .
   # Access: PIV, L IJ, right radial line
   .
   # PPx: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, IV PPI

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of biventricular heart failure and moderate pulmonary hypertension. She presented with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia, and dyspnea on exertion. She was intubated on arrival to the MICU for airway protection and ease of bronchoscopy.

The patient's current condition includes hemoptysis, hypoxia, and chest pain. The hemoptysis is concerning for pneumonic laceration during the procedure. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which showed right lower lobe bleeding. A bronchial blockade was placed for tamponade of bleeding, and the plan is to remove the balloon today if the patient remains stable. If the bleeding does not stop, interventional radiology (IR) will be consulted, and angiography may be performed. Thoracic surgery has been made aware, as the patient may require chest tube placement or surgical intervention if hemostasis is not achieved by bronchoscopy.

The patient also has hypoxia and dyspnea on exertion, which are most likely secondary to volume overload. The patient has known biventricular heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and a new pleural effusion. Imaging was less consistent with pneumonia. No evidence of pulmonary embolism was seen on computed tomography angiography (CTA) on admission. The patient is due for a work-up of pulmonary hypertension, including pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and may"

The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] admitted to the ICU with the following chief complaints: [list of chief complaints]. The patient has undergone several interventions and procedures, including bronchoscopy, arterial line placement, multi-lumen line placement, thoracentesis, and various medication infusions. The patient's vital signs have been monitored, and their respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently supported by mechanical ventilation, indicating acute respiratory failure. Continued respiratory support may be required, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Renal Failure: The patient's laboratory results indicate acute renal failure, as evidenced by elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output. Oliguria/anuria is present, and further evaluation and management of renal function are necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with PMHx of biventricular heart failure and moderate pulm
   hypertension presents with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia and DOE
   transferred to the MICU for hemoptysis following thoracentesis.
   .
   # Hemoptysis:  Concern for fistula created during the procedure.
   Patient was intubated on arrival to the MICU for airway protection and
   ease of bronchoscopy.
   - Bronchoscopy showed RLL bleeding, however not brisk, plan to perform
   bronchial blockade for tamponade of bleeding
   - IR on board, may require angiography if bleeding does not stop
   - Thoracic Surgery made aware as she may require chest tube placement
   or surgical intervention if hemostasis not achieved by bronchoscopy
   - Q 4h Hct
   - Monitor O2 sats overnight
   - Maintain intubated overnight
   .
   # Hypoxia/DOE:  Most likely secondary to volume overload.  Pt with
   known biventricular heart failure, pulm htn and new pleural effusion.
   Imaging was less consistent with PNA.  No evidence of PE on CTA on
   admission.  Pt is due for work-up of pulm hypertension including PFTs
   and may also benefit from trial of sildenafil.
   - Diuresis was initiated with lasix 40mg IV in am, then titrated up to
   80mg [**Hospital1 **] today.  Will hold off on diuresis overnight tonight as has
   potential to become hemodynamically unstable, may restart in the
   future.
   - Bronchoscopy showed secretions, will start on antibiotics,
   vanc/aztreonam/flagyl given penicillin allergy for possible HAP, send
   sputum cultures, trend fever curve and WBCs
   - continue to monitor strict i/os
   - Alb/atro nebs PRN
   .
   # Chest pain:  Most likely pleurtic in nature.  Resolved.  EKGs
   essentially unchanged, CE's ruled out and cardiac cath in [**10-28**] was
   normal.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Hold Aspirin, will hold metoprolol for now, and restart if
   hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypertension: hold toprol & lasix until hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Ulcerative Colitis: currently asymptomatic, continue home regimen
   - restart Asacol 800mg TID when taking PO
   .
   # Afib:  The patient was not anticoagulated previously secodnary to
   recent Dx of Duodenal Ulcer.  Will not start anticoagulation in the
   setting of acute bleed.
   - Hold toprol for now, will use IV lopressor as needed overnight.
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now, replete lytes PRN

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of biventricular heart failure and moderate pulmonary hypertension. She presented with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia, and dyspnea on exertion. She was transferred to the MICU for hemoptysis following thoracentesis.

The patient was intubated upon arrival to the MICU for airway protection and ease of bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy showed right lower lobe bleeding, but it was not brisk. The plan was to perform a bronchial blockade for tamponade of bleeding. Infrared (IR) is on board and may require angiography if the bleeding does not stop. Thoracic Surgery was made aware as she may require chest tube placement or surgical intervention if hemostasis is not achieved by bronchoscopy.

The patient's current conditions include hemoptysis, hypoxia/DOE, and chest pain. The assessment and plan indicate concern for a fistula created during the procedure. The patient is due for a work-up of pulmonary hypertension, including pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and may also benefit from a trial of sildenafil.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 78 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 104/48 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with PMHx of biventricular heart failure and moderate pulm
   hypertension presents with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia and DOE
   transferred to the MICU for hemoptysis following thoracentesis.
   .
   # Hemoptysis:  Concern for fistula created during the procedure.
   Patient was intubated on arrival to the MICU for airway protection and
   ease of bronchoscopy.
   - Bronchoscopy showed RLL bleeding, however not brisk, plan to perform
   bronchial blockade for tamponade of bleeding, will likely remove
   balloon today if remains stable
   - IR on board, may require angiography if bleeding does not stop
   - Thoracic Surgery made aware as she may require chest tube placement
   or surgical intervention if hemostasis not achieved by bronchoscopy
   - Continue Q 4h Hct
   - Monitor O2 sats
   - Maintain mechanical ventilation and wean after balloon removed
   .
   # Hypoxia/DOE:  Most likely secondary to volume overload.  Pt with
   known biventricular heart failure, pulm htn and new pleural effusion.
   Imaging was less consistent with PNA.  No evidence of PE on CTA on
   admission.  Pt is due for work-up of pulm hypertension including PFTs
   and may also benefit from trial of sildenafil.
   - Diuresis was initiated with lasix 40mg IV initially, then titrated up
   to 80mg [**Hospital1 **], on hold since admission to the MICU
   - Bronchoscopy showed secretions, continue vanc/aztreonam/flagyl given
   penicillin allergy for possible HAP, send sputum cultures, trend fever
   curve and WBCs
   - continue to monitor strict i/os
   - Alb/atro nebs PRN
   .
   # Hypotension:  CVP elevated.  Most likely cardiogenic failure.  Will
   continue levophed as needed, attempt to titrate. \
   - Consider diuresis with lasix drip for cardiogenic shock
   .
   # Chest pain:  Most likely pleurtic in nature.  Resolved.  EKGs
   essentially unchanged, CE's ruled out and cardiac cath in [**10-28**] was
   normal.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Hold Aspirin, will hold metoprolol for now, and restart when
   hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypertension: hold toprol & lasix until hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Ulcerative Colitis: currently asymptomatic, continue home regimen
   - restart Asacol 800mg TID when taking PO
   .
   # Afib:  The patient was not anticoagulated previously secodnary to
   recent Dx of Duodenal Ulcer.  Will not start anticoagulation in the
   setting of acute bleed.
   - Hold toprol for now, will use IV lopressor as needed overnight.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of biventricular heart failure and moderate pulmonary hypertension. The patient presented with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia, and dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and was transferred to the MICU for hemoptysis following thoracentesis.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Hemoptysis: The patient experienced hemoptysis following thoracentesis, and there is a concern for a fistula created during the procedure. The patient was intubated for airway protection and ease of bronchoscopy. A bronchoscopy showed right lower lobe bleeding, and a bronchial blockade was placed to tamponade the bleeding. The balloon may be removed today if the patient remains stable.

2. Hypoxia/DOE: The patient's hypoxia and DOE are most likely secondary to volume overload. The patient has known biventricular heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and a new pleural effusion. Imaging was less consistent with pneumonia, and there was no evidence of pulmonary embolism on computed tomography angiography (CTA) admission. The patient is due for a work-up of pulmonary hypertension including pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and may also benefit from a trial of sildenafil.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely cardiogenic in nature due to heart failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis and diastolic congestive heart failure. She was treated for an upper respiratory infection with azithromycin two weeks ago, but her symptoms of orthopnea and shortness of breath worsened after that. She was admitted to the hospital and initially placed on the floor, but then transferred to the MICU due to hypoxemia. The patient underwent a thoracentesis and experienced hemoptysis post-procedure. She was intubated and bronchoscoped, with a bronchial blocker placed in the right lower lobe. However, the blocker became dislodged a few hours later and had to be replaced via bronchoscopy, although no active bleeding was found. The patient has also been hypotensive overnight despite high central venous pressures up to 25. Levophed infusion has been weaned down.

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute on chronic diastolic CHF:  Lasix drip for diuresis
   hemoptisys:  may have been due to vascular injury with airway
   communication during thoracentisis - blocker in place.  Bronch today,
   if no bleeding, remove blocker.
   HOTN:  On leveophed, but likely due to sedation.
   Respiratory failure:  Is alkalotic, but breathing over rate.  Will try
   PSV once blocker is out
   UC: stable
   Afib:  currently HR controlled.
   PUD:  stable:
   no evidence of infection, so will stop IV antibiotics.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). She was previously treated for a urinary tract infection (URI) with Azithromycin two weeks ago. Since then, she has been experiencing worsening orthopnea and shortness of breath. She was admitted to the hospital with hypoxemia and initially placed on the floor. A thoracentesis was performed yesterday, following which she began experiencing hemoptysis. The patient was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU), intubated, and bronchoscoped. A bronchial blocker was placed in the right lower lobe (RLL), but it became dislodged a few hours later. It was replaced via bronchoscopy, although no active bleeding was found. The patient has also been hypotensive overnight despite high central venous pressures (CVPs) up to 25. Levophed has been weaned down.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 86 bpm with a range of 54-86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/52 mmHg to 136/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute with inspiration, oxygen saturation of 97%, and atrial fibrillation (AF) as the heart rhythm."

   62 y/o F with PMHx of biventricular heart failure and moderate pulm
   hypertension presents with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia and DOE
   transferred to the MICU for hemoptysis following thoracentesis.
   .
   # Hemoptysis:   Most likely secondary to pneumonic laceration during
   the thoracentesis.  Endobronchial balloon placed and removed yesterday
   afternoon.  Continues to require mechanical ventilation.
   - IR on board
   - Thoracic Surgery on board
   - Hct stable overnight, will check [**Hospital1 **] today
   - Monitor O2 sats
   - Attempt to wean mechanical ventilation following diuresis, will stop
   tube feeds as may be able to be extubated later today
   - On propofol for sedation, may be complicating hypotension, will
   attempt to wean today
   .
   # Hypoxia/DOE:  Most likely secondary to volume overload.  Pt with
   known biventricular heart failure, pulm htn and new pleural effusion.
   Imaging was less consistent with PNA.  No evidence of PE on CTA on
   admission.  Pt is due for work-up of pulm hypertension including PFTs
   and may also benefit from trial of sildenafil.
   - Continue lasix drip, negative only 400cc yesterday, goal of 1L today
   - Will not add back antibiotics as unlikely to be infectious given
   afebrile and no increase in WBC count, follow cultures, trend fever
   curve and WBCs and start as needed
   - continue to monitor strict i/os
   - Alb/atro nebs PRN
   .
   # Hypotension:  CVP elevated.  Most likely cardiogenic failure,
   worsened by sedation.  Will continue levophed as needed, attempt to
   titrate.
   -          Continue lasix drip today for volume removal in the setting
   of cardiogenic shock
   -          Check PM lytes
   -          Continue to attempt to wean sedation, may have to switch to
   fentanyl and midazolam
   .
   # Chest pain:  Most likely pleurtic in nature.  Resolved.  EKGs
   essentially unchanged, CE's ruled out and cardiac cath in [**10-28**] was
   normal.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Hold Aspirin, will hold metoprolol for now, and restart when
   hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypertension: hold toprol & lasix until hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Ulcerative Colitis: currently asymptomatic, continue home regimen
   - restart Asacol 800mg TID when taking PO
   .
   # Afib:  The patient was not anticoagulated previously secodnary to
   recent Dx of Duodenal Ulcer.  Will not start anticoagulation in the
   setting of acute bleed.
   - Hold toprol for now, will use IV lopressor as needed overnight.

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of biventricular heart failure and moderate pulmonary hypertension. She presented with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia, and dyspnea on exertion. She was transferred to the MICU for hemoptysis following thoracentesis.

The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including:

1. Hemoptysis: Most likely secondary to pneumonic laceration during the thoracentesis. An endobronchial balloon was placed and removed yesterday afternoon.

2. Hypoxia/DOE: Most likely secondary to volume overload. The patient has known biventricular heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and a new pleural effusion. Imaging was less consistent with pneumonia. No evidence of pulmonary embolism on computed tomography angiography (CTA) on admission. The patient is due for work-up of pulmonary hypertension including pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and may also benefit from a trial of sildenafil.

3. Hypotension: CVP elevated. Most likely cardiogenic failure, worsened by sedation. Will continue norepinephrine as needed, attempt to titrate. Continue lasix drip today for volume removal in the setting of cardiogenic shock.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with PMHx of biventricular heart failure and moderate pulm
   hypertension presents with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia and DOE
   transferred to the MICU for hemoptysis following thoracentesis.
   .
   # Hemoptysis:   Most likely secondary to pneumonic laceration during
   the thoracentesis.  Endobronchial balloon placed and removed yesterday
   afternoon.  Continues to require mechanical ventilation.
   - IR on board
   - Thoracic Surgery on board
   - Hct stable overnight, will check [**Hospital1 **] today
   - Monitor O2 sats
   - Attempt to wean mechanical ventilation following aggressive diuresis
   - On propofol for sedation, may be complicating hypotension, will
   attempt to wean today
   .
   # Hypoxia/DOE:  Most likely secondary to volume overload.  Pt with
   known biventricular heart failure, pulm htn and new pleural effusion.
   Imaging was less consistent with PNA.  No evidence of PE on CTA on
   admission.  Pt is due for work-up of pulm hypertension including PFTs
   and may also benefit from trial of sildenafil.
   - Continue lasix drip, negative only 400cc yesterday, goal of 1L today
   - Will not add back antibiotics as unlikely to be infectious given
   afebrile and no increase in WBC count, follow cultures, trend fever
   curve and WBCs and start as needed
   - continue to monitor strict i/os
   - Alb/atro nebs PRN
   .
   # Hypotension:  CVP elevated.  Most likely cardiogenic failure,
   worsened by sedation.  Will continue levophed as needed, attempt to
   titrate.
   -          Continue lasix drip today for volume removal in the setting
   of cardiogenic shock
   -          Check PM lytes
   -          Continue to attempt to wean sedation, may have to switch to
   fentanyl and midazolam
   .
   # Chest pain:  Most likely pleurtic in nature.  Resolved.  EKGs
   essentially unchanged, CE's ruled out and cardiac cath in [**10-28**] was
   normal.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Hold Aspirin, will hold metoprolol for now, and restart when
   hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypertension: hold toprol & lasix until hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Ulcerative Colitis: currently asymptomatic, continue home regimen
   - restart Asacol 800mg TID when taking PO
   .
   # Afib:  The patient was not anticoagulated previously secodnary to
   recent Dx of Duodenal Ulcer.  Will not start anticoagulation in the
   setting of acute bleed.
   - Hold toprol for now, will use IV lopressor as needed overnight.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications include:

1. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by oliguria/anuria (low urine output), electrolyte and fluid disorder, and peripheral edema. The patient's low potassium levels (hypokalemia) and sodium levels (hyponatremia) may be related to the renal failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension, which is not in shock. This could be due to cardiogenic failure worsened by sedation. The patient's elevated CVP (central venous pressure) suggests fluid overload, and the use of diuretics (Lasix) is recommended to remove excess fluid.

3. Hypoxia/Dyspnea on exertion (DOE): The patient's hypoxia and DOE are likely secondary to volume overload. The patient has known biventricular heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and a new pleural effusion. Imaging is less consistent with pneumonia, and there is no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) on admission. The patient may benefit from further work-up, including pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and a trial of sildenafil.

4. Hypothermia: The patient's current temperature is 37.2°C, indicating mild hypothermia.

5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be due to prolonged bed rest or other factors.

The patient also has hypoxia and dyspnea on exertion, most likely secondary to volume overload. The imaging was less consistent with pneumonia, and no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) was found on computed tomography angiography (CTA) on admission. The patient is due for work-up of pulmonary hypertension, including pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and may also benefit from a trial of sildenafil. 

The patient's blood pressure is low, and the central venous pressure (CVP) is elevated. This suggests"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, oliguria/anuria, electrolyte and fluid disorder, peripheral edema, hypokalemia, hypotension, hypothermia, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, with a tidal volume set at 500 mL and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O. The patient's blood pressure is 119/51 mmHg, heart rate is 111 bpm, respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 267 K/uL, low hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 112 mg/dL, low sodium level of 27 mg/dL, and elevated potassium level of 5.6 mEq/L.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory failure, along with low oxygen saturation and high FiO2 requirements, raises concern for ARDS. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygenation status and respiratory parameters is necessary.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at an increased risk for developing VAP. Surveillance cultures and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF) who was admitted with respiratory failure. She underwent a bronchial blocker removal yesterday and has been stable since then. The patient has been placed back on assisted ventilation after pressure support (PSV) overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's primary issue upon admission was respiratory failure, which seems to have improved with the use of PSV. However, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if the patient does not continue to improve or if any complications arise.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient had hemoptysis after thoracentesis but it has since resolved. This could be a sign of underlying lung pathology or complications from the procedure.
3. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF and it is mentioned that the cause could be diastolic dysfunction versus constrictive/restrictive cardiomyopathy. Proper management and diuresis should be continued to manage the CHF.
4. Right effusion: The patient has a right effusion which has been stable. Regular monitoring and management should be done to prevent any complications related to the effusion.
5. Extubation: The plan is to aim for extubation later today. Careful assessment and monitoring will be necessary to determine if the patient is ready for extubation and to prevent any post-extubation complications.
6. Potential infections"

   62 y/o F with PMHx of biventricular heart failure and moderate pulm
   hypertension presents with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia and DOE
   transferred to the MICU for hemoptysis following thoracentesis.
   .
   # Hemoptysis:   Most likely secondary to pneumonic laceration during
   the thoracentesis.  Endobronchial balloon placed and removed yesterday
   afternoon.  Continues to require mechanical ventilation.
   - IR on board
   - Thoracic Surgery on board
   - Hct stable overnight, will check [**Hospital1 **] today
   - Monitor O2 sats
   - Attempt to wean mechanical ventilation following diuresis, will stop
   tube feeds as may be able to be extubated later today
   - On propofol for sedation, may be complicating hypotension, will
   attempt to wean today
   .
   # Hypoxia/DOE:  Most likely secondary to volume overload.  Pt with
   known biventricular heart failure, pulm htn and new pleural effusion.
   Imaging was less consistent with PNA.  No evidence of PE on CTA on
   admission.  Pt is due for work-up of pulm hypertension including PFTs
   and may also benefit from trial of sildenafil.
   - Continue lasix drip, negative only 400cc yesterday, goal of 1L today
   - Will not add back antibiotics as unlikely to be infectious given
   afebrile and no increase in WBC count, follow cultures, trend fever
   curve and WBCs and start as needed
   - continue to monitor strict i/os
   - Alb/atro nebs PRN
   .
   # Hypotension:  CVP elevated.  Most likely cardiogenic failure,
   worsened by sedation.  Will continue levophed as needed, attempt to
   titrate.
   -          Continue lasix drip today for volume removal in the setting
   of cardiogenic shock
   -          Check PM lytes
   -          Continue to attempt to wean sedation, may have to switch to
   fentanyl and midazolam
   .
   # Chest pain:  Most likely pleurtic in nature.  Resolved.  EKGs
   essentially unchanged, CE's ruled out and cardiac cath in [**10-28**] was
   normal.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Hold Aspirin, will hold metoprolol for now, and restart when
   hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypertension: hold toprol & lasix until hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Ulcerative Colitis: currently asymptomatic, continue home regimen
   - restart Asacol 800mg TID when taking PO
   .
   # Afib:  The patient was not anticoagulated previously secodnary to
   recent Dx of Duodenal Ulcer.  Will not start anticoagulation in the
   setting of acute bleed.
   - Hold toprol for now, will use IV lopressor as needed overnight.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with PMHx of biventricular heart failure and moderate pulm
   hypertension presents with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia and DOE
   transferred to the MICU for hemoptysis following thoracentesis.
   .
   # Hemoptysis:   Most likely secondary to pneumonic laceration during
   the thoracentesis.  Endobronchial balloon placed and removed yesterday
   afternoon.  Continues to require mechanical ventilation.
   - Hct continues to be stable
   - Attempt to wean mechanical ventilation today following diuresis, will
   stop tube feeds as may be able to be extubated later today
   - On propofol for sedation, may be complicating hypotension, will
   attempt to wean today
   .
   # Hypoxia/DOE:  Worsening hypoxia this AM.  Most likely secondary to
   volume overload, however could be mucus plugging.  Pt with known
   biventricular heart failure, pulm htn and new pleural effusion. Imaging
   was less consistent with PNA.  No evidence of PE on CTA on admission.
   Pt is due for work-up of pulm hypertension including PFTs and may also
   benefit from trial of sildenafil.
   - Bronchoscopy today
   - Continue lasix drip, negative only 400cc yesterday, goal of at least
   1L today
   - Will not add back antibiotics as unlikely to be infectious given
   afebrile and no increase in WBC count, follow cultures, trend fever
   curve and WBCs and start as needed
   - continue to monitor strict i/os
   - Alb/atro nebs PRN
   - If the patient does not improve, will consider CTA for possible PE,
   although very unlikely
   .
   # Hypotension:  CVP elevated.  Most likely cardiogenic failure,
   worsened by sedation.  Will continue levophed as needed, attempt to
   titrate.
   -          Continue lasix drip today for volume removal in the setting
   of cardiogenic shock
   -          Check PM lytes
   -          Continue to attempt to wean sedation, may have to switch to
   fentanyl and midazolam
   .
   # Chest pain:  Most likely pleurtic in nature.  Resolved.  EKGs
   essentially unchanged, CE's ruled out and cardiac cath in [**10-28**] was
   normal.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Hold Aspirin, will hold metoprolol for now, and restart when
   hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Hypertension: hold toprol & lasix until hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Ulcerative Colitis: currently asymptomatic, continue home regimen
   - restart Asacol 800mg TID when taking PO
   .
   # Afib:  The patient was not anticoagulated previously secodnary to
   recent Dx of Duodenal Ulcer.  Will not start anticoagulation in the
   setting of acute bleed.
   - Hold toprol for now, will use IV lopressor as needed overnight.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of biventricular heart failure and moderate pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted to the MICU for hemoptysis following a thoracentesis and is currently requiring mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already on mechanical ventilation, indicating acute respiratory failure. The worsening hypoxia and dependence on CPAP/PSV mode suggest ongoing respiratory distress.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has oliguria/anuria and abnormal renal function tests (elevated BUN and creatinine), which indicate possible acute renal failure.

3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has hypokalemia (low potassium), hypotension (low blood pressure), and hyponatremia (low sodium), indicating electrolyte imbalances and fluid disorders.

4. Peripheral Edema: The patient has right-sided 2+ edema, suggesting peripheral edema.

5. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is 36.1°C (97°F), which is below the normal range, indicating hypothermia.

6. Impaired Skin Integrity: There is no specific mention of skin integrity issues in the provided information.

7. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's elevated CVP and hypotension suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock, potentially worsened by sedation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/57 to 69/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 set at 50%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg and is receiving fluids through various routes, including intravenous fluids, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and blood products. The patient has received a total of 2,710 mL of fluids since midnight, with an output of 2,710 mL through the urine.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 45. The plateau pressure is 18 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 170, and a base excess (BE) of -6 mEq/L.

The patient's laboratory values include a white blood cell (WBC) count of 8.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.0 g/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.4 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 151 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 134 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 3.5 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 98 mEq/L, glucose of 112 mg/dL, and magnesium (Mg++) of 1.7 mg/dL. The blood cultures were positive for gram-negative rods.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, oliguria/anuria, electrolyte and fluid disorder, peripheral edema, hypokalemia, hypotension (not in shock), hypothermia, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS).

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, respiratory distress, and potential infections due to the positive blood cultures."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with PMHx of biventricular heart failure and moderate pulm
   hypertension presents with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia and DOE
   transferred to the MICU for hemoptysis following thoracentesis.
   # Hemoptysis:   Most likely secondary to pneumonic laceration during
   the thoracentesis.  Endobronchial balloon placed and removed yesterday
   afternoon.  Continues to require mechanical ventilation.
   - Hct continues to be stable
   - Attempt to wean mechanical ventilation today following diuresis, will
   stop tube feeds as may be able to be extubated later today
   - On propofol for sedation, may be complicating hypotension, will
   attempt to wean today
   # Hypoxia/DOE:  Worsening hypoxia this AM.  Most likely secondary to
   volume overload, however could be mucus plugging.  Pt with known
   biventricular heart failure, pulm htn and new pleural effusion. Imaging
   was less consistent with PNA.  No evidence of PE on CTA on admission.
   Pt is due for work-up of pulm hypertension including PFTs and may also
   benefit from trial of sildenafil.
   - Bronchoscopy today
   - Continue lasix drip, negative only 400cc yesterday, goal of at least
   1L today
   - Will not add back antibiotics as unlikely to be infectious given
   afebrile and no increase in WBC count, follow cultures, trend fever
   curve and WBCs and start as needed
   - continue to monitor strict i/os
   - Alb/atro nebs PRN
   - If the patient does not improve, will consider CTA for possible PE,
   although very unlikely
   # Hypotension:  CVP elevated.  Most likely cardiogenic failure,
   worsened by sedation.  Will continue levophed as needed, attempt to
   titrate.
   -          Continue lasix drip today for volume removal in the setting
   of cardiogenic shock
   -          Check PM lytes
   -          Continue to attempt to wean sedation, may have to switch to
   fentanyl and midazolam
   # Chest pain:  Most likely pleurtic in nature.  Resolved.  EKGs
   essentially unchanged, CE's ruled out and cardiac cath in [**10-28**] was
   normal.
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   - Hold Aspirin, will hold metoprolol for now, and restart when
   hemodynamically stable
   # Hypertension: hold toprol & lasix until hemodynamically stable
   # Ulcerative Colitis: currently asymptomatic, continue home regimen
   - restart Asacol 800mg TID when taking PO
   # Afib:  The patient was not anticoagulated previously secodnary to
   recent Dx of Duodenal Ulcer.  Will not start anticoagulation in the
   setting of acute bleed.
   - Hold toprol for now, will use IV lopressor as needed overnight.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of biventricular heart failure and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
- She presented with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia, and dyspnea on exertion.
- The patient was transferred to the MICU for hemoptysis following thoracentesis.
- She has been requiring mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's Hct has been stable, and there have been attempts to wean mechanical ventilation today.
- She is on propofol for sedation, which may be complicating hypotension.
- The patient's hypoxia has worsened, and imaging does not suggest pneumonia.
- Bronchoscopy was performed today.
- Lasix drip has been continued, and tube feeds have been stopped for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).
- The patient's electrolytes should be monitored, and she may benefit from sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension.
- There are no signs of pulmonary embolism on computed tomography angiography (CTA).
- The patient's chest pain has resolved, and EKGs show no changes.

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of biventricular heart failure and moderate pulmonary hypertension. She presented with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia, and dyspnea on exertion, and was transferred to the MICU for hemoptysis following thoracentesis. The patient was previously intubated but is now extubated and awake, still requiring supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 116/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation. Her height is 63 inches, and her weight is not mentioned. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 913 mL and an output of 1980 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1067 mL.

The patient is receiving furosemide (Lasix) at a rate of 12 mg/hr to increase diuresis. She has been repleting potassium levels and started on insulin subcutaneously for elevated blood glucose levels. The patient complains only of a sore throat.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of anxiety. The patient underwent a bronchoscopic procedure at 12:00 PM on [**2108-1-12**], invasive ventilation was stopped at 02:30 PM, and an arterial line was stopped at 07:35 PM. The patient was successfully extubated without difficulty.

The patient's allergies include Lisinopril, which causes a rash and abdominal reaction; Kefzol (Cefazolin Sodium), resulting in hives; and Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics), leading to hives and nausea. The patient received Metronidazole and Aztreonam on [**2108-1-10**].

The patient is currently receiving Furosemide (Lasix) at a rate of 12 mg/hr. Other medications include insulin SS for elevated blood glucose levels and Ambien for sleep aid.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for respiratory failure, acute renal failure, oliguria/anuria, electrolyte & fluid disorder, peripheral edema, hypokalemia, hypotension, hypothermia, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS).

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (96.9°F) and 35.9°C (96.7°F), heart rate of 97 bpm (65-119 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 116/50 mmHg to 152/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (10-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 913 mL since midnight and output of 1,980 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,067 mL. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen with a FiO2 of 50% and is ventilated in PSV/SBT mode with a Vt of 533 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR of 8 breaths per minute, PEEP of 0 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 96%.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count ranging from 5.4 to 6.7 K/uL, hemoglobin levels between 8.7 and 9.7 g/dL, sodium levels between 133 and 135 mg/dL, potassium levels between 3.2 and 4.3 mEq/L, and blood glucose levels ranging from 101 to 158 mg/dL.

Radiology and imaging studies are pending, including a chest X-ray. Microbiology results from a urine culture on [**2108-1-11**] show the presence of Staphylococcus coagulase-negative organisms at a count of 10,000-100,000 organisms/mL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure indicates a potential risk of ongoing respiratory compromise, requiring close monitoring and appropriate ventilatory support.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's oliguria/anuria and elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, which may require further evaluation and management to preserve renal function.
3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's imbalanced electrolytes and fluid status pose a risk for complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
4. Peripheral Edema: The presence of peripheral edema indicates possible fluid overload, which could contribute to further renal dysfunction or cardiovascular issues.
5. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
6. Hypotension: The patient's low blood"

","The patient is a 63-year-old male who presented with respiratory failure. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, invasive ventilation, and arterial line placement. He was extubated yesterday and is currently on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula with PSV/SBT ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/87 to 152/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets. However, there are elevated levels of potassium (K+), bicarbonate (HCO3-), glucose, and slightly elevated levels of BUN and creatinine. The liver function tests are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear breath sounds with diminished breath sounds at the right base, indicating possible right lower lobe consolidation or effusion. The patient's extremities are warm and well-perfused.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: Given the presence of diminished breath sounds at the right base, there is a possibility of pneumonia, especially considering the patient's recent intubation and prolonged ICU stay.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheter use increase the risk of developing DVT. The patient's"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient was extubated yesterday and is doing well without further hemoptysis. 

The patient has several medical allergies, including Lisinopril (rash, abdominal pain), Kefzol (hives), and Sulfa (hives, nausea/vomiting). 

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including Pantoprazole (Protonix) and Furosemide (Lasix). 

The patient's medical, social, and family history remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted events and interventions mentioned in the note. 

The review of systems shows no hemoptysis, dyspnea, or abdominal pain. 

The vital signs show a temperature of 36.1°C (96.9°F), heart rate of 119 bpm (normal range 71-119 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 113/87 mmHg to 152/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute (normal range 10-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation. 

The fluid balance shows an input of 913 mL and an output of 1980 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1067 mL. 

The respiratory support indicates that the patient is on nasal cannula with oxygen delivery, using PSV/SBT mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 533 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and positive inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 13 cmH2O. The arterial blood gas (ABG) values show a pH of 7.50, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 138 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 31 mmHg. 

The physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress, with clear breath sounds at the right base. The patient has a warm skin and is attentive with oriented responses to verbal stimuli. 

The lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and kidney function. The blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there are slight variations in electrolyte levels. 

Assessment and plan include continued diuresis for hypoxemia and edema, restarting Lopressor for atrial fibrillation, and monitoring for potential complications related to acute renal failure and ulcerative colitis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include respiratory infections due to hypoxemia and prolonged mechanical ventilation, further deterioration of renal function, and potential exacerbation of ulcerative colitis."
