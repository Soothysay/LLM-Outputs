   1. Severe pancreatitis with peripancreatic stranding and fluid, but no
   pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst. Reactive inflammation in the
   descending colon.
   2. Small blush along the course of a mesenteric vessel may represent a
   tiny
   pseudoaneurysm at the inferior margins of the inflammatory change.
   However this is not along the course of the dominant abdominal aortic
   vessels.
   3. Multiple renal hypodensities, most of which represent cysts, but the

   Assessment and Plan
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   74yoM h/o HIV on HAART and EtOH abuse transfered from OSH with
   pancreatitis and altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with
   evidence of pseudocyst.  Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug
   reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH.  Cholelithiasis unlikely given
   unremarkable RUQ u/s.  TG 253.  Lipase normalizing.
   - NPO
   - IVF
   - hold HAART meds
   - pain meds
   - consider low rate enteric feeding to avoid bacterial translocation,
   place post pyloric Dobhoff
   - CT Abd/Pelvis
   #.  Respiratory failure: Now intubated after having an ABG with pH 7.27
   due to CO2 retention.
   - Currently on assist control, will wean per protocol as tolerated.
   #.  Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. Toxic-metabolic, especially given elevated Na.
   Also concern for EtOH withdrawal.  Could be neuroleptic malignant
   syndrome given altered mental status, low grade temp, some rigidity on
   exam, however no documented Haldol given.  Consider infectious source
   however negative workup so far at OSH (see below for futher
   discussion).  No evidence of hemorrhage or trauma on CT.  TSH normal.
   - re check CK
   - LP in am after reversal of INR
   - CT head
   #.  Leukocytosis -  Low grade fever, was on Zosyn at OSH. Opacity on
   CXR however CT suggests attelectasis.  Concern for infection vs
   pancreatitis.
   - Pan culture if febrile
   - UA
   - Hold Abx until clear source.
   .
   #.  Hypernatremia - Sodium elevated to 161 at OSH from admission Na of
   134.  Today value is 153, with a free water deficit of 4.7 liters.
   More likely a chonically rising elevation in Na, as it is unlikely that
   with aggressive fluid resuscitation with NS, there was a 30 pt increase
   in one day.
   - Getting D5 1/2 NS at 600ccs/hour.
   - Check [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - Do not rapidly correct > 12mEq/24hr
   .
   #.  EtOH Withdrawal - H/o daily EtOH has been receiving BZD, approx
   4-8mg in 24hrs.  Unknown if prior seizures or withdrawal.  H/o chornic
   decline.  Now with tachycardia and hypertension as evidence of
   withrawal, no apparant tremors.  Is now 5 days from initial
   hospitalization.  Would expect that if he has had withdrawal, it would
   be improving at this point in his course.
   - CIWA protocol with frequent monitoring and ativan prn
   - thaimine
   .
   #.  HIV - Diagnosed in [**2124**] and long-term HAART therapy, currently held
   given concern for pancreatitis.
   - Hold HAART temporarily
   - ID consult
   .
   #.  Coagulopathy - INR elevated to 5.4 at OSH on warfarin for a fib.
   Warfarin held and Vit K started.  No obvious bleeding.
   - Recheck coags
   - Hold Warfarin
   - Continue Vit K
   - FFP if active bleeding
   .
   #.  A fib - On Warfarin, currently held in the setting of
   subratherapeutic INR.  Episode of RVR that responded to IV dig and
   lopressor at OSH.  Currently on scheduled lopressor.
   - Continue IV Lopressor
   - Hold dig as it was newly started and monitory for effect of beta
   blocker
   - Follow INR
   - Hold warfarin
   .
   #.  Ileus - CT with evidence of ileus, here with abdominal distention.
   Likely [**12-28**] pancreatitis.
   - NPO
   - bowel rest

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART therapy and EtOH abuse, who was transferred from another hospital with pancreatitis and altered mental status. The patient has severe pancreatitis with evidence of pseudocyst formation on CT scan, likely secondary to EtOH abuse or drug reaction. The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, leading to intubation for respiratory failure due to CO2 retention. The patient's altered mental status is multifactorial, including toxic-metabolic causes, especially given the elevated sodium levels, concern for EtOH withdrawal, and potential neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

The patient also has leukocytosis with low-grade fever, opacities on chest X-ray suggestive of atelectasis, and concern for infection versus pancreatitis. There is hypernatremia with a chronic rise in sodium levels, and the patient is receiving D5 1/2 NS at 600ccs/hour. The patient's EtOH withdrawal symptoms are being managed with benzodiazepines. The patient's HIV diagnosis and long-term HAART therapy are on hold due to concern for pancreatitis. The patient has a coagulopathy with an elevated INR on warfarin for a fib, which is currently held.

The patient has atrial fibrillation, and there are concerns about possible complications such as stroke or thromboembolism. The patient has ileus likely secondary to severe pancreatitis."

   74yoM h/o HIV on HAART and EtOH abuse transfered from OSH with
   pancreatitis and altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with
   evidence of pseudocyst.  Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug
   reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH.  Cholelithiasis unlikely given
   unremarkable RUQ u/s.  TG 253.  Lipase normalizing.
   - NPO
   - IVF with D5W for correction of hypernatremia as he now appears
   euvolemic.
   - hold HAART meds
   - pain meds
   - Consult IR to have post-pyloric dobhoff placed to give low amounts of
   - Consult Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2269**] from Pancreatic service
   #.  Respiratory failure: Now intubated after having an ABG with pH 7.27
   due to CO2 retention.
   - Currently on assist control with failure to fully correct his
   acidemia.  Will begin with increasing RR to improve ventilation.  If
   that does not work could consider increasing tidal volumes.
   #.  Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.
   - re check CK
   - Now that INR normalized, can do an LP.  Will be good for CSF analysis
   and measurement of pressures.
   #.  Leukocytosis -  No clear source to date, not on antibiotics.
   Opacity on CXR however CT suggests atelectasis.  UA negative. Concern
   for infection vs pancreatitis.
   - Pan culture if febrile
   - Hold Abx until clear source.
   .
   #.  Hypernatremia - Sodium elevated to 161 at OSH from admission Na of
   134.  Today value is 153, with a free water deficit of 4.7 liters.
   More likely a chonically rising elevation in Na, as it is unlikely that
   with aggressive fluid resuscitation with NS, there was a 30 pt increase
   in one day.   Today he appears euvolemic, so we will give just free
   water to try to correct hypernatremia.
   - Will give D5W at 150ccs/hour.
   - Check [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - Do not rapidly correct > 12mEq/24hr
   .
   #.  EtOH Withdrawal - H/o daily EtOH and prior to intubation had been
   receiving BZD, approx 4-8mg in 24hrs.  Unknown if prior seizures or
   withdrawal.  H/o chornic decline.  We can reassess after his mental
   status improves, as he is currently intubated and sedated.

   given concern for pancreatitis.
   - Hold HAART temporarily.  We will try to contact his outpatient
   provider to gather added information.
   - ID consult
   .
   #.  Coagulopathy - INR elevated to 5.4 at OSH on warfarin for a fib.
   Warfarin held and Vit K started, his INR is now normalized.  No obvious
   bleeding.  Once he has been stabilized, we will consider restarting his
   warfarin.
   .
   #.  A fib - On Warfarin, currently held in the setting of
   subratherapeutic INR.  Episode of RVR that responded to IV dig and
   lopressor at OSH.  Currently on a labetalol gtt and well controlled.
   - Hold dig as it was newly started and monitor for effect of beta
   blocker

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART therapy and ethanol abuse, who was transferred from another hospital with pancreatitis and altered mental status. He has severe pancreatitis with peripancreatic stranding and fluid, but no pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst. There is also evidence of reactive inflammation in the descending colon, a tiny pseudoaneurysm along the course of a mesenteric vessel, and multiple renal hypodensities representing cysts. The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure, and his mental status is likely multifactorial with ventriculomegaly and possible communicating hydrocephalus. He has leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and a history of chronic EtOH abuse with potential withdrawal. His INR is normalized, but he has coagulopathy and atrial fibrillation. The patient has ileus and abdominal distention, and his condition requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and an opacity on CXR suggesting atelectasis. There is concern for infection versus pancreatitis.
2. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia with a free water deficit of 4.7 liters, which needs to be corrected carefully.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-inch tall individual with severe pancreatitis, fluid and stranding in the colon, ventriculomegaly, and central atrophy or communicating hydrocephalus. The patient has been receiving aggressive fluids for pancreatitis and is currently on invasive ventilation and arterial line monitoring. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status. Laboratory results indicate electrolyte imbalances and elevated lipase levels. Imaging studies reveal severe pancreatitis with peripancreatic stranding and fluid, as well as a possible tiny pseudoaneurysm along a mesenteric vessel. The patient has been diagnosed with an electrolyte and fluid disorder, atrial fibrillation, delirium/confusion, and acute pancreatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: Severe pancreatitis can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst formation, infected necrosis, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
2. Pseudoaneurysm: The presence of a tiny pseudoaneurysm along a mesenteric vessel may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: This cardiac arrhythmia can result in reduced cardiac output, embolic events, and an increased risk of thromboembolism.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's laboratory results indicate imbalances in sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels. These imbalances can affect"

The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He underwent a lumbar puncture and pan culture, with the CSF HSV test pending. His electrolyte and fluid disorder, atrial fibrillation, delirium/confusion, and acute pancreatitis are being managed in the ICU.

24-hour events include a lumbar puncture and pan culture. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 99/55 to 123/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600cc, respiratory support, and oxygen delivery device through an endotracheal tube.

The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (17.2-18.4 K/uL), low platelet count (365-377 K/uL), high triglycerides (515 mg/dL), elevated cholesterol (324 mg/dL), and abnormal kidney function with creatinine levels ranging from 0.9-1.1 mg/dL. The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range.

   .
   #.  Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with
   evidence of pseudocyst.  Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug
   reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH.  Cholelithiasis unlikely given
   unremarkable RUQ u/s.  TG 253.  Lipase normalizing.
   - NPO
   - IVF with D5W for correction of hypernatremia as he now appears
   euvolemic.
   - hold HAART meds
   - pain meds
   - Consult IR to have post-pyloric dobhoff placed to give low amounts of
   - Consult Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2269**] from Pancreatic service
   #.  Respiratory failure: Now intubated after having an ABG with pH 7.27
   due to CO2 retention.
   - Currently on assist control with failure to fully correct his
   acidemia.  Will begin with increasing RR to improve ventilation.  If
   that does not work could consider increasing tidal volumes.
   #.  Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.
   - re check CK
   - Now that INR normalized, can do an LP.  Will be good for CSF analysis
   and measurement of pressures.
   #.  Leukocytosis -  No clear source to date, not on antibiotics.
   Opacity on CXR however CT suggests atelectasis.  UA negative. Concern
   for infection vs pancreatitis.
   - Pan culture if febrile
   - Hold Abx until clear source.
   .
   #.  Hypernatremia - Sodium elevated to 161 at OSH from admission Na of
   134.  Today value is 153, with a free water deficit of 4.7 liters.
   More likely a chonically rising elevation in Na, as it is unlikely that
   with aggressive fluid resuscitation with NS, there was a 30 pt increase
   in one day.   Today he appears euvolemic, so we will give just free
   water to try to correct hypernatremia.
   - Will give D5W at 150ccs/hour.
   - Check [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - Do not rapidly correct > 12mEq/24hr
   .
   #.  EtOH Withdrawal - H/o daily EtOH and prior to intubation had been
   receiving BZD, approx 4-8mg in 24hrs.  Unknown if prior seizures or
   withdrawal.  H/o chornic decline.  We can reassess after his mental
   status improves, as he is currently intubated and sedated.

   #.  HIV - Diagnosed in [**2124**] and long-term HAART therapy, currently held
   given concern for pancreatitis.
   - Hold HAART temporarily.  We will try to contact his outpatient
   provider to gather added information.
   - ID consult
   .
   #.  Coagulopathy - INR elevated to 5.4 at OSH on warfarin for a fib.
   Warfarin held and Vit K started, his INR is now normalized.  No obvious
   bleeding.  Once he has been stabilized, we will consider restarting his
   warfarin.
   .
   #.  A fib - On Warfarin, currently held in the setting of
   subratherapeutic INR.  Episode of RVR that responded to IV dig and
   lopressor at OSH.  Currently on a labetalol gtt and well controlled.
   - Hold dig as it was newly started and monitor for effect of beta
   blocker
   - Follow INR
   - Hold warfarin

 Has had CT with evidence of ileus and abdominal distention

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART therapy and EtOH abuse. He was transferred from another hospital with pancreatitis and altered mental status. The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, electrolyte & fluid disorder, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), delirium/confusion, and acute pancreatitis.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to an ABG with pH 7.27 due to CO2 retention. He is currently on assist control ventilation, but his acidemia has not fully corrected. The plan is to increase the respiratory rate to improve ventilation. If that does not work, increasing tidal volumes may be considered.

2. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient has hypernatremia with a free water deficit of 4.7 liters. The sodium levels have been elevated from admission Na of 134 to 161 at OSH, and today's value is 153. The plan is to give D5W at 150cc/hour to correct hypernatremia. The free water deficit will be corrected slowly over 24 hours, not exceeding a 12mEq/24hr change in sodium levels.

3. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient was on warfarin for a fib, which was held due to subtherapeutic INR. His INR is now normalized. Once stabilized, we will consider restarting"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART therapy and EtOH abuse, who was transferred from another hospital with pancreatitis and altered mental status. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, atrial fibrillation, delirium/confusion, severe pancreatitis with peripancreatic stranding and fluid, but no pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst, and multiple renal hypodensities representing cysts.

The patient's assessment and plan include:
1. Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with evidence of pseudocyst. Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH. Cholelithiasis unlikely given unremarkable RUQ u/s. Lipase normalizing.
2. Respiratory failure: Now intubated after having an ABG with pH 7.27 due to CO2 retention. Continued to be acidotic at 7.3 so tidal volume increased to 760 and CO2 slightly improved to 42 this am, pH 7.31.
3. Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly, out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.
4. Leukocytosis - No"

   - consider re-imaging his abdomen to see if any improvement in
   pancreatitis
   # Dropping hematocrit
 Unclear source as guiac
s negative per nursing
   and no clear blood loss anywhere. Could be hemodilutional as overall
   trend has been downwards since admission and is overall 17L positive.
   #.  Respiratory failure: ABG has improved, is less CO2 and pH is better
   yesterday after giving more fluids, so could have been intravascular
   volume down leading to significant amt of dead space. Will continue to
   try to keep up with his volume status today with normal saline.
   - SBT and try to wean from vent
   #.  Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.
   --F/u Crypto and HSV from PCR
   --Will try to wean sedation today
   #.  Leukocytosis -  No clear source to date, not on antibiotics.
   Opacity on CXR however CT suggests atelectasis.  UA negative. Concern
   for infection vs pancreatitis.
   - PICC line has been pulled and has new central line
   - Pan culture if febrile
 cultures negative to date
   - Continue to hold Abx until clear source

   #.  Hypernatremia
 Had hypovolemic hypernatremia picture on
   presentation with elevated Uosm and low UNa. Now no longer
   hypernatremic

   #.  EtOH Withdrawal - H/o daily EtOH and prior to intubation had been
   receiving BZD, approx 4-8mg in 24hrs.  Unknown if prior seizures or
   withdrawal.  H/o chronic decline.  We can reassess after his mental
   status improves, as he is currently intubated and sedated.
   - thiamine, multivitamins, folate qday
   - continue sedation Versed as is for now

   #.  HIV - Diagnosed in [**2124**] and long-term HAART therapy, currently held
   given concern for pancreatitis.
   - Currently holding HAART. Was taking Combivir/Sustiva before
   admission. Will consult ID about the need to start his therapy, given
   that it could have been implicated in the pancreatitis

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV, EtOH abuse, and chronic decline. He was transferred from another hospital with pancreatitis and altered mental status. The patient has severe pancreatitis, likely secondary to EtOH abuse or drug reaction, with evidence of pseudocyst on CT. He also has respiratory failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, atrial fibrillation, delirium/confusion, and leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's Hct is dropping, which may indicate anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This may be due to hypovolemia or other factors.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. ABG results have improved with fluid administration, suggesting intravascular volume depletion.
4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient initially had hypernatremia, but it has resolved. He now requires careful monitoring and management of his electrolyte levels.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which requires monitoring and possible anticoagulation.
6. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status is multifactorial, likely due to progressive decline, moderate ventriculomegaly, and chronic process.

   - NPO for now though
   - hold HAART meds
   - pain meds with Fentanyl
   - consider re-imaging his abdomen to see if any improvement in
   pancreatitis
   # Dropping hematocrit
 Unclear source as guiac
s negative per nursing
   and no clear blood loss anywhere. Could be hemodilutional as overall
   trend has been downwards since admission and is overall 17L positive.
   - Trend Hct this pm
   #.  Respiratory failure: ABG has improved, is less CO2 and pH is better
   yesterday after giving more fluids, so could have been intravascular
   volume down leading to significant amt of dead space.
   - SBT and try to wean from vent
   #.  Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.
   --F/u Crypto and HSV from PCR
   --Will try to wean sedation today
   #.  Leukocytosis -  No clear source to date, not on antibiotics.
   Opacity on CXR however CT suggests atelectasis.  UA negative. Concern
   for infection vs pancreatitis.

   admission. Will consult ID about the need to start his therapy, given
   that it could have been implicated in the pancreatitis
   #.  A fib - On Warfarin, currently held in the setting of
   subratherapeutic INR, but his coagulopathy has now normalized.
   .  Episode of RVR that responded to IV dig and lopressor at OSH.
   Currently on a labetalol gtt and well controlled.
   - Will consider adding back Coumadin now that subTx INR, but unclear
   whether necessary in setting of acute illness with increased risk of
   bleed with higher INR
   - Hold dig as it was newly started and monitor for effect of beta
   blocker
   - Follow INR
   - Hold warfarin

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV, EtOH abuse, and pancreatitis. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, altered mental status, and septic shock. The patient has multiple medical complications including anemia, hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, atrial fibrillation, pancreatitis, delirium, and ileus. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition remains unstable, and he requires close monitoring and management of his various medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pseudocysts, abscesses, and infected necrotizing pancreatitis.
2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status may be due to multiple factors including EtOH withdrawal, sepsis, or underlying dementia.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress to severe ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) if not properly managed.
4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ failure.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has imbalances in sodium, chloride, magnesium, and phosphate levels, which can affect various bodily functions.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's irregular heart rhythm can increase the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events.

","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Based on the provided progress note, the following are the summarized information and potential medical complications:

Summary of Information:
- The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note.
- The patient underwent several interventions, including the placement of an internal jugular (IJ) line, removal of a percutaneous catheterization (PICC) line, and insertion of a Dobhoff tube into the stomach.
- The patient responded positively to a fluid bolus of D5 Bicarb and monitoring of urine output (UOP).
- The patient's sodium level decreased to 140 after receiving 5L of D5W, while chloride levels remained high at 112.
- A family meeting was set up to discuss the goals of care.
- The patient has a history of mesenteric pseudoaneurysm and is experiencing a drop in hemoglobin concentration (hct), with negative guiac results.
- The patient requires magnesium and phosphate supplementation.
- The patient was switched to levophed support.
- The patient is sedated on fentanyl and versed, breathing synchronously with the ventilator, and displaying withdrawal symptoms such as sternal rub and intermittent opening of eyes to noxious stimuli. Prior head CT imaging has been done.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation (Afib) is rate-controlled and stable, with an INR of 1.2. Warfarin has been held, and further monitoring is planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating acute respiratory failure. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and a plateau pressure of 13 cmH2O. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 300, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) deferred due to lack of spontaneous respiration. These parameters indicate the need for careful monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient's sodium level has decreased to 140 after receiving D5W, indicating possible hyponatremia. The chloride level remains elevated at 112, which may suggest hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 5,976 mL and output of 2,660 mL, with positive fluid balance of 3,316 mL over the past 24 hours. Close monitoring of fluid administration and electrolyte levels is necessary to prevent further imbalances.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin"

   74yoM h/o HIV on HAART and EtOH abuse transfered from OSH with
   pancreatitis and altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with
   evidence of pseudocyst.  Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug
   reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH.  Cholelithiasis unlikely given
   unremarkable RUQ u/s.  Lipase normalizing.
   [**Last Name (un) 1369**]
s criteria significant for age, WBC
s and LDH on presentation
   and Hct drop, base deficit, and fluid sequestration at 48hrs. With
   these six criteria, has 40% chance mortality.
   - Pt on schedule for IR guided placement of Dobhoff into jejunum, will
   then f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2269**] and start feedings per their recs.
   - NPO for now though
   - hold HAART meds
   - pain meds with Fentanyl
   - consider re-imaging his abdomen to see if any improvement in
   pancreatitis
   # Dropping hematocrit
 Unclear source as guiac
s negative per nursing
   and no clear blood loss anywhere.
   #.  Respiratory failure: ABG has improved, is less CO2 and pH is better
   yesterday after giving more fluids, so could have been intravascular
   volume down leading to significant amt of dead space. Will continue to
   try to keep up with his volume status today with normal saline.
   #.  Altered mental status - Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.
   - re check CK
   --F/u Crypto and HSV from PCR
   --Continue sedation with Fentanyl Versed for now until less acidotic
   and underlying medical condition appears to improve, then will consider
   decreasing sedation
   #.  Leukocytosis -  No clear source to date, not on antibiotics.
   Opacity on CXR however CT suggests atelectasis.  UA negative. Concern
   for infection vs pancreatitis.
   - Pan culture if febrile
 cultures negative to date
   - Continue to hold Abx until clear source
   - Pull PICC line from OSH and will need to have central line placed
   today
   .
   #.  Hypernatremia
 Had hypovolemic hypernatremia picture on
   presentation with elevated Uosm and low UNa. Sodium improving slowly,
   is 147 today. Wt is 84kg with free H20 deficit 2.5L. Appears euvolemic
   now.
   - Will give D5W at 150ccs/hour.
   - Check [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
   - Do not rapidly correct > 12mEq/24hr
   .
   #.  EtOH Withdrawal - H/o daily EtOH and prior to intubation had been
   receiving BZD, approx 4-8mg in 24hrs.  Unknown if prior seizures or
   withdrawal.  H/o chronic decline.  We can reassess after his mental
   status improves, as he is currently intubated and sedated.
   - thiamine, multivitamins, folate qday
   - continue sedation Versed as is for now
   .
   #.  HIV - Diagnosed in [**2124**] and long-term HAART therapy, currently held
   given concern for pancreatitis.
   - Currently holding HAART. Was taking Combivir/Sustiva before
   admission. Will consult ID about the need to start his therapy, given
   that it could have been implicated in the pancreatitis
   #.  A fib - On Warfarin, currently held in the setting of
   subratherapeutic INR, but his coagulopathy has now normalized.
   .  Episode of RVR that responded to IV dig and lopressor at OSH.
   Currently on a labetalol gtt and well controlled.
   - Will consider adding back Coumadin now that subTx INR, but unclear
   whether necessary in setting of acute illness with increased risk of
   bleed with higher INR
   - Hold dig as it was newly started and monitor for effect of beta
   blocker
   - Follow INR
   - Hold warfarin
   .
   #.  Ileus
 Has had CT with evidence of ileus and abdominal distention
   on exam.  Likely due to pancreatitis.  [**Month (only) 51**] improve with dobhoff for
   decompression.  We will continue to monitor.
   - Place Dobhoff into jejunum and will start light TF
   #.  FEN: NPO
   - lytes [**Hospital1 7**], replete as needed
   - can begin low-dose tube-feeds after dobhoff placement today
   .
   #.  PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots and SC heparin.
   -Bowel regimen not needed currently.
   -Pain management with fentanyl.
   .
   #.  ACCESS: PIV's, PICC -> plan is to leave outside PICC for now. Art
   line on R
   .
   #.  CODE STATUS: Per report, DNR, ok to intubate but he has said he
   would like a
dignified death
 and does not want prolonged mechanical
   ventilation.  Will clarify with his son.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART and EtOH abuse who presented to the ICU with pancreatitis, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. He has multiple comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, hypernatremia, and possible ileus. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including severe pancreatitis with evidence of pseudocyst formation, delirium/confusion, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), electrolyte & fluid disorder, atrial fibrillation, and possible mesenteric pseudoaneurysm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe Pancreatitis: The patient has severe pancreatitis with evidence of pseudocyst formation. Complications of pancreatitis can include infected pancreatic necrosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), organ failure, and death.
2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's altered mental status may be due to multiple factors such as EtOH withdrawal, sepsis, hypoxia, or medication effects. Delirium can progress to coma and increase the risk of complications like pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE).
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which can be due to various causes like pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or exacerbation of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This condition can lead to"

   74yoM h/o HIV on HAART and EtOH abuse transfered from OSH with
   pancreatitis and altered mental status, continues to be intubated and
   altered, but is slowly improving in his responsiveness to outside
   stimuli.
   #.  Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with
   evidence of pseudocyst.  Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug
   reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH.  Cholelithiasis unlikely given
   unremarkable RUQ u/s.  Lipase has been normal through admission.
   [**Last Name (un) 1369**]
s criteria significant for age, WBC
s and LDH on presentation
   and Hct drop, base deficit, and fluid sequestration at 48hrs. With
   these six criteria, has 40% chance mortality.
   --F/u with Pancreas team re: starting jejunal feedings now that he has
   post pyloric Dobhoff tube
   --hold HAART meds per conversation with pt's PCP/ID MD.
   --pain meds with Fentanyl
   --If clinically deteriorate, consider re-imaging
   # Dropping hematocrit
 Hct seen to drop yesterday from 27's to 24's in
   context of overall LOS 17L net positive. Was stable through the day at
   24. No obvious signs of bleeding and no gross changes in vital signs.
   --Pm Hct this afternoon and watch
   --Hold on transfusions for now
   # Fluid status
Is 17L positive through LOS. Will hold off on
   maintenance or bolus fluids for now, watch UOP and vitals and bolus
   small amts of NS prn.
   #.  Respiratory failure: ABG is stable for 2days now. Signs of fluid
   overload on CXR yesterday but no change in his respiratory status.
   --SBT today
   #.  Altered mental status-- Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.
   --F/u Crypto and HSV from PCR
   --Will continue to wean sedation today
   #.  Leukocytosis -  No clear source to date, not on antibiotics. Likely
   from pancreatitis itself, and is trending down. Still with low grade
   fever yesterday 100.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV, alcohol abuse, and acute pancreatitis. He is currently intubated and in the ICU due to altered mental status. The patient has several medical complications that require monitoring and management.

1. Acute pancreatitis: The patient has severe pancreatitis with evidence of pseudocyst formation. The etiology is likely secondary to alcohol abuse rather than drug reaction. HAART therapy for HIV has been held due to concern for pancreatitis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, but his ABG is stable for the past two days. There are signs of fluid overload on the CXR, but no change in respiratory status. A SBT (Spontaneous Breathing Trial) is planned today.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is likely multifactorial and has been progressively declining over the past year. A CT scan shows moderate ventriculomegaly, which is concerning for communicating hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH levels are normal.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with no clear source identified. It is likely related to pancreatitis itself and is trending down. The patient has a low-grade fever.

5. HIV: The patient was diagnosed with HIV in [**2124**] and has been on long-term HAART therapy, currently held due to acute illness."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART therapy and alcohol abuse. He was admitted with pancreatitis and altered mental status. He continues to be intubated and altered but is slowly improving in responsiveness.
- The patient has severe pancreatitis, as evidenced by CT scan findings of pseudocyst. The etiology is likely secondary to EtOH abuse or drug reaction, and HAART therapy is being held.
- The patient's hematocrit has dropped from the 27's to 24's, which is concerning for ongoing blood loss or fluid sequestration. No obvious signs of bleeding are present.
- The patient's respiratory status has stabilized, and there are no signs of fluid overload. A swallowing tube (Dobhoff) has been placed for jejunal feedings.
- The patient's altered mental status is likely multifactorial, with a possible contributing factor being moderate ventriculomegaly on CT scan, indicating communicating hydrocephalus or a chronic process. Further investigation is needed, including follow-up with Cryptococcus and HSV PCR tests.
- The patient's leukocytosis is trending down and is likely due to pancreatitis itself. There is a low-grade fever present, and surveillance cultures are being obtained.
- The patient has a history of daily EtOH abuse and may be at risk for withdrawal or seizures."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART and EtOH abuse. He was transferred from another hospital with pancreatitis and altered mental status. The patient remains intubated but is slowly improving in responsiveness. 

The patient's current medical conditions include severe pancreatitis with evidence of pseudocyst, altered mental status, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, HIV infection with HAART therapy held due to pancreatitis, and possible communicating hydrocephalus.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe pancreatitis with evidence of pseudocyst formation. Complications of pancreatitis can include infection, necrosis, bleeding, and organ failure.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support due to respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to the patient's altered mental status. Potential complications include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, and ventilator-induced lung injury.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to multiple factors including the underlying HIV infection, pancreatitis, and possible communicating hydrocephalus. Monitoring for further decline in mental status is important, and sedation weaning should be done cautiously.

4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is trending upwards, indicating an ongoing inflammatory response. In the absence of a clear source, it"

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART therapy and EtOH abuse, admitted with pancreatitis and altered mental status. He is currently intubated and sedated, but slowly improving in responsiveness. The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including severe pancreatitis with evidence of pseudocyst, respiratory failure with evidence of fluid overload, altered mental status possibly due to multifactorial causes, leukocytosis likely secondary to pancreatitis, HIV infection currently on hold due to pancreatitis, and a central line on the right side placed yesterday.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 69/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is hemodynamically stable and able to wean off pressor overnight. The arterial blood gas (ABG) is stable, but there is evidence of fluid overload on chest X-ray. The patient's hematocrit trend is down but now stable.

The patient has several pending issues, including a family meeting planned for today at 4 pm to discuss code status, disposition, and emergency contact information. The patient's code status is currently do not resuscitate (DNR) with permission for intubation, but he prefers a dignified death without prolonged mechanical ventilation. The patient's disposition is pending improvement in mental status.

   Disposition:
","The patient's daily progress note indicates that they are currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. They have a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, HIV/AIDS, anemia, hypotension, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), leukocytosis, and atrial fibrillation. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.3 C (101 F), heart rate within the normal range at 84 bpm, blood pressure slightly low at 97/59 mmHg, respiratory rate within normal limits at 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter.

In terms of fluid balance, the total fluid input is 2,171 mL and total fluid output is 2,340 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -169 mL. The urine output is 1,040 mL, NG output is 1,300 mL, and stool output is not documented.

The patient is receiving various medications, including norepinephrine, fentanyl, and midazolam. They are also on a ventilator with settings such as a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and spontaneous ventilation not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 18.4 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) of 8.3 g/dL, elevated blood glucose level of 147 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests including elevated ALT and AST. Other lab results indicate normal kidney function with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL.

The patient's care plan includes managing pancreatitis, HIV/AIDS, anemia, hypotension, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is on a full enteral nutrition regimen and is being monitored closely for glycemic control. The patient has an arterial line and multi-lumen line in place. Prophylactic measures are being taken for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

It is important to note that the patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) status."

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   74yoM h/o HIV on HAART and EtOH abuse transfered from OSH with
   pancreatitis and altered mental status, continues to be intubated and
   altered, but is slowly improving in his responsiveness to outside
   stimuli.
   #.  Pancreatitis - Severe pancreatitis as demonstrated on CT with
   evidence of pseudocyst.  Etiology likely secondary to EtOH vs drug
   reaction, HAART therapy held at OSH.  Cholelithiasis unlikely given
   unremarkable RUQ u/s.  Lipase has been normal through admission.
   [**Last Name (un) 2245**] criteria:  40% chance mortality.
   --Continue tube feeds with goal 60cc/hr as tolerated
   --hold HAART meds per conversation with pt's PCP/ID MD.
   --pain control  with Fentanyl
   --If clinically deteriorates, consider re-imaging
   # Dropping hematocrit
 Hct trend down but now stable.  Hemodynamically
   stable and able to wean off presssor overnight.  No gross bleeding
   --Have stopped lab draws, so no more monitoring of Hct
   #.  Respiratory failure: ABG stable. Evidence of fluid overload on CXR
   but stable respiratory status.
   --Keep on vent as
   #.  Altered mental status-- Likely multifactorial and h/o progressive
   decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly,
   out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating
   hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal.  CSF negative.
   --Will continue to wean sedation today aand reassess mental status
   #.  Leukocytosis -  Trending upwards without clear source to date, not
   on antibiotics. Still with low grade fever yesterday 100.  Cultures
   negative to date.  Likely from pancreatitis.
   - Surveillance Cx's q3 days --> next [**10-3**]
   - Continue to hold Abx until clear source
   #.  HIV - Diagnosed in [**2124**] and long-term HAART therapy, currently held
   given concern for pancreatitis.
   - Currently holding HAART. Was taking Combivir/Sustiva before
   admission.
   - Spoke with ID PCP who deferred initiating HAART to us, but was ok
   with not starting it during acute illness
   #.  FEN: Start enteral feeds through Dobhoff
   - ISS
   - lytes [**Hospital1 7**], replete as needed
   #.  PPX:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots and SC heparin.
   -Bowel regimen not needed currently.
   -Pain management with fentanyl, will try to wean
   #.  ACCESS: PIV's, Central line on R placed yesterday.  Art line on R
   #.  CODE STATUS: Per report, DNR, ok to intubate but he has said he
   would like a

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV, alcohol abuse, and pancreatitis. He was transferred to the ICU with acute respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation.

Assessment:
1. Pancreatitis: Severe pancreatitis with evidence of pseudocyst on CT scan. Etiology likely secondary to EtOH abuse vs drug reaction. HAART therapy held.
2. HIV: Diagnosed in [**2124**]. Long-term HAART therapy, currently held due to concern for pancreatitis.
3. Anemia: Trending downwards but still stable. No gross bleeding, so no more monitoring of Hct.
4. Respiratory failure: ABG stable. Evidence of fluid overload on CXR but stable respiratory status.
5. Altered mental status: Likely multifactorial and progressive decline for one year. CT scan showed moderate ventriculomegaly, out-of-proportion to sulcal enlargement, concerning for communicating hydrocephalus or a chronic process. TSH normal. CSF negative.
6. Leukocytosis: Trending upwards without clear source to date, not on antibiotics. Still with low-grade fever yesterday. Cultures negative to date. Likely from pancreatitis.
7. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): Hemodynamically stable and able to wean off pressor overnight.
8. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Heart rhythm A Flut (Atrial Flutter).

Plan:
1. Continue tube feeds with goal 60cc/hr as tolerated.
2. Hold HAART meds per conversation with pt's PCP/ID MD.
3. Pain control with Fentanyl.
4. If clinically deteriorates, consider re-imaging.
5. Wean sedation today and reassess mental status.
6. Surveillance Cx's q3 days --> next [**10-3**].
7. Continue to hold Abx until clear source.
8. Start enteral feeds through Dobhoff.
9. ISS, lytes [**Hospital1 7**], replete as needed.
10. DVT ppx with pneumoboots and SC heparin.
11. Bowel regimen not needed currently.
12. Pain management with fentanyl, will try to wean.
13. PIV's, Central line on R placed yesterday. Art line on R.
14. Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate).
15. ICU care pending improvement in mental status."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART and EtOH abuse who was transferred from another hospital with pancreatitis and altered mental status. The patient continues to be intubated and altered but is slowly improving in responsiveness to outside stimuli.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/59 mmHg to 91/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 14 mmHg and fluid balance with a total input of 2,171 mL and output of 2,340 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 169 mL since the last measurement.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 600 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided in the note.

The patient's laboratory values indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 18.4 to 18.2 thousand cells/mm³, elevated glucose levels ranging from 126 to 147 mg/dL, and elevated lactate levels at 0.8 mmol/L. Other lab results are within normal ranges or do not show significant abnormalities.

The patient has a history of acute pancreatitis, HIV, anemia, hypotension, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and the family has agreed to terminal extubation and making the patient a comfort measure only (CMO) patient upon the arrival of the son from [Name (NI) 9091] on [Name (NI) 1117].

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Infection: The patient has a fever of 38.3°C, indicating a possible infection. The presence of leukocytosis and Gram-positive cocci in clusters suggests a potential bacterial infection.

2. Fluid imbalance: The negative fluid balance of 169 mL may indicate inadequate fluid resuscitation or ongoing fluid losses, which can lead to hypotension and organ dysfunction.

3. Respiratory complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which carries its own risks such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma due to high tidal volumes or pressures.

4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure readings are relatively low, and the use of nore"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of HIV, alcohol abuse, and acute pancreatitis. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. He is receiving norepinephrine and fentanyl/versed infusions. His vital signs include a temperature of 102.2°F, heart rate of 138 bpm, blood pressure of 132/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's labs show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 18.4 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's HIV status is positive, and he has a history of EtOH abuse. The family has decided to terminate extubation and make him a comfort measure-only patient. Unnecessary medications have been stopped, and the plan is to continue on pressors and minimal sedation. The patient's son is expected to arrive soon.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. There is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.
