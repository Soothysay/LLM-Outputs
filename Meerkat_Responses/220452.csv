   71 y/o man with PSC complicated by cirrhosis with known esophageal
   varices presenting with melanic stools and hct drop from esophageal
   variceal bleed s/p banding on [**1-3**] who now is transferred back to the
   ICU in setting of hematemesis.
   .
   # GI bleeding: EGD performed on initial transfer to [**Hospital1 54**] on [**1-3**]
   which showed esophageal varices with cherry red spots (stigmata of
   recent bleeding) over varices. Two varices were banded during that
   initial EGD.  Now s/p repeat EGD upon tx back to ICU with blood seen in
   stomach, but no additional active bleeding noted; varices banded
   again.  Pre bleed, hct was 28.8 and is 27.4 this morning after 2 units
   prbs
   - s/p 2 units FFP for INR 2.3 and 2 units prbcs
   - give additional unit prbcs now
   - repeating hct now
   - Octreotide bolus with 100mcg now then octreotide gtt
   - Protonix gtt
   - Sucralfate 1 gm PO QID for 14 days
   - Has been off Nadolol, diuretics in setting of BPs high 80s-90s
   - 4 20g pivs
   - Already being treated for SBP so no need for proph
   .
   # Hypotension:  It appears that SBPs have been running consistently
   80s-90s while in house and this appears to be his baseline when
   reviewing old OMR notes.  Transiently dipped to 70s on the floor in the
   setting of hemoptysis and, thus, likely represents hypotension in the
   setting of active bleeding.  Of note, however, he has had persistent
   leukocytosis and is being treated with broad spectrum abx for SBP so
   infection is possible contributor.  Lactate elevated to 3.5 on
   presentation to the ICU and ? in setting of hypoperfusion d/t
   underlying infection (lactate previously normal even in the setting of
   his liver disease); has since normalized.  Currently on presentation to
   the ICU, SBPs are stable in the 80s and he is not tachycardic.  No EKG
   changes and CEs negative so as not to suggest underlying cardiogenic
   etiology.
   - Management of UGIB as above
   - Transfusing now
   - Treating underlying infection while awaiting final cx data; on
   meropenem, vancomycin, fluconazole
   - f/u outstanding culture data
   - sending UA/cx, blood cultures, repeat stool
   - Trend lactate
   .
   # Peritonitis: Diagnosed [**2185-1-5**], patient was on Cipro ppx as
   outpatient and recently increased dose due to recent bleed. Placed on
   Aztreonam [**2176**] mg IV Q8H 5 days (Day 1 [**2185-1-5**] - [**2185-1-10**]).  WBC count
   kept rising despite aztreonam/fluconazole, leading to repeat tap [**1-10**]-
   SBP w GNR. Started on Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] (aztreonam d/c'd) [**1-11**].  Given appears
   polymicrobial ? truly SBP vs. secondary seeding.  Has diffuse abdominal
   discomfort, but not focal pain nor rebound/guarding to suggest acute
   abdominal process.  Cholangiogram without biliary obstruction/leak
   (perc tube pulled [**1-10**]).  Does have left inguinal hernia, but without
   evidence of strangulation/incarceration.   Given concern for possible
   secondary seeding from underlying intraabdominal process will obtain
   RUQ U/S to assess for e/o obstructive/ascending cholangitis (t.bili up
   slightly from yesterday, AP stable).  Will also check CT abd/pelvis
   (without IV contrast, with oral contrast given UOP has dropped off and
   want to see where renal function will settle out).
   - Cont Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/fluconazole (fluc started [**1-5**], vanco/[**Last Name (un) 430**] started
   [**1-11**])
   - Monitor LFTs to assess for rising t.bili and concern for possible
   cholangitis given h/o recurrent episodes requiring perc drain placement
   - Repeat tap after 5d to confirm SBP eradication.
   - Received day 3 albumin (1g/kg)
   - Plan for bactrim for ppx following tx.
   - Monitor abdominal exam
   - Pursue abdominal imaging/[**Doctor First Name 458**] consult if abdominal exam at all
   concerning
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Non anion gap.  Lactate was elevated on
   transfer, but normalized this am and, again, non AG met acidosis.  He
   is on standing lactulose and suspect this is in the setting of ongoing
   diarrhea.  Patient did not have h/o encephalopathy prior to last
   discharge (discharged [**12-31**]) at which time he had some mental status
   changes.  Although during that admission, asterixis was never noted,
   there was concern for hepatic encephalopathy so he was started on
   lactulose with perhaps some improvement in MS per d/c summary.  In
   review of his labs, it appears that thereafter his bicarb fell which
   further suggests this is in the setting of diarrhea.  He is again
   without asterixis and is currently alert and oriented x3 so ?
   previously lethargic in setting of infection, meds.
   - continue to monitor chem7/bicarb
   - hold lactulose if continues to fall with close monitoring of mental
   status
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Persistently elevated to nearly 20K range.  Only clear
   source at this point is peritoneal fluid and as above, ? SBP vs.
   secondary seeding although no clear acute intraabdominal process at
   this time. CXR [**1-7**] showed low lung volume and probable small pleural
   effusions, not repeated since and he is without pulmonary symptoms to
   suggest as source.  Did hear soft systolic murmur on exam which is
   noted in old OMR notes so not new and TTE without e/o veg.  Blood and
   urine cultures have shown no growth.  He does have diarrhea, but is on
   lactulose; c. diff negative x1 on [**1-9**].
   - Treating peritonitis as above
   - Awaiting blood, urine cultures, c. diff
   - continue antibiotic coverage as above
   .
   # PSC with cirrhosis: On liver transplant list.   Complicated by
   ascites, portal gastropathy, and SBP. No clear history of
   encephalopathy as discussed above.
   - PTC drain removed [**1-10**]
   - Continue to trend LFTs - check for complications of PTC removal.
   - ursodiol [**Hospital1 **]
   - lactulose 30 mg daily  (may hold if met acidosis persists/worsens)
   - hold spironolactone/lasix in setting of hyponatremia/low BP
   .
   # Strictures: Pull back cholangiography on [**1-10**] demonstrated no
   obstruction. PTC drain removed by IR [**2185-1-10**].
   - Follow LFTs
   .
   # Esophagitis: Biopsy from EGD [**2184-12-28**] biopsy grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1656**].
   Unclear etiology. Fluconazole 200 mg qd for 14 days (Day 1 [**2185-1-5**]).
   If symptoms reoccur treat with Vori.
   - Negative fungal cultures
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Per floor team, improved with holding diuretics and
   fluid challenge therefore thought to be most likely hypovolemic
   hyponatremia.  Again improved slightly after receiving NS.
   - f/u urine lytes
   .
   # Ulcerative colitis: Continue outpatient Mesalamine.
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: Continue Statin. Holding ASA and BB in setting of
   bleed.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:  Continue outpatient dose statin.
   .
   # Depression/ADHD: Continue sertraline. Hold Ritalin as needed.
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), cirrhosis, and known esophageal varices. He presented with melanic stools and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration due to an esophageal variceal bleed. The patient underwent endoscopic banding of the varices and received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP).

The patient's current condition includes gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, peritonitis, metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, and potential complications related to his underlying liver disease. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and additional diagnostic tests are being conducted to assess his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of esophageal varices and recent bleeding indicate a high risk for recurrent GI bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and ongoing assessment for signs of active bleeding are necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be attributed to the recent GI bleed and ongoing fluid resuscitation efforts. Frequent monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic status is essential.
3. Peritonitis: The patient has been diagnosed with SBP, which requires prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics. Repeated paracentesis and monitoring of abdominal pain and tenderness are necessary to assess the progress"

   71 y/o man with PSC complicated by cirrhosis with known esophageal
   varices presenting with melanic stools and hct drop from esophageal
   variceal bleed s/p banding on [**1-3**] who now is transferred back to the
   ICU in setting of hematemesis.
   .
   # GI bleeding: EGD performed on initial transfer to [**Hospital1 54**] on [**1-3**]
   which showed esophageal varices with cherry red spots (stigmata of
   recent bleeding) over varices. Two varices were banded during that
   initial EGD.  Now s/p repeat EGD upon tx back to ICU with blood seen in
   stomach, but no additional active bleeding noted; varices banded
   again.  Pre bleed, hct was 28.8 and is 27.4 this morning after 2 units
   prbs
   - s/p 2 units FFP for INR 2.3 and 2 units prbcs
   - repeating hct now
   - Octreotide bolus with 100mcg now then octreotide gtt
   - Protonix gtt
   - Sucralfate 1 gm PO QID for 14 days
   - Has been off Nadolol, diuretics in setting of BPs high 80s-90s
   - 3 18g pivs
   - Already being treated for SBP so no need for proph
   .
   # Hypotension:  It appears that SBPs have been running consistently
   80s-90s while in house and this appears to be his baseline when
   reviewing old OMR notes.  Transiently dipped to 70s on the floor in the
   setting of hemoptysis and, thus, likely represents hypotension in the
   setting of active bleeding.  Of note, however, he has had persistent
   leukocytosis and is being treated with broad spectrum abx for SBP so
   infection is possible contributor.  Lactate elevated to 3.5 on
   presentation to the ICU and ? in setting of hypoperfusion d/t
   underlying infection (lactate previously normal even in the setting of
   his liver disease).  Currently on presentation to the ICU, SBPs are
   stable in the 80s and he is not tachycardic.  Given h/o CAD, cardiac
   cause also possible although seems less likely given alternative
   explanations as above.
   - Management of UGIB as above
   - Transfusing now
   - Treating underlying infection while awaiting final cx data; on
   meropenem, vancomycin, fluconazole
   - f/u outstanding culture data
   - sending UA/cx, blood cultures, repeat stool
   - Trend lactate
   - EKG now, CEs (may see some demand, but doubt ischemic event as
   underlying cause of low BP)
   .
   # SBP: Diagnosed [**2185-1-5**], patient was on Cipro ppx as outpatient and
   recently increased dose due to recent bleed. Placed on Aztreonam [**2176**]
   mg IV Q8H 5 days (Day 1 [**2185-1-5**] - [**2185-1-10**]).  WBC count kept rising
   despite aztreonam/fluconazole, leading to repeat tap [**1-10**]- SBP w GNR.
   Started on Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] (aztreonam d/c'd) [**1-11**].  Given appears
   polymicrobial ? SBP vs. secondary seeding.  Has diffuse abdominal
   discomfort, but not focal pain nor rebound/guarding to suggest acute
   abdominal process.  Cholangiogram without biliary obstruction/leak
   (perc tube pulled [**1-10**]).  Does have left inguinal hernia, but without
   evidence of strangulation/incarceration.
   - Cont Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/fluconazole (fluc started [**1-5**], vanco/[**Last Name (un) 430**] started
   [**1-11**])
   - Repeat tap after 5d to confirm SBP eradication.
   - D3 albumin (1g/kg) [**1-12**].
   - Plan for bactrim for ppx following tx.
   - Monitor abdominal exam
   - Pursue abdominal imaging/[**Doctor First Name 458**] consult if abdominal exam at all
   concerning
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Persistently elevated to 20K range.  Only clear source
   at this point is peritoneal fluid and as above, ? SBP vs. secondary
   seeding although no clear acute intraabdominal process at this time.
   CXR [**1-7**] showed low lung volume and probable small pleural effusions,
   not repeated since and he is without pulmonary symptoms to suggest as
   source.  Did hear soft systolic murmur on exam which is noted in old
   OMR notes so not new and TTE without e/o veg.  Blood and urine cultures
   have shown no growth.  He does have diarrhea, but is on lactulose; c.
   diff negative x1 on [**1-9**].
   - Treat SBP as above.
   - Repeat blood, urine cultures
   - Repeat c. diff
   - continue antibiotic coverage as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and cirrhosis, presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypotension, and a hemoglobin drop. He has been treated for small bowel perforation (SBP) and esophageal varices. The patient's current condition includes leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, hyponatremia, and potential complications such as infection, cardiac causes, or hypoperfusion. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, and other supportive care measures. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient's initial presentation was melanic stools and a drop in hemoglobin levels due to esophageal variceal bleeding. Although the bleeding has been controlled through banding, there is still a risk of rebleeding.
2. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with SBP and has shown persistent leukocytosis. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is a possibility of polymicrobial infection or secondary seeding. Additionally, the patient's elevated lactate levels suggest possible hypoperfusion secondary to underlying infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient's baseline blood pressure in the 80s-90s, along with transient dipping to the 70s, indicates chronic hypotension. This may be due to chronic liver disease, infection"

   changes.  Although during that admission, asterixis was never noted,
   there was concern for hepatic encephalopathy so he was started on
   lactulose with perhaps some improvement in MS per d/c summary.  In

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) complicated by cirrhosis, known esophageal varices, and ulcerative colitis. He presented with melanic stools and a drop in hemoglobin concentration due to an esophageal variceal bleed. He underwent endoscopic band ligation (EBL) of the varices on [**1-3**] and was transferred back to the ICU with hematemesis. Upon return, another EGD was performed, which showed blood in the stomach but no active bleeding. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for a high INR. He is currently receiving octreotide and pantoprazole infusions.

Medical Complications:
1. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient presented with melanic stools and a drop in hemoglobin concentration due to an esophageal variceal bleed. He underwent EBL of the varices, but continued to have blood in the stomach during the repeat EGD.

2. Hypotension: The patient has consistently had blood pressures in the 80s-90s, which may be his baseline due to his history of cardiac disease. However, transient hypotension was noted in the setting of hemoptysis. The patient's lactate levels were elevated on presentation to the ICU, indicating possible"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and cirrhosis, presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He underwent endoscopic banding for variceal bleeding and is currently on octreotide and pantoprazole drips. The patient also had recent MICU stay for variceal bleed, where he received broad-spectrum antibiotics for peritonitis and possible cholangitis. He has allergies to penicillins and sulfa medications.

24-hour events include an EKG at 02:00 AM, and the patient is receiving octreotide and pantoprazole infusions. Other ICU medications are noted, but not specified. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/61 mmHg to 126/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving aerosol-cool oxygen delivery and has an ABG result of ///17/. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, distended abdomen with right lower quadrant tenderness, trace edema in both lower extremities, and unassessed skin and neurologic status. Laboratory results indicate hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, leukocyte count of 22.7 K/uL, platelet count of 196 K/uL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, and troponin-T levels below 0.01. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly elevated. Fluid analysis shows polymicrobial cultures from recent taps.

Assessment and plan include the patient's declining urine output, plans for blood transfusion, repeated paracentesis with positive culture indicating possible secondary peritonitis, and an abdominal CT scan to evaluate the condition further. The patient is currently covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics and undergoing transplant evaluation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include acute blood loss anemia due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension potentially due to infection and blood loss, leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and the risk of developing secondary infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

The assessment and plan section outlines ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, VAP, communication, code status, and disposition.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the limited information provided, it is difficult to determine specific potential medical complications. However, some possible complications that can arise in the ICU include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and medication-related adverse effects. Further evaluation and detailed information from the progress note would be necessary to assess these potential complications accurately."

   71 y/o man with PSC complicated by cirrhosis with known esophageal
   varices presenting with melanic stools and hct drop from esophageal
   variceal bleed s/p banding on [**1-3**] who now is transferred back to the
   ICU in setting of hematemesis.
   # GI bleeding: EGD performed on initial transfer to [**Hospital1 54**] on [**1-3**]
   which showed esophageal varices with cherry red spots (stigmata of
   recent bleeding) over varices. Two varices were banded during that
   initial EGD.  Repeat EGD in the setting of hemoptysis [**1-11**] AM, varices
   w/stigmata of bleeding banded.
   - Received 2 units PRBCs
   - s/p 2 units FFP for INR 2.3 and 2 units prbcs
   - HCT stable overnight w/o new bleeding episodes
   - Octreotide bolus with 100mcg now then octreotide gtt
   - Protonix gtt
   - Sucralfate 1 gm PO QID for 14 days
   - Has been off Nadolol, diuretics in setting of BPs high 80s-90s
   - 4 20g pivs
   - Already being treated for SBP so no need for proph
   # Hypotension:  Resolved-systolic 80s-90s at baseline.
   # Peritonitis: Diagnosed [**2185-1-5**], patient was on Cipro ppx as
   outpatient and recently increased dose due to recent bleed. Placed on
   Aztreonam [**2176**] mg IV Q8H 5 days (Day 1 [**2185-1-5**] - [**2185-1-10**]).  WBC count
   kept rising despite aztreonam/fluconazole, leading to repeat tap [**1-10**]-
   SBP w GNR. Started on Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] (aztreonam d/c'd) [**1-11**].  Given appears
   polymicrobial ? truly SBP vs. secondary seeding.  Has diffuse abdominal
   discomfort, but not focal pain nor rebound/guarding to suggest acute
   abdominal process.  Cholangiogram without biliary obstruction/leak
   (perc tube pulled [**1-10**]).  Does have left inguinal hernia, but without
   evidence of strangulation/incarceration.   Given concern for possible
   secondary seeding from underlying intraabdominal process will obtain
   RUQ U/S to assess for e/o obstructive/ascending cholangitis (t.bili up
   slightly from yesterday, AP stable).  Will also check CT abd/pelvis
   (without IV contrast, with oral contrast given UOP has dropped off and
   want to see where renal function will settle out).
   - Cont Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/fluconazole (fluc started [**1-5**], vanco/[**Last Name (un) 430**] started
   [**1-11**])
   - Monitor LFTs to assess for rising t.bili and concern for possible
   cholangitis given h/o recurrent episodes requiring perc drain placement
   - Repeat tap after 5d to confirm SBP eradication
   - Received day 3 albumin (1g/kg)
   - Plan for bactrim for ppx following tx.
   - Monitor abdominal exam
   - Pursue abdominal imaging/[**Doctor First Name 458**] consult if abdominal exam at all
   concerning
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Non anion gap.  Lactate was elevated on
   transfer, but normalized this am and, again, non AG met acidosis.  He
   is on standing lactulose and suspect this is in the setting of ongoing
   diarrhea.  Patient did not have h/o encephalopathy prior to last
   discharge (discharged [**12-31**]) at which time he had some mental status
   changes.  Although during that admission, asterixis was never noted,
   there was concern for hepatic encephalopathy so he was started on
   lactulose with perhaps some improvement in MS per d/c summary.  In
   review of his labs, it appears that thereafter his bicarb fell which
   further suggests this is in the setting of diarrhea.  He is again
   without asterixis and is currently alert and oriented x3 so ?
   previously lethargic in setting of infection, meds.
   - continue to monitor chem7/bicarb
   - hold lactulose if continues to fall with close monitoring of mental
   status
   # Leukocytosis: Persistently elevated to nearly 20K range.  Only clear
   source at this point is peritoneal fluid and as above, ? SBP vs.
   secondary seeding although no clear acute intraabdominal process at
   this time. CXR [**1-7**] showed low lung volume and probable small pleural
   effusions, not repeated since and he is without pulmonary symptoms to
   suggest as source.  Did hear soft systolic murmur on exam which is
   noted in old OMR notes so not new and TTE without e/o veg.  Blood and
   urine cultures have shown no growth.  He does have diarrhea, but is on
   lactulose; c. diff negative x1 on [**1-9**].
   - Treating peritonitis as above
   - Awaiting blood, urine cultures, c. diff
   - continue antibiotic coverage as above
   # PSC with cirrhosis: On liver transplant list.   Complicated by
   ascites, portal gastropathy, and SBP. No clear history of
   encephalopathy as discussed above.
   - PTC drain removed [**1-10**]
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - ursodiol [**Hospital1 **]
   - lactulose 30 mg daily
   - restart spironolactone/lasix, monitoring lytes closely
   # Strictures: Pull back cholangiography on [**1-10**] demonstrated no
   obstruction. PTC drain removed by IR [**2185-1-10**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) complicated by cirrhosis, known esophageal varices, and ulcerative colitis. He presented with melanic stools and a drop in hemoglobin concentration due to an esophageal variceal bleed. He underwent banding of the varices but continues to experience hematemesis. He has been treated with octreotide, pantoprazole, sucralate, red blood cell transfusions, fresh frozen plasma, and has been placed on NPO (nothing by mouth) status.

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI bleeding: Esophageal varices with stigmata of recent bleeding were banded initially, and repeat banding was performed due to ongoing hemoptysis.
2. Hypotension: Resolved, with systolic blood pressures in the 80s-90s at baseline.
3. Peritonitis: Diagnosed on [**2185-1-5**], patient was on ciprofloxacin prophylaxis as an outpatient and recently increased the dose due to recent bleeding. Placed on aztreonam [**2176**] mg IV Q8H for 5 days (Day 1 [**2185-1-5**] - [**2185-1-10**]). WBC count remained elevated despite aztreonam/fluconazole, leading to"

   71 y/o man with PSC complicated by cirrhosis with known esophageal
   varices presenting with melanic stools and hct drop from esophageal
   variceal bleed s/p banding on [**1-3**] who now is transferred back to the
   ICU in setting of hematemesis.
   .
   # GI bleeding: EGD performed on initial transfer to [**Hospital1 54**] on [**1-3**]
   which showed esophageal varices with cherry red spots (stigmata of
   recent bleeding) over varices. Two varices were banded during that
   initial EGD.  Repeat EGD in the setting of hemoptysis [**1-11**] AM, varices
   w/stigmata of bleeding banded.
   - Received 2 units PRBCs
   - s/p 2 units FFP for INR 2.3 and 2 units prbcs
   - HCT stable overnight w/o new bleeding episodes
   - Octreotide bolus with 100mcg now then octreotide gtt
   - Protonix gtt
   - Sucralfate 1 gm PO QID for 14 days
   - Has been off Nadolol, diuretics in setting of BPs high 80s-90s
   - 4 20g pivs
   - Already being treated for SBP so no need for proph
   .
   # Hypotension:  It appears that SBPs have been running consistently
   80s-90s while in house and this appears to be his baseline when
   reviewing old OMR notes.  Transiently dipped to 70s on the floor in the
   setting of hemoptysis and, thus, likely represents hypotension in the
   setting of active bleeding.  Of note, however, he has had persistent
   leukocytosis and is being treated with broad spectrum abx for SBP so
   infection is possible contributor.  Lactate elevated to 3.5 on
   presentation to the ICU and ? in setting of hypoperfusion d/t
   underlying infection (lactate previously normal even in the setting of
   his liver disease); has since normalized.  Currently on presentation to
   the ICU, SBPs are stable in the 80s and he is not tachycardic.  No EKG
   changes and CEs negative so as not to suggest underlying cardiogenic
   etiology.
   - Management of UGIB as above
   - Transfusing now
   - Treating underlying infection while awaiting final cx data; on
   meropenem, vancomycin, fluconazole
   - f/u outstanding culture data
   - sending UA/cx, blood cultures, repeat stool
   - Trend lactate
   .
   # Peritonitis: Diagnosed [**2185-1-5**], patient was on Cipro ppx as
   outpatient and recently increased dose due to recent bleed. Placed on
   Aztreonam [**2176**] mg IV Q8H 5 days (Day 1 [**2185-1-5**] - [**2185-1-10**]).  WBC count
   kept rising despite aztreonam/fluconazole, leading to repeat tap [**1-10**]-
   SBP w GNR. Started on Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] (aztreonam d/c'd) [**1-11**].  Given appears
   polymicrobial ? truly SBP vs. secondary seeding.  Has diffuse abdominal
   discomfort, but not focal pain nor rebound/guarding to suggest acute
   abdominal process.  Cholangiogram without biliary obstruction/leak
   (perc tube pulled [**1-10**]).  Does have left inguinal hernia, but without
   evidence of strangulation/incarceration.   Given concern for possible
   secondary seeding from underlying intraabdominal process will obtain
   RUQ U/S to assess for e/o obstructive/ascending cholangitis (t.bili up
   slightly from yesterday, AP stable).  Will also check CT abd/pelvis
   (without IV contrast, with oral contrast given UOP has dropped off and
   want to see where renal function will settle out).
   - Cont Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/fluconazole (fluc started [**1-5**], vanco/[**Last Name (un) 430**] started
   [**1-11**])
   - Monitor LFTs to assess for rising t.bili and concern for possible
   cholangitis given h/o recurrent episodes requiring perc drain placement
   - Repeat tap after 5d to confirm SBP eradication.
   - Received day 3 albumin (1g/kg)
   - Plan for bactrim for ppx following tx.
   - Monitor abdominal exam
   - Pursue abdominal imaging/[**Doctor First Name 458**] consult if abdominal exam at all

   # Metabolic acidosis:  Non anion gap.  Lactate was elevated on
   transfer, but normalized this am and, again, non AG met acidosis.  He
   is on standing lactulose and suspect this is in the setting of ongoing
   diarrhea.  Patient did not have h/o encephalopathy prior to last
   discharge (discharged [**12-31**]) at which time he had some mental status
   changes.  Although during that admission, asterixis was never noted,
   there was concern for hepatic encephalopathy so he was started on
   lactulose with perhaps some improvement in MS per d/c summary.  In
   review of his labs, it appears that thereafter his bicarb fell which
   further suggests this is in the setting of diarrhea.  He is again
   without asterixis and is currently alert and oriented x3 so ?
   previously lethargic in setting of infection, meds.
   - continue to monitor chem7/bicarb
   - hold lactulose if continues to fall with close monitoring of mental
   status
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Persistently elevated to nearly 20K range.  Only clear
   source at this point is peritoneal fluid and as above, ? SBP vs.
   secondary seeding although no clear acute intraabdominal process at
   this time. CXR [**1-7**] showed low lung volume and probable small pleural
   effusions, not repeated since and he is without pulmonary symptoms to
   suggest as source.  Did hear soft systolic murmur on exam which is
   noted in old OMR notes so not new and TTE without e/o veg.  Blood and
   urine cultures have shown no growth.  He does have diarrhea, but is on
   lactulose; c. diff negative x1 on [**1-9**].
   - Treating peritonitis as above
   - Awaiting blood, urine cultures, c. diff
   - continue antibiotic coverage as above
   .
   # PSC with cirrhosis: On liver transplant list.   Complicated by
   ascites, portal gastropathy, and SBP. No clear history of
   encephalopathy as discussed above.
   - PTC drain removed [**1-10**]
   - Continue to trend LFTs - check for complications of PTC removal.
   - ursodiol [**Hospital1 **]
   - lactulose 30 mg daily  (may hold if met acidosis persists/worsens)
   - hold spironolactone/lasix in setting of hyponatremia/low BP
   # Strictures: Pull back cholangiography on [**1-10**] demonstrated no
   obstruction. PTC drain removed by IR [**2185-1-10**].

   # Esophagitis: Biopsy from EGD [**2184-12-28**] biopsy grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1656**].
   Unclear etiology. Fluconazole 200 mg qd for 14 days (Day 1 [**2185-1-5**]).
   If symptoms reoccur treat with Vori.
   - Negative fungal cultures
   # Hyponatremia: Improved slightly after receiving NS.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with PSC complicated by cirrhosis, known esophageal varices, and a history of melanic stools and hct drop from esophageal variceal bleed. He presented to the ICU with hematemesis and was previously treated for SBP, peritonitis, and esophageal variceal bleeding. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/79 mmHg to 113/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is receiving octreotide and pantoprazole infusions, as well as other medications for various conditions. His fluid balance shows a total intake of 4,301 mL and output of 2,630 mL, with a urine output of 605 mL. The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 22.7 K/uL and elevated lactate levels, which have since normalized. He has stable blood pressures in the 80s and is not tachycardic. His abdominal exam is unremarkable, but there is concern for possible secondary seeding of infection. The patient has a history of metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, and ulcers. He is being treated for multiple conditions, including peritonitis, esophageal varices, and liver disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Esophageal Variceal Bleeding: The patient has a history of esophageal varices and recent bleeding, which can recur and require immediate intervention.
2. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has been diagnosed with SBP and is at risk for recurrent infection, especially with his elevated leukocyte count.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's liver disease and elevated ammonia levels, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status.
4. Cholangitis: The patient's history of recurrent cholangitis and previous percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC) drain placement raises the concern for ongoing biliary tract infection.
5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient has decreased urine output and may be at risk for renal dysfunction, which can complicate his overall condition.
6. Diarrhea and Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient is on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause diarrhea and increase the risk of Clostridium difficile infection.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's leukocytosis and low lung volumes on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of pneumonia, especially given his immunocompromised state.
8. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and liver disease increase the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) complicated by cirrhosis and known esophageal varices. He presented with melanic stools and a drop in hemoglobin level, indicating a possible esophageal variceal bleed. He was initially treated with banding of the varices and admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. On the second day, he experienced hematemesis and required transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for an elevated INR. Octreotide and pantoprazole infusions were also initiated.

The patient has a history of recurrent episodes requiring percutaneous (PTC) drain placement, and his cholangiogram showed no evidence of biliary obstruction or leak. He is currently being treated with vancomycin and fluconazole, and his liver function tests (LFTs) will be monitored to assess for rising total bilirubin levels, which may indicate cholangitis. Repeat tapping is planned to confirm spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) eradication.

The patient's PSC with cirrhosis is complicated by ascites, portal gastropathy, and SBP. He is on the liver transplant list and has stable hyponatremia. Ursodiol, lactulose, spironolactone/lasix, and nadol"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) complicated by cirrhosis, known esophageal varices, and ulcerative colitis. He presented with melanic stools and a drop in hemoglobin concentration due to an esophageal variceal bleed, which was initially managed with banding. He was transferred back to the ICU with hematemesis.

The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for an elevated INR of 2.3. He is currently stable without new bleeding episodes. He is receiving octreotide, pantoprazole, sucralfate, and intravenous fluids.

The patient also has peritonitis diagnosed on [**2185-1-5**], which was initially treated with ciprofloxacin prophylaxis and subsequently escalated due to the recent bleed. He was started on aztreonam and fluconazole, but his white blood cell count continued to rise, leading to a repeat tap confirming spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with gram-negative rods. He was then started on vancomycin and aztreonam.

The patient's abdominal discomfort is being monitored, and a RUQ ultrasound has been ordered to assess for evidence of obstructive or ascending cholangitis. He is continuing vancomycin and fluconazole. A repeat tap is planned"

   there was concern for hepatic encephalopathy so he was started on

   review of his labs, it appears that thereafter his bicarb fell which
   further suggests this is in the setting of diarrhea.  He is again
   without asterixis and is currently alert and oriented x3 so ?

The patient is a 71-year-old male with PSC complicated by cirrhosis and known esophageal varices. He presented with melanic stools and a drop in hemoglobin concentration due to esophageal variceal bleeding, which was treated with banding. He was transferred back to the ICU for hematemesis. The patient has a history of recurrent episodes of bleeding, and two varices were banded during an initial EGD. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for an elevated INR. The patient is currently stable without new bleeding episodes. He is on octreotide, pantoprazole, and sucralfate for gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient also has hypotension, which has resolved. He was diagnosed with peritonitis on [1-5] and started on ciprofloxacin as prophylaxis. The patient developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with Gram-negative rods, and the aztreonam was discontinued. He was started on vancomycin and fluconazole. The patient has a left inguinal hernia without evidence of strangulation or incarceration. He will undergo a right upper quadrant ultrasound (RUQ) to assess for obstructive or ascending cholangitis. A CT abdomen/pelvis without IV contrast will also be done to evaluate for any intraabdominal processes.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o man with PSC complicated by cirrhosis with known esophageal
   varices presenting with melanic stools and hct drop from esophageal
   variceal bleed s/p banding on [**1-3**] who now is transferred back to the
   ICU in setting of hematemesis.
   # GI bleeding: No new episodes. EGD performed on initial transfer to
   [**Hospital1 54**] on [**1-3**] which showed esophageal varices with cherry red spots
   (stigmata of recent bleeding) over varices. Two varices were banded
   during that initial EGD.  Repeat EGD in the setting of hemoptysis [**1-11**]
   AM, varices w/stigmata of bleeding banded.
   - Received 2 units PRBCs
   - s/p 2 units FFP for INR 2.3 and 2 units prbcs
   - HCT stable overnight w/o new bleeding episodes
   - Octreotide bolus with 100mcg now then octreotide gtt
   - Protonix gtt
   - Sucralfate 1 gm PO QID for 14 days
   - 4 20g pivs
   - Already being treated for SBP so no need for proph
   # Peritonitis: Diagnosed [**2185-1-5**], patient was on Cipro ppx as
   outpatient and recently increased dose due to recent bleed. Placed on
   Aztreonam [**2176**] mg IV Q8H 5 days (Day 1 [**2185-1-5**] - [**2185-1-10**]).  WBC count
   kept rising despite aztreonam/fluconazole, leading to repeat tap [**1-10**]-
   SBP w GNR. Started on Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] (aztreonam d/c'd) [**1-11**].  Given appears
   polymicrobial ? truly SBP vs. secondary seeding.  Has diffuse abdominal
   discomfort, but not focal pain nor rebound/guarding to suggest acute
   abdominal process.  Cholangiogram without biliary obstruction/leak
   (perc tube pulled [**1-10**]).  Does have left inguinal hernia, but without
   evidence of strangulation/incarceration.   Given concern for possible
   secondary seeding from underlying intraabdominal process will obtain
   RUQ U/S to assess for e/o obstructive/ascending cholangitis (t.bili up
   slightly from yesterday, AP stable).  Abdominal exam benign.
   - Cont Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/fluconazole (fluc started [**1-5**], vanco/[**Last Name (un) 430**] started
   [**1-11**])
   - Monitor LFTs to assess for rising t.bili and concern for possible
   cholangitis given h/o recurrent episodes requiring perc drain placement
   - Repeat tap after 5d to confirm SBP eradication
   - Received day 3 albumin (1g/kg)
   - Plan for bactrim for ppx following tx.
   - Leukocytosis: Improved. Persistently elevated to nearly 20K range.
   Only clear source at this point is peritoneal fluid and as above, ? SBP
   vs. secondary seeding although no clear acute intraabdominal process at
   this time. CXR [**1-7**] showed low lung volume and probable small pleural
   effusions, not repeated since and he is without pulmonary symptoms to
   suggest as source.  Did hear soft systolic murmur on exam which is
   noted in old OMR notes so not new and TTE without e/o veg.  Blood and
   urine cultures have shown no growth.  He does have diarrhea, but is on
   lactulose; c. diff negative x1 on [**1-9**].
   - Treating peritonitis as above
   - Awaiting blood, urine cultures, c. diff
   - continue antibiotic coverage as above
   # PSC with cirrhosis: On liver transplant list.   Complicated by
   ascites, portal gastropathy, and SBP. No clear history of
   encephalopathy as discussed above.   Pull back cholangiography on [**1-10**]
   demonstrated no obstruction. PTC drain removed by IR [**2185-1-10**].
   Complicated by stable hyponatremia.
   - PTC drain removed [**1-10**]
   - Continue to trend LFTs and lytes
   - ursodiol [**Hospital1 **]
   - lactulose 30 mg daily
   - restart spironolactone/lasix, monitoring lytes closely
   - restart nadolol
   # Esophagitis: Biopsy from EGD [**2184-12-28**] biopsy grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1656**].
   Unclear etiology. Fluconazole 200 mg qd for 14 days (Day 1 [**2185-1-5**]).
   - Negative fungal cultures
   # Metabolic acidosis:  Non anion gap.  Likely due to stool loss in the
   setting of lactulose- stable.
   # Hypotension:  Resolved-systolic 80s-90s at baseline.
   # Ulcerative colitis: Continue outpatient Mesalamine.
   # CAD s/p CABG: Continue Statin. Holding ASA and BB in setting of
   bleed.
   -Continue outpatient dose statin.

","The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) complicated by cirrhosis, known esophageal varices, and ulcerative colitis. He presented with melanic stools and a drop in hemoglobin concentration, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent banding of esophageal varices twice, once on [**1-3**] and again on [**1-11**]. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.3.

The patient also has peritonitis, diagnosed on [**2185-1-5**], for which he was initially treated with ciprofloxacin prophylaxis and later switched to aztreonam. However, his white blood cell count continued to rise, and a repeat abdominal tap on [**1-10**] revealed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with gram-negative rods. He was then started on vancomycin and fluconazole. The patient has diffuse abdominal discomfort but no focal pain or rebound/guarding, suggesting an acute abdominal process.

The patient has a history of PSC with cirrhosis, including complications such as ascites, portal gastropathy, and SBP. He is on the liver transplant list. Cholangiography demonstrated no biliary obstruction or leak,"

   stomach, but no additional active bleeding noted; varices banded
   again.  Pre bleed, hct was 28.8 and is 27.4 this morning after 2 units
   prbs
   - s/p 2 units FFP for INR 2.3 and 2 units prbcs

   .
   # Hypotension:  It appears that SBPs have been running consistently
   80s-90s while in house and this appears to be his baseline when
   reviewing old OMR notes.  Transiently dipped to 70s on the floor in the
   setting of hemoptysis and, thus, likely represents hypotension in the
   setting of active bleeding.  Of note, however, he has had persistent
   leukocytosis and is being treated with broad spectrum abx for SBP so
   infection is possible contributor.  Lactate elevated to 3.5 on
   presentation to the ICU and ? in setting of hypoperfusion d/t
   underlying infection (lactate previously normal even in the setting of
   his liver disease); has since normalized.  Currently on presentation to
   the ICU, SBPs are stable in the 80s and he is not tachycardic.  No EKG
   changes and CEs negative so as not to suggest underlying cardiogenic
   etiology.
   - Management of UGIB as above
   - Transfusing now

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) complicated by cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and known liver disease. He presented with melanic stools and a drop in hemoglobin concentration due to an esophageal variceal bleed. He was initially treated with banding of the varices and blood transfusions. Upon transfer back to the ICU, he presented with hematemesis. Repeat endoscopy showed blood in the stomach but no active bleeding, so the varices were banded again.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, peritonitis, metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, PSC with cirrhosis, and strictures. He is being treated for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and his white blood cell count remains elevated. He is also being monitored for possible secondary seeding of infection.

The patient's metabolic acidosis is non-anion gap and thought to be related to ongoing diarrhea. He is on lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, but his mental status is currently normal.

He has a history of ulcerative colitis, coronary artery disease with previous CABG surgery, hyperlipidemia, and depression/ADHD. His medications have been adjusted based on his current condition.

   # Hypotension:  It appears that SBPs have been running consistently
   80s-90s while in house and this appears to be his baseline when
   reviewing old OMR notes.  Transiently dipped to 70s on the floor in the
   setting of hemoptysis and, thus, likely represents hypotension in the
   setting of active bleeding.  Of note, however, he has had persistent
   leukocytosis and is being treated with broad spectrum abx for SBP so
   infection is possible contributor.  Lactate elevated to 3.5 on
   presentation to the ICU and ? in setting of hypoperfusion d/t
   underlying infection (lactate previously normal even in the setting of
   his liver disease); has since normalized.  Currently on presentation to
   the ICU, SBPs are stable in the 80s and he is not tachycardic.  No EKG
   changes and CEs negative so as not to suggest underlying cardiogenic
   etiology.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of PSC complicated by cirrhosis, known esophageal varices, and a recent episode of melanic stools and hematocrit drop from esophageal variceal bleeding. He was initially treated with banding but is now back in the ICU with hematemesis. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, peritonitis, metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, strictures, esophagitis, hyponatremia, ulcerative colitis, CAD s/p CABG, hyperlipidemia, and depression/ADHD. He has received various treatments and interventions for these conditions, including banding, blood transfusions, antibiotics, and adjustments to medication regimens.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at risk for the following potential medical complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of esophageal varices and recent episode of melanic stools and hematocrit drop indicate ongoing bleeding. This can lead to hypovolemia and shock if not adequately managed.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings consistently in the 80s-90s suggest baseline hypotension. This could be due to ongoing bleeding, infection, or other underlying conditions.

3. Peritonitis: The patient has been diagnosed with peritonitis, which is an"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old male with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. He was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status, peritonitis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hypotension, and other comorbidities. The patient underwent paracentesis, which revealed 1500cc of clear yellow fluid positive for SBP. He is currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, octreotide, and pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs are stable, but his blood pressure is low. He requires respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has a SpO2 of 99%. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count ranging from 15.5 to 17.9 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function. The patient's overall condition remains critical, and he is currently on full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with SBP and is currently receiving antibiotics. There is a risk of developing other infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes and abnormal kidney function. These findings suggest the possibility of hepatic and renal dysfunction, which may require further evaluation and management.
3. Hemodynamic instability: Despite being on vasop"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 y/o man with PSC complicated by cirrhosis who was admitted with
   esophageal variceal bleed, and now w/ recurrent bleed as well as ESBL
   E. coli SBP.
   .
   #  Hematemasis.  Patient initially admitted for esophageal variceal
   bleed s/p banding on [**1-3**].  He had a repeat bleed on [**2185-1-11**]
   requiring repeat banding.  He has received a total of 5 units of PRBCs
   during his hospital stay.  Today with small amount of hematemesis and
   transient hypotension.  Given recent variceal bleed, concern for
   variceal bleed, though also may be related to bleeding from recent
   esophageal biopsy.
   - q 6 hour Hcts
   - PIV x 2
   - type and cross 3 units (type and screen expires [**2185-1-17**])
   - octreotide drip
   - GI aware; do not want to scope at present, but will scope if unstable
   or has melena
   - maintain SBP >85
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Sucralfate 1 gm PO QID for 14 days (Day 1, [**2185-1-12**])
   - s/p FFP x 2 units today
   .
   #  Hypotension: SBPs have been running consistently 80s-90s during this
   hospital stay w intermittant 70s. Triggered [**1-15**] for BP 74/46 -> alb
   25g, 500cc NS -> BPs 80s, 90s. Pt does have known infection (SBP &
   esophagitis), making sepsis possible, though lower suspicion given
   overall clinical picture. He has had no EKG changes or CEs negative to
   suggest underlying cardiogenic etiology.  TSH, cortisol wnl.
   - f/u blood, urine, peritoneal cultures
   - Management of UGIB as above
   - hold nadolol
   - Treating underlying infection w/ meropenem, vancomycin, fluconazole
   .
   # Peritonitis: Diagnosed [**2185-1-5**], patient was on Cipro ppx as
   outpatient and recently increased dose due to recent bleed. Initially
   tx'd w/ Aztreonam [**2176**] mg IV Q8H 5 days (Day 1 [**2185-1-5**] - [**2185-1-10**])
   given PCN allergy. Repeat tap on [**2185-1-10**] done b/c of persistent
   leukocytosis showed SBP, again. Ascitic cx growing ESBL E.Coli
   (sensitive to Meropenem, Zosyn, Tobramycin).   Repeat tap today shows
   improvement of SBP with falling WBC.
   - Cont Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **]/fluconazole (fluc started [**1-5**] for esophagitis,
   vanco/[**Last Name (un) 430**] started [**1-11**]) x5d
   - Repeat tap ([**1-15**]) to confirm SBP eradication - Bactrim if neg for
   ppx.
   - Monitor abdominal exam
   - Pursue abdominal imaging/IR consult if abdominal exam at all
   concerning
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Persistently elevated during this hosp stay. Likely [**2-21**]
   SBP & stress of bleed. CXR clear on [**1-5**]. RUQ U/S w/o acute findings
   on [**2185-1-12**]. C. diff negative x1 on [**1-9**].   WBC trending down on
   antibiotics and improvement of ascetic wbc suggests appropropriate
   antibiotics.
   - Treating peritonitis as above
   - F/u blood, urine cultures
   - continue antibiotic coverage as above
   .
   # PSC with cirrhosis: On liver transplant list. Complicated by ascites,
   portal gastropathy, and SBP. No clear history of encephalopathy.
   - ursodiol [**Hospital1 **]
   - lactulose 30 mg daily (may hold if met acidosis persists/worsens)
   - hold spironolactone/lasix in setting of hyponatremia/low BP
   .
   # Biliary strictures: Pull back cholangiography on [**1-10**] demonstrated
   no obstruction. PTC drain removed by IR [**2185-1-10**]. Bili peaked [**1-13**],
   decreasing through [**1-15**].
   - Trend LFTs to assess for complications of PTC removal (ie,
   cholangitis)
   .
   # Esophagitis: Biopsy from EGD [**2184-12-28**] biopsy grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1656**].
   Unclear etiology. Fluconazole 200 mg qd for 14 days (Day 1 [**2185-1-5**]).
   If symptoms reoccur treat with Vori.
   - Negative fungal cultures
   - monitor for odynophagia
   .
   # Hyponatremia: stable at 129 [**1-15**]. Was thought to be primarily
   hypovolemic hyponatremia in ICU. Diuretics on hold.
   - monitor, if worsens resend urine lytes
   .
   # Ulcerative colitis: Continue outpatient Mesalamine.
   .
   # CAD s/p CABG: Continue Statin. Holding ASA and BB in setting of
   bleed.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue outpatient dose statin.
   .
   # Depression/ADHD: Continue sertraline. Hold Ritalin as needed.
   .
   # Low 02 Sats: 02 sats in low 90s in ICU on RA. CXR w/ small pl
   effusion. Con't to monitor. Repeat CXR if worsens.
   .
   # Hernia: Inguinal hernia, causing significant discomfort. Has been
   eval'd by surgery in past. No e/o incarceration on exam. Reportedly has
   been eval'd by surgery in past, w/ decision to hold on surgery.
   .
   # Depression/ADHD: Pt not depressed at present. Con't sertraline. Hold
   Ritalin as needed.
   .
   # FEN: Very poor PO intake. Calorie count shows <500cal/day.
   Nutritionist following.
   - Continue to encourage po intake
   - Changing supplements to Ensure Plus TID to increase kcals/prot
   - Place dauboff [**1-15**] -> start tube feeds.
   - When more stable, post-pyloric feeding tube. TF goal per
   nutritionist: FS Nutren 2.0 @ 40cc/hr to provide 1920kcals and 77g
   prot/day meeting 100% est needs.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) complicated by cirrhosis, who was admitted for an esophageal variceal bleed and now presents with recurrent bleeding, as well as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient has received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) during his hospital stay. He is currently experiencing small amounts of hematemesis and transient hypotension. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/52 to 75/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals a distended abdomen with positive ascites, and the presence of asterixis. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.2, elevated liver enzymes, and evidence of infection. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal with prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). 

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, treatment of SBP with meropenem, vancomycin, and fluconazole, and monitoring for any signs of worsening"
