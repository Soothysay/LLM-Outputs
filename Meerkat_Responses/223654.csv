   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, sutured ventricular tachycardia with pacer, and recently diagnosed metastatic lung cancer treated with palliative radiation therapy. The patient was initially admitted from a nursing home for lethargy and confusion and was felt to have multiple medications/narcotics contributing to his condition. An infectious workup was pursued, and the patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), hypotension, and new-onset atrial fibrillation.

Key events in the patient's 24-hour period include the placement of a cordis/introducer, endoscopy, insertion of a left atrial line, and right femoral cordis. The patient received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells. An emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with intubation for the procedure revealed a duodenal ulcer at the bulb with a large clot, which was blindly injected and prophylactic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) gastritis guard (GGT) started. The patient experienced hypotension post-intubation, responding to intravenous fluid (IVF) bolus. The patient's blood pressure remained low this morning after administration of 1 mg of versed, again responding to IVF bolus. Ventilator settings were adjusted for persistent"

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, and metastatic lung cancer. He was initially admitted for lethargy and confusion from narcotics, and additional infectious workup was pursued. He was later transferred to the MICU for coffee ground emesis/UGIB (upper gastrointestinal bleeding), hypotension, and new-onset atrial fibrillation.

The patient has had several significant events in the past 24 hours. He underwent an endoscopy to address a large clot in the duodenum, which resulted in hypotension that responded to intravenous fluids (IVF) bolus. His blood pressure improved to 70/48 mmHg after the procedure. He also received 2 units of packed red blood cells (prbc's) yesterday.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 98. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 27, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100%, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 473. His ventilatory"

   - continue vanc and zosyn
   - will hold off on extubation for now
   - will switch propofol to fentanyl/midazolam.

   2) Acute renal failure: Creatinine increased to 1.6 since prior day
   from a baseline of 1.0, possible prerenal etiology in the setting of
   emesis and hypovolemia.  However, FeNA 1.6 with anion gap if 44

   Patient now minimally responsive in the setting of active
   resuscitation.  Per previous notes, Oncology team was considering
   dehydration vs. over-medication vs. infection.  Infectious work-up has

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, SVT with a pacemaker, AAA repair, and metastatic lung cancer. He was admitted with coffee-ground emesis and is suspected to have an upper gastrointestinal bleed. He has a hematocrit drop from 35 to 23 over 36 hours. He underwent an urgent endoscopy with injection of epinephrine around a large clot in the duodenal bulb. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He also has acute renal failure with a creatinine increase to 1.6, possible prerenal etiology in the setting of emesis and hypovolemia. His cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation with ectopy, and his pacemaker appears to be functioning adequately. The patient has stage IV squamous cell lung cancer with known metastases to the vertebrae, currently undergoing palliative radiation therapy. He is also on chemotherapy. The patient's mental status changes were initially thought to be due to dehydration, over-medication, or infection, but an infectious work-up has been negative to date.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient's coffee-ground emesis and hematocrit drop suggest an ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleed. There is a differential diagnosis including radiation-induced gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, or a Boerhaave syndrome tear. The patient has received epinephrine injection around a"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 237**] is an 86 yo male with h/o CAD s/p stent, SVT s/p pacer, AAA
   repair, recently diagnosed metastatic lung CA who is transferred to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with coffee-ground emesis x 2 days.
   .
   1) GI bleed: Actively bleeding with hematocrit drop from 35 -> 23 over
   past 36 hours.  Suspect UGI source given coffee-ground emesis, although
   NG lavage not performed.  Differential includes radiation-induced
   gastritis vs. PUD vs. [**Doctor First Name 241**]-[**Doctor Last Name 37**] tear.
   - GI consult aware with plan for urgent endoscopy tonight
   - Erythromycin prior to endoscopy
   - D/c ASA, Plavix, Lovenox
   - Transfuse 2 units now
   - q6 hour hematocrits
   - Active T&C
   - Protonix bolus, followed by gtt
   - large bore IV access placed
   - NPO
   .
   2) Acute renal failure: Creatinine increased to 1.6 since prior day
   from a baseline of 1.0, likely of prerenal etiology in the setting of
   emesis and hypovolemia.
   - urine lytes for FeNa calculation
   - IVF and blood for hydration
   - Renally dose medications
   .
   3) Tachyarrhythmia: Patient with known h/o SVT, with pacer, now
   presents in rapid afib in the setting of volume depletion.
   - anti-hypertensive agents contraindicated while HD unstable
   - rehydration + IV digoxin load for rate control
   .
   4) Squamous Cell Lung CA:  Stage IV disease with known metastates to
   vertebrae.  Patient is currently undergoing palliative XRT, most
   recently on [**3-9**].
   - continue decadron 6mg
   - will discuss steroid taper with RadOnc
   .
   5) Coronary Artery Disease: currently stable
   - discontinue ASA, Plavix in the setting of active GIB
   - hold Nifedipine in the setting of HD instability
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   6) Mental status changes: This was original reason for admission.
   Patient now minimally responsive in the setting of active
   resuscitation.  Per previous notes, Oncology team was considering
   dehydration vs. over-medication vs. infection.  Infectious work-up has
   been negative to date.   CT head negative for acute process or e/o
   metastatic disease.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous surgical interventions, and recently diagnosed metastatic lung cancer. He was admitted to the ICU due to mental status changes, which were initially suspected to be caused by dehydration, over-medication, or infection. However, the infectious work-up has been negative so far. The patient is currently experiencing a gastrointestinal bleed, acute renal failure, tachyarrhythmia, and stage IV squamous cell lung cancer with known metastasis to the vertebrae. The patient's condition is unstable, and he requires active resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient is actively bleeding with a significant drop in hematocrit. This indicates ongoing blood loss and may require urgent endoscopy for diagnosis and treatment. The source of bleeding could be from an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) source, possibly radiation-induced gastritis, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), or a Boerhaave syndrome tear.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.0 to 1.6, suggesting acute renal failure. This is likely due to prerenal causes such as emesis and hypovolemia. Fluid resuscitation and careful monitoring of renal function are necessary.

3. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a known history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a pac"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has a history of cancer (malignant neoplasm) of the lung, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), atrial fibrillation (AF), renal failure, and upper gastrointestinal bleed (melena). 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius (100.8 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 115/55 mmHg to 154/123 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal ventilation. The patient is currently sedated and not fully responsive.

The patient has multiple lines and tubes inserted, including an arterial line, multi-lumen central venous catheter, and endotracheal tube. The patient is receiving various medications such as propofol, midazolam, fentanyl, gancyclovir, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Renal function tests indicate acute renal failure. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds, and soft abdomen. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to sedation.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, and recently diagnosed metastatic lung cancer undergoing palliative radiation therapy. He was initially admitted from a nursing home for lethargy and confusion, possibly related to medications/narcotics, with an additional infectious workup pursued. He was transferred to the MICU for upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a large duodenal ulcer, resulting in hypotension and new-onset atrial fibrillation. The patient required intubation for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and is now experiencing worsening acute respiratory failure (ARF) and thick secretions likely developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration.

The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia, with a blood pressure of 109/56 mmHg and a heart rate of 110 bpm. His respiratory rate is 34 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 38.2 degrees Celsius. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL and leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.3 x 10^9/L. The platelet count is within normal range at 118 x 10^9/L. Renal function is impaired with a creatinine level of 1."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation with a pacemaker, and recently diagnosed metastatic lung cancer. He was initially admitted for lethargy and confusion, and then transferred to the MICU for upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a large duodenal ulcer. 

The patient's current main issues include:

1. UGIB - The patient continues to have upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which is causing a slow drop in hemoglobin levels. The source of the bleeding is a large duodenal ulcer. The patient is being treated with serial hemodynamic monitoring, intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and close observation by the gastrointestinal team.

2. ARF - The patient is likely experiencing acute renal failure, possibly due to hypovolemia resulting from the bleeding and subsequent hypotension. There is also a concern for a mixed acid-base disorder with respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. Renal dosing of medications is necessary, and the creatinine level remains stable with improving urine output. Continued follow-up is needed.

3. Hypotension/Shock - The patient has experienced hypotension, which may be due to sepsis from a new infection or hypovolemia. Given the patient's compromised cardiovascular status, including a known coronary artery disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm, it is difficult to determine the exact cause. Empiric antibiotics have been started for hospital"

   little change in
   the appearance of the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, central
   catheter,
   or the pacemaker leads.  The hemidiaphragms are now much more sharply
   seen,
   consistent with some clearing of bibasilar atelectatic change.  Mild
   fullness
   of pulmonary vessels suggests some underlying elevated pulmonary venous
   pressure.
   The somewhat ill-defined area of increased opacification at the left
   base
   laterally is again seen.
   TTE:  Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity is unusually small. There is mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinning and near akinesis of the
   basal to mid inferior and inferolateral walls. The ascending aorta is
   mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
   mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-12**], the
   findings are similar.

   - continue vanc and zosyn
   - will hold off on extubation for now
   - will switch propofol to fentanyl/midazolam.

   2) Acute renal failure: Creatinine increased to 1.6 since prior day
   from a baseline of 1.0, possible prerenal etiology in the setting of
   emesis and hypovolemia.  However, FeNA 1.6 with anion gap if 44

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous stent placement, supraventricular tachycardia with pacemaker, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and recently diagnosed metastatic lung cancer. He was transferred to the ICU with coffee-ground emesis for two days. The patient has been actively bleeding with a drop in hematocrit from 35 to 23 over 36 hours. An urgent endoscopy was performed, and epinephrine was injected around a large clot in the duodenal bulb. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient is suspected to have an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed, as evidenced by coffee-ground emesis and a significant drop in hematocrit. The differential includes radiation-induced gastritis, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and possible [Doctor First Name 241]-[Doctor Last Name 37] tear. The patient received erythromycin prior to endoscopy and has been transfused with two units of blood overnight. He will continue to receive transfusions for a hematocrit <28 and will be monitored with q4-hour hematocrits. Large bore IV access has been placed, and the patient will be kept cordis-in for today. If the hematocrit stabilizes, the cordis can be removed. The patient is NPO, and proton"

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous stent placement, supraventricular tachycardia with pacemaker, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and recently diagnosed metastatic lung cancer.
- The patient was transferred to the ICU with coffee-ground emesis for two days, suspected upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and underwent urgent endoscopy with epinephrine injection around a large clot in the duodenal bulb.
- The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and difficult intubation.
- The patient has acute renal failure with an increase in creatinine from 1.0 to 1.6, possibly prerenal etiology or renal tubular acidosis.
- The patient has a known history of supraventricular tachycardia with a pacemaker and is now presenting with atrial fibrillation, likely due to volume depletion.
- The patient has stage IV squamous cell lung cancer with known metastases to the vertebrae and is currently undergoing palliative radiation therapy.
- The patient has coronary artery disease that is currently stable.
- The patient initially presented with mental status changes, which are still present and unclear in etiology.
- The patient has abdominal pain of unclear cause, possibly steroid-induced gastritis, duodenal ulcer, ulcer perforation, worsened abdominal aortic aneurysm, or abdominal infection. Further evaluation is planned.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI Bleed: The patient had a suspected upper GI bleed, which was confirmed by endoscopy. The patient received epinephrine injection around a large clot in the duodenal bulb. The patient's hematocrit dropped from 35 to 23 over 36 hours, indicating ongoing blood loss. Continued monitoring and management of the GI bleed are necessary.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status is concerning with copious thick yellow secretions requiring hourly suction. The sputum culture is positive for Gram-negative rods, indicating a possible pulmonary infection. Antibiotic therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with an increase in creatinine from 1.0 to 1.6. This may be due to prerenal causes such as hypovolemia and ongoing blood loss or renal tubular acidosis. Close monitoring of urine output and renal function is essential.

4. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a known history of supraventricular tachycardia and now presents with atrial fibrillation. Rate control measures should be implemented, and anti-hypertensive agents should be used cautiously due to the patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation with pacemaker, and recently diagnosed metastatic lung cancer receiving palliative radiation therapy. He was admitted initially from a nursing home for lethargy and confusion, suspected to be caused by medication/narcotics. Infectious workup was pursued, and he was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) from a large duodenal ulcer, accompanied by hypotension and atrial fibrillation. He was intubated for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and is now showing signs of worsening acute respiratory failure (ARF) and thick secretions, which are concerning for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration. The patient also has new abdominal pain.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation with pacemaker, and recently diagnosed metastatic lung cancer receiving palliative radiation therapy. He was admitted initially from a nursing home for lethargy and confusion, suspected to be caused by medication/narcotics. Infectious workup was pursued, and he was transferred to the MICU for UGIB from a large duodenal ulcer, accompanied by hypotension and atrial fibrillation. He was intubated for an EGD and is now showing signs of worsening ARF and thick secretions, which are concerning for developing VAP or aspiration. The patient also has new abdominal pain.

Main issues include:
1. Abdominal pain - new, on steroids, most concerning for possible perforation or post-scope complication, triple A rupture less concerning given stability of hematocrit and hemodynamics.
   - Check KUB, then obtain CT abdomen (without contrast, given renal failure), serial exams, LFT's, repeat blood cultures.
2. UGIB from duodenal ulcer, patient remains stable.
   - Follow [**Hospital1 7**].
   - Transfuse for active bleed or < 26.
   - Change GGT to IV PPI, GI continues to follow with no plans at this time to rescope.
3. ARF-likely acute tubular necrosis from hypovolemia/hypotension, renally dose medications.
   - Continue renal dosing.
   - Cr improving with increased urine output - will continue to follow.
4. Pneumonia - pan [**Doctor Last Name**] kleb in sputum, blood with NG tube, continue Zosyn given abdominal pain but can d/c vancomycin.
5. Hypotension/shock - sepsis improving, HD stabilization, never requiring pressor support, no evidence of cardiac ischemia negative cardiac enzymes or change in echo.
   - Antibiotics as above.
   - Continue current dose of dexamethasone pending rad onc input about ongoing need or taper.
6. Respiratory failure - intubated for airway initially though now developing VAP, possible aspiration.
   - Still with significant vent support and RSBI 105, improving secretions, continues to do well from oxygenation standpoint.
   - Respiratory alkalosis.
   - Adjust MV can decrease TV, treat pain and agitation.
   - Continue on vent.
7. Atrial fibrillation/sinus tachycardia - continue digoxin, check level.
8. Coronary artery disease - holding aspirin and Plavix in setting of GIB, blood pressure stable.
9. Advanced malignancy - palliative radiation therapy if stabilizes/continue dexamethasone.

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrhythmia, recent diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer, and previous admission for lethargy and confusion.
- The patient was admitted initially from a nursing home and was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) from a large duodenal ulcer, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation.
- The patient is currently intubated for an elective gastrostomy procedure and now presents with worsening acute respiratory failure (ARF) and thick secretions, concerning for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration.
- The patient has new abdominal pain, which could be related to a post-scope complication or possible rupture of a known abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).
- The patient has ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) from the duodenal ulcer.
- The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), likely caused by hypovolemia/hypotension, and there is a concern for renal tubular acidosis (RTA) with mixed acid-base disturbance.
- The patient has a positive sputum culture for pan [**Doctor Last Name **] klebsiella, but no growth in the blood culture.
- The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam), pain medications, and steroids.

   Imaging: IMPRESSION:
   1.  Pneumoperitoneum and  fluid accumulation adjacent to the second
   part of
   the duodenum, which extends into the right anterior pararenal spaces,
   are
   suggestive of perforation of ulcer of second part of duodenum.
   2.  Interval development of complete collapse of L4 lumbar vertebra and
   interval decrease in the soft tissue mass of the pedicle of L4.  As no
   IV
   contrast has been used, assessment of thecal sac compression cannot be
   performed.
   3.  Diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis.
   4. Interval development of high density mass in right adrenal gland in
   1 month
   is suggestive of either benign etiologies such as hematoma or
   metastatic
   disease ( underlyng small cell lung cancer) .
   IMPRESSION:  No large amount of free intraperitoneal air identified.
   If
   clinical suspicion is high, decubitus film or standing upright film is
   recommended.
   FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**2161-3-15**], there is little
   change in
   the appearance of the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, central
   catheter,
   or the pacemaker leads.  The hemidiaphragms are now much more sharply
   seen,
   consistent with some clearing of bibasilar atelectatic change.  Mild
   fullness
   of pulmonary vessels suggests some underlying elevated pulmonary venous
   pressure.
   The somewhat ill-defined area of increased opacification at the left
   base
   laterally is again seen.

   Assessment and Plan
 Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 237**] is an 86 yo male with h/o CAD s/p stent, SVT s/p pacer, AAA
   repair, recently diagnosed metastatic lung CA who is transferred to
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with coffee-ground emesis x 2 days.
   .
   1) Duodenal Perforation:  s/p emergent surgery.  Currently
   hemodynamically stable, w/ drains reportedly w/ expected output.
   Degree of abdominal tenderness on exam significantly improved.
         - Patient to continue vanc/meropenem for coverage of GI
   infectious catastrophy in ICU setting.  Will
   .
 check q4h hct
   - keep patient NPO
   2) Hemodynamic Instability:  Patient required significant fluid
   resuscitation following the OR, with now adequate blood pressures.  HR
   remains stable.  With fluid resuscitation patient has shown improvement
   of metabolic acidosis.  Feel that patient is now adequately
   resuscitated.  Continues to monitor pressures, check serial hct, serial
   physical exams, and ABGs.
   # Respiratory Failure
 Pt Intubated for endoscopy, was difficult to
   intubate so remained intubated overnight in case  that further
   intervention was required.  CXR [**3-15**] showed evidence of possible new
   bibasilar lung process concerning for PNA.  Pt now has copius thick
   yellow secretions requiring hourly suction.  Sputum Cx positive for
   GNR.   Likely new PNA perhaps [**2-14**] aspiration v other infectious
   etiology
   - continue vanc and meropenem
   - will hold off on extubation for now
   - continue to adjust vent settings w/ ABG in response to metabolic
   derangements
   - will switch propofol to fentanyl/midazolam, titrate up for better
   sedation.  Feel that some degree of hypertension is agitation
   related..
   .
   #) Acute renal failure: Creatinine increased to 1.6 since prior day
   from a baseline of 1.0, possible prerenal etiology in the setting of
   emesis and hypovolemia.  Despite aggressive hydration, has not show any
   improvement.  Likely ATN with patient that is now anuric..
   - continue to trend Cr
   -renaly dose all meds
   .
   #) Tachyarrhythmia: Patient with known h/o SVT, with pacer, now
   presents in rapid afib in the setting of volume depletion, which
   resolved w/ fluids.
   - rehydration + IV digoxin load for rate control
   - contact[**Name (NI) **] cards over weekend, felt rhythm to be afib with ectopy and
   believed pacer to be functioning adequately
   - nature of pacer firing different following OR, and was turned off
   during procedure, have EP interrogate pace to see if firiting adequatly
   4) Squamous Cell Lung CA:  Stage IV disease with known metastates to
   vertebrae.  Patient is currently undergoing palliative XRT, most
   recently on [**3-9**].
   - continue decamethasone 4mg [**Hospital1 7**], and down titrate to 2mg tomorrw
   - no role for chemo in this critically ill patient.
   5) Coronary Artery Disease: currently stable
   - discontinue ASA, Plavix in the setting of active GIB
   - hold Nifedipine in the setting of HD instability
   - rise in troponins likely from [**Last Name (un) 283**] ischemia w/ renal failure, as
   ration not elevated.  Continue to trend cardiac enzymes, no evidence of
   MI on EKG.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous stent placement, supraventricular tachycardia with pacemaker, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and recently diagnosed metastatic lung cancer. He was transferred to the ICU with coffee-ground emesis for two days.

The patient underwent emergent surgery for a perforated duodenal ulcer and is currently hemodynamically stable with expected output from drains. He is being monitored for any signs of abdominal tenderness, which has shown significant improvement.

The patient required significant fluid resuscitation following the surgery due to hemodynamic instability, but now has adequate blood pressures. His metabolic acidosis has also improved. He is expected to be adequately resuscitated.

The patient has been intubated for respiratory failure, as he was difficult to intubate during the endoscopy. His condition worsened overnight, and he now has copious thick yellow secretions requiring hourly suction. A sputum culture positive for GNR suggests a new pneumonia, possibly aspiration-related. His ventilator settings will be adjusted based on arterial blood gas (ABG) results.

The patient has developed acute renal failure, with an increase in creatinine from 1.0 to 1.6. This could be due to pre-renal causes such as emesis and hypovolemia. Despite aggressive hydration, there has been no improvement, indicating possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN)."

   Imaging: IMPRESSION:
   1.  Pneumoperitoneum and  fluid accumulation adjacent to the second
   part of
   the duodenum, which extends into the right anterior pararenal spaces,
   are
   suggestive of perforation of ulcer of second part of duodenum.
   2.  Interval development of complete collapse of L4 lumbar vertebra and
   interval decrease in the soft tissue mass of the pedicle of L4.  As no
   IV
   contrast has been used, assessment of thecal sac compression cannot be
   performed.
   3.  Diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis.
   4. Interval development of high density mass in right adrenal gland in
   1 month
   is suggestive of either benign etiologies such as hematoma or
   metastatic
   disease ( underlyng small cell lung cancer) .
   IMPRESSION:  No large amount of free intraperitoneal air identified.
   If
   clinical suspicion is high, decubitus film or standing upright film is
   recommended.
   FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**2161-3-15**], there is little
   change in
   the appearance of the endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, central
   catheter,
   or the pacemaker leads.  The hemidiaphragms are now much more sharply
   seen,
   consistent with some clearing of bibasilar atelectatic change.  Mild
   fullness
   of pulmonary vessels suggests some underlying elevated pulmonary venous
   pressure.
   The somewhat ill-defined area of increased opacification at the left
   base
   laterally is again seen.

   .
   1) GI bleed: Actively bleeding with hematocrit drop from 35 -> 23 over
   36 hours.  Suspect UGI source given coffee-ground emesis, although NG
   lavage not performed.  Now s/p urgent endoscopy with injection of
   epinephrine around large clot in duodenal bulb.
   - Erythromycin prior to endoscopy
   - D/c
d ASA, Plavix, Lovenox
   - hct has held stable over last 2 days
   - q12 hour hematocrits
   - Active T&C
   - Protonix  gtt, now switching to [**Hospital1 7**] bolus dosing
   - large bore IV access placed, will d/c cordis today as hct has
   remained stable, making likelihood of need for rapid fluid resusitation
   unlikely
   - will start on TF
   - f/u GI recs
   .

   etiology
   - continue vanc and zosyn
   - will hold off on extubation for now
   - will switch propofol to fentanyl/midazolam.
   .
   2) Acute renal failure: Creatinine increased to 1.6 since prior day
   from a baseline of 1.0, possible prerenal etiology in the setting of
   emesis and hypovolemia.  However, FeNA 1.6 with anion gap if 44
   suggestive of possible RTA
   - IVF and blood for hydration
   - Renally dose medications
   - monitor urine output
   .
   3) Tachyarrhythmia: Patient with known h/o SVT, with pacer, now
   presents in rapid afib in the setting of volume depletion.
   - anti-hypertensive agents contraindicated while HD unstable
   - rehydration + IV digoxin load for rate control
   - contact[**Name (NI) **] cards over weekend, felt rhythm to be afib with ectopy and
   believed pacer to be functioning adequately
   4) Squamous Cell Lung CA:  Stage IV disease with known metastates to
   vertebrae.  Patient is currently undergoing palliative XRT, most
   recently on [**3-9**].
   - continue decamethasone 6mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - will discuss steroid taper with RadOnc
   - heme onc rec
   .
   5) Coronary Artery Disease: currently stable
   - discontinue ASA, Plavix in the setting of active GIB
   - hold Nifedipine in the setting of HD instability-- > restart today
   - Continue Atorvastatin
   .
   6) Mental status changes: This was original reason for admission.
   Patient now minimally responsive in the setting of active
   resuscitation.  Per previous notes, Oncology team was considering
   dehydration vs. over-medication vs. infection.  Infectious work-up has
   been negative to date.   CT head negative for acute process or e/o
   metastatic disease.
   - Plan to reassess this issue following resolution of acute
   decompensation
   7)Abdominal pain:  Unclear cause.  [**Month (only) 51**] be steroid induced gastritis vs.
   pain from duodenal ulcer vs. ulcer perforation vs. worsened AAA vs. abd
   infection.  Will check amylase and lipase, get a KUB to evaluate for
   free air and persue an abd CT.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of metastatic lung cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and a perforated duodenal ulcer. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. He is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and antifungal treatment. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about potential complications such as respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition indicates respiratory failure due to aspiration and Klebsiella pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and airway pressures is necessary. The patient may require further interventions such as bronchoscopy or tracheostomy.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels and declining urine output suggest acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis. Renal dose medications should be adjusted, and nephrotoxic agents should be avoided. Monitoring of electrolytes and respiratory status is crucial.

3. Infection: The patient is at high risk for nosocomial infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Elevation of the head of bed, daily weaning of sedation, and maintaining respiratory synchrony are important preventive measures. Cultures and appropriate antibiotics should be initiated if there are signs of infection.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of cardiovascular disease, recent diagnosis of metastatic lung cancer, and current presentation of bleeding duodenal ulcer leading to perforation. The patient underwent an omental patch procedure and is now in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure caused by aspiration during the endoscopic examination. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as well.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and urine output is decreasing, indicating potential acute renal failure. This may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension or other factors.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and it is important to monitor his hemoglobin and hematocrit levels regularly.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can lead to poor cardiac output and increased risk of thromboembolic events.
5. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Meropenem and Vancomycin) due to the risk of hospital-acquired infections such as VAP. There is also concern for Klebsiella pneumonia.
6. Cancer Malignancy: The patient has metastatic lung cancer and is undergoing palliative radiation treatment.
