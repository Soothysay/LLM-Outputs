   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old female with metastatic melanoma (known
   brain mets, adrenal mets), who presented with nausea and hypotension
   now being transfered to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and
   respiratory distress, concerning for sepsis vs effects of metastatic
   cancer. Overnight improved with decreased requirement of levophed but
   continued anuria.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely multifactorial:
   1) vasovagal response during chemo
   2) volume depletion (in the setting of chemotherapy and poor PO intake)
   3) sepsis (given her leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and fever)
   presumed source urinary or gastroentestinal.
   4) PEs (but very small on on CTA, without RVS or hypoxia)
   5) adrenal insufficiency (given history of metastases to adrenals, TB
   and lower than expected cortisol 8.6)
   6) tachycardia (afib vs MAT).
   - Repleting steroid at sepsis dose given known h/o TB, adrenal mets and
   cortisol lower than would be expected in sepsis (8.6)
   - Currently appears fluid resuscitated with CVP 13-14. No TR or RV
   dysfunction on prelim of echo, will f/u final read. NS per CVP <8 as
   tolerated by respiratory status.
   - Continue broad coverage: CTX, vanco, cipro, and f/u cultures
   (currently GNR in blood from [**3-14**] and [**3-15**])
   - Repeat CXR with evidence of fluid overload
   - Wean pressors as tolerated.
   - Given metastases, small size, and need for procedures, holding
   heparin at present.
   .
   # Tachycardia: Patient flips between sinus tachycardia (rate 90-120) to
   what appears to be atrial fibrillation vs MAT with rate >140s. Line
   appeared appropriately placed but pulled back 2cm for certainty without
   change. Seems to be responsive to fluids and amiodarone.
   - cont amiodarone
   - IVF prn CVP
   - Pain control via tylenol and morphine.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Resolved. Suspect this may have been secondary
   to the tachycardia. No evidence of PNA on CXR. Patient does have small
   subsegmental PE's, however no significant hypoxia or tachynpea.
   - Serial CXRs for evidence of fluid overload.
   - Anticoagulation held for initial concern of facial asymmetry/ICB (CT
   neg)
   - on pneumoboots, can consider lovenox
   .
   # [**Doctor First Name **]: Pt anuric, Cr up to 1.6 from 1. Likely ATN in setting of
   hypovolemia.
   - renally dose meds, avoid contrast and toxins
   .
   # Abdominal discomfort, nausea: Could have been secondary to
   chemotherapy, or possibly indolent gastroenteritis.
   - Checking C. difficile toxin, anti-emetics, morphine
   - Consider additional abdominal imaging once patient is more stable
   .
   # Metastatic Melanoma: s/p 2nd cycle dacarbazine [**2120-3-13**].
   - Oncologist following
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding home BP medications.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: [**2-5**] partial thyroidectomy
   - Continue Levoxyl
   .
   # GERD/hiatal hernia: continue omeprazole, anti-emetics prn

","Summary of Progress Note:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 81-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and known brain and adrenal metastases. She presented with nausea and hypotension and was transferred to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress, concerning for sepsis versus the effects of metastatic cancer. Overnight, she improved with a decreased requirement of levophed but continued to be anuric.

The patient has multiple medical conditions including hypertension, hypothyroidism, GERD/hiatal hernia, and metastatic melanoma. She has been receiving chemotherapy treatment.

In the ICU, the patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has received fluids and pressors as needed. She has also been given anti-emetics and pain control medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory distress raises concern for sepsis. The elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and fever support this possibility. A potential source of infection could be urinary or gastrointestinal.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's anuria and elevated creatinine level suggest the possibility of acute kidney injury, likely due to hypovolemia.
3. Pneumonia: Although the patient's respiratory distress has resolved, the presence of small subsegmental pulmonary embolisms raises concern for possible pneumonia."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old female with metastatic melanoma admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, tachycardia, and shock. She was diagnosed with a GNR urinary tract infection (UTI) and sepsis, resulting in multiorgan failure with shock. The patient was also found to have atrial fibrillation, which was converted back to sinus rhythm using amiodarone. She had small subsegmental pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and is not currently on anticoagulation. The patient has acute renal insufficiency, likely due to hypotension and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Her blood pressure remains low, and she is oliguric. Renally dose medications are being administered, and renal function will be re-evaluated later.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension from sepsis/adrenal insufficiency: The patient's low blood pressure can be attributed to sepsis and adrenal insufficiency. Although the patient has shown improvement and no longer requires pressors, there is still a risk of recurrent hypotension.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient experienced rapid atrial fibrillation, which was likely triggered by severe sepsis. She was successfully converted to sinus rhythm using amiodarone, but close monitoring is necessary due to the potential for recurrence. The decision to discontinue amiodarone infusion tomorrow should be carefully considered.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with metastatic melanoma who presented with nausea and hypotension. She is now in the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress could be indicative of sepsis, especially considering the presence of GNR in urine and blood. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and response to antibiotics is necessary.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (ATN): The patient's anuria and elevated creatinine level suggest the possibility of acute kidney injury, likely secondary to hypovolemia. Renal dosing of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins should be considered.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to drug effect from vancomycin or secondary to chemotherapy (dacarbazine). Monitoring of platelet count and considering alternative antibiotics if necessary.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's rapid heart rate and irregular rhythm may indicate atrial fibrillation. Close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm, as well as controlling the rate with amiodarone, is essential.

5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be attributed to several factors, including sepsis, volume depletion,"

   now being transfered to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and
   respiratory distress, concerning for sepsis vs effects of metastatic
   cancer. Overnight improved with decreased requirement of levophed but
   continued anuria.
   # Hypotension: Likely multifactorial:
   1) urosepsis GNR in urine and blood
   2) volume depletion (in the setting of chemotherapy and poor PO intake)
   3) adrenal insufficiency (given history of metastases to adrenals, TB
   and lower than expected cortisol 8.6)
   4) tachycardia (afib vs MAT).
   Less likely vasovagal response during chemo and effects of PEs as very
   small on on CTA, without RVS or hypoxia)
   - Continue broad gram negative coverage: CTX, cipro, and f/u cultures
   and sensis
   - stop Vancomycin
   - Repleting steroid at sepsis dose given known h/o TB, adrenal mets and
   cortisol lower than would be expected in sepsis
   - Currently appears fluid resuscitated with CVP 13-14 and CXR with
   fluid increase. No TR or RV dysfunction on prelim of echo, will f/u

   - off pressors
   # Tachycardia: Patient flips between sinus tachycardia (rate 90-120) to
   what appears to be atrial fibrillation vs MAT with rate >140s. Line
   appeared appropriately placed but pulled back 2cm for certainty without
   change. Seems to be responsive to fluids and amiodarone.
   - cont amiodarone today and hopefully stop tomorrow

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, who presented with nausea and hypotension. She is now in the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis, effects of metastatic cancer, atrial fibrillation, hypotension (not in shock), hypocalcemia, renal failure, and tachycardia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): The patient is currently experiencing episodes of sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. Treatment includes amiodarone and IV fluids.
2. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's hypotension is likely multifactorial, including urosepsis, volume depletion, adrenal insufficiency, and tachycardia. Treatment includes broad gram-negative coverage, repleting steroids, and fluid resuscitation.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to several factors such as urosepsis, volume depletion, adrenal insufficiency, and tachycardia. Treatment includes fluid resuscitation and broad gram-negative coverage.
4. Hypocalcemia: The patient has low calcium levels. Treatment includes calcium supplementation.
5. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's anuria and elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. Treatment includes"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with metastatic melanoma who has been admitted to the ICU with sepsis. The patient has a history of chemotherapy and is currently experiencing several medical complications. These include atrial fibrillation (afib), hypotension (not in shock), hypocalcemia (low calcium), acute renal failure, and tachycardia.

The patient's vital signs show intermittent hypotension and tachycardia, requiring the use of Levophed and fluid boluses. The patient's lungs are clear, and she is alert and oriented. However, she has ecchymoses in the lower left quadrant with superficial tenderness. There is no edema in the extremities, but there is decreased skin turgor with skin tenting.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, elevated lactate levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient also has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of [**1-6**].

The assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for sepsis with E. coli, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, hypocalcemia, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition is improving overall but still requires intermittent use of Levophed and amiodarone.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

   now being transfered to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and
   respiratory distress, concerning for sepsis vs effects of metastatic
   cancer. Overnight improved with decreased requirement of levophed but
   continued anuria.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION - Likely multifactorial: urosepsis
   GNR in urine and blood, volume depletion (in the setting of
   chemotherapy and poor PO intake), tachycardia (afib vs MAT).
   Less likely vasovagal response during chemo and effects of PEs as very
   small on on CTA, without RVS or hypoxia)
   - Narrowed abx to cipro as pan-sensi E coli
   - Vancomycin, CTX d/c
   - Currently appears fluid resuscitated with CVP 13-14 and CXR with
   fluid increase. No TR or RV dysfunction on prelim of echo, will f/u
   final read. NS per CVP <8 as tolerated by respiratory status.
   - off pressors
 TACHYCARDIA, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Patient flips between sinus
   tachycardia (rate 90-120) to what appears to be atrial fibrillation
   with rate >140s. Line appeared appropriately placed but pulled back 2cm
   for certainty without change. Seems to be responsive to fluids and
   amiodarone.
   - completed amiodarone gtt, now rate-controlled
   - IVF prn CVP
   - Pain control via tylenol and morphine.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect drug effect from Vancomycin now d/c
   Less likely HIT as time course is off (4-T score is 3), also possbily
   secondary to dacarbazine.
   - Trend plts for now
   - No plan to start argatroban as pt
s HIT probability unlikely
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Pt oligouric, Cr up
   to 1.6 from 1. Likely ATN in setting of hypovolemia.
   - renally dose meds, avoid contrast and toxins
   # Metastatic Melanoma: s/p 2nd cycle dacarbazine [**2120-3-13**].
   - Oncologist following

","Summary of Progress Note:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **], an 81-year-old female with metastatic melanoma (known brain mets, adrenal mets), presented with nausea and hypotension. She was transferred to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress, concerning for sepsis vs effects of metastatic cancer. Overnight, she improved with a decreased requirement of levophed but continued anuria.

The patient has a history of metastatic melanoma, with known brain and adrenal metastases. She was admitted to the ICU due to her worsening condition. The initial assessment included sepsis with suspected urosepsis, volume depletion, tachycardia (atrial fibrillation vs metastatic melanoma-associated thrombosis), and less likely vasovagal response during chemotherapy and effects of pulmonary embolism. Fluid resuscitation was provided, and narrow-spectrum antibiotics were initiated.

The patient also had thrombocytopenia, suspected to be due to drug effect from vancomycin, which was discontinued. Renal failure, acute renal failure (ATN), and metastatic melanoma were also noted. The patient's hypertension and hypothyroidism medications were held.

In terms of ICU care, the patient received ensure nutrition, glycemic control, arterial and multi-lumen lines, and stress ulcer prophylaxis. Communication status was set as DNR/DNI, and disposition was called out.

   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old female with metastatic melanoma (known
   brain mets, adrenal mets), who presented with nausea and hypotension
   now being transfered to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and
   respiratory distress, concerning for sepsis vs effects of metastatic
   cancer. Overnight improved with decreased requirement of levophed but
   continued anuria.
 UROSEPSIS:
   - Narrowed abx to cipro as pan-sensi E coli
 continue cipro 400 IV q12
   day # 5
   - Vancomycin, CTX d/c
ed x 48hrs
   - Currently appears fluid resuscitated with CVP 13-14 and CXR with
   fluid increase. No TR or RV dysfunction on prelim of echo, will f/u
   final read. NS per CVP <8 as tolerated by respiratory status.
   - off pressors
   - Wean stress dose steroids to hydrocortisone 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - f/u blood cx, ensure pt cleared infection
 TACHYCARDIA, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Patient flips between sinus
   tachycardia (rate 90-120) to what appears to be atrial fibrillation
   with rate >140s. Line appeared appropriately placed but pulled back 2cm
   for certainty without change. Seems to be responsive to fluids,
   metoprolol and amiodarone.
   - completed amiodarone gtt, now off but continues to flip into
   tachycardia.
   - stable on metop 12.5 TID
   - repleting calcium now that ceftriaxone out of system
   - Pain control via tylenol and morphine.
   # [**Name (NI) 4860**] PE
 pt now being treated w/ heparin gtt, pt will likely
   start lovenox tomorrow, holding off for now as pt
s renal function
   still not at baseline yet.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect drug effect from Vancomycin now d/c
   Less likely HIT as time course is off (4-T score is 3), also possbily
   secondary to dacarbazine.
   - continue to trend
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Cr peaked at 1.7
   from 1, now 1.4. Likely ATN in setting of hypovolemia.  Starting to
   have increased UOP.
   - renally dose meds, avoid contrast and toxins
   # Metastatic Melanoma: s/p 2nd cycle dacarbazine [**2120-3-13**].

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old female with metastatic melanoma (known
   brain mets, adrenal mets), who presented with nausea and hypotension
   now being transfered to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and
   respiratory distress, concerning for sepsis vs effects of metastatic
   cancer. Overnight improved with decreased requirement of levophed but
   continued anuria.
 UROSEPSIS:
   - Narrowed abx to cipro as pan-sensi E coli
   - Vancomycin, CTX d/c
ed x 48hrs
   - Currently appears fluid resuscitated with CVP 13-14 and CXR with
   fluid increase. No TR or RV dysfunction on prelim of echo, will f/u
   final read. NS per CVP <8 as tolerated by respiratory status.
   - off pressors
   - Wean stress dose steroids
 TACHYCARDIA, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Patient flips between sinus
   tachycardia (rate 90-120) to what appears to be atrial fibrillation
   with rate >140s. Line appeared appropriately placed but pulled back 2cm
   for certainty without change. Seems to be responsive to fluids,
   metoprolol and amiodarone.
   - completed amiodarone gtt, now off but continues to flip into
   tachycardia.
   - will start standing BB
   - repleting calcium now that ceftriaxone out of system
   - Pain control via tylenol and morphine.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Suspect drug effect from Vancomycin now d/c
   Less likely HIT as time course is off (4-T score is 3), also possbily
   secondary to dacarbazine.
   - continue to trend
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Cr peaked at 1.7
   from 1, now 1.4. Likely ATN in setting of hypovolemia.  Starting to
   have increased UOP.
   - renally dose meds, avoid contrast and toxins
   # Metastatic Melanoma: s/p 2nd cycle dacarbazine [**2120-3-13**].
   - Oncologist following
   # Hypertension: Holding home BP medications.
   # Hypothyroidism: [**2-5**] partial thyroidectomy
   - Continue Levoxyl
   # GERD/hiatal hernia: continue omeprazole, anti-emetics prn

","Summary:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 81-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, including brain and adrenal metastases. She presented with nausea and hypotension and is now in the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis versus effects of metastatic cancer. Overnight, she showed improvement with a decreased requirement of levophed but continued to have anuria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: Narrowed antibiotics to cipro as pan-sensitivity to E. coli, discontinued vancomycin and CTX after 48 hours. Fluid resuscitation was provided, and the patient appeared to be responding well.
2. Tachycardia and Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient flipped between sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with rates over 140 beats per minute. The arterial line appeared appropriately placed, but it was pulled back 2 cm for certainty without change. The patient responded to fluids, metoprolol, and amiodarone.
3. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): Creatinine peaked at 1.7 from 1.0 and is now 1.4. It is likely acute tubular necrosis in the setting of hypovolemia. Increased urine output was observed, indicating the start of recovery.
4. Thrombocytopenia: Suspected"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with a medical history of melanoma, who presented with e.coli sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection (UTI). She has been diagnosed with septic shock, arterial line stopped, and underwent an ultrasound. The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) that resolved with rest and one dose of intravenous lopressor. She is currently in sinus rhythm and denies any pain or discomfort. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for nausea and anemia. Vital signs show a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/54 to 197/177 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with a total input of 2,736 mL and output of 1,110 mL. The patient is receiving multiple medications including metoprolol, heparin sodium, and ciprofloxacin. Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.9 K/uL, elevated lactate levels, and acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL. Imaging shows no significant abnormalities. Assessment and plan include resolving sepsis, managing pulmonary embolism (PE), controlling atrial fibrillation, and addressing acute renal failure. The"

","The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of melanoma, presenting with septic shock secondary to an E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has been receiving intravenous (IV) antibiotics, specifically ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. 

During the hospital stay, the patient experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) but was successfully controlled with rest and metoprolol. The patient's breathing is comfortable, and they deny any pain.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 113 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) ranging from 117/54 to 197/177 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.1 degrees Celsius.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and elevated creatinine (Cr) level. The platelet count, blood glucose, and liver function tests are within normal limits. 

The patient's blood cultures were positive for E. coli, confirming the diagnosis of sepsis. The patient's condition has improved since the initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy. The assessment plan includes continuing IV ciprofloxacin, rechecking blood cultures,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and known brain and adrenal metastases. She presented with nausea and hypotension, and is now being transferred to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is showing signs of infection, such as fever and elevated white blood cell count, which may lead to sepsis.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, indicating difficulty breathing, which may be due to pneumonia or fluid accumulation in the lungs.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function, which can be caused by dehydration or direct damage from metastatic cancer.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which could be due to sepsis, dehydration, or medication side effects.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently high, which could be a response to infection, pain, or stress.
6. Anuria: The patient is not producing urine, indicating a possible kidney issue or side effect of medication.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to medication side effects or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 year old female with metastatic melanoma (known
   brain mets, adrenal mets), who presented with nausea and hypotension
   now being transfered to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and
   respiratory distress, concerning for sepsis vs effects of metastatic
   cancer. Overnight improved with decreased requirement of levophed but
   continued anuria.
 UROSEPSIS:
   - Narrowed abx to cipro as pan-sensi E coli
 continue cipro 400 IV q12
   day [**6-16**]
   - Vancomycin, CTX d/c
ed x 48hrs
   - off levophed x>48h
   - Wean stress dose steroids to hydrocortisone 25 [**Hospital1 **] (intended to wean
   to [**Hospital1 **] yesterday but order not processed)
   - f/u blood cx, ensure pt cleared infection
 TACHYCARDIA, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Patient flips between sinus
   tachycardia (rate 90-120) to what appears to be atrial fibrillation
   with rate >140s. Line appeared appropriately placed but pulled back 2cm
   for certainty without change. Seems to be responsive to fluids,
   metoprolol and amiodarone.
   - completed amiodarone loading dose
   - stable on metop 12.5 TID
   - repleting calcium now that ceftriaxone out of system
   - Pain control via tylenol and morphine.
   # Subsegmental PE
 On heparin gtt this am.
   - Per primary oncologist okay to start anticoagulation despite known
   brain mets.
   - Start lovenox and d/c heparin gtt as renal fxn now normalized
   # Thrombocytopenia: Ddx includes med effect (vanco, dacarbazine and
   heparin) most likely. Pt has no prior h/o thrombocytopenia in the past.
   Per primary oncologist the pt is likely at nadir following chemo, did
   not think that HIT Ab indicated (as timing off).
   - Trend plts

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Cr peaked at 1.7
   from 1, now 0.9. Was likely ATN now resolving.
   - Trend creatinine
   # Metastatic Melanoma: s/p 2nd cycle dacarbazine [**2120-3-13**].
   - Primary oncologist ([**Doctor Last Name 4894**], [**Doctor Last Name 4895**]) following
   # Hypertension: Holding home BP medications.
   # Hypothyroidism: [**2-5**] partial thyroidectomy
   - Continue Levoxyl
   # GERD/hiatal hernia: continue omeprazole, anti-emetics prn

","Summary:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 81-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and known brain and adrenal metastases. She presented with nausea and hypotension, and was transferred to the ICU for tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress. The patient has shown improvement overnight with decreased requirement of levophed but continues to have anuria. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension (not in shock), hypocalcemia (low calcium), acute renal failure, and impaired balance, aerobic capacity/endurance, knowledge, gait, and impaired atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory distress are concerning for sepsis. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs and blood cultures to assess for any signs of infection.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. It is necessary to monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust treatment accordingly.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to medication effects or chemotherapy. Regular monitoring of platelet levels and Trending plts is advised.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has been diagnosed with a subsegmental pulmonary embolism and is on he"
