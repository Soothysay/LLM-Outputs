   Assessment and Plan
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
   86 year old female with afib, CHF, DM2, CKD, and recurrent UTIs who
   presents with UTI and likely pyelonephritis.
   .
   # Urinary tract infection/?Pyelonephritis: UA notable for bacturia,
   pyuria, and mod leuks, and CT abdomen w/ bilateral perinephric
   stranding.  Her leukocytosis also points toward an infectious
   etiology.  Her CT scan and ARF is concerning for possible
   pyelonephritis.
   - Cont meropenem, concerned for possible resistant organsim given
   history of UTIs.
   - Follow up blood and urine cultures
   - Follow up final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   .
   # RUQ Pain: Likely referred pain from UTI and concerning for possible
   pyelo given CT findings of perinephric stranding. Other etiology
   includes cholecystitis, choledocholelithiasis, and cholangitis though
   less likely given mildly elevated AP/AST on a hemolyzed specimen,
   otherwise T bili not elevated to indicate cholestatic picture.  Also
   prelim read of CT abdomen/pelvis was not able to visualize
   gallbladder.  CT abdomen not notable for other inflammatory or
   infectious process intraabdominally.  Gyn source such as PID, ovarian
   torsion possibility though less likely in the presence of UTI.
   - Follow LFTs
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - Consider RUQ US
   - Treat UTI as above
   .
   # Hypotension: Etiology infectious vs cardiogenic.  With elevated
   lactate, leukocytosis, and positive UA sepsis is concerning.
   Complicated by patient's sCHF w/ poor forward flow.
   - Closely monitoring hemodynamics, UO, mentation as patient is refusing
   pressors and central line placement
   - Will hold on fluids, getting fluids from iv abx
   - Goal MAP > 60, if drops will give gentle ivfs (250-500cc)
   - Holding beta-blocker, ACE-I, diuresis
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Creatinine remains elevated, likely
   pre-renal, with recent increase in bumex.
   - hold ACE-I
   - hold Bumex
   - cautious and gentle IVFs prn
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient with baseline EF 10% and poor foward

","Summary:
- The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, chronic kidney disease, and recurrent urinary tract infections.
- She presents with symptoms of a urinary tract infection and likely pyelonephritis.
- The patient's vital signs show hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels, which may indicate sepsis.
- She has a history of chronic systolic heart failure with poor forward flow.
- Laboratory results indicate renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated liver enzymes.
- The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and refuses invasive measures such as central line placement and pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels, hypotension, and positive urine analysis suggest a possible infectious process leading to sepsis.
2. Pyelonephritis: The presence of urinary symptoms, leukocytosis, and CT findings of bilateral perinephric stranding indicate a possible kidney infection.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest worsening renal function, likely due to pre-renal causes.
4. Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient's history of heart failure and poor forward flow may contribute to her current symptoms.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to sepsis"

   Assessment and Plan
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
   86 year old female with afib, CHF, DM2, CKD, and recurrent UTIs who
   presents with UTI and likely pyelonephritis.
   .
   # Urinary tract infection/?Pyelonephritis: UA notable for bacturia,
   pyuria, and mod leuks, and CT abdomen w/ bilateral perinephric
   stranding.  Her leukocytosis also points toward an infectious
   etiology.  Her CT scan and ARF is concerning for possible
   pyelonephritis. RUQ U/S is unusual for pyelo.
   - Cont meropenem, concerned for possible resistant organsim given
   history of UTIs.
   - Follow up blood and urine cultures
   - Follow up final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   .
   # RUQ Pain: Likely referred pain from UTI and concerning for possible
   pyelo given CT findings of perinephric stranding. Other etiology
   includes cholecystitis, choledocholelithiasis, and cholangitis though
   less likely given mildly elevated AP/AST on a hemolyzed specimen,
   otherwise T bili not elevated to indicate cholestatic picture.  Also
   prelim read of CT abdomen/pelvis was not able to visualize
   gallbladder.  CT abdomen not notable for other inflammatory or
   infectious process intraabdominally.  Gyn source such as PID, ovarian
   torsion possibility though less likely in the presence of UTI.
   - Follow LFTs
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - Obtain RUQ US
   - Treat UTI as above
   .
   # Hypotension: Etiology infectious vs cardiogenic.  With elevated
   lactate, leukocytosis, and positive UA sepsis is concerning.
   Complicated by patient's sCHF w/ poor forward flow.
   - Closely monitoring hemodynamics, UO, mentation as patient is refusing
   pressors and central line placement
   - Will hold on fluids, getting fluids from iv abx
   - Start metoprolol 25mg PO QID for rate control, which should help her
   BPs given AF
   - Goal MAP > 60, if drops will give gentle ivfs (250-500cc)
   - Holding ACE-I, diuresis
   - Encourage PO intake
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Creatinine remains elevated, likely
   pre-renal, with recent increase in bumex.
   - hold ACE-I
   - hold Bumex
   - cautious and gentle IVFs prn
   - Obtain urine lytes (FeUrea), sediment
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF: Compensated. Probably euvolemic and
   cephalization on CXR may be chronic. Patient with baseline EF 10% and
   poor foward flow.  While given concern for infectious process, possible
   superimposed cardiac decompensation as well.  However, patient has
   expressed that she does not want invasive measures will need to be
   monitored closely
   - Hold ACE-I and metoprolol for now given hypotension
   - holding bumex
   - Given her stability will not diurese
   .
   # Afib on Coumadin: Stable. Currently rate-controlled.  Coumadin dose
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] hold dose tonight and check INR with am labs.
   - clarify coumadin dose w/ daughter
   - start coumadin today given subtherapeutic
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding beta-blocker and ACE-I as above.
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus, type II: Will hold metformin given renal failure.
   Will hold long-acting night insulin given hypoglycemia earlier today.
   -HISS for now.
   .
   # Depression: Cont. citalopram
   .
   # GERD - Cont. omeprazole

","Summary:
The patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, chronic kidney disease, and recurrent urinary tract infections. She presents with symptoms of a urinary tract infection and likely pyelonephritis. The patient's vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 90/52 mmHg and a heart rate of 92 bpm. She has a fever of 35.4 degrees Celsius and an oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles, mild jugular venous distension, and trace pitting edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urinary tract infection (UTI) with possible pyelonephritis: The patient's symptoms, including fever, leukocytosis, and the presence of bacteriuria and pyuria on urinalysis, along with the CT scan findings of bilateral perinephric stranding, suggest an infectious etiology. This could potentially lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to an infectious or cardiogenic cause. Given the elevated lactate levels and positive urine analysis, sepsis is a concern. The patient's history of congestive heart failure (CHF) with poor forward flow may also contribute to the hypotension.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creat"

 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
   86 year old female with afib, CHF, DM2, CKD, and recurrent UTIs who
   presents with UTI and likely pyelonephritis.

   # Urinary tract infection/?Pyelonephritis: UA notable for bacturia,
   pyuria, and mod leuks, and CT abdomen w/ bilateral perinephric
   stranding.  Her leukocytosis also points toward an infectious
   etiology.  Her CT scan and ARF is concerning for possible
   pyelonephritis.
   - Treat w/ meropenem, concerned for possible resistant organsim given
   history of UTIs.
   - Add on urine culture
   - Follow up blood and urine cultures
   - Follow up final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   .
   # RUQ Pain: Likely referred pain from UTI and concerning for possible
   pyelo given CT findings of perinephric stranding. Other etiology
   includes cholecystitis, choledocholelithiasis, and cholangitis.  She
   had mildly elevated AP/AST on a hemolyzed specimen, otherwise T bili
   not elevated to indicate cholestatic picture.  Prelim read of CT
   abdomen/pelvis was not able to visualize gallbladder, these less
   likely.  CT abdomen not notable for other inflammatory or infectious
   process intraabdominally.  Gyn source such as PID, ovarian torsion
   possibility though less likely in the presence of UTI.
   - Follow LFTs
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - Consider RUQ US
   - Treat UTI as above
   .
   # Hypotension: Etiology infectious vs cardiogenic.  With elevated
   lactate, leukocytosis, and positive UA sepsis is concerning.  This is
   complicated by patient's poor systolic function and forward flow.  As
   she is refusing pressors and is DNR/DNI will need to carefully monitor
   patient's blood pressures, MAPs, urine output, mentation, and I's/O's.
   For now will not give any further fluids, she is getting fluids from IV
   antibiotics.
   - Goal MAP > 60
   - Follow urine output
   - Gentle IVFs as needed, 250cc-500cc boluses
   - Holding beta-blocker, ACE-I

   # Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Creatinine 2.2.  Last creatinine 1.6
   on [**2111-1-17**], however, her Bumex has since been increased, so difficult
   to know how much of her current increase is related to this illness vs.
   higher dose of diuretics.
   - hold ACE-I
   - hold Bumex
   - gentle IVFs prn
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient with baseline EF 10% and poor foward
   flow.  Will be a delicate balance between supporting blood pressure
   while avoiding worsening heart failure.
   - Hold ACE-I and metoprolol for now given hypotension
   .
   # Afib on Coumadin: Stable. Currently rate-controlled.  Coumadin dose
   unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] hold dose tonight and check INR with am labs.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). The patient presents with symptoms of a UTI and likely pyelonephritis.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis: The patient has bacteriuria, pyuria, and moderate leukocytes in the urine analysis, along with bilateral perinephric stranding on the CT abdomen. This indicates a possible infection in the kidneys. Treatment with meropenem is recommended, considering the history of UTIs. Follow-up blood and urine cultures are also advised.

2. RUQ pain: Referred pain from the UTI is likely, and the CT findings suggest possible pyelitis. Other etiologies such as cholecystitis, choledocholelithiasis, and cholangitis should be considered as well. Follow-up liver function tests (LFTs) and serial abdominal exams are planned. An RUQ ultrasound may be considered.

3. Hypotension: The etiology of the patient's hypotension is uncertain, with possibilities including infectious or cardiogenic causes. Elevated lactate, leukocytosis, and positive urine analysis suggest sepsis. Given the"

   Assessment and Plan
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
   86 year old female with afib, CHF, DM2, CKD, and recurrent UTIs who
   presents with UTI and likely pyelonephritis.
   .
   # RUQ Pain: Possibly referred pain from UTI and concerning for possible
   pyelo given CT findings of perinephric stranding. Other etiology
   includes cholecystitis, choledocholelithiasis, and cholangitis though
   only w/ mildly elevated AP/AST; T bili not elevated to indicate
   cholestatic picture.  Also prelim read of CT abdomen/pelvis was not
   able to visualize gallbladder.  Will need to further evaluate w/ RUQ
   US. CT abdomen not notable for other inflammatory or infectious process
   intraabdominally.  Gyn source such as PID, ovarian torsion possibility
   though less likely in the presence of UTI.
   - Follow LFTs
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - RUQ US
   - Treat UTI
   - Treat broadly w/ meropenem (pt pcn allergic); need ID approval
   .
   # Urinary tract infection/?Pyelonephritis: UA notable for bacturia,
   pyuria, and mod leuks, and CT abdomen w/ bilateral perinephric
   stranding.  Her leukocytosis also points toward an infectious
   etiology.  Her CT scan and ARF is concerning for possible
   pyelonephritis, though patient w/o CVT on exam.
   - Cont meropenem, concerned for possible resistant organsim given
   history of UTIs.
   - Follow up blood and urine cultures
   - Follow up final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Urine sediments
   .
   # Hypotension: Etiology infectious vs cardiogenic.  With elevated
   lactate, leukocytosis, and positive UA sepsis is concerning.
   Complicated by patient's sCHF w/ poor forward flow.
   - Closely monitoring hemodynamics, UO, mentation as patient is refusing
   pressors and central line placement
   - Will hold on fluids, getting fluids from iv abx
   - Start metoprolol 25mg PO QID for rate control, which should help her
   BPs given AF
   - Goal MAP > 60, if drops will give gentle ivfs (250-500cc)
   - Holding ACE-I, diuresis
   - Encourage PO intake
   - Treat w/ broad abx
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Creatinine remains elevated, likely
   pre-renal, with recent increase in bumex.
   - hold ACE-I
   - hold Bumex
   - cautious and gentle IVFs prn
   - Obtain urine lytes (FeUrea), sediment
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF: Compensated. Probably euvolemic and
   cephalization on CXR may be chronic. Patient with baseline EF 10% and
   poor foward flow.  While given concern for infectious process, possible
   superimposed cardiac decompensation as well.  However, patient has
   expressed that she does not want invasive measures will need to be
   monitored closely
   - Hold ACE-I
   - holding bumex
   - Given her stability will not diurese
   .
   # Afib on Coumadin: Stable. Currently rate-controlled.  Coumadin dose
   unclear.
   - clarify coumadin dose w/ daughter
   - start coumadin today given subtherapeutic
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding beta-blocker and ACE-I as above.
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus, type II: Hold metformin given renal failure,
   likely should not be restarted in the setting of her chronic renal
   disease.  Will hold long-acting night insulin given hypoglycemia
   earlier today.
   -HISS for now.
   .
   # Depression: Cont. citalopram
   .
   # GERD - Cont. omeprazole

She presents with symptoms of a UTI and likely pyelonephritis, as well as abdominal pain possibly due to referred pain from the UTI or cholecystitis. The patient has hypotension with elevated lactate levels, leukocytosis, and positive urine analysis suggesting sepsis. She also has acute-on-chronic renal failure with pre-renal azotemia, chronic systolic CHF, and AF on Coumadin. The patient's blood glucose levels are unstable, and she has depression and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) for which she is taking citalopram and omeprazole, respectively.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urinary tract infection (UTI) and pyelonephritis: The patient's symptoms, including fever, flank pain, and dysuria, along with laboratory findings such as leukocytosis and bacteriuria, suggest a UTI. The presence of perinephric stranding on the CT scan raises concern for pyelonephritis, which is a more severe infection involving the kidneys. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated promptly, and further evaluation with urine cultures and follow-up imaging may be necessary"

   Assessment and Plan
 PYELONEPHRITIS: CT abdomen and findings on UA are consistent albeit
   location of tenderness on exam is more RUQ.  Since unable to visualize
   GB on CT will also evaluate with RUQ US.  Agree with broad spectrum
   antibiotics.  Follow up on culture data.
 HYPOTENSION:  Secondary to sepsis vs. cardiogenic component with
   known poor LVEF (~10%).  Also had recently been increased on her bumex
   as an outpatient, may be relatively intravascularly depleted.
   Responded to gently volume resusitation.  Maintain even I/Os.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Secondary to hypotension, poor
   forward flow given poor EF and recent doubling of bumex dose. Cr
   trending down. Good urine output. Check urine electrolytes and
   sediment.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Will restart her beta blocker first, would not
   tolerate rapid rate so hesitant holding off on restarting meds for rate
   control.  Continue to monitor in ICU.  Subtherapeutic on coumadin, will
   clarify dose and restart today.
 DIABETES:  Held outpatient meds, on RISS.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with afib, CHF, DM2, CKD, and recurrent UTIs who
   presents with UTI and likely pyelonephritis.
   # RUQ Pain: Possibly referred pain from UTI and concerning for possible
   pyelo given CT findings of perinephric stranding. Other etiology
   includes cholecystitis, choledocholelithiasis, and cholangitis though
   only w/ mildly elevated AP/AST; T bili not elevated to indicate
   cholestatic picture.  Also prelim read of CT abdomen/pelvis was not
   able to visualize gallbladder.  Will need to further evaluate w/ RUQ
   US. CT abdomen not notable for other inflammatory or infectious process
   intraabdominally.  Gyn source such as PID, ovarian torsion possibility
   though less likely in the presence of UTI.
   - Follow LFTs
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - RUQ US
   - Treat UTI
   - Treat broadly w/ meropenem (pt pcn allergic); need ID approval
   # Pyelonephritis:
   - Cont meropenem, concerned for possible resistant organsim given
   history of UTIs.
   - Follow up blood and urine cultures
   - Follow up final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Urine sediments
   # Hypotension:
   Etiology infectious vs cardiogenic.  With elevated lactate,
   leukocytosis, and positive UA sepsis is concerning.  Complicated by
   patient's sCHF w/ poor forward flow.
   - Maintain even I/Os.
   - Will hold on fluids, getting fluids from iv abx
   - Start metoprolol 25mg PO QID for rate control, which should help her
   BPs given AF
   - Goal MAP > 60, if drops will give gentle ivfs (250-500cc)
   - Holding ACE-I, diuresis
   # Acute on Chronic Renal failure - holding ACE-I
   - holding Bumex
   - cautious and gentle IVFs prn
   - Obtain urine lytes (FeUrea), sediment
   # Chronic Systolic CHF: Compensated. Probably euvolemic and
   cephalization on CXR may be chronic. Patient with baseline EF 10% and
   poor foward flow.  While given concern for infectious process, possible
   superimposed cardiac decompensation as well.  However, patient has
   expressed that she does not want invasive measures will need to be
   monitored closely
   - Hold ACE-I
   - holding bumex
   - Given her stability will not diurese
   # Afib on Coumadin: Stable. Currently rate-controlled.  Coumadin dose
   unclear.
   - clarify coumadin dose w/ daughter
   - start coumadin today given subtherapeutic
   - continue metoprolol
   # Diabetes mellitus, type II: Hold metformin given renal failure,
   likely should not be restarted in the setting of her chronic renal
   disease.  Will hold long-acting night insulin given hypoglycemia
   earlier today.
   -HISS for now
   # Depression: Cont. citalopram
   # GERD - Cont. omeprazole

Other possible etiologies include cholecystitis, choledocholelithiasis, and cholangitis, but these are less likely. There is no evidence of gallbladder inflammation on CT abdomen/pelvis. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, acute on chronic renal failure, chronic systolic CHF, and atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pyelonephritis: The patient has signs and symptoms suggestive of pyelonephritis, which is an infection of the kidneys. This condition can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may be due to an infectious or cardiogenic cause. Given the elevated lactate levels, leukocytosis, and positive urine analysis for infection, sepsis is a concern. The patient's CHF with poor forward flow may contribute to the hypotension.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal"

","The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, chronic kidney disease, and recurrent urinary tract infections. She presents with symptoms of a urinary tract infection and likely pyelonephritis. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/79 mmHg to 80/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and a sinus rhythm. 

Her physical examination reveals irregularly irregular heart rhythm and jugular venous distention at the clavicle when lying flat. She also has bibasilar crackles in her lungs, mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen, and trace pitting edema up to the mid-shin.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, increased creatinine, urea nitrogen, and potassium levels, as well as elevated levels of sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, and magnesium. The liver function tests are within normal limits. Urine analysis shows moderate leukocytes and the presence of nitrites, with no evidence of bacteria, red blood cells, or protein.

The patient is currently receiving meropenem for pyelonephritis, omeprazole for gastroesophageal reflux disease, and metoprolol for rate control. She is also"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and urinary tract infection (UTI). An ultrasound was performed, which did not reveal any cholelithiasis or cholecystitis to explain the RUQ pain. The patient's urine electrolytes showed a FE Urea suggesting prerenal azotemia, although it was not significantly different from 35. The patient's diet was advanced, and they were started on metoprolol for rate control. Meropenem was approved, and the patient had a known allergy to penicillins. Other medications included omeprazole, morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs remained stable with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/79 to 80/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support were provided. The patient received a total input of 1,000 mL of fluids and had a urine output of 762 mL. The ABG results showed ///27.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic kidney disease, and recurrent urinary tract infections. She presents with a urinary tract infection and likely pyelonephritis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 111/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is receiving IV lasix, heparin, and meropenem. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible worsening kidney function. This may require adjustments to her diuretic therapy and consideration for dialysis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating possible hypotension. This may require further evaluation and management, including the use of vasopressors or adjustment of diuretic therapy.
3. Pyelonephritis: The patient likely has pyelonephritis, which is a severe kidney infection. This requires prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics and close monitoring of renal function.
4. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure with a low ejection fraction. She is on medications such as metoprolol and bumetan"

   Imaging: CXR [**2-20**]:
   FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-18**], there are persistent low
   lung
   volumes. There is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac
   silhouette
   with relatively mild vascular congestion. This discordancy raises the
   possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.
   Mild atelectatic changes are seen at the bases.
   Microbiology: UCxs final: negative

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old female with afib, CHF, DM2, CKD, and recurrent UTIs who
   presents with UTI and likely pyelonephritis.
   .
   # Pyelonephritis:
   - Cont meropenem, pending culture data (day 1 [**2-19**]) - blood cxs are
   still pending
   .
   # RUQ Pain:
   RUQ US without good explanation for pain. Possibly [**1-27**] pyelo.
   - Treat UTI
   .
   # Hypotension:
   Patient now at baseline. Still holding ACE until finished diuresis
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal failure
   Creatinine improved with diuresis yesterday although not great response
   (was -500 mL over past 24 hrs in response to 80 mg IV lasix challenge
   then 160 in evening, LOS fluid balance is -198); likely secondary to
   improved forward flow.  (currently 2.1, baseline is 1.5)
   - diurese with lasix IV, goal 500-1L negative
   - holding ACE-I until Creatinine resolves
   - Restart 4 mg Bumex [**Hospital1 **] (as per home regimen)
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF: Compensated EF 10%
   - transition to PO bumetanide as above
   - on metoprolol
   - Holding ACE-I until ARF resolves
   .
   # Afib on Coumadin:
   Stable. Currently rate-controlled.  Inr 1.4 today. Continue IV heparin
   given afib hx.
   - coumadin dose 3.5
   - metoprolol
   -continue IV heparin
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus, type II: Hold metformin given renal failure,
   likely should not be restarted in the setting of her chronic renal
   disease.  Will hold long-acting night insulin given hypoglycemia
   earlier today.
   -HISS for now
   .
   # Depression: Cont. citalopram
   .
   # GERD - Cont. omeprazole
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (afib), congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs). She presents with a UTI and likely pyelonephritis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/76 mmHg to 148/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is in atrial fibrillation and has a weight of 62 kg.

Laboratory results show the following values:
- Hemoglobin: 11.2 g/dL
- Hematocrit: 33.0%
- White blood cell count: 10.2 K/uL
- Platelet count: 119,000/uL
- Creatinine: 2.1 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 119 mg/dL
- Sodium: 138 mEq/L
- Potassium: 3.6 mEq/L
- Chloride: 102 mEq/L
- BUN: 56 mg/dL
- Calcium: 8.9 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
- Phosphorus: 3.8 mg/dL

Imaging reveals persistent low lung volumes, substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, mild vascular congestion, and mild atelectatic changes at the bases.

The patient's assessment and plan include:
- Treating UTI and likely pyelonephritis with continued meropenem, pending culture data
- Evaluating RUQ pain, possibly due to pyelo, by treating UTI
- Managing hypotension by holding ACE inhibitors until diuresis is completed
- Addressing acute on chronic renal failure with diuresis using lasix IV and bumex, aiming for a negative fluid balance of 500-1000 mL
- Managing chronic systolic CHF with transition to PO bumetanide and holding ACE inhibitors until ARF resolves
- Continuing rate control in atrial fibrillation with metoprolol and monitoring INR at 1.4
- Holding metformin due to renal failure and long-acting night insulin due to hypoglycemia
- Continuing citalopram for depression and omeprazole for GERD

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of CHF, acute kidney injury, exacerbation of pyelonephritis, and further electrolyte imbalances."
