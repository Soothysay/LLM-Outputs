 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
   A/P: 85M with CAD, CHF EF 20%, VT s/p ICD, ESRD on HD, p/w dysphagia.
   .
   # Dysphagia:  This is most likely [**12-24**] obstruction and food impaction in
   esophagus.  Pt is comfortable and handling his secretions; however,
   prolonged food impaction carries a significant risk of eroding the
   esophagus and may cause rupture.
   - GI aware, plan for upper endoscopy
   - NPO
   - given elevated INR will  give FFP peri-operatively
   - obtain T& S, crossmatch 2 units
   .
   # Pre-procedure risk evaluation: Given the food impaction and known
   prior aspiration/dysphagia (Dysphagia Outcome Severity Scale (DOSS)
   rating of 4, moderate dysphagia), this patient is at particular risk of
   aspiration and will need intubation. As far as I can see from OMR, the
   patient has not been formally diagnosed with primary pulmonary disease.
   He was a long-term smoker, quit 20 years ago. He did have PFT's in [**2137**]
   w/o any evidence of obstructive disease but showing mild restrictive
   ventilatory defect and reduced diffusing capacity suggesting an
   interstitial process and possible amiodarone toxicity. He has chronic
   effusions and is on 2L home O2 suggestive of underlying lung disease-
   both of which may complicate extubation.  However, he has never had
   symptoms from pulmonary disease and hospitalizations for respiratory
   distress have been largely related to aspiration and CHF.  In addition
   to the aspiration risk, patient has multiple cardiac comorbidities that
   place him at risk for peri-procedural MI. Having said that, endsocopy
   is a low risk procedure itself. At this time, he appears to be stable
   and at baseline from a cardiac and pulmonary perspective with stable
   effusion, no CHF exacerbation and no new hypoxia. Although the patient
   is moderate/high risk, the benefit of removing a food impaction
   urgently appears to out weight the risk of  aspiration and difficulty
   extubating.
   - proceed with EGD
   - ideally would give long acting perioperative beta-blocker but can
   consider short acting BB instead given NPO status.
   - discuss with anesthesia and family risk of difficulty with extubation
   .
   # ESRD on HD:
   - contact renal for HD
   .
   # CAD s/p multiple stents:  No active angina.  has been several years
   since the last stent, the patient has not been taking the aspirin since
   [**11-16**]
   - restart meds when can take PO
   .
   # H/o VT s/p ICD:
   - restart Mexiletine and BB when able to take PO's
   .
   # Chronic systolic HF:  currently euvolemic
   - restart metoprolol and lisinopril when able to take PO's
   .
   # anemia:  hct 34.7, has baseline anemia
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:
   - hold  levothyroxine  until taking Po
   .
   # Factor V leiden: INR supratherapeutic
   - hold coumadin and trend INR
   -                      give FFP peri-procedure, but will not reverse
   with vit K

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ventricular tachycardia (VT) after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dysphagia, and factor V Leiden mutation. He was admitted to the ICU for food impaction in the esophagus.

24-hour events include invasive ventilation, endoscopy, and sedation. The patient is currently on fentanyl, versed, and assist/control ventilation settings. He is unable to provide history due to sedation.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for throat pain. Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs with a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/45-145/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with a total input of 594 mL and output of 16 mL. Respiratory support includes endotracheal tube ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 16, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ventricular tachycardia (VT) post implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), dysphagia, and factor V Leiden mutation. He presented with food impaction and required invasive ventilation and endoscopy for removal. The patient is currently sedated but responsive to verbal stimuli. He is on assist/control ventilation settings and receiving various medications including PPI, fentanyl, versed, and assist/control vent settings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's inability to protect his airway, there is a risk of aspiration leading to pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobilization and underlying factor V Leiden mutation.
4. Bleeding: The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, indicating an increased risk of bleeding if anticoagulation therapy is continued.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
6. Hypoglyc"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ventricular tachycardia (VT) after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and dysphagia due to food impaction. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and had a food impaction removed. He tolerated a clear liquid diet and then progressed to a dysphagia soft diet. The patient is still experiencing throat soreness, which began after the EGD, but it is improving without intervention. He has a new cough that is loose and occasionally productive, which he reports started prior to hospitalization shortly after food got stuck in his throat. The patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, and has no fever or leukocytosis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 107/47 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals right posterior lung field crackles to mid-lung, left basilar crackles, and a murmur that is difficult to assess due to"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 20%, ventricular tachycardia (VT) post implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and dysphagia. The patient was previously intubated and ventilated but was successfully extubated this morning without complications. He tolerated clear liquids for lunch and dinner and is planned to receive a dysphagia diet for breakfast. The patient underwent dialysis by nephrology and restarted on all home medications except for warfarin, which was held due to an elevated INR of 2.9.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dysphagia: The patient has a history of dysphagia, and there is a risk of aspiration or further difficulties with swallowing.
2. ESRD on HD: The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored, and appropriate adjustments to medication dosages may be necessary.
3. CAD s/p multiple stents: Although the patient does not currently have active angina, restarting aspirin therapy may be important to prevent stent thrombosis.
4. VT s/p ICD: Restarting medications such as mexiletine and beta-blockers is essential to manage the patient's arrhythmia.
5. Chronic systolic HF: Restart"
