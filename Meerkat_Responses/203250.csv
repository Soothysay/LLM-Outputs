   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN 66 y/o F s/p CVA with hemorrhagic evolution ([**9-26**])
   with AV and MV valves transferred from OSH with MV thrombosis and GI
   bleed
   .
   # Acute Congestive Heart Failure:  Secondary to Mitral valve thrombus
   and atrial fibrillation.  Patient has high gradient between LA and LV,
   also not filling well secondary to functional stenosis secondary to
   thrombus.
   -          Start low dose Metoprolol IV for HR control to help forward
   flow.
   -          Lasix prn
   Prosthetic Mitral Valve Thrombus:  Echocardiogram consistent with
   thrombus on prosthetic MV valve and fluroscopy shows one leaflet that
   is fixed.  Patient has TTE during admission at [**Hospital1 1817**] three weeks ago
   that was negative for valvular thrombus.  TTE shows gradient pressures
   of Mitral 28/(mean)18 and Aortic 45/(mean)23.  Given the patient had
   recently had a hemorrhagic stroke and recent GI bleed, the management
   will be difficult.  Patient had resumed coumadin on transfer to
   rehabilitation to prevent further clots.  Need to have dialogue with
   surgery if she will be candidate for surgery in the future.
   - Will continue Heparin gtt
   - TEE today
   # GI bleed:  Unclear source, likely lower GI.  HCT dropped from 29 to
   25 this AM and was subsequently transfused
   - GI recs for endoscopy
   - Will transfuse as needed
   - Trend HCT
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Poorly rate controlled.  Dig level 1.1, likely
   toxic level in this patient in light of her EKG changes.
   - Will start BB
   - Heparin gtt for further thrombus progression
   # CORONARIES:  h/o CAD documented in OSH records, however patient had
   cath in [**2109**] that showed normal coronaries. Pt had STD on EKG possibly
   in setting of GI Bleed/demand or related to digoxin toxicity.
   .
   # PUMP:  Previous TTE at [**Hospital1 1817**] 3 wks ago showed EF of 50% with no
   thrombus, with presence of dilated left atrium.
   - TEE today
   .
   # RLL Pneumonia:  Possible cause of her elevated WBC of 25 this AM.
   Lactate 1.3.  WBC at OSH was elevated.  Afebrile.  Not apparent that
   BCx obtained at OSH.  In context of thrombus, differential includes
   infected thrombus for leukocytosis.
   - BCx and UCx pending
   - Continue Vanco and Meropenem
   - Check CDiff, start IV Flagyl
   .
   # HTN:  BP 108/43.  SBPs on admission in 80s.
   - Start BB.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue home synthroid.
   .
   # s/p hemorrhagic stroke:  Patient with neurological deficits on exam.
   Patient at risk for further embolic event with thrombus.
   .
   FEN: Low salt, thickened liquids
   ACCESS: 18 gauge PIV and R IJ
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with Hep gtt, IV PPI
   CODE: Full Code.  Will need to be readdressed with family.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of CVA and hemorrhagic evolution, AV and MV valves, and recent GI bleed. She was transferred from another hospital with mitral valve thrombus and acute congestive heart failure secondary to the thrombus and atrial fibrillation. The patient has a high gradient between the left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV), indicating poor filling due to functional stenosis caused by the thrombus.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Acute Congestive Heart Failure: Start low-dose Metoprolol IV for heart rate control to improve forward flow. Use Lasix as needed.
2. Prosthetic Mitral Valve Thrombus: Echocardiogram confirms thrombus on the prosthetic MV valve, and fluoroscopy shows one leaflet that is fixed. The patient had a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) during admission three weeks ago that was negative for valvular thrombus. TEE shows gradient pressures of Mitral 28/(mean)18 and Aortic 45/(mean)23. Given the patient's recent hemorrhagic stroke and GI bleed, management will be challenging. The patient resumed coumadin on transfer to rehabilitation to prevent further clots. Consult with surgery regarding the patient's candidacy for future surgery. Continue Heparin gtt.
3. GI Bleed: Unclear source, likely lower GI. HCT dropped"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of cardiovascular accident (CVA), hemorrhagic evolution, atrioventricular (AV) and mitral (MV) valves, thrombosis, and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She has been admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Summary of the patient's condition:
- Prosthetic Mitral Valve Thrombus: The patient has an echocardiogram consistent with thrombus on the prosthetic MV valve. She had a TTE during admission three weeks ago that was negative for valvular thrombus. Given the patient's recent hemorrhagic stroke and GI bleed, the management will be difficult. The patient is likely a poor surgical candidate.
- Acute Congestive Heart Failure: Secondary to Mitral valve thrombus and atrial fibrillation. The patient has a high gradient between the left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV), also not filling well secondary to functional stenosis secondary to thrombus. Good response to low-dose IV metoprolol.
- GI bleed: Unclear source, likely lower GI. HCT dropped from 29 to 25 this AM and was subsequently transfused. Hct responded appropriately but then came back down.
- Atrial Fibrillation: Poorly rate controlled. Dig level 1.1, likely toxic level in this patient in light of her EKG changes.

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of CVA, hemorrhagic evolution, atrial fibrillation, and mechanical mitral valve thrombosis. She was transferred from another hospital with mitral valve thrombosis and gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Acute congestive heart failure secondary to mitral valve thrombus and atrial fibrillation.
- Prosthetic mitral valve thrombus, with an echocardiogram consistent with thrombus on prosthetic MV valve.
- Trace aortic regurgitation.
- Thrombus in the left atrial appendage.
- Unclear source GI bleed, likely lower GI.
- Atrial fibrillation, poorly rate-controlled.
- Coronaries: h/o CAD documented in OSH records, normal coronaries on cath in [**2109**].
- Pump: Previous TTE at [**Hospital1 1817**] 3 wks ago showed EF of 50% with no thrombus, with presence of dilated left atrium.

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y/o F s/p CVA with hemorrhagic evolution ([**9-26**]) with AV and MV
   valves transferred from OSH with MV thrombosis and GI bleed, now made
   CMO
   # Prosthetic Mitral Valve Thrombus:  Echocardiogram consistent with
   thrombus on prosthetic MV valve and fluroscopy shows one leaflet that
   is fixed.  Patient has TTE during admission at [**Hospital1 1817**] three weeks ago
   that was negative for valvular thrombus.  TTE shows gradient pressures
   of Mitral 28/(mean)18 and Aortic 45/(mean)23.  Given the patient had
   recently had a hemorrhagic stroke and recent GI bleed, the management
   will be difficult.  Patient had resumed coumadin on transfer to
   rehabilitation to prevent further clots.  Patient would likely be a
   poor surgical candidate.  This issue represents an end-stage disease
   and this is understood by family and they have elected to make the
   patient DNR/DNI and CMO.
   - Will continue Heparin gtt
   - Palliative care consult
   - Goal to get home with family, respiratory support and pain control
   # Acute Congestive Heart Failure:  Secondary to Mitral valve thrombus
   and atrial fibrillation.  Patient has high gradient between LA and LV,
   also not filling well secondary to functional stenosis secondary to
   thrombus.   Good response to low-dose IV metoprolol.
   - PO metoprolol 25 mg TID.
   - Bumex 1 mg [**Hospital1 **], which is
 home dose with goal of even
   # GI bleed:  Unclear source, likely lower GI.  HCT dropped from 29 to
   25 this AM and was subsequently transfused.  Hct responded
   appropriately but then came back down.
   -          stop lab draws
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Poorly rate controlled.  Dig level 1.1, likely
   toxic level in this patient in light of her EKG changes.
   - Will cont BB
   # CORONARIES:  h/o CAD documented in OSH records, however patient had
   cath in [**2109**] that showed normal coronaries. Pt had STD on EKG possibly
   in setting of GI Bleed/demand or related to digoxin toxicity.
   # PUMP:  Previous TTE at [**Hospital1 1817**] 3 wks ago showed EF of 50% with no
   thrombus, with presence of dilated left atrium.
   # RLL Pneumonia:  Possible cause of her elevated WBC of 25 this AM.
   Lactate 1.3.  WBC at OSH was elevated.  Afebrile.  Not apparent that
   BCx obtained at OSH.  In context of thrombus, differential includes
   infected thrombus for leukocytosis.  C. diff negatibe

","The patient is a 66-year-old female who has had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with a hemorrhagic evolution, atrioventricular (AV) and mitral valve (MV) thrombosis, and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She has been transferred from another hospital with a prosthetic MV and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 86/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

Her physical examination reveals rales in the posterior lung fields, right lower quadrant tenderness with voluntary guarding, and no femoral bruits. Neurological examination shows movement of all four limbs with commands but decreased grip strength on the left side.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 20.8 thousand cells/mm3, hemoglobin of 7.9 g/dL, sodium of 131 mg/dL, potassium of 4.6 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen of 24 mg/dL. Coagulation studies show a prothrombin time (PT) of 14.9 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 41.1 seconds, and international normalized ratio"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 y/o F s/p CVA with hemorrhagic evolution ([**9-26**]) with AV and MV
   valves transferred from OSH with MV thrombosis and GI bleed
   # Prosthetic Mitral Valve Thrombus:  Echocardiogram consistent with
   thrombus on prosthetic MV valve and fluroscopy shows one leaflet that
   is fixed.  Patient has TTE during admission at [**Hospital1 1817**] three weeks ago
   that was negative for valvular thrombus.  TTE shows gradient pressures
   of Mitral 28/(mean)18 and Aortic 45/(mean)23.  Given the patient had
   recently had a hemorrhagic stroke and recent GI bleed, the management
   will be difficult.  Patient had resumed coumadin on transfer to
   rehabilitation to prevent further clots.  Patient would likely be a
   poor surgical candidate.  This issue represents an end-stage disease
   and this is understood by family.
   - Will continue Heparin gtt
   - Palliative care consult
   - Goal to get home with family, respiratory support and pain control
   # Acute Congestive Heart Failure:  Secondary to Mitral valve thrombus
   and atrial fibrillation.  Patient has high gradient between LA and LV,
   also not filling well secondary to functional stenosis secondary to
   thrombus.   Good response to low-dose IV metoprolol.
   - PO metoprolol 25 mg TID.
   - Bumex 1 mg [**Hospital1 **], which is
 home dose with goal of even
   # GI bleed:  Unclear source, likely lower GI.  HCT dropped from 29 to
   25 this AM and was subsequently transfused.  Hct responded
   appropriately but then came back down.
   - GI recs for endoscopy
   - Transfusion for symptomatic anemia
   # Atrial Fibrillation:  Poorly rate controlled.  Dig level 1.1, likely
   toxic level in this patient in light of her EKG changes.
   - Will start BB
   - Heparin gtt for further thrombus progression
   .
   # CORONARIES:  h/o CAD documented in OSH records, however patient had
   cath in [**2109**] that showed normal coronaries. Pt had STD on EKG possibly
   in setting of GI Bleed/demand or related to digoxin toxicity.
   # PUMP:  Previous TTE at [**Hospital1 1817**] 3 wks ago showed EF of 50% with no
   thrombus, with presence of dilated left atrium.
   - TEE today
   # RLL Pneumonia:  Possible cause of her elevated WBC of 25 this AM.
   Lactate 1.3.  WBC at OSH was elevated.  Afebrile.  Not apparent that
   BCx obtained at OSH.  In context of thrombus, differential includes
   infected thrombus for leukocytosis.  C. diff negatibe
   - BCx and UCx pending
   - Continue Vanco and Meropenem
   - D/C flagyl
   # HTN:  BP 108/43.  SBPs on admission in 80s.
   - Start BB.
   # Hypothyroidism:  Continue home synthroid.
   # s/p hemorrhagic stroke:  Patient with neurological deficits on exam.
   Patient at risk for further embolic event with thrombus.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of cerebral vascular accident (CVA) and hemorrhagic evolution. She has prosthetic aortic and mitral valves and was transferred from another hospital with mitral valve thrombosis and gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has been in the ICU since admission.

The patient has been on heparin drip, but it was discontinued due to bleeding complications. The family is considering comfort measures only (CMO) if the patient worsens.

The patient has multiple medical conditions including congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), GI bleed, and hypothyroidism. She also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) but had normal coronary arteries on catheterization.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), low hemoglobin (Hct), and elevated lactate levels. The echocardiogram shows a thrombus on the prosthetic mitral valve and fixed leaflet.

Plan:

1. Prosthetic Mitral Valve Thrombus: Continue heparin drip and consider surgical intervention if possible. The patient is likely a poor surgical candidate due to recent hemorrhagic stroke and GI bleed.

2. Acute Congestive Heart Failure: Secondary to mitral valve thrombus and AF. The patient has high gradient between left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV), not filling well secondary to functional st"
