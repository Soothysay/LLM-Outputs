   Assessment and Plan
   Altered mental status
   Likely toxic metabolic in the setting of cellulits. One gas with resp.
   alkalosis but primary process seems to be anion gap acidosis (ASA neg.
   on tox screen) raising
   the possibility of hyerglycemic, non-ketotic acidois. Also concerend
   for tricyclic o/d given tachycardia and +tox screen. No QRS widening
   and some time now since last dose so will hydrate and monitor.
   Will check MRI and LP today given concern for CNS infection. Unknown
   HIV status, and seems a greater than average risk.
   Per history, does not appear to at risk for withdraw syndromes. Low
   threshold for benzos.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the MICU and is currently on several medications including insulin, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs show a fever of 38.6Â°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/88 mmHg to 181/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

On physical examination, the patient appears well-nourished but has small erythematous macules widely distributed, along with a larger cellulitic lesion on the left shoulder. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, and the extremities show no significant abnormalities. Neurological examination reveals that the patient responds to verbal stimuli and is oriented to person but not assessed for movement, tone, or skin.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 16.8 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.4 g/dL, platelet count of 422 K/uL, creatinine level of 3.3 mg/dL, and glucose level of 283 mg/dL. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, liver enzymes, electrolytes, albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal ranges.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old man who was admitted to the MICU. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, uncontrolled, and is currently on an insulin drip. The patient also has an unknown HIV status and appears to be at greater than average risk. He is alert but not oriented, with fever, abdominal pain, and small erythematous macules widely distributed, as well as a larger cellulitic lesion on his left shoulder. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.6Â°C (101.4Â°F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/88 mmHg to 181/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and sinus tachycardia. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose level, and creatinine level. He has an anion gap acidosis and a positive toxic screen, raising concerns for hyperglycemic, non-ketotic acidosis and possible tricyclic overdose. There is no QRS widening, so the patient will be hydrated and monitored. An MRI and lumbar puncture will be performed today due to concerns for CNS infection. The patient is concerned for potential complications such as encephalopathy, acute renal failure, and diabetic ketoacidosis. He is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The"

   Assessment and Plan
   62M PMH CAD s/p CABG, DM2, HTN, CRF (baseline Cr 2.0), depression with
   past suicide attempt presenting with altered mental status.
   # Altered Mental Status: Unclear etiology and broad differential.
   Neurologic exam is nonfocal with somewhat improved mental status from
   presentation, now answering simple questions.  Low-grade temperature
   and leukocytosis suggest infection, although stress response is also
   possible.  Most likely etiology of infection would be intra-abdominal
   process versus cellulitis
 chest x-ray, urinalysis negative.  Unlikely
   to be meningitis.  Medication overdose also likely, intentional or
   unintentional
 tox screens positive for tricyclics, otherwise
   unrevealing.  Uremia and metabolic derangements contributing.  Patient
   is hyperglycemic but there is no indication of ketoacidosis or HONK.
   Calcium, liver function tests normal.
   - Continue vancomycin and start zosyn for now for empiric coverage of
   skin and abdominal pathogens
   - CT head and torso without contrast
   - Toxicology curbside
 monitor EKG for QRS widening which would
   suggest tricyclic overdose
   - Supportive care for metabolic derangements
   - Hold all sedating medications
   - NPO for now
   - Unclear medication regimen; will clarify regimen with home pharmacy
   in the morning
   - Continue to monitor
   - Consider HIV test when patient able to consent
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline creatinine is 2.0 and was
   4.0 on admission.  A Foley was placed and patient drained 1.7L.  Could
   represent post-obstructive physiology given history of BPH.  Urine
   electrolytes not indicative of a prerenal etiology.  Hyperkalemic on
   presentation but not hyperphosphatemic.
   - CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Urine eosinophils pending
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Treatment for hyperkalemia as needed
   - Continue to trend
   - Consider renal consult in the morning if no improvement
   # Acid base status: Patient has primary respiratory alkalosis with
   non-gap metabolic acidosis of unclear etiology.  Consider CNS lesion or
   medications for respiratory alkalosis
 unlikely hepatic failure or
   sepsis.  Most likely etiology of metabolic acidosis is early renal
   disease versus ingestion versus intra-abdominal process; no history of
   diarrhea.
   - D5 with 3 amps bicarbonate x 1 L
   - CT head and torso without contrast
   - Monitor closely
   # Left shoulder lesion:  Unclear etiology
 per patient
s partner,
   there is no history of trauma and the lesion has been progressively
   worsening over weeks.  He also has a number of smaller crusted popular
   lesions on his left arm.
   - Consider dermatology consult for further evaluation
   - Wound care
   # Elevated lipase: Normal amylase.  [**Month (only) 60**] be elevated in the setting of
   acute renal failure.  The patient does not clinically have
   pancreatitis.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Tachycardia: Mild, sinus.  Unclear etiology
 likely due to agitation
   versus volume depletion.  Afebrile, not in pain.  Hematocrit stable.
   - Fluids as above
   - Monitor
   # Type 2 diabetes: Currently not controlled.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease post CABG, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, chronic renal failure, and depression. He presented with altered mental status. 

The vital signs show a temperature of 38.6 C (101.4 F), heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/88 to 181/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.8 K/uL, elevated glucose level of 283 mg/dL, hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 5.6 mEq/L, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 134 mEq/L. Other lab values show elevated creatinine, liver enzymes, amylase, lipase, and low albumin.

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions:

1. Altered mental status of unclear etiology, possibly due to infection, medication overdose, uremia, or metabolic derangements. Tox screens were positive for tricyclics.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 2.0, which increased to 4.0 on admission. Foley catheter drainage of 1.7L suggests post-obstructive physiology"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease status post CABG, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, chronic renal failure, and depression. He presented with altered mental status and has since been found to have several medical complications. 

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved from initial presentation, but the exact etiology is unclear. It could be due to an infection such as cellulitis or an abdominal infection. Other potential causes include medication overdose, uremia, and metabolic derangements. Further evaluation is needed, including a lumbar puncture (LP) to rule out meningitis.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function has improved from an initial creatinine level of 4.0 to 2.9. This could represent post-obstructive physiology due to a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Repeated urine electrolytes are pending, and the patient will be monitored closely.

3. Left shoulder lesion: The patient has a large erythematous, weeping lesion on his left shoulder blade with multiple crusted papules on his left arm. The etiology is unclear, but it could be consistent with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus cellulitis. Treatment with vancomycin is recommended, and wound care is important.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (post CABG), diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 2.0), and depression. The patient presented with altered mental status, fever, and a large erythematous lesion on his left shoulder blade with multiple crusted papules on his left arm. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, but no longer agitated or febrile. 

Vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/88 mmHg to 181/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's blood cultures have been obtained, and he is receiving vancomycin and zosyn for empiric coverage of skin and abdominal pathogens. Urine, blood, and stool cultures are pending. 

The patient's renal function has improved from 4.0 on admission to 2.9, and a Foley catheter has been placed, draining 1.7L. This could represent post-obstructive physiology due to a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). 

The patient's acid-base status is improving after receiving D5 with 3 amps bicarbonate x 1 L. The left shoulder lesion is unclear in etiology but may be consistent"

   62M PMH CAD s/p CABG, DM2, HTN, CRF (baseline Cr 2.0), depression with
   past suicide attempt presenting with altered mental status.
   # Altered mental status:  Patient with improved mental status. Etiology
   felt to be cellulitis. Concerned there may have been a component of
   medication overdose, most likely unintentional for tricyclics.  Not
   consistent with alcohol withdrawal, and partner denies history of
   recent abuse.
   - Continue vanc for skin, and stop amp given neg LP
   - Urine, blood, stool cultures pending
   - Hold all sedating medications
   - Continue to monitor
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: Improving, volume responsive, now
   2.3.  Baseline creatinine is 2.0 and was 4.0 on admission.  A Foley was
   placed and patient drained 1.7L.  Could represent post-obstructive
   physiology given history of BPH.  Urine electrolytes on admission were
   not indicative of a prerenal etiology, but will repeat.  Hyperkalemic
   on presentation but not hyperphosphatemic.
   - Renally dose medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   - Continue to trend
   # Diarrhea: chronic *3 months. Gets all outpatient care at VA.
   -          r/o c. diff
   -          consider HIV testing
   -          get records from VA
   # Acid base status: Improving.  Patient had primary respiratory
   alkalosis with gap metabolic acidosis.
   - Received D5 with 3 amps bicarbonate x 1 L
   - Monitor closely
   # Left shoulder lesion:  Unclear etiology
 per patient
s partner,
   there is no history of trauma and the lesion has been progressively
   worsening over weeks.  He also has a number of smaller crusted popular
   lesions on his left arm.  This can all be consistent with S. aureus or
   Strep cellulitis.
   - Continue vancomycin
   - Wound care
   # Elevated lipase: Normal amylase.  [**Month (only) 60**] be elevated in the setting of
   acute renal failure.  The patient does not clinically have
   pancreatitis.
   - Continue to monitor
   # Tachycardia: Sinus.  Unclear etiology
 agitation versus volume
   depletion versus tricyclic overdose.  No QRS widening.  Afebrile, not
   in pain.  Hematocrit stable.
   - Fluids as above
   - Monitor
   # Type 2 diabetes: Improved control with insulin gtt.
   - Home insulin dose is NPH 67 units [**Hospital1 **]
 monitor BG and titrate up to
   home dose
   #Hyperkalemia: Resolved.  In the setting of ARF.  No EKG changes.
   - Patient received kayexalate in the ED
   - Monitor
   # Coagulopathy: Unclear etiology
 likely due to nutritional deficiency
   since low albumin as well.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - Vitamin K 10 mg x 3 days
   # Anemia: Microcytic, improved from previous baseline in our system
   after CABG.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding. Patient iron
   deficient
   - Iron [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Monitor
   # Coronary artery disease: Status post CABG in [**2134**].  No ischemic
   changes on EKG.
   - Restart aspirin, statin, PO metoprolol
   # Hypertension: Currently hypertensive.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.7Â°F (Tmax: 38.7Â°C), blood pressure ranging from 159/102 mmHg to 186/113 mmHg, heart rate of 114 bpm with a sinus tachycardia rhythm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for fever and diarrhea. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's urine output has been low, and he has received fluid resuscitation. The patient's chest X-ray shows no infiltrates or effusions. 

The patient's assessment and plan include hyperglycemia, diarrhea, wound infection, altered mental status, acute renal failure, and benign hypertension. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and ventilation-associated pneumonia prevention. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include worsening of renal failure, development of sepsis due to the wound infection, progression of altered mental status leading to delirium or coma, uncontrolled hypertension, and further electrolyte imbalances."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with an altered mental status. They have a fever of 101.7Â°F and tachycardia with a heart rate of 114 bpm. Blood pressure is elevated at 159/102 mmHg. Respiratory rate is within normal limits, but oxygen saturation is at 93%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 400 mL.

Physical examination reveals a large cellulitic rash on the left shoulder. Neurologic examination shows that the patient follows simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli, but orientation is impaired. They are unable to assess movement or tone.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.8 K/uL. Hemoglobin levels are within normal range, but platelet count is slightly low at 406 K/uL. Renal function tests show elevated creatinine levels. Blood glucose levels are significantly high at 707 mg/dL. Other lab values, including liver enzymes and electrolytes, are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include hyperglycemia, diarrhea, wound infection, altered mental status (not delirium), acute renal failure, and benign hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The presence of fever, leukocytosis, and cellulitic rash suggests a potential infection, which could lead to sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished male with altered mental status. The patient has been experiencing fever, agitation, hypertension, and tachycardia. He has a history of altered mental status, hyperglycemia, wound infection, acute renal failure, and hypertension. The patient is currently on several medications including ampicillin, metoprolol, hydralazine, diazepam (Valium), and heparin sodium. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, altered mental status, and wound infection suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction, which may progress to acute kidney injury.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels require management to prevent further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
4. Wound Infection: The presence of a large cellulitic rash on the patient's left shoulder indicates a potential wound infection that needs to be addressed.
5. Ethanol Withdrawal: The administration of Valium could be related to managing possible ethanol withdrawal symptoms in the patient.
6. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressure needs to be controlled to prevent complications such as stroke or heart attack.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and assessment would"

The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and sedatives. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 128 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 145/83 mmHg to 186/127 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 18 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O. The patient's blood cultures came back negative, but they are still awaiting results from the blood cultures drawn yesterday. The patient has been experiencing chronic diarrhea, which is being evaluated further. The patient also has a wound infection on his back and is continuing to receive vancomycin. The patient's mental status has improved, as previously noted. The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to volume responsiveness and tachycardia.
