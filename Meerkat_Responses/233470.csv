   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Most likely source is empyema and bacteremia.  Also
   has urine and BAL with GNR.  History of VRE UTI.  Currently maintaining
   good urine output.
   - f/u Cx and sensitivities
   - continue tobramycin, linezolid, meropenem
   - continue caspofungin and acyclovir prophylaxis, will consider sending
   Bglucan and galactomannan
   - continue hydrocortisone (stress dose given chronic steroids)
   - IVF and pressors to MAP > 65, try to wean pressors off
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Her rapid ventricular rate is secondary to
   stress due to infection.  She appears to be intravascularly volume
   down.  She also has pain which is contributing to pain.  Currently
   - will try to wean her off of esmolol
   - IVF given septic shock
   - complete amio IV load with gtt
   - appreciate cardiology recs
   - ? cardioversion tomorrow, may convert back given acute stress
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes, ? two with air
   leak.
   - appreciate thoracics recs
   - antibiotics as above
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Respiratory alkolisis: Most likely due to increased RR.  Will
   decrease RR and recheck ABG.  Also readjusted the tube positioning as
   it is too high.
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease.  Tbili
   and dbili climbing up secondary to this.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - continue mycophenolate mofetil
   - continue hydrocortisone
   - appreciated GI recs regarding elevated bili
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis.
   - Plt transfusion to 60 000 per BMT recs
   .
   # ALL: Appreciate BMT recs
   .
   # FEN: Trophic tube feeds started today.  ? Nutrition consult for TPN.
   Replete lytes prn.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI. Pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of ALL who underwent an allogeneic transplant and subsequently developed severe GVHD. She also has a history of VRE UTI and empyema for which she underwent thoracotomy.

The patient's current condition includes septic shock, atrial fibrillation, right lung empyema, respiratory alkalosis, severe GVHD, thrombocytopenia, and impaired nutrition. She is being treated with multiple antibiotics, antifungal medication, and antiviral prophylaxis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include worsening septic shock leading to organ dysfunction, persistent atrial fibrillation with potential embolic events, further deterioration of lung function due to empyema and respiratory alkalosis, progression of GVHD affecting multiple organ systems, continued thrombocytopenia leading to increased risk of bleeding, and malnutrition impacting overall recovery.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms to promptly address any emerging complications and adjust the treatment plan accordingly."

   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Most likely source is empyema and bacteremia.  Also
   has urine and BAL with GNR.  History of VRE UTI.  Currently maintaining
   good urine output.
   - f/u Cx and sensitivities
   - continue tobramycin, linezolid, meropenem
   - continue caspofungin and acyclovir prophylaxis, sent beta-glucan and
   galactomannan, f/u results
   - continue hydrocortisone (stress dose given chronic steroids)
   - IVF and pressors to MAP > 65, weaned pressors
   - appreciate ID following/recs
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Her rapid ventricular rate is secondary to
   stress due to infection.  She appears to be intravascularly volume
   down.  She also has pain which is contributing to pain
   - weaned esmolol
   - IVF to address hypotension/ sepsis
   - complete amio IV load with gtt, will cont amio IV, reassess need each
   day
   - appreciate cardiology following/recs

","Summary:
- The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of ALL who underwent allogeneic transplant and developed severe GVHD.
- She presented with septic shock, most likely due to empyema and bacteremia, as well as urine and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with gram-negative bacilli (GNR).
- She also has a history of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) urinary tract infection (UTI).
- The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungal, and antiviral prophylaxis.
- She is being treated for atrial fibrillation, hypotension, respiratory alkalosis, right lung empyema, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), thrombocytopenia, and impaired skin integrity.
- The patient's laboratory values show leukocytosis, anemia, elevated creatinine, and deranged liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to GVHD and ongoing sepsis puts her at high risk for developing further infections. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging studies will be necessary to detect any new infections early.

2. GVHD: The patient's severe GVHD may lead to multi-organ involvement and failure. Regular assessment of liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and other organ functions will help monitor the progression of GVHD.

The patient is a 41-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions including sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, cancer (malignant neoplasm), impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypotension (not shock), and pain control. The patient's blood culture was taken on 1/4/2132 at 10:40 AM, followed by an ultrasound at 2:15 PM. The patient experienced cardioversion/defibrillation at 3:14 PM using 200 Joules. EKG was performed at 3:17 PM. The patient's heart rate has been unstable, going back into atrial fibrillation after being stable for about three hours. An esmolol drip was restarted, and the heart rate returned to the 120s.

The patient has allergies to cefepime and aztreonam. The last dose of antibiotics administered was piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 1/3/2132 at 2:41 AM. Other medications given include metronidazole, piperacillin, vancomycin, caspofungin, acyclovir, meropenem, tobramycin, and linezolid.

Infusions include fentanyl at 50 mcg/hour, amiodarone at 0.5 mg/min, and esmolol at 100 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including septic shock, empyema, respiratory failure, unstable atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, complicated oncologic and immunologic history, chest tubes with small leak, malnutrition, severe, and heme-related issues such as coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. 

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has septic shock and empyema, indicating a high risk of infection. The presence of GNRs (Gram-negative rods) in blood and tissue cultures suggests a bacterial infection, and appropriate antibiotics should be continued as per Infectious Disease (ID) consultation.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of ventilator settings are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Unstable Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's unstable atrial fibrillation needs close cardiac monitoring. Consultation with cardiology is recommended to evaluate the need for antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone, which may be continued for a short period given the patient's marked prior instability.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, including blistering. This increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infection. Dermatology consultation is advised for further evaluation and management.

5. Complicated Oncologic and"

","The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who underwent an allogeneic transplant and subsequently developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). She also has empyema in the right lung, bacteremia, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is currently in septic shock and requires intensive care unit (ICU) care.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure of 151/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with good urine output.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including septic shock, right lung empyema, severe GVHD, thrombocytopenia, and atrial fibrillation. The most likely source of infection is the empyema and bacteremia. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals.

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's coagulation profile is within normal limits.

The patient's care plan includes ongoing IV fluids, pressors to maintain blood pressure, and daily rounds with the ID team to review culture data and sensitivities. The patient's blood"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of ALL, who underwent an allogeneic transplant and subsequently developed severe GVHD. She is currently in the ICU for septic shock, likely due to empyema and bacteremia. The patient has multiple positive cultures including Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Enterococcus species. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including meropenem, caspofungin, and acyclovir.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation, which is being treated with esmolol and IV fluids. She had a cardioversion procedure performed and will continue to have her heart rate monitored. The patient's right lung empyema required a thoracotomy and placement of chest tubes. Antibiotics are being continued as per ID recommendations.

The patient is experiencing thrombocytopenia, likely due to GVHD or bone marrow suppression secondary to sepsis. A platelet transfusion was given based on BMT recommendations. The patient's skin lesions were evaluated by a dermatologist and were determined to be consistent with multiple blood draws and thin skin, rather than GVHD.

The patient's nutritional status is being addressed with trophic tube feeds to maintain gut motility and a nutrition consult for TPN. Prophylactic measures include PPI, pneumoboots for thrombocytopenia, and BM regimens.

The patient's code status is full"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of ALL who underwent an allogeneic transplant and developed severe GVHD. She also has empyema and bacteremia, which led to septic shock. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics, antifungal, and antiviral prophylaxis. She is also being treated for atrial fibrillation, right lung empyema, respiratory alkalosis, thrombocytopenia, and other conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of sepsis, empyema, and bacteremia. There is a risk of developing further infections due to her compromised immune system.

2. Graft versus host disease (GVHD): The patient has severe GVHD, which can cause damage to various organs, including the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding and bruising.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to empyema and bacteremia. There is a risk of worsening respiratory function and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is being treated for atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of clot formation and potential stroke.

6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to GVHD and potential infection,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent an allogeneic transplant and developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). She was found to have empyema and septic shock, requiring thoracotomy and chest tube placement. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Gram-negative rods (GNR) and bacteremia. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. She has atrial fibrillation, respiratory alkalosis, thrombocytopenia, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is also malnourished and requires nutrition support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of septic shock indicates a potential life-threatening complication due to infection. Close monitoring and prompt management of infection sources are essential.
2. GVHD: The patient has a history of severe GVHD, which can lead to further complications such as liver dysfunction, renal impairment, and gastrointestinal issues. Regular monitoring of organ functions and appropriate management are necessary.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is progression of lung involvement or complications from mechanical ventilation. Frequent assessment of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt intervention for any"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent an allogeneic transplant and subsequently developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). She is currently in the ICU due to septic shock, most likely caused by empyema and bacteremia. The patient also has a history of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), urinary tract infection (UTI), and bacteremia with gram-negative rods (GNR).

The patient's current medical conditions include septic shock, atrial fibrillation, right lung empyema, respiratory alkalosis, severe GVHD, thrombocytopenia, and acute respiratory failure. She is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, corticosteroids, and other supportive therapies.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of multiple lines and tubes.

2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's respiratory failure and septic shock put her at risk for developing organ dysfunction, particularly in the lungs and kidneys.

3. Bleeding: Thrombocytopenia and the use of anticoagulant therapy increase the risk of bleeding.

4. GVHD: The patient's severe GVHD may lead to further complications such as liver dysfunction, skin changes, and gastrointestinal issues.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and has several medical conditions. The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure (not ARDS), cancer (malignant neoplasm), impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypotension (not shock), and pain control (acute pain, chronic pain). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient is at risk for further deterioration in their condition, potential organ failure, and possibly death if the infection spreads or does not respond to treatment.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience worsening respiratory function, difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation, or development of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.

3. Cancer (malignant neoplasm): The patient may experience disease progression, metastasis, or recurrence of cancer. This can lead to additional symptoms, complications, and decreased overall prognosis.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient is at risk for pressure ulcers, infections, or other skin-related complications due to immobility and potential compromised blood flow.

5. Alteration in nutrition: The patient may have difficulty meeting their nutritional needs, leading to malnutrition, weight loss, muscle wasting, or impaired healing.

6. Hypotension: The patient may experience low blood pressure, which can affect organ perfusion and lead to organ damage or dysfunction.

7. Pain control: Inadequate pain management"

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Most likely source is Enterococcus and GNR empyema and
   GNR bacteremia.  Also has urine and BAL with multiple organisms,
   although all organisms are pan-sensitive.  History of VRE UTI.
   Currently maintaining good urine output and remains hemodynamically
   stable. ID is following with recs while pending Cx develop.
   - f/u Cx and sensitivities
   - continue meropenem (day 5) for 2 week course, caspofungin, and
   acyclovir prophylaxis
   - continue hydrocortisone (stress dose given chronic steroids)
   - IVF for MAP > 65,  off pressors at this time
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u thoracic recs re: CT (currently to suction)
   .
   Culture data (as of [**1-6**]):
   [**12-31**] Stool: negative for microsporidium, clyclospora, c.diff,
   ova/parasites
   [**1-2**] Hemothrax: Enterococcus
   [**1-2**] Urine: Klebsiella oxytoca, Morganella morgani
   [**1-2**] Rind: Enterobacter cloacae
   [**1-3**] Bronchial washing: Enterobacter aerogenes
   [**1-3**] Blood cx: Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae
   MRSA negative
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Today reverted back to afib with RVR during
   rounds, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of pain and tachypnea. Her
   rate improved quickly with going back to PS 10/5 and decreasing
   stimuli. It is likely a combination of underlying lunch injury and
   pain, which has been a consistent complaint despite our using sedation.
   Currently she is being treated with esmolol and we are monitoring. If
   she reverts back to high rate afib, will reload with amiodarone. Her
   arrhythmia was not in the setting of a fever, and resolved fairly
   quickly, so it is not likely to be due to worsening of her underlying
   infection. We will also start a fentanyl patch to adequately cover her
   underlying pain, in hopes that this will allow us to move towards
   extubation again tomorrow. She is also receiving 1L NS for volume
   resuscitation.   (FYI: S/p cardioversion on thoracic service on first
   reversion to atrial fib).
   - titrate esmolol
   - 1L NS IVF
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   - hold off on weaning vent at this time; retry to wean PS this
   afternoon/evening if hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes,  two with
   known air leak. Thoracic service is following and is on board with
   extubation when tolerated. Drainage appears serosangiunous.
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - no changes to her regimen at this time
   - continue hydrocortisone
   - follow LFTs
   # skin lesions
 wound care following, appreciate their recs.
   -          unlikely GVHD
   -          continue wound care
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis.
   -          Plt transfusion to 60 000 per BMT recs
   .
   # ALL: Appreciate BMT recs
   .
   # FEN: continue her TFs.  Replete lytes prn.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of ALL who underwent an allogeneic transplant. She has developed severe GVHD and septic shock, most likely due to an empyema and bacteremia. She also has urine and BAL with multiple organisms, along with a history of VRE UTI. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's current condition of septic shock is likely due to the empyema and bacteremia. It is crucial to closely monitor her vitals, fluid balance, and response to antibiotics.

2. GVHD: The patient has developed severe graft vs host disease, which is causing elevated bilirubin levels. This may require adjustment of immunosuppressive therapy and close monitoring of liver function.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which could be due to GVHD or bone marrow suppression secondary to sepsis. Platelet transfusion has been given according to BMT recommendations.

4. Skin lesions: The patient has skin lesions that are consistent with multiple blood draws and thin skin, rather than GVHD. Wound care should be continued, and further evaluation by a dermatologist may be necessary.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly related to her empyema and se"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to sepsis without organ dysfunction and respiratory failure. The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation, hemothorax, cancer (malignant neoplasm), impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypotension (not in shock), and pain control (acute pain, chronic pain). 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate ranging from 74 to 166 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/62 mmHg to 136/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 594 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 28.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.4 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL, normal glucose levels ranging from 84 to 143 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 99 mg/dL and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 76 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient has multiple lines including an arterial line placed on 1/3/2132 at 12:46 AM and a multi-lumen central venous catheter placed on 1/3/2132 at 09:21 AM. The patient is receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and multiple antibiotics such as linezolid, tobramycin, caspofungin, acyclovir, and meropenem.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or barotrauma.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, and if left untreated or inadequately managed, it can progress to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke.
4. Hemothorax: The patient's hemothorax may require intervention to prevent re-accumulation or complications such as tension pneumothorax.
5. Cancer (malignant neoplasm): The patient's underlying cancer may progress and cause further complications or metastasis.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and subsequent infections.
7. Alteration in nutrition: The patient's altered nutrition status can lead to malnutrition and compromised immune function.
8. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension, although not in shock, should be closely monitored to prevent the development of hypotensive crises or organ hypoperfusion.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia.  Also
   has urine and BAL with multiple organisms, although all organisms are
   pan-sensitive.  History of VRE UTI.  Currently maintaining good urine
   output and remains hemodynamically stable, with intermittent episodes
   of hypertention likely secondary to pain. Has been on PS 5/5 and is
   likely ready to be extubated today.
   - continue meropenem (day 6) for 2 week course, caspofungin, and
   acyclovir prophylaxis
   - off pressors at this time
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u thoracic recs re: CT currently on water seal
   -likely extubate today
   .
   Culture data (as of [**1-8**]):
   [**12-31**] Stool: negative for microsporidium, clyclospora, c.diff,
   ova/parasites
   [**1-2**] Hemothrax: Enterococcus
   [**1-2**] Urine: Klebsiella oxytoca, Morganella morgani
   [**1-2**] Rind: Enterobacter cloacae
   [**1-3**] Bronchial washing: Enterobacter aerogenes
   [**1-3**] Blood cx: Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae
   MRSA negative
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Intermittent episodes of afib with RVR and
   hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of pain and
   tachypnea. It is likely a combination of underlying lung injury and
   pain. Currently on lopressor 50mg tid with good control. If she reverts
   back to high rate afib, will reload with amiodarone. Fentanyl patch was
   started to adequately cover her underlying pain, and ativan prn for
   anxiety. (FYI: S/p cardioversion on thoracic service on first reversion
   to atrial fib).
   - IVF first then esmolol prn if reverts back
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   - will retry to wean off vent today and extubate
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes, two with known
   air leak. Thoracic service is following and is on board with extubation
   when tolerated. CTs were placed to water seal this morning. If CXR
   looks unchanged will retry SBTs this afternoon with plan to extubate.
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. BMT recommended switching from IV hydrocortisone to
   solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. Her LFTs continue to increase which may be due to GVHD
   vs. acalculous cholecystitis vs. other GI etiology. At this time we
   will continue following her LFTs. If they continue to increase will
   consider RUQ US tomorrow and increasing steroid dose.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend LFTs
   # skin lesions
 wound care and dermatology following, appreciate their
   recs.
   -          unlikely GVHD
   -          continue wound care
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis. Received plt transfusion for plt 45
   this AM.
   -          Plt transfusion to 60 000 per BMT recs
   .
   # ALL: Appreciate BMT recs
   .
   # FEN: TF on hold for extubation.  On K, Mg scales.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of ALL who underwent an allogeneic transplant and subsequently developed severe GVHD. She is currently in the ICU due to septic shock caused by Enterococcus and GNR empyema, as well as GNR bacteremia. The patient has also been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, right lung empyema, thrombocytopenia, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Septic shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. If not properly managed, it can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.

2. GVHD: The patient has severe graft vs host disease affecting both the liver and GI tract. If left untreated or not properly managed, GVHD can lead to further organ damage and dysfunction.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and hypertension. If not controlled, atrial fibrillation can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiac complications.

4. Right lung empyema: The patient has a right lung empyema, which is an accumulation of pus in the pleural space. If not appropriately treated, it can lead to worsening respiratory function, recurrent infections, and potentially spread to other areas of the body.

   # Atrial fibrillation:  Today reverted back to afib with RVR during
   rounds, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of pain and tachypnea. Her
   rate improved quickly with going back to PS 10/5 and decreasing
   stimuli. It is likely a combination of underlying lunch injury and
   pain, which has been a consistent complaint despite our using sedation.
   Currently she is being treated with esmolol and we are monitoring. If
   she reverts back to high rate afib, will reload with amiodarone. Her
   arrhythmia was not in the setting of a fever, and resolved fairly
   quickly, so it is not likely to be due to worsening of her underlying
   infection. We will also start a fentanyl patch to adequately cover her
   underlying pain, in hopes that this will allow us to move towards
   extubation again tomorrow. She is also receiving 1L NS for volume
   resuscitation.   (FYI: S/p cardioversion on thoracic service on first
   reversion to atrial fib).
   - titrate esmolol

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of ALL and allogeneic transplant, who underwent thoracotomy for empyema and was found to be in septic shock. She has severe GVHD of the liver and GI tract, as well as thrombocytopenia likely due to GVHD or bone marrow suppression. The patient has atrial fibrillation, a hemothorax, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, altered nutrition, hypotension, and pain control issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently in septic shock, indicating a severe systemic infection. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed promptly.
2. Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD): The patient has severe GVHD affecting both the liver and GI tract. GVHD can cause significant morbidity and may require adjustments in immunosuppressive therapy.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding and bruising. Platelet transfusions may be necessary to maintain a safe level.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's recent episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/RVR) requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.
5. Hemothorax: The presence of a hemothorax increases the risk of respiratory compromise and should be addressed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of ALL who underwent an allogeneic transplant and developed severe GVHD. She is currently in the ICU for septic shock secondary to Enterococcus and GNR empyema, as well as GNR bacteremia. The patient has multiple infections including urine, BAL, and wound infections. She also has atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, and right lung collapse due to empyema. The patient is extubated and autodiuresing, with a positive fluid balance. She is receiving multiple antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, and she is on solumedrol for GVHD. She has a known DVT in her right upper extremity and is planned for a Dobhoff placement for enteral feeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock due to ongoing infections (empyema, bacteremia)
2. Right lung collapse and empyema
3. Severe GVHD affecting the liver and gastrointestinal tract
4. Thrombocytopenia
5. Atrial fibrillation
6. Transaminitis (possibly secondary to GVHD or acalculous cholecystitis)
7. Impaired skin integrity
8. Alteration in nutrition
9. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)

","The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of ALL and subsequent allogeneic transplant, who is currently in the ICU due to septic shock caused by Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia. She has also been diagnosed with severe GVHD affecting her liver and GI tract. Other medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, right lung empyema, thrombocytopenia, and skin wounds. She is receiving multiple antibiotics, antifungal, and antiviral medications. The patient is extubated and experiencing all-over pain, for which she has been given a fentanyl patch and bolus dosing. Her vital signs are stable, but she is still receiving IV fluids and has an ongoing fluid balance issue. She is also receiving pain management with fentanyl patch and bolus dosing, and her anxiety is being treated with low-dose Ativan or Klonopin. Further plans include wound care, monitoring liver function, and evaluating for possible acalculous cholecystitis. The patient's nutritional status is a concern, and she is expected to receive enteral feeding once a Dobhoff tube is placed."

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia.  Also
   has urine and BAL with multiple organisms, although all organisms are
   pan-sensitive.  History of VRE UTI.  Currently maintaining good urine
   output and remains hemodynamically stable, with intermittent episodes
   of hypertention likely secondary to pain. Has been on PS 5/5 and is
   likely ready to be extubated today.
   - continue meropenem (day 6) for 2 week course, caspofungin, and
   acyclovir prophylaxis
   - off pressors at this time
   - appreciate ID recs
   - f/u thoracic recs re: CT currently on water seal
   -likely extubate today
   .
   Culture data (as of [**1-8**]):
   [**12-31**] Stool: negative for microsporidium, clyclospora, c.diff,
   ova/parasites
   [**1-2**] Hemothrax: Enterococcus
   [**1-2**] Urine: Klebsiella oxytoca, Morganella morgani
   [**1-2**] Rind: Enterobacter cloacae
   [**1-3**] Bronchial washing: Enterobacter aerogenes
   [**1-3**] Blood cx: Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae
   MRSA negative
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Intermittent episodes of afib with RVR and
   hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of pain and
   tachypnea. It is likely a combination of underlying lung injury and
   pain. Currently on lopressor 50mg tid with good control. If she reverts
   back to high rate afib, will reload with amiodarone. Fentanyl patch was
   started to adequately cover her underlying pain, and ativan prn for
   anxiety. (FYI: S/p cardioversion on thoracic service on first reversion
   to atrial fib).
   - IVF first then esmolol prn if reverts back
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   - will retry to wean off vent today and extubate
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes, two with known
   air leak. Thoracic service is following and is on board with extubation
   when tolerated. CTs were placed to water seal this morning. If CXR
   looks unchanged will retry SBTs this afternoon with plan to extubate.
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. BMT recommended switching from IV hydrocortisone to
   solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. Her LFTs continue to increase which may be due to GVHD
   vs. acalculous cholecystitis vs. other GI etiology. At this time we
   will continue following her LFTs. If they continue to increase will
   consider RUQ US tomorrow and increasing steroid dose.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]
   - trend LFTs
   # skin lesions
 wound care and dermatology following, appreciate their
   recs.
   -          unlikely GVHD
   -          continue wound care
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis. Received plt transfusion for plt 45
   this AM.
   -          Plt transfusion to 60 000 per BMT recs
   .
   # ALL: Appreciate BMT recs
   .
   # FEN: TF on hold for extubation.  On K, Mg scales.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI. Pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia., BM regimen
   .
   # Access: LIJ and Aline. PICC placement today/tomorrow for long-term

The patient was extubated yesterday and complains of all-over pain, which has been managed with bolus fentanyl. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 76 bpm with sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 130/76mmHg to 174/113mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving several medications including fentanyl, midazolam, hydralazine, metoprolol, and solu-medrol. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,196 mL and output of 4,150 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,954 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of PSV/SBT mode on the ventilator with a set tidal volume of 451 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 6 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 24. The patient's blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.49, partial pressure of oxygen ("

   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia,
   treated with meropenem (day 8 of 2week course). Also has urine and BAL
   with multiple organisms, although all organisms are pan-sensitive.
   History of VRE UTI. Hemodynamically stable, extubated, and
   autodiuresing. Given collapsed lung, chest tubes put back on suction
   for now, repeat CXR showed improved PTX. No air leak. Thoracic service
   following.
   -continue meropenem, caspofungin, and acyclovir prophylaxis

   # Transaminitis: Likely secondary to GVHD however cannot rule out
   acalculous cholecystitis given prolonged abx use and ICU stay.
   Nontender to palp over RUQ this AM, although slight icterus on exam.
   RUQ U/S- negative for cholecystitis. LFTs stable today. No change in
   steroid/cellcept regimen.
   -f/u BMT recs
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Pt had initially had intermittent episodes of
   afib with RVR and hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of
   pain and tachypnea. It was likely a combination of underlying lung
   injury and pain. Given she is unable to take PO will treat with
   standing low-dose lopressor IV until PO route established. For pain,
   she is off fentanyl drip and this time and mainly covered by fentanyl
   patch and bolus fentanyl prn. Once stable, would consider pain,
   palliative care consult to provide a good pain regimen for the
   long-term.  She is also quite anxious, which we can treat with low dose
   ativan or klonopin (note: very cachectic and low RR, caution not to
   oversedate. Also with elevated compromised liver function, avoid
   long-acting agents)
   - IV lopressor with goal HR<90s
   -fentanyl patch for pain
   -ativan prn anxiety
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   -prn esmolol for elevated SBPs
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes, now with
   collapsed lung, CT back on suction. Repeat CXR showed improved ptx, per
   thoracic will leave on suction for now.
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. On IV solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. Her LFTs continue to increase
   which may be due to GVHD vs. acalculous cholecystitis as above. No BMs
   for several days which is inconsistent with GVHD of the gut. RUQ US
   negative for cholecystitis, Dobhoff placed yesterday and TF begun this
   am.
   - appreciate BMT recs.

   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis. Receiving plt transfusion this am. For
   platelets of 26.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of ALL and subsequent severe GVHD post allogeneic transplant. She underwent thoracotomy for empyema and was found to be in septic shock. The patient is currently in the ICU, extubated, and autodiuresing. She has a collapsed lung, but repeat CXR showed improved PTX. Chest tubes are still on suction, and the thoracic service is following up with her. She has multiple cultures positive for various organisms, all of which are pan-sensitive. The patient is being treated with meropenem, caspofungin, and acyclovir prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the presence of multiple infections (empyema, urine, and BAL) with different organisms. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential to detect any deterioration.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's collapsed lung and previous respiratory issues put her at risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and respiratory effort is necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding. Platelet transfusion has been given, and close monitoring of any signs of bleeding is required.
4. GVHD: The patient has severe graft vs host disease affecting both the liver and GI tract. Close monitoring"

   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia,
   treated with meropenem (day 7 of 2week course). Also has urine and BAL
   with multiple organisms, although all organisms are pan-sensitive.
   History of VRE UTI Hemodynamically stable, extubated, and
   autodiuresing. Given collapsed lung, chest tubes put back on suction
   for now, repeat CXR pending. Thoracic service following.

   # Atrial fibrillation:  Intermittent episodes of afib with RVR and
   hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of pain and
   tachypnea. It is likely a combination of underlying lung injury and
   pain. Given she is unable to take PO will treat with standing low-dose
   lopressor IV until PO route established. For pain, she is off fentanyl
   drip and this time and mainly covered by fentanyl patch and bolus
   fentanyl prn. Once stable, would consider pain, palliative care consult
   to provide a good pain regimen for the long-term.  She is also quite
   anxious, which we can treat with low dose ativan or klonopin (note:
   very cachectic and low RR, caution not to oversedate. Also with
   elevated compromised liver function, avoid long-acting agents)

   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. On IV solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. Her LFTs continue to increase
   which may be due to GVHD vs. acalculous cholecystitis as above. No BMs
   for several days which is inconsistent with GVHD of the gut. Once PO
   route is established (hopefully with Dobhoff) will start low rate TF
   and monitor for improvement in gut motility.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of ALL and subsequent severe GVHD post allogeneic transplant. She presented with septic shock due to Enterococcus and GNR empyema, as well as GNR bacteremia. She also has multiple organisms in her urine and bronchoalveolar lavage, all of which are pan-sensitive. The patient underwent a thoracotomy for empyema and currently has a collapsed lung with chest tubes on suction. She is hemodynamically stable, extubated, and autodiuresing. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right lung empyema: The patient had empyema which required thoracotomy and chest tube placement. However, the lung is still collapsed, indicating that the empyema has not completely resolved. Further intervention may be required to fully clear the infection and re-expand the lung.
2. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock due to Enterococcus and GNR infections. Although she is currently stable, there is still a risk of recurrent or persistent sepsis if the infections are not adequately controlled.
3. GVHD: The patient has severe GVHD affecting both the liver and gastrointestinal tract. This condition requires close monitoring and management with immunosuppressive therapy.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding. Platelet transfusion may be necessary to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 41-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, hemothorax, respiratory failure, cancer (malignant neoplasm), impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, and pain control. The patient is receiving various medications including Caspofungin, Acyclovir, and Meropenem. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/80 mmHg to 147/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's current weight is 48.5 kg.

The patient has received an ultrasound, Dobhoff placement, and TFs started. Oncology recommendations include continuing Cellcept and Solumedrol, with a plan to increase the dose of Cellcept if the patient's leukocyte count increases tomorrow. The patient's allergies are noted as well.

Laboratory results show leukocyte count of 26 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, sodium of 128 mg/dL, potassium of 0.4 mg/dL, chloride of 30 mEq/L, magnesium of 3.5 mEq/L, calcium of 25 mg/dL, glucose of 142 mg/dL, and creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL. Other lab results are also provided, including WBC, Hct, Plt, TCO2, and various enzymes and electrolytes.

The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.49, PCO2 of 38 mmHg, PO2 of 143 mmHg, HCO3- of 30 mEq/L, and SaO2 of 99%. The patient's physical examination is largely unremarkable, with no assessment in several areas such as peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, movement, tone, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure, which can lead to complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity can increase the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and poor wound healing.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension can lead to complications such as heart failure, stroke, or renal damage if not properly managed.
4. Hemothorax: The patient's hemothorax may require further evaluation and management to prevent complications such as recurrent pleural effusion or infection.
5. Cancer (malignant neoplasm): The patient's underlying malignancy can progress and lead to complications such as metastasis, organ dysfunction, or infection due to immunosuppression.
6. Nutrition alteration: The patient's alteration in nutrition"

   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia,
   treated with meropenem (day 8 of 2week course). Also has urine and BAL
   with multiple organisms, although all organisms are pan-sensitive.
   History of VRE UTI. Hemodynamically stable, extubated, and
   autodiuresing. Given collapsed lung, chest tubes put back on suction
   for now, repeat CXR showed improved PTX. No air leak. Thoracic service
   following.

   Nontender to palp over RUQ this AM, although slight icterus on exam.
   RUQ U/S- negative for cholecystitis. LFTs stable today. No change in
   steroid/cellcept regimen.
   -f/u BMT recs
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Pt had initially had intermittent episodes of
   afib with RVR and hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of
   pain and tachypnea. It was likely a combination of underlying lung
   injury and pain. Given she is unable to take PO will treat with
   standing low-dose lopressor IV until PO route established. For pain,
   she is off fentanyl drip and this time and mainly covered by fentanyl
   patch and bolus fentanyl prn. Once stable, would consider pain,
   palliative care consult to provide a good pain regimen for the
   long-term.  She is also quite anxious, which we can treat with low dose
   ativan or klonopin (note: very cachectic and low RR, caution not to
   oversedate. Also with elevated compromised liver function, avoid
   long-acting agents)
   - IV lopressor with goal HR<90s
   -fentanyl patch for pain

   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. On IV solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. Her LFTs continue to increase
   which may be due to GVHD vs. acalculous cholecystitis as above. No BMs
   for several days which is inconsistent with GVHD of the gut. RUQ US

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of ALL and allogeneic transplant who is currently in the ICU. She has severe GVHD and was treated for septic shock due to Enterococcus and GNR empyema, as well as GNR bacteremia. The patient underwent a thoracotomy for empyema and had collapsed lung, but now has improved PTX without air leak. She is hemodynamically stable, extubated, and autodiuresing. The patient is also experiencing transaminitis, atrial fibrillation, right lung empyema, and thrombocytopenia. She is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, steroids, and antivirals. The patient's nutrition and pain control are also being addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis due to Enterococcus and GNR empyema, which may recur if there is inadequate control of infection or if the patient develops a new infection.
2. GVHD: The patient has severe GVHD affecting both the liver and GI tract. This condition can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not managed properly.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding, especially with invasive procedures or if the platelet count further decreases.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be monitored and"

   Assessment and Plan
   56-year-old woman with a history of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3327**] chromosome ALL s/p
   allogeneic transplant, s/p DLI (day 121) with subsequent severe GVHD
   underwent thoracotomy for empyema and found to be in septic shock.
   .
   # Septic shock:  Enterococcus and GNR empyema and GNR bacteremia,
   treated with meropenem (day 9 of 2week course). Also has urine and BAL
   with same organisms that are pan-sensitive.  History of VRE UTI.
   Hemodynamically stable, extubated, and autodiuresing. Per thoracics CTs
   placed to water seal, follow up CXR without collapse or PTX. She is
   hemodynamically stable with good UOP (autodiuresing). At this time it
   is reasonable to remove the Aline and monitor for improvement.
   -continue meropenem, caspofungin, and acyclovir prophylaxis
   - f/u thoracic recs
   -support breathing with pulmonary toilet prn
   - remove A-line
   -complete meropenem course, will put in for PICC request
   .

   .
   # Transaminitis: Likely secondary to GVHD however cannot rule out
   acalculous cholecystitis given prolonged abx use and ICU stay.
   Nontender to palp over RUQ this AM, although slight icterus on exam.
   RUQ U/S- negative for cholecystitis. LFTs stable today with decreased
   bilirubin. No change in steroid/cellcept regimen.
   -continue methylprednisone for now
   -trend LFTs, bilirubin
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Pt had initially had intermittent episodes of
   afib with RVR and hypertension, in the setting of SBTs and complaint of
   pain and tachypnea. It was likely a combination of underlying lung
   injury and pain. She is on metoprolol for several days on which she has
   successfully remained in NSR. For pain, she is covered by fentanyl
   patch and bolus fentanyl prn. Once stable, would consider pain,
   palliative care consult to provide a good pain regimen for the
   long-term.  She is also anxious at times, which we can treat with low
   dose ativan or klonopin (note: very cachectic and low RR, caution not
   to oversedate. Also with elevated compromised liver function, avoid
   long-acting agents)
   - metoprolol 50mg tid po
   -fentanyl patch for pain
   -ativan prn anxiety
   - if converts to rapid afib w/RVR reload amio
   -prn esmolol for elevated SBPs
   .
   # Right lung empyema: s/p thoracotomy and 3 chest tubes now on water
   seal, breathing stable and repeat CXR without PTX
   - appreciate thoracic [**Doctor First Name 91**] following and recs.
   - antibiotics as above
   .
   # GVHD:  Patient is found to have severe graft vs host disease of both
   liver and GI tract. On IV solumedrol [**Hospital1 **]. RUQ US negative for
   cholecystitis, Dobhoff placed yesterday and TF begun. Steroids per BMT
   recs.
   - appreciate BMT recs.
   - methylprednisone 20mg qam, 15mg qpm
   - trend LFTs
   .
   # Skin wounds
 wound care and dermatology following, appreciate their
   recs.
   -          continue wound care
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Most likely due to GVHD vs. bone marrow
   suppression secondary to sepsis.
   -Plt transfusion to 60 000 per BMT recs
   .
   # ALL: Appreciate BMT recs. Continue cellcept.
   .
   # FEN: TFs via Dobhoff. Nutrition consult to ensure she is getting
   appropriate calories.  On K, Mg scales.
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI. Pneumoboots given thrombocytopenia., BM regimen
   .
   # Access: LIJ. D/c Aline prior to transfer to floor service. PICC
   request (may need IR guided).

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of ALL who underwent an allogeneic transplant and subsequently developed severe GVHD. She was treated for an empyema and bacteremia caused by Enterococcus and GNR organisms. The patient's current condition includes septic shock, atrial fibrillation, right lung empyema, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, and impaired skin integrity. She is hemodynamically stable, extubated, and autodiuresing. The patient's medical team has implemented various interventions, including antibiotics, pain management, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient has been treated for an empyema and bacteremia, but there is still a risk of ongoing infection leading to sepsis or septic shock.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation, which may require further management to maintain sinus rhythm.
3. Right Lung Empyema: Although the chest tubes are now on water seal, there is still a risk of recurrence or complications related to the empyema.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests indicate elevated levels, which could be secondary to GVHD or prolonged antibiotic use. Monitoring and adjustment of medication regimens may be necessary.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding."
