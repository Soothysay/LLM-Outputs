","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male who underwent ant and post decompression and fusion of T10-L5. He is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient received a large volume of resuscitation fluids intraoperatively and is now experiencing bradycardia but with stable blood pressure. He is expected to remain on bedrest until Sunday for dural defect repair. His pain is managed with hydromorphone (Dilaudid) as needed.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 128/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, sodium level of 132 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, blood glucose of 130 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, and platelet count of 94 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal range.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who underwent ant and post decompression and fusion of T10-L5. He is currently intubated and sedated, with impaired physical mobility due to bedrest until Sunday for dural defect repair. The patient's cardiovascular system is stable, although he received a large resuscitation intraoperatively and is now experiencing bradycardia. His pulmonary function is compromised as he is intubated and sedated, requiring mechanical ventilation (CMV) overnight. The patient's gastrointestinal and abdominal systems are not showing any issues, and he is currently NPO with plans to begin tube feeding (TF). His renal function is stable with a creatinine level of 0.7. The patient's hematologic profile indicates postoperative hct of 28.7, which is stable. Endocrine functions are noted as surgical site infections (SSI). The patient's infectious disease profile shows cefazolin x 2 doses postop, with an afebrile white blood cell count of 4.4. He has multiple lines and tubes in place, including an endotracheal tube (ETT), oral gastric tube (OGT), arterial line, right internal jugular (RIJ) catheter, Foley catheter, chest tube, and lumbar bulb drain. The patient's wounds are described as ant and post thor"
