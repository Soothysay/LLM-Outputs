   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1380**] is a 63 year-old male smoker with a history of severe COPD on
   home oxygen (4L), DM2, prior PEA arrest who presents from home with
   dypnea and respiratory failure.
   # Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to
   pneumonia and COPD flare.  Patient has history of multiple COPD
   exacerbations and pneumonia episodes in past and continues to smoke.
   DDx includes bacterial or viral pna, e.g. influenza, PCP given chronic
   steroids, acute heart failure and PE.  Currently on CMV and has been
   intubated in the past.  ABG c/w chronic respiratory acidosis but was
   performed after intubation.
   - Continue vanc, Zosyn, azithro
   - Continue Tamiful and rule out for flu
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Standing nebs/inhalers after extubation
   - Sputum culture with PCP smear
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] BNP 273 not c/w severe heart failure as cause
   - Monitor ABGs
   - Daily CXR
   - FU blood cultures, urine cultures
   # Sepsis:  Met SIRS criteria with fever, leukocytosis, tachypnea prior
   to intubation, and has likely source of infection with lung
   infiltrate.  Would also consider other possible etiologies such as UTI,
   abscess, endocarditis.
   - management of respiratory failure as above
   - continue fluid resuscitation as needed, appears to be maintaining
   blood pressures without pressors at this time
   # Acute renal failure:  Creatinine 0.7 at baseline but was 1.7 on [**1-6**]
   at rehab.  Remains in ARF, although creatinine improved with IVF and
   likely related to prerenal etiology.  DDx includes hypovolemia,
   hypoperfusion from sepsis, ATN, medication toxicity; less likely are
   vasculitis, post-renal etiologies.
   - follow UOP; foley in place
   - urine lytes pending a.m. creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   # Anemia: Hct dropped from 34.2 to 25.3 in the setting of aggressive
   fluid resuscitation and multiple line placements.  Most likely
   dilutional but some concern for bleeding
   - guaiac stools
   - repeat Hct in pm
   # Diastolic heart failure:  No evidence of volume overload on CXR.
   - hold lasix in setting of sepsis
   # Hypertension:
   - hold Norvasc, Lisinopril in setting of sepsis

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male smoker with a history of severe COPD, diabetes mellitus type 2, and a prior cardiac arrest. He presented with dyspnea and respiratory failure and was intubated. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure likely secondary to pneumonia and a COPD flare. Other differential diagnoses include bacterial or viral pneumonia, acute heart failure, and pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin, Zosyn, azithromycin, and Tamiflu for influenza. A urine test for Legionella came back negative.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure: The patient will continue on CMV ventilation and receive nebulizers/inhalers after extubation. Sputum culture with PCP smear will be performed.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria with fever, leukocytosis, tachypnea prior to intubation, and has a likely source of infection with lung infiltrate. Management of respiratory failure and fluid resuscitation will be continued as needed.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved with IVF but remains in ARF. Differential diagnoses include hypovolemia, hypoperfusion from sepsis, ATN, medication toxicity, vasculitis, and post-renal etiologies. Foley catheter"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, diabetes mellitus type 2, prior PEA arrest, who presented with dyspnea and respiratory failure. He is intubated and sedated. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure likely secondary to pneumonia and COPD flare. Other possible diagnoses include bacterial or viral pneumonia, acute heart failure, and sepsis. The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, anemia, diastolic heart failure, and hypertension. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and various medications for sedation, antibiotics, and other treatments. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's history of COPD exacerbations and continued smoking increases the risk of pneumonia. The presence of lung infiltrate on imaging supports this diagnosis.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and potential pneumonia increase the risk of developing ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by fluid accumulation in the lungs.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and tachypnea indicate possible sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output suggest the possibility of AKI, potentially due to prerenal causes such as hypovolemia or hypoperfusion from"

   This may be influenza, bacterial pneumonia, or even PCP or aspergillus
   (which appears to be an emerging infectious disease in patients with
   severe COPD.  We will test and treat for influenza and bacterial
   pneumonia at this point.  We will pursue bronchoscopy for microbiologic
   diagnosis.  If no clear diagnosis from rapid tests, send galactomannan
   and beta-glucan.
   Will treat for COPD exacerbation with steroids, bronchodilators, and
   antibiotics.
   His acute renal failure seems to have been hypovolemic/hemodynamic and
   is improving.
   Will decrease respiratory rate on the ventilator to allow his pCO2 to
   rise and pH to fall, until he is just overbreathing the ventilator.
   This will also likely improve his autoPEEP (total PEEP presently 10).
   Watch lytes and Hct for now.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1380**] is a 63 year-old male smoker with a history of severe COPD on
   home oxygen (4L), DM2, prior PEA arrest who presented from home with
   dypnea and respiratory failure, now intubated and sedated.
   # Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to
   pneumonia and COPD flare.  Patient has history of multiple COPD
   exacerbations and pneumonia episodes in past and continues to smoke.
   DDx includes bacterial or viral pna, e.g. influenza, PCP given chronic
   steroids, acute heart failure.  Currently on AC ventilation, and most
   recent blood gas shows pC02 of 44.  Likely needs higher PC02 to drive
   respirations, so will decrease RR at this time.
   - Decrease RR on ventilator to 12 (from 22) to encourage respiratory
   drive
   - Monitor ABGs
   - Bronch today with BAL for PCP, f/u cx
   - Continue vanc, Zosyn, azithro for PNA day 2 of 8
   - d/c tamiflu, droplet precautions (negative for flu)
   - Urine legionella negative
   - Standing nebs/inhalers after extubation
   - Will consider invasive aspergillosis
   - BNP 273 not c/w severe heart failure as cause
   - Daily CXR
   - FU blood cultures, urine cultures
   # Sepsis:  Met SIRS criteria with fever, leukocytosis, tachypnea prior
   to intubation, and has likely source of infection with lung
   infiltrate.  Would also consider other possible etiologies such as UTI,
   abscess, endocarditis.
   - management of respiratory failure as above
   - continue fluid resuscitation as needed, appears to be maintaining
   blood pressures without pressors at this time
   # Acute renal failure:  Creatinine 0.7 at baseline but was 1.7 on [**1-6**]
   at rehab.  Remains in ARF, although creatinine improved with IVF and
   likely related to prerenal etiology.  DDx includes hypovolemia,
   hypoperfusion from sepsis, ATN, medication toxicity; less likely are
   vasculitis, post-renal etiologies.
   - follow UOP; foley in place
   - urine lytes pending
   - renally dose meds
   - will check pm lytes
   # Diastolic heart failure:  No evidence of volume overload on CXR.
   - hold lasix in setting of sepsis
   # Hypertension:
   - hold Norvasc, Lisinopril in setting of sepsis

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1380**] is a 63 year-old smoker with severe COPD on 4L home O2, DM2,
   prior PEA arrest who presented from home with dypnea and respiratory
   failure, now intubated and sedated. Etiology of Respiratory failure
   likely [**3-18**] PNA & COPD exacerbation.
   # Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to
   pneumonia and COPD flare.  Patient has history of multiple COPD
   exacerbations and pneumonia episodes in past and continues to smoke.
   DDx includes bacterial or viral pna, e.g. [**Month/Day (2) 1845**], PCP given chronic
   steroids, acute heart failure.  Did well on AC, hypercarbic back to
   baseline.
   - Trial of pressure support-> spontaneous breathing trial
   - attempt to extubate to BiPAP if tolerated
   - Monitor ABGs
   - f/u BAL for cx, pcp, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1845**]
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Continue vanc, Zosyn, azithro for PNA day 2 of 8 (azithro day 2 of 5)
   - Standing nebs/inhalers after extubation
   - Daily CXR
   - FU blood cultures, urine cultures
   - not requiring pressors, bp rising appropriately w/ fluid boluses
   # Acute renal failure:  Creatinine 0.7 at baseline but was 1.7 on [**1-6**]
   at rehab.  Now improving as most recent Cr is 1.3, after fluid boluses,
   likely pre-renal. DDx includes hypovolemia, hypoperfusion from sepsis,
   ATN, medication toxicity; less likely are vasculitis, post-renal
   etiologies.
   - follow UOP; foley in place
   - f/u urine lytes
   - renally dose meds
   # Diastolic heart failure:  No evidence of volume overload on CXR.
   - hold lasix in setting of sepsis
   # Hypertension:
   - hold Norvasc, Lisinopril in setting of sepsis

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure: The patient has severe COPD and was intubated due to respiratory failure. The risk of worsening respiratory failure is present, especially if there is an underlying pneumonia or if the patient's COPD exacerbation does not improve.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been fluctuating, indicating a possible renal impairment. This could be due to pre-renal causes such as hypovolemia or hypoperfusion from sepsis, or it could be intrinsic renal damage like acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

3. Diastolic heart failure: Although no evidence of volume overload is seen on the chest X-ray, the patient has a history of prior diastolic heart failure. This condition can worsen if the patient's current illness and treatment lead to fluid retention or decreased cardiac function.

4. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, but it is mentioned to hold antihypertensive medications during sepsis. If the patient's blood pressure normalizes after the resolution of sepsis, there might be a risk of rebound hypertension when restarting these medications.

5. Possible infection complications: The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. There is a risk of developing antibiotic-associated complications such as Clostridium difficile infection or allergic reactions to the medications.

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo male with severe COPD now admitted with respiratory failure
   following recent return to home from rehab.   This is concerning for
   pulmonary based infection with trigger of exacerbation of patient's
   reactive airways disease.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient is wide awake making pulmonary mechanics
   difficult to assess.  He does have markedly decreased breath sounds
   bilaterally and symmetrically.  He is able to interact quite
   appropriately.  He does not have significant fever/bandemia through to
   today making widespread pneumonia less likely  perhaps.  He will need
   to be maintained on FIO2 and Ve target.  At admission patient had
   evidence of acute infection which now has been further investigated
   with bronchoscopy.
   -Will move to PSV this morning and have decreased PEEP in the absence
   of active autopeep.
   -Will re-evaluate his ABG following 30 minutes on PSV
   -Will move to SBT this morning if able to tolerate PSV.
   -If appropriate for extubation with stability of oxygenation and
   ventilation will consider BIPAP following extubation both acutely and
   over longer course.
   -His Ve is [**8-21**] lpm and he has very good mental status

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted with respiratory failure following a recent return home from rehab. The patient's condition is concerning for pulmonary-based infection with a trigger of exacerbation of reactive airways disease.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical intervention. It is important to monitor and manage the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters closely.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of acute infection, and there is a concern for pneumonia. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Azithro/Zosyn/Vanco) is appropriate in this case to cover potential bacterial pathogens. Bronchoscopy results will help guide further management.

3. COPD exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD is being exacerbated by the recent infection. Appropriate bronchodilators (Albuterol/Atrovent) and corticosteroids (Methylprednisolone) are being used to manage the exacerbation.

4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given that the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Prophylactic measures, such as elevation of the head of the bed, oral hygiene, and regular aspiration of subglottic secretions, should be implemented to"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 1380**] is a 63 year-old smoker with severe COPD on 4L home O2, DM2,
   prior PEA arrest who presented from home with dypnea and respiratory
   failure, now intubated and sedated. Etiology of Respiratory failure
   likely [**3-18**] PNA & COPD exacerbation.
   # Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to
   pneumonia and COPD flare.  Patient has history of multiple COPD
   exacerbations and pneumonia episodes in past and continues to smoke.
   DDx includes bacterial or viral pna, e.g. [**Month/Day (2) 1845**], PCP given chronic
   steroids, acute heart failure.  Did well on AC and doing well of PS
   [**11-23**], hypercarbic back to baseline.
   - Trial of pressure support-> spontaneous breathing trial
   - Attempt to extubate to BiPAP if tolerated

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, diabetes mellitus type 2, and previous PEA arrest. He presented with dyspnea and respiratory failure and was intubated and sedated. The etiology of respiratory failure is likely pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation. The patient has a history of multiple COPD exacerbations and pneumonia episodes in the past and continues to smoke. The differential diagnosis includes bacterial or viral pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), acute heart failure, and hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, diastolic heart failure, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure: This condition is already present and may worsen if the patient does not improve or if there is a new respiratory infection.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels indicate an improvement from a previous value of 1.7. It is important to monitor urine output, follow up with urine electrolytes, and adjust medications based on renal function.
3. Diastolic heart failure: There is no evidence of volume overload on the chest X-ray. The patient's blood pressure needs to be monitored, and diuretics should be used cautiously in the setting of sepsis.
4. Hypertension: The patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo male with history of COPD and Obesity now with hypoxemic and
   hypercarbic respiratory failure.  He did have trial of move to
   extubation yesterday but was limited by drop in Vt and resulting rise
   in PCO2 leading to concern that patient not at optimal in regards to
   liberation from mechanical ventilation.  This has improved across the
   night and the patient does retain excellent tolerance of minimal
   pressure support levels.
   1)Respiratory Failure-He has had significant improvement in tolerance
   of PSV at 5/5
this is largely attributable to time on treatment for
   COPD exacerbation with steroid, MDI
s and empiric antibiotics.  Will
   move to intermittent positive pressure ventilation across tonight for
   support and to maintain long term support at discharge if there is
   favorable response.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of COPD and obesity who is currently experiencing hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in tolerance of pressure support levels. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Barotrauma: The use of high levels of positive pressure ventilation can lead to barotrauma, which is damage to the lung tissue caused by excessive pressure.
3. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI): Similar to barotrauma, VILI can occur when the mechanical ventilation settings are not optimized, leading to further damage to the lungs.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has bilateral lower lobe opacities on chest imaging, which could indicate pneumonia. The mixed flora seen on gram stain of bronchial washings also suggests the possibility of pneumonia.
5. Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures have grown GPC, indicating a possible bloodstream infection.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and other risk factors may increase the patient's risk for developing DVT, which can potentially lead to PE.
7. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis due to the risk of developing stress"

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1380**] is a 63 year-old smoker with severe COPD on 4L home O2, DM2,
   prior PEA arrest who presented from home with dypnea and respiratory
   failure, now intubated and sedated. Etiology of Respiratory failure
   likely [**3-18**] PNA & COPD exacerbation.
   # Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to
   pneumonia and COPD flare.  Patient has history of multiple COPD
   exacerbations and pneumonia episodes in past and continues to smoke.
   DDx includes bacterial or viral pna, e.g. influenza, PCP given chronic
   steroids, acute heart failure.  Doing well on NC.
   - f/u BAL for cx
   - Continue vanc, Zosyn, azithro for PNA day 4 of 8 (azithro day 4 of 5)
   - Standing nebs/inhalers
   - Daily CXR
   - FU blood cultures
   - Not requiring pressors, bp actually high this am
   # Acute renal failure:  Creatinine 0.7 at baseline but was 1.7 on [**1-6**]
   at rehab.  Now improving as most recent Cr is 1.0, likely pre-renal.
   DDx includes hypovolemia, hypoperfusion from sepsis, ATN, medication
   toxicity; less likely are vasculitis, post-renal etiologies.
   - follow UOP; foley in place
   - renally dose meds
   # Diastolic heart failure:  No evidence of volume overload on CXR.
   -holding lasix in setting of sepsis
   # Hypertension: Starting to be hypertensive
   - restarted Norvasc as patient no longer septic and hypertensive at
   this time, plan to increase to 10mg daily, consider addition of ace-i

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 63-year-old smoker with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), and a history of prior pulmonary embolism and arrest.
- The patient presented with dyspnea and respiratory failure and was intubated.
- The patient has a history of multiple COPD exacerbations and pneumonia episodes.
- The patient continues to smoke.
- The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation (NIPPY) with a nasal cannula.
- The patient's blood cultures are pending, and respiratory viral antigen testing was negative for COVID-19.
- The patient has acute renal failure with improving creatinine levels, likely pre-renal in nature.
- The patient also has diastolic heart failure, hypertension, and hypothermia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which could recur if the underlying cause (such as pneumonia or COPD exacerbation) is not adequately treated or if there is a new respiratory insult.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of multiple pneumonia episodes, and current blood cultures are pending. There is a risk of developing or worsening pneumonia due to the patient's smoking history and underlying COPD.
3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old smoker with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2, and a history of prior pulmonary embolism and arrest. The patient presented with dyspnea and respiratory failure, was intubated, and sedated. The likely etiology of the respiratory failure is pneumonia (PNA) and COPD exacerbation. The patient has a history of multiple COPD exacerbations and pneumonia episodes in the past and continues to smoke.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure: This is likely secondary to pneumonia and COPD flare. The patient has a history of multiple COPD exacerbations and pneumonia episodes in the past and continues to smoke.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is very high at times, reaching up to 200s. Consider starting an ACE inhibitor in the future with improved renal function.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.7, but it increased to 1.7 on [**1-6**] at rehab. It is now improving, likely pre-renal. The differential diagnosis includes hypovolemia, hypoperfusion from sepsis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), medication toxicity; less likely are vasculitis, post-renal etiologies.
4. Diastolic heart failure: There is no evidence of volume overload on CX"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTHERMIA
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1380**] is a 63 year-old smoker with severe COPD on 4L home O2, DM2,
   prior PEA arrest who presented from home with dypnea and respiratory
   failure, now intubated and sedated. Etiology of Respiratory failure
   likely [**3-18**] PNA & COPD exacerbation.
   # Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to
   pneumonia and COPD flare.  Patient has history of multiple COPD
   exacerbations and pneumonia episodes in past and continues to smoke.
   DDx includes bacterial or viral pna, e.g. [**Month/Day (2) 1845**], PCP given chronic
   steroids, acute heart failure.  Did well on AC and doing well of PS
   [**11-23**], hypercarbic back to baseline.
   - Trial of pressure support-> spontaneous breathing trial
   - Attempt to extubate to BiPAP if tolerated
   - Monitor ABGs
   - f/u BAL for cx, pcp, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1845**]
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Continue vanc, Zosyn, azithro for PNA day 3 of 8 (azithro day 3 of 5)
   - Standing nebs/inhalers after extubation
   - Daily CXR
   - FU blood cultures, urine cultures
   - Not requiring pressors, bp actually high this am
   # Acute renal failure:  Creatinine 0.7 at baseline but was 1.7 on [**1-6**]
   at rehab.  Now improving as most recent Cr is 1.2, after fluid boluses,
   likely pre-renal. DDx includes hypovolemia, hypoperfusion from sepsis,
   ATN, medication toxicity; less likely are vasculitis, post-renal
   etiologies.
   - follow UOP; foley in place
   - renally dose meds
   # Diastolic heart failure:  No evidence of volume overload on CXR.
   - hold lasix in setting of sepsis
   # Hypertension: Starting to be hypertensive
   - will restart Norvasc as patient no longer septic and hypertensive at
   this time

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, diabetes mellitus type 2, and prior cardiac arrest. He presented with dyspnea and respiratory failure and has been intubated and sedated. The etiology of respiratory failure is likely pneumonia (PNA) and COPD exacerbation.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2, and acute renal failure. His creatinine levels were elevated from 0.7 to 1.7 on [**1-6**] but have improved to 1.2 after fluid boluses, suggesting pre-renal acute kidney injury.

Other potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and risk factors such as smoking increase the risk of thromboembolic events. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin should be continued.

3. Pressure injuries: Prolonged immobility on the ICU bed can lead to pressure injuries. Regular repositioning and appropriate use of pressure-relieving devices should be implemented.

 HYPOTHERMIA
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1380**] is a 63 year-old smoker with severe COPD on 4L home O2, DM2,
   prior PEA arrest who presented from home with dypnea and respiratory
   failure, now intubated and sedated. Etiology of Respiratory failure
   likely [**3-18**] PNA & COPD exacerbation.
   # Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to
   pneumonia and COPD flare.  Patient has history of multiple COPD
   exacerbations and pneumonia episodes in past and continues to smoke.
   DDx includes bacterial or viral pna, e.g. [**Month/Day (2) 1845**], PCP given chronic
   steroids, acute heart failure.  Did well on AC and doing well of PS
   [**11-23**], hypercarbic back to baseline.
   - Trial of pressure support-> spontaneous breathing trial
   - Attempt to extubate to BiPAP if tolerated
   - Monitor ABGs
   - f/u BAL for cx, pcp, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1845**]
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Continue vanc, Zosyn, azithro for PNA day 3 of 8 (azithro day 3 of 5)
   - Standing nebs/inhalers after extubation
   - Daily CXR
   - FU blood cultures, urine cultures
   - Not requiring pressors, bp actually high this am
   # Acute renal failure:  Creatinine 0.7 at baseline but was 1.7 on [**1-6**]
   at rehab.  Now improving as most recent Cr is 1.2, after fluid boluses,
   likely pre-renal. DDx includes hypovolemia, hypoperfusion from sepsis,
   ATN, medication toxicity; less likely are vasculitis, post-renal
   etiologies.
   - follow UOP; foley in place
   - renally dose meds
   # Diastolic heart failure:  No evidence of volume overload on CXR.
   - hold lasix in setting of sepsis
   # Hypertension: Starting to be hypertensive
   - will restart Norvasc as patient no longer septic and hypertensive at

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, diabetes mellitus type 2, and a history of prior pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He presented with dyspnea and respiratory failure, requiring intubation and sedation. The etiology of respiratory failure is likely pneumonia (PNA) and COPD exacerbation. The patient has a history of multiple COPD exacerbations and pneumonia episodes in the past and continues to smoke.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to pneumonia and COPD flare. This condition can worsen if the patient develops further infections or if there is an exacerbation of his COPD.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient had an elevated creatinine level in the past, but it has improved. It is important to monitor renal function and prevent further deterioration.
3. Diastolic heart failure: There is no evidence of volume overload on the chest X-ray, but the patient may be at risk for diastolic heart failure due to his underlying conditions.
4. Hypertension: The patient is starting to be hypertensive, and his blood pressure needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
5. Potential infections: Given the patient's history of COPD exacerbations and pneumonia episodes, there is a risk of developing new infections while in the ICU.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with COPD and obesity admitted with acute respiratory failure likely triggered by pneumonia. The patient has successfully been extubated and is currently on supplemental oxygen to maintain good oxygenation. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD with an acute exacerbation and pneumonia puts him at risk for continued respiratory distress. Close monitoring of CO2 levels will be necessary to prevent further respiratory failure. If needed, non-invasive ventilation support or BIPAP may be used.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has likely developed pneumonia, which is indicated by the presence of bilateral lower lobe opacities and effusions on the chest X-ray. Appropriate antibiotics, such as Vancomycin and Zosyn, have been initiated to treat the infection.

3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has pleural effusions, which can complicate his respiratory status. Negative fluid balance will be continued to manage this condition.

4. Hypothermia: The patient's core temperature is slightly below the normal range (36.8°C or 98.3°F), indicating a mild hypothermia. Care should be taken to maintain adequate body temperature.

5. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient's underlying COPD may worsen due to the acute exacerbation caused by the pneumonia. Proper management with"

   secondary to pneumonia and COPD flare.  Patient has history of multiple
   COPD exacerbations and pneumonia episodes in past and continues to
   smoke.  DDx includes bacterial or viral pna, e.g. influenza, PCP given
   chronic steroids, acute heart failure.  Doing well on NC except desats
   with movement.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2, and a history of previous pulmonary embolism arrest. He presented to the hospital with difficulty breathing and respiratory failure. He was intubated and sedated upon admission. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of multiple COPD exacerbations and pneumonia episodes. He continues to smoke, which increases the risk of respiratory infections and worsening of COPD symptoms. 
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is high, ranging from 150-190s. This may be due to acute stress or underlying chronic hypertension. 
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.7, but it increased to 1.7 on January 6th. It is now improving, likely pre-renal. The differential diagnosis includes hypovolemia, hypoperfusion from sepsis, acute tubular necrosis, medication toxicity, vasculitis, and post-renal etiologies. 
4. Diastolic heart failure: The patient may have diastolic heart failure, and Lasix is being restarted based on daily assessment.

He presented with dyspnea and respiratory failure and was intubated and sedated. The likely etiology of his respiratory failure is pneumonia (PNA) and COPD exacerbation.

Regarding the hypertension, the patient's blood pressure is in the high range. Consideration should be given to starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) in the future when renal function improves.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male with obesity and COPD now admitted with respiratory failure
   in the setting of pneumonia.  He has been able to be extubated but
   retains a significant and persistent tachypnea, bronchospasm and
   dyspnea.  This is most likely related to persistent and significatn
   bronchospasm which may be exacerbated in the setting of modest volume
   overload and chest wall restriction with obesity leaving him with
   persistent respiratory distress.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Secondary to multiple active issues as follows-->
    CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION-
   -Will continue with steroid taper
   -Will continue with Albuterol/Atrovent
   -Will view 4 lpm as baseline O2 requirement
   PNEUMONIA-
   -Zosyn/Azithro/Ceftaz/Vanco but will need to refine
   -I would argue that pathogen from BAL is deserving of continued
   treatment with improvement on antibiotics it is likely covered but will
   pursue sensitivies
   -Would consider Vanco/Zosyn/Ceftaz as reasonable treatment given
   pathogens found and clinical response and will wait for final
   sensitivites from Stenothophomonas
   VOLUME OVERLOAD
   -Will continue with home dosing of Lasix
   -Goal negative one liter by end of day
   2)HYpertension-
   -Amlodipine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with obesity and COPD who is admitted with respiratory failure in the setting of pneumonia. The patient has been extubated but continues to experience significant tachypnea, bronchospasm, and dyspnea.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress may lead to further deterioration in respiratory function, potentially resulting in worsening respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is being treated with antibiotics, but there is a need for sensitivities to determine the most effective treatment. If the infection does not improve or worsens, it could lead to complications such as sepsis or abscess formation.
3. Volume Overload: The patient has a negative fluid balance, indicating fluid overload. If not managed appropriately, this could result in pulmonary edema or worsening heart failure.
4. Hypertension: The patient has persistent hypertension despite treatment. If left uncontrolled, it may lead to complications such as cardiac dysfunction or stroke.
5. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's COPD exacerbation, combined with pneumonia and obesity, increases the risk of respiratory complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can be life-threatening.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, adjust treatments accordingly, and address any complications promptly to improve the patient's outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 1380**] is a 64 year-old smoker with severe COPD on 4L home O2, DM2,
   prior PEA arrest who presented from home with dypnea and respiratory
   failure.  Was intubated and extubated succesfully. Etiology of
   respiratory failure felt to be pneumonia & COPD exacerbation.
   # Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to
   pneumonia and COPD flare.  BAL culture grew xanthomonas sensitive to
   Bactrim and Levaquin but patient has allergy.  Doing well on NC except
   desats with movement.
   - F/u BAL for senstivities
   - Will switch to Levaquin, today is day 3 of 10 of antibiotics aimed at
   treating xanthomonas
   - Stop Vanc/Ceftaz but if decompensates, consider restarting
   - Standing nebs/inhalers
   - No need for daily CXR
   - FU blood cultures
   - Bipap at night if patient will tolerate
   - Continue prednisone 60mg po daily (day 1 of this dose was [**1-14**]), will
   do slow taper and will look at how he was tapered in the past
   - Smoking cessation counseling
   #. Hypertension: Hypertension continues but has been much more
   controlled on new regimen.  Achieved -1L fluid goal today.
   - Continue home Norvasc 10mg po daily
   - Continue hydralazine 20mg po q6h
   - Have restarted home dose of Lasix 60mg today
   - Continue lisinopril 10mg daily
   # Acute renal failure:  Creatinine 0.7 at baseline but was 1.7 on [**1-6**]
   at rehab.  Now improving as most recent Cr is 1.0, likely was
   pre-renal.
   - follow UOP; foley in place as pt. unable to use urinal easily
   - renally dose meds
   # Diastolic heart failure:
   -restarted home lasix yesterday
   # Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Sugars uncontrolled on ISS
   - Restart metformin and glipizide at discharge

- Heart Rate: 86 bpm (with a range of 74-110 bpm)
- Blood Pressure: 161/73 mmHg (with a range of 89/53-168/84 mmHg)
- Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute (with a range of 16-27 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen Saturation: 94% on 4L nasal cannula

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), glucose, and lactic acid, along with decreased levels of hemoglobin (Hgb), hematocrit (Hct), and platelets (Plt). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates, and cultures were"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old man with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type 2, and a history of prior pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He presented with dyspnea and respiratory failure, which was likely due to pneumonia and a COPD exacerbation. The patient was successfully intubated and extubated. He has been diagnosed with hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure, hypertension, acute renal failure, and diastolic heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, and subsequent BAL culture grew Xanthomonas maltophilia, which is sensitive to Bactrim. However, the patient has an allergy to Bactrim. Therefore, there is a potential complication related to the ongoing infection and the need for an alternative antibiotic treatment.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's underlying severe COPD may lead to further exacerbations, especially if the current treatment does not effectively control the symptoms. This could result in repeated episodes of respiratory failure.
3. Hypertension: The patient has controlled hypertension but requires ongoing management. If not adequately controlled, it may lead to complications such as heart failure or stroke.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient previously had an elevated creatinine level of 1.7, indicating acute renal failure. Although his recent creatinine level is improving to 1.0, there"

   - Asked ID about antibiotics, felt that we should stop Zosyn as
   combination with Ceftaz gives double the side effects and has a similar
   spectrum.  Will await sensitivities of his bug to ceftaz and if
   resistant, can talk to allergy about possible Bactrim desensitization
   or challenge.  Per the patient, allergy is related to prior Lasix

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with severe COPD, diabetes mellitus type 2, and a history of prior PEA arrest. He presented with dyspnea and respiratory failure, which was likely secondary to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. The patient was successfully intubated and extubated. BAL culture grew Xanthomonas maltophilia, which is sensitive to Bactrim but the patient has an allergy. The patient is currently on NC (nasal cannula) oxygen and doing well, except for desaturation with movement. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he becomes hypoxic or hypercapneic, leading to further deterioration in his condition.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of Xanthomonas maltophilia suggests a potential ongoing infection that could lead to worsening pneumonia and respiratory failure.
3. COPD exacerbation: The patient's underlying severe COPD could lead to further exacerbations, potentially resulting in respiratory failure.
4. Allergic reaction: If the patient is exposed to sulfa drugs due to cross-reactivity with Bactrim, it may cause an allergic reaction.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was 0.7, but it increased to 1.7 on [**1-6**] at rehab and is now improving. Close monitoring of renal function"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia. The patient has been supported without the need for high-level ICU support and has been successfully weaned to 4 liters nasal cannula. The patient has tolerated diuresis and shown improvement in stability.

Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia:
   - The patient is being treated with vancomycin and ceftazidime while awaiting culture results.
   - Levofloxacin will be considered as the next step based on sensitivity results for a 14-day course.

2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):
   - The patient will be moved to a steroid taper.
   - Bronchodilators (albuterol/atrovent) will be continued.
   - Prednisone 60 will be administered.

Other:
   - The patient's nutritional needs are being met through a well-tolerated oral diet.
   - Glycemic control is being maintained with regular insulin sliding scale.
   - Lines have been placed, including an arterial line and multi-lumen line.
   - Prophylaxis measures include stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention.
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis is also being implemented.
   - The patient's code status is full"
