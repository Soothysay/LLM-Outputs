   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 52**]yF with CAD, systolic/diastolic CHF w/ EF 40%, CKD, presenting from
   rehab facility with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely
   secondary to flash pulmonary edema.
   #) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The differential diagnosis for an acute
   hypoxemic event in this patient is broad and includes both primary
   pulmonary and cardiac processes. Given the patient's worsening
   systolic/diastolic CHF, particularly in the context of an NSTEMI one
   month ago, flash pulmonary edema is the most likely cause of her
   current clinical picture. Her CXR findings and BNP of 30,000 (baseline
   10,000) support this diagnosis, as does her blood gas, which suggests
   metabolic alkalosis [**3-12**] intravascular volume contraction in the setting
   of CHF. She has had several recent admissions for CHF exacerbations,
   therefore this admission may represent a more severe presentation of a
   recurrent problem.
   It also is possible, given the patient's recent MI, that she developed
   an arrhythmia overnight that precipitated a syncopal event and her
   subsequent hypoxemia (via hypoperfusion alone, or via an aspiration
   event), or that she had another MI. No EKG changes. Her troponin was
   slightly elevated at 0.04, but this might be [**3-12**] chronic renal
   insufficiency vs demand ischemia vs volume-related myocardial stretch,
   and her CK was reassuringly normal at 40.
   With respect to a primary pulmonary process: infection and/or mucous
   plugging leading to shunt physiology are two possible diagnoses that
   could cause this clinical picture in isolation or superimposed on a CHF
   exacerbation. New superior LLL opacification on CXR suggests infection;
   however, the patient is afebrile, HD stable, with a normal white count
   (though a left shift). An acute bronchitis superimposed on COPD also
   could cause this clinical picture; the patient has some evidence of
   obstruction on flow-volume loop, as well as slightly flattened
   diaphragms on CXR, but she does not carry an official diagnosis of COPD
   (per OMR and daughter) and has no exam findings (productive cough,
   wheezing) to support this dx. An aspiration event affecting only the
   superior segment of the L lower lobe would be unusual. There is no
   evidence of PTX on CXR. And if she had a PE severe enough to cause a
   syncopal event, we would expect persistent hemodynamic instability,
   which we do not see here.
   Of all these possible diagnoses, flash pulmonary edema and mucous
   plugging are the two most likely to be rapidly reversible, resulting in
   the improved respiratory status demonstrated by this patient upon
   arrival to the floor (i.e. vent settings compatible with extubation).
   -Monitor Is/Os
   -40mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **], up-titrate  for goal -500 to -1L per day
   -BP control for goal SBP<140
   -Switch vent mode to PSV tomorrow AM with plan for extubation
   -Vanc/Levo/cefepime for broad-spectrum coverage of possible PNA
   -Cardiac enzymes x3 to r/o ACS
   -Telemetry to monitor for arrhythmias
   -Albuterol and Ipratropium nebulizers PRN for reactive airways
   -Sputum gram stain and cx
   -f/u blood cx
   #) CHF: As above. Pt w/ CHF exacerbation per respiratory status, CXR,
   BNP. Pt diuresed 600cc in response to 120mg IV lasix. Concern for
   repeated flash pulmonary edema with cessation of PEEP following
   extubation.
   -Optimize afterload reduction and fluid status prior to extubation
   -Continue diuresis with 20mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **] (double home dose)
   -Consider adding home BB for increased diastolic filling time if HR>75
   #) HTN: BPs ranged between 130-150/50-60 in week prior to admission.
   While afterload reduction will be key to preventing future episodes of
   flash edema, patient's diastolic pressure and therefore SVR may be at a
   minimum already. Overnight BP reflects sedation with propofol.
   -Hydralazine 10mg per OGT Q6H + Isosorbide Mononitrate 20mg per OGT [**Hospital1 **]
   for afterload reduction
   #) CAD: Stable. No clinical, EKG, or laboratory evidence for new ACS
   event.
   -Complete r/o for ACS
   -ASA 81mg daily per OGT
   -Clopidogrel 75mg daily per OGT
   -Repeat EKG
   #) CKD: Cr appears to be at new baseline of 2.4 s/p contrast
   nephropathy.
   -Trend BUN/Cr
   -Renally dose meds
   #) Type 2 Diabetes: Controlled with diet at home. Elevated blood sugar
   on admission may reflect IV solumedrol.
   -Insulin SS + hypoglycemia protocol
   #) Anemia: Pt's HCT is 35, up from 28 on d/c from [**Hospital1 54**] last month. HCT
   has been labile over last several years, 26-40, which may reflect
   fluctuating volume status.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly female with a history of CAD, systolic/diastolic CHF, CKD, and type 2 diabetes presenting from a rehabilitation facility with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure. The likely cause of her current clinical picture is flash pulmonary edema due to worsening systolic/diastolic CHF, supported by CXR findings, BNP levels, and blood gas analysis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a possibility of further deterioration. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and ventilation support is necessary.

2. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of CAD and CHF, cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction could arise. Telemetry monitoring should be continued to detect any arrhythmias promptly.

3. Pulmonary Edema: Flash pulmonary edema is likely the cause of the patient's current condition. Close monitoring of fluid balance and diuresis is essential to prevent recurrent episodes of pulmonary edema.

4. Infection: Although the patient is currently afebrile, there is a possibility of underlying infection. Cultures should be obtained to rule out pneumonia or other infections that may contribute to respiratory failure.

5. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest renal insufficiency, which may be related to contrast nephropathy. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 52**]yF with CAD, systolic/diastolic CHF w/ EF 40%, CKD, presenting from
   rehab facility with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary
   to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of worsening CHF.
   #) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The differential diagnosis for an acute
   hypoxemic event in this patient is broad and includes both primary
   pulmonary and cardiac processes. Given the patient's several-month
   history of worsening systolic/diastolic CHF, particularly in the
   context of an NSTEMI one month ago, flash pulmonary edema is the most
   likely cause of her current clinical picture. She does not appear
   volume-overloaded on exam, but her CXR findings and BNP of 30,000
   (baseline 10,000) support this diagnosis. We might have expected an
   improved clinical picture this morning, given that the patient ran -1L
   yesterday; however, neither fluid nor hemodynamic status is currently
   optimized, the latter in part because of agitation in setting of
   intubation. Concern is for repeat flash edema with cessation of PEEP
   following extubation.
   -Hold extubation until hemodynamic and fluid status optimized;
   re-evaluate in PM
   -Increase lasix to 80mg IV BID, up-titrate  for goal -500 to -1L per

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 52**]yF with CAD, systolic/diastolic CHF w/ EF 40%, CKD, presenting from
   rehab facility with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary
   to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of worsening CHF.
   #) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The differential diagnosis for an acute
   hypoxemic event in this patient is broad and includes both primary
   pulmonary and cardiac processes. Given the patient's several-month
   history of worsening systolic/diastolic CHF, particularly in the
   context of an NSTEMI one month ago, flash pulmonary edema is the most
   likely cause of her current clinical picture. She does not appear
   volume-overloaded on exam, but her CXR findings and BNP of 30,000
   (baseline 10,000) support this diagnosis. We might have expected an
   improved clinical picture this morning, given that the patient ran -1L
   yesterday; however, neither fluid nor hemodynamic status is currently
   optimized, the latter in part because of agitation in setting of
   intubation. Concern is for repeat flash edema with cessation of PEEP
   following extubation.
   -Hold extubation until hemodynamic and fluid status optimized;
   re-evaluate in PM
   -Increase lasix to 80mg IV BID, up-titrate  for goal -500 to -1L per
   day
   -Re-start home-dose beta blocker (Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID) for
   negative inotropic effect
   -Re-start home-dose CCB (Felodipine 10mg PO daily) for negative
   inotropic effect

   Agree with excellent MS IV note.  In summary, she is an elderly female
   with CHF, HTN, here with flash pulmonary edema.  Minimal vent settting,
   but persistent evidence of CHF on CXR and ongoing agitation while
   weaning sedation.  Will continue lasix diuresis, resume beta-blocker &
   felodipine, continue imdur/hydral.  Afebrile and left sided infiltrate
   resolved so will stop antibiotics.   Will continue to optimize for
   possible extubation.  Will need to discuss with family poor prognosis.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), systolic/diastolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 40%, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and coronary artery disease (CAD). She presented to the ICU with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of worsening CHF.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition is hypoxemic respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema. If not properly managed, she may continue to experience respiratory distress and further deterioration in oxygenation.

2. Repeat Flash Edema: Given the patient's history of CHF and the recent worsening of her condition, there is a risk of repeat flash edema upon cessation of PEEP following extubation. This can lead to recurrent respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability.

3. Diabetic Complications: Although the patient's diabetes is currently controlled with diet, her elevated blood sugar on admission may indicate a need for insulin management. Poor glycemic control can increase the risk of infections and other complications.

4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of CHF, HTN, and CAD. Improper management of her cardiovascular condition may lead to worsening heart failure symptoms, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest.

5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's CKD is"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has a history of chronic heart failure and presents with acute decompensated heart failure, respiratory failure, and possible pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated heart failure: The patient's current condition suggests worsening of pre-existing heart failure, leading to fluid overload and pulmonary congestion.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is unable to maintain adequate gas exchange on his own, requiring mechanical ventilation support.
3. Possible pneumonia: Right basilar consolidation and effusion observed on chest X-ray may indicate pneumonia, although atelectasis cannot be completely ruled out.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization from being bedridden.
5. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and the use of certain medications can increase the risk of developing stress ulcers.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Due to the patient's chronic heart failure and electrolyte imbalances, there is a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Fluid overload and decreased renal perfusion due to heart failure can"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic/diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40%, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and type 2 diabetes. The patient presented with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of worsening CHF.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, CHF/HTN, CAD, CKD, and type 2 diabetes. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate in the 60s, blood pressure ranging from 118-149/37-57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 118.

The patient has shown improvement in hemodynamics and fluid status today, as indicated by vital signs, intake/output chart, and chest X-ray. However, there are still concerns for repeat flash pulmonary edema with cessation of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) upon extubation, as well as the patient's ability to tolerate post-extubation bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP).

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension (HTN), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- She presented with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of worsening CHF.
- The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
- Diuresis has been initiated with furosemide to manage fluid overload.
- Sedation has been changed from propofol to dexmedetomidine to minimize agitation and optimize hemodynamics prior to extubation.
- Beta-blockers and afterload reduction medications are being continued to manage CHF and HTN.
- The patient's diabetes is being managed with insulin and a hypoglycemia protocol.
- Renal function is being monitored due to CKD.
- The patient's potassium levels are being repleted.
- Nutrition and glycemic control are also being addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Repeat flash pulmonary edema: The patient may be at risk for another episode of flash pulmonary edema upon cessation of PEEP upon extubation.
2. Tolerance of post-extubation BiPAP: The patient may not tolerate post-extubation bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP).
3. Agitation upon extubation: The patient has been agitated with lower levels of sedation, which could pose a challenge during the ext"

   [**Age over 90 52**]yF with CAD, systolic/diastolic CHF w/ EF 40%, CKD, presenting from
   rehab facility with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary
   to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of worsening CHF.
   #) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The differential diagnosis for an acute
   hypoxemic event in this patient is broad and includes both primary
   pulmonary and cardiac processes. Given the patient's several-month
   history of worsening systolic/diastolic CHF, particularly in the
   context of an NSTEMI one month ago, flash pulmonary edema is the most
   likely cause of her current clinical picture. She does not appear
   volume-overloaded on exam, but her CXR findings and BNP of 30,000
   (baseline 10,000) support this diagnosis. We might have expected an
   improved clinical picture this morning, given that the patient ran -1L
   yesterday; however, neither fluid nor hemodynamic status is currently
   optimized, the latter in part because of agitation in setting of
   intubation. Concern is for repeat flash edema with cessation of PEEP
   following extubation.
   -Hold extubation until hemodynamic and fluid status optimized;
   re-evaluate in PM
   -Increase lasix to 80mg IV BID, up-titrate  for goal -500 to -1L per
   day
   -Re-start home-dose beta blocker (Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID) for
   negative inotropic effect
   -Re-start home-dose CCB (Felodipine 10mg PO daily) for negative
   inotropic effect

   and therefore SVR may be at a minimum already.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of CAD, systolic/diastolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 40%, CKD, and type 2 diabetes. She presented to the ICU with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of worsening CHF. She has been on mechanical ventilation since admission. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 137/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 40% FiO2. She is on propofol for sedation.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute hypoxemic event is likely due to flash pulmonary edema secondary to worsening CHF. This diagnosis is supported by her history of CHF, elevated BNP levels, and chest X-ray findings. There is concern for repeat flash edema with cessation of PEEP following extubation. Therefore, it is recommended to hold extubation until hemodynamic and fluid status are optimized. Other interventions include increasing Lasix to 80mg IV BID, restarting home-dose beta blockers and calcium channel blockers for negative inotropic effects, continuing hydralazine + isosorbide mononitrate for afterload reduction, and discussing goals of care with the primary"

   rehab facility with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary
   to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of worsening CHF.
   #) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The differential diagnosis for an acute
   hypoxemic event in this patient is broad and includes both primary
   pulmonary and cardiac processes. Given the patient's several-month
   history of worsening systolic/diastolic CHF, particularly in the
   context of an NSTEMI one month ago, flash pulmonary edema is the most
   likely cause of her current clinical picture. She does not appear
   volume-overloaded on exam, but her CXR findings and BNP of 30,000
   (baseline 10,000) support this diagnosis. We might have expected an
   improved clinical picture this morning, given that the patient ran -1L
   yesterday; however, neither fluid nor hemodynamic status is currently
   optimized, the latter in part because of agitation in setting of
   intubation. Concern is for repeat flash edema with cessation of PEEP
   following extubation.
   -Hold extubation until hemodynamic and fluid status optimized;
   re-evaluate in PM
   -Increase lasix to 80mg IV BID, up-titrate  for goal -500 to -1L per
   day
   -Re-start home-dose beta blocker (Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID) for
   negative inotropic effect
   -Re-start home-dose CCB (Felodipine 10mg PO daily) for negative
   inotropic effect

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic/diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40%, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and type 2 diabetes. She presented from a rehabilitation facility with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of worsening CHF.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's current clinical picture is consistent with flash pulmonary edema, which is likely causing her acute hypoxemic event. Optimization of fluid and hemodynamic status is crucial to prevent repeat flash edema, especially after extubation.
2) CHF/HTN: The patient has systolic/diastolic CHF and hypertension. Afterload reduction will be key in preventing future episodes of flash edema. However, the patient's diastolic pressure and systemic vascular resistance may already be at a minimum.
3) CAD: The patient's CAD is currently stable with no clinical, EKG, or laboratory evidence of a new acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event. Further evaluation with third set cardiac enzymes is recommended to rule out any ACS.
4) CKD: The patient's creatinine level appears to be at a new baseline of 2.4 due to contrast nephropathy. Monitoring trends in BUN/Cr and adjusting medication dosages based on renal function is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic/diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40%, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and type 2 diabetes. The patient presented to the hospital with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of worsening CHF.

The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow. The vital signs show a blood pressure of 157/58 mmHg, heart rate of 50 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's TropT level is elevated at 0.04, indicating some cardiac injury.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, BUN, and potassium. The physical examination reveals clear lungs, rales at the lung bases, jugular venous distention (JVD) of 6cm, regular rhythm with normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and distal pulses (DPs) 1+ bilaterally.

The assessment and plan include several diagnoses and corresponding treatment plans. The main concerns are hypoxic respiratory failure, CHF/HTN, and CAD. The treatment plan includes sedation with dexmedetomidine, diuresis with f"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly, frail-appearing individual who was admitted with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic/diastolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 40%, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and type 2 diabetes. The patient underwent successful extubation and is currently on room air with normal oxygen saturation. Vital signs include a heart rate in the 50s, blood pressure in the 140s/40s, and respiratory rate at 18 breaths per minute. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, no crackles or wheezes, regular heart rhythm, and warm, well-perfused extremities. Laboratory results show stable creatinine levels and electrolytes. The patient's current respiratory status is reassuring, but additional diuresis is warranted to prevent recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema. Long-term prognosis is poor, and goals of care need to be re-addressed, given the possibility of re-intubation on this admission. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema: The patient's history of CHF and recent episode of flash pulmonary edema indicate a risk for recurrent episodes, especially if diuresis is not adequately managed.
2. Re-intubation: Due to the poor long-term prognosis and the"

   today per vital signs, Is/Os, CXR. Still room for additional diuresis.
   Pt apneic on 40mcg/kg/min of propofol, agitated w/ lower levels of
   sedation, RSBI 118 on PSV trial. Concern for repeat flash pulmonary
   edema w/ cessation of PEEP upon extubation, plus patient may not
   tolerate post extubation BiPAP.
   -Change sedation from propofol to dexmedetomidine to minimize agitation
   and optimize hemodynamics prior to extubation
   -Continue diuresis w/ furosemide 80mg IV BID
   -SBT this afternoon following reassessment of fluid status
   -Continue beta blockade with carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   -Continue afterload reduction with hydralazine + isosorbide mononitrate
   -Albuterol and Ipratropium nebulizers PRN for reactive airways in
   setting of CHF
   -check sputum gram stain and cx for baseline prior to extubation
   -f/u blood cx @ OSH
    #) CHF/HTN: As above. While afterload reduction will be key to
   preventing future episodes of flash edema, patient's diastolic pressure
   and therefore SVR may be at a minimum already.
   -Continue carvedilol12.5mg PO BID
   -Continue Hydralazine 10mg per OGT Q6H + Isosorbide Mononitrate 20mg
   per OGT [**Hospital1 **] for afterload reduction
   -Continue diuresis with 80mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **]
   #) CAD: Stable. Pt is s/p NSTEMI one month ago, treated with cath and
   BMS to left circumflex. No clinical, EKG, or laboratory evidence for
   new ACS event on this admission.
   -ASA 81mg daily per OGT
   -Clopidogrel 75mg daily per OGT
   #) CKD: BUN 74, up from 57 on admission, likely [**3-12**] aggressive
   diuresis. Cr stable at new baseline of 2.4 s/p contrast nephropathy
   from cardiac cath on last admission.
   -Trend BUN/Cr
   -Renally dose meds
   #) Type 2 Diabetes: Controlled with diet at home. Elevated blood sugar
   on admission likely [**3-12**] steroids @ OSH. BS 93 this morning.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, systolic/diastolic congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She presented with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of worsening CHF. The patient successfully underwent extubation with oxygen maintained above 94% on room air. Her respiratory status is currently reassuring, but additional diuresis is still warranted to prevent recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema. The long-term prognosis is poor, and goals of care need to be re-addressed due to the possibility of re-intubation on this admission.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure has already resolved, but there is a risk of recurrence if appropriate diuresis is not maintained.
2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): Although the acute exacerbation of CHF has resolved, continued diuresis is necessary to prevent future episodes of flash pulmonary edema.
3. Hypertension (HTN): The patient was hypertensive yesterday, indicating potential difficulty in controlling blood pressure.
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) one month ago, treated with catheterization and bare-metal stent placement in the left circumflex artery. There is no clinical, EKG"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic/diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40%, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient presented with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure and flash pulmonary edema, which has since resolved after being placed on ventilator support. The patient successfully underwent extubation with oxygen saturation maintained above 94% on room air.

The patient's current respiratory status is reassuring; however, recurrent flash pulmonary edema remains a concern. The patient continues to diuresis well, with a negative fluid balance of 1.8 liters yesterday. The long-term prognosis is poor, and goals of care will need to be readdressed due to the possibility of requiring re-intubation on this or future admissions.

The patient's CHF exacerbation has resolved, and she has lost a total of 6 liters of fluid. The patient may be near euvolemic, but she will need to continue with aggressive diuresis at home to remain negative to euvolemic.

In terms of medications, the patient is currently on carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID, felodipine 10mg PO daily, lasix 80mg PO BID (considering a change to 40mg PO BID if creat"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic/diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40%, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient presented with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of worsening CHF and is now post successful extubation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema: The patient has had a previous episode of flash pulmonary edema, which is a serious complication of CHF. Additional diuresis is recommended to prevent recurrent episodes.

2. Worsening CHF: The patient's CHF appears to be well-managed at the moment, but there is a long-term prognosis of poor outcomes. Continued diuresis with Lasix is planned to prevent exacerbation of CHF.

3. Hypertension: The patient was hypertensive yesterday, and it has been difficult to control prior to admission. The current plan is to continue with Hydralazine and Isosorbide Mononitrate for afterload reduction.

4. Cardiovascular events: The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) one month ago and was treated with catheterization and placement of a bare-metal stent (BMS"

","The patient is a 52-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic/diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 40%, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and type 2 diabetes. She presented with acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to flash pulmonary edema in the setting of worsening CHF and was successfully extubated.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 125/43 mmHg to 163/58 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is normotensive and hemodynamically stable.

Her lab results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function with a creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated cardiac enzymes but within non-specific ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute events overnight, and her respiratory status is reassuring. She is currently receiving diuretics for fluid management, beta-blockers for blood pressure control, and other medications for her CAD, CKD, and diabetes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema, worsening CHF, hypertension, acute kidney injury, and potential need for re-intub"

","Summary:
The patient presented with pulmonary edema and was admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition has been improving, with residual cough and no acute distress. The patient is well-nourished and has normal vital signs, including a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 125/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with 7 liters of negative end-expiratory pressure (L negative). Laboratory results show elevated BUN and creatinine levels, indicating possible kidney involvement. The patient's cardiac function is compromised, as indicated by heart failure (systolic and diastolic) and acute respiratory failure. No evidence of pneumonia is present. The patient requires a more aggressive diuretic regimen in the future. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin, and prophylactic measures such as DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's disposition is planned for transfer to the floor once stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: Due to compromised cardiac function, the patient may be at risk of developing cardiogenic shock, characterized by poor perfusion and hypotension.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest possible kidney involvement, which could progress to AKI if not addressed promptly.
3. Pneumonia: Although no evidence of"
