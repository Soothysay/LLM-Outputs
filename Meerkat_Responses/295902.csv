","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). The patient required invasive ventilation, IABP line insertion, cardiac arrest management, and defibrillation. The patient also has hyperkalemia, altered mental status, and multiple comorbidities including obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) - The patient experienced VF, which is a life-threatening heart rhythm disorder. It is important to monitor the patient's heart rhythm closely and provide appropriate interventions if VF occurs again.
2. Myocardial infarction (MI) - The patient had an acute MI, which can lead to further cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac function and ongoing assessment of cardiac enzymes are necessary.
3. Hyperkalemia - The patient has high potassium levels, which can be dangerous and may contribute to cardiac arrhythmias. Monitoring of potassium levels and appropriate management to correct hyperkalemia is crucial.
4. Altered mental status - The patient is unresponsive and sedated, indicating altered mental status. Regular neurological assessments and monitoring for any signs of improvement or deterioration are essential.
5. Obesity and comorbidities - The patient's obesity and presence of other comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 6047**] is a 62 yo man with CAD, CKD, DM who presents with
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest. [**Month (only) 8**] be a primary arrhythmic event versus related to
   ischemia vs post-ischemic cardiomyopathy.  More likely however seems to
   be VT from metabolic derangement/hyperkalemia given the numerous
   morphologies of his VT from the EMS & the wide intervals of his sinus
   rhythm EKG.  Unfortunately he has very poor neurologic prognosis given
   - no cooling given his instability unless becomes febrile
   - neuro consult
   - q 4 hour neuro checks
   .
   # Refractory ventricular tachycardia: may be secondary to either
   hyperkalemia or ischemia.
   - q 4 hours K+ and ABG
   - continue lidocaine drip at 2
   - continue amiodarone drip at 1mg/min
   - echo in AM to eval for WMA/ischemia
   - ACLS & amio if recurrs
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: may be related to VT versus ischemia
   - wean EPI, then levophed, then dopamine
   - IABP.  Re-evaluate need for baloon in AM.
   - Echo in AM
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: LAD and RCA occlusions appeared to be old
   - consider viability study/MIBI and revascularization if survives.
   - aspirin, statin
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: unclear if this is primary from ARF & ACE versus
   secondary to acidosis
   - monitor K q 4 hours.
   - insulin drip
   - s/p kayexalate
   .
   # Mental status: has signs of severe CNS injury with bleak prognosis
   (decerebrate posturing; babinski, dilated pupils, oculocephalics not
   intact); likely anoxic brain injury.  Given h/o fall on head and
   anticoagulation (heparin & aspirin) in the lab, CNS bleed should be
   ruled out.
   - CT head if stabilized in AM
   - EEG in AM
   - propofol for sedation, will try to avoid sedation to monitor neuro
   status.
   .
   # Tongue twitching: neurology c/s feels this is likely myoclonus.
   Seizure also on ddx
   - EEG in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely due to ACE & lasix.  [**Month (only) 8**] develop ATN
   post-code.  Still urinating
   - monitor I/O
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold nephrotoxins

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 62-year-old man with a history of cardiac arrest, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus, presented with refractory ventricular tachycardia and subsequent cardiogenic shock. He was resuscitated and intubated for airway protection. The patient's neurological status is poor, with decerebrate posturing, dilated pupils, and oculocephalic reflexes not intact. There are concerns about severe CNS injury and anoxic brain injury, and a CT head is planned in the morning to rule out CNS bleed. The patient is also showing signs of myoclonus, and an EEG is ordered to assess for seizures. The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to ACE inhibitors and lasix, and is still urinating. His blood glucose levels are being monitored, and he is on an insulin drip for diabetes management. The patient has hyperkalemia, which may be primary from acute renal failure or secondary to acidosis. His potassium levels will be monitored every 4 hours, and he received kayexalate. There is a concern for coronary artery disease with LAD and RCA occlusions appearing old, and a viability study/MIBI and revascularization are considered if the patient survives. The patient is on multiple medications including lidocaine, amiodarone, norepinephrine, dopamine, insulin, and aspirin. He is currently sedated with propof"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 6047**] is a 62 yo man with CAD, CKD, DM who presents with
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest. [**Month (only) 8**] be a primary arrhythmic event versus related to
   ischemia vs post-ischemic cardiomyopathy.  More likely however seems to
   be VT from metabolic derangement/hyperkalemia given the numerous
   morphologies of his VT from the EMS & the wide intervals of his sinus
   rhythm EKG.  Unfortunately he has very poor neurologic prognosis given
   - no cooling given his instability unless becomes febrile
   - neuro consult
   - q 4 hour neuro checks
   .
   # Refractory ventricular tachycardia: may be secondary to either
   hyperkalemia or ischemia.
   - q 4 hours K+ and ABG
   - continue lidocaine drip at 2
   - continue amiodarone drip at 1mg/min
   - echo in AM to eval for WMA/ischemia
   - ACLS & amio if recurrs
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: may be related to VT versus ischemia
   - wean EPI, then levophed, then dopamine
   - IABP.  Re-evaluate need for baloon in AM.
   - Echo in AM
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: LAD and RCA occlusions appeared to be old
   - consider viability study/MIBI and revascularization if survives.
   - aspirin, statin
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: unclear if this is primary from ARF & ACE versus
   secondary to acidosis
   - monitor K q 4 hours.
   - insulin drip
   - s/p kayexalate
   .
   # Mental status: has signs of severe CNS injury with bleak prognosis
   (decerebrate posturing; babinski, dilated pupils, oculocephalics not
   intact); likely anoxic brain injury.  Given h/o fall on head and
   anticoagulation (heparin & aspirin) in the lab, CNS bleed should be
   ruled out.
   - CT head if stabilized in AM
   - EEG in AM
   - propofol for sedation, will try to avoid sedation to monitor neuro
   status.
   .
   # Tongue twitching: neurology c/s feels this is likely myoclonus.
   Seizure also on ddx
   - EEG in AM
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely due to ACE & lasix.  [**Month (only) 8**] develop ATN
   post-code.  Still urinating
   - monitor I/O
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold nephrotoxins

   # Hypercholesterolemia: statin
   .
   # Diabetes: insulin gtt

   # PPX: heparin SQ, PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. He presented with cardiac arrest, which was likely due to refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT) secondary to either hyperkalemia or ischemia. The patient is currently in the ICU on multiple medications, including insulin, lidocaine, amiodarone, norepinephrine, and dopamine. He has been resuscitated and has returned to sinus rhythm. However, he has poor neurologic prognosis and is unresponsive with decerebrate posturing. The patient also has signs of acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and mental status changes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac arrest may have resulted in cardiogenic shock, which could be related to VT or ischemia. This can be monitored through hemodynamic parameters such as blood pressure and heart rate.
2. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of CAD with old occlusions in the LAD and RCA. Further evaluation for viability and revascularization may be needed if the patient survives.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has high levels of potassium, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications. Monitoring and management of potassium levels are crucial.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure, possibly due to ACE inhibitors and lasix."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of cardiac arrest, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. He was brought to the ICU after experiencing cardiac arrest and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxia, respiratory failure, refractory ventricular tachycardia, cardiogenic shock, hyperkalemia, mental status changes, acute renal failure, pancreatitis, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Failure: The patient has copious secretions and collapse of the left lower lobe, which can lead to difficulty in oxygenation and ventilation. The patient requires frequent suctioning and recruitment maneuvers to improve oxygenation.

2. Refractory Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient had episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which may be secondary to hyperkalemia or prior infarction/ischemia. It is important to monitor the patient's EKG and administer appropriate antiarrhythmic medications as needed.

3. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient may be experiencing cardiogenic shock due to ischemia or ventricular tachycardia. Pressors are being used to maintain blood pressure, and an echocardiogram is planned to evaluate cardiac function.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure likely due to hypoperfusion during cardiac arrest. Close"

   ischemia vs post-ischemic cardiomyopathy.  More likely however seems to
   be VT from metabolic derangement/hyperkalemia given the numerous
   morphologies of his VT from the EMS & the wide intervals of his sinus
   rhythm EKG.  Unfortunately he has very poor neurologic prognosis given
   length of resuscitation events. Decision was made not to cool given his
   instability and high risk of repeat arrythmic event
   - neuro consult
   - q 4 hour neuro checks

   # Hypoxia/respiratory failure:  pt with copious secretion and collapse
   of the LLL likely causing difficulty with hypoxia during the day
   yesterday.  s/p bronch by pulm and repeated suctioning to remove
   secretions.  Recruitment maneuver attempted yesterday this but
   unsuccessful. Likely etiology aspiration pneumonitis with some
   component of volume overload . Also consider infection given copious
   secretions but this less likely. Was started on propofol yesterday
   given concern for dysynchronous bretahing, but unclear that propofol
   improved his respiratory status or rate. FiO2 weaned to 70%.
   - f/u pulm recs
   - t/c BAL today to assess for infection
   - t/c esophageal balloon to assess optimal peep pressures.
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as able
   - d/c propofol and continuously eval need for sedation
   - f/u CXR

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes who presented with cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated and admitted to the ICU. The patient has poor neurological prognosis due to prolonged resuscitation events and is unresponsive. He has hypoxia and respiratory failure with copious secretions and collapsed left lower lobe, likely causing difficulty with oxygenation. The patient also has refractory ventricular tachycardia, possibly secondary to hyperkalemia or prior infarction/ischemia. He is still requiring pressors overnight and has cardiogenic shock, which may be related to VT or ischemia. The patient also has acute renal failure due to hypoperfusion during cardiac arrest, hyperkalemia, mental status changes with severe CNS injury, tongue twitching, pancreatitis with inflammation surrounding the pancreas, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a history of refractory ventricular tachycardia, which can potentially recur.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is still requiring pressors overnight, indicating ongoing cardiogenic shock.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure due to hypoperfusion during cardiac arrest. This condition can lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient has inflammation surrounding the pancreas,"

   Imaging:
   CT Head: (final) 1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or
   major territorial infarct is apparent. Of note, MRI with
   diffusion-weighted sequences are more sensitive for evaluation of acute
   ischemia.
   2. Extensive sinus disease.
   CT C-spine: (final)
   1. No evidence of acute fracture or traumatic malalignment.
   2. Mild to moderate multilevel degenerative changes with central canal
   narrowing from posterior disc osteophyte complexes. Severe assymetric
   facetjoint degenerative disease on the left at C3-4.
   3. Extensive sinus disease. Dedicated CT sinus may be obtained to
   furtherevaluate as indicated.
   CT Chest: (prelim)
   1. Complete collapse of the left lower lobe and partial collapse of the
   right lower lobe, likely secondary to secretions. Small bilateral
   pleural effusions.
   2. Diffuse stranding around the body and tail of the pancreas which is
   concerning for pancreatitis. Clinical correlation is recommended. If
   there is clinical concern for pancreatitis, a CT of the abdomen may be
   obtained for further characterization.
   3. Bilateral indeterminate low-density lesions within the kidneys
   bilaterally which statistically most likely represent renal cysts. An
   ultrasound may be obtained for further characterization.
   4. Multiple right-sided rib fractures involving ribs one through five
   anteriorly and possible fracture of rib nine posteriorly.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 6047**] is a 62 yo man with CAD, CKD, DM who presents with
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest. Most likely primary arrhythmic event from possible
   hyperkalemia rather than secondary to ischemia.  Pt s/p multiple
   episodes of refractory VT and repeated cycles of CPR/shocks. d/c
   lidocaine gtt yesterday w/o further episodes of VT/arrhythmia.
   - continue amiodarone drip at 1mg/min
   - ACLS & lidocaine if recurs
   .
   # Hypoxia/respiratory failure:  pt with copious secretion and collapse
   of the LLL likely causing difficulty with hypoxia during the day
   yesterday.  s/p bronch by pulm and repeated suctioning to remove
   secretions.  Recruitment maneuver attempted yesterday but was
   unsuccessful [**2-11**] HoTN.  Likely etiology aspiration pneumonitis with
   some component of volume overload . Also consider infection given
   copious secretions but this less likely. Was started on propofol
   yesterday given concern for dysynchronous bretahing, but unclear that
   propofol improved his respiratory status or rate. FiO2 weaned to 70%.
   PEEP increased to 18.
   - f/u pulm recs
   - t/c BAL today to assess for infection
   - t/c esophageal balloon to assess optimal peep pressures.
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as able
   - d/c propofol and continuously eval need for sedation
   - f/u CXR
   - diuresis as below
   - optimize respiratory mechanics
 ie hypoxia improved with Left side
   up.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: may be related to VT versus ischemia.  Pt still
   requiring pressors overnight. Still has Swan in place, but without
   clear utility at this point.
   - will attempt to wean dopamine today
   - d/c Swan today
   - ECHO today
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: LAD and RCA occlusions appeared to be old
   - continue ASA
   - d/c statin given likely elevation in LFT
s and short-tern risk vs
   benefit analysis
   - check LFTs
   - echo to eval for ischemia.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: resolved.  Thought to be primary from ARF & ACE given
   history, but also possibly secondary to acidosis
   - monitor K [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Mental status: has signs of severe CNS injury with bleak prognosis
   (decerebrate posturing; babinski, dilated pupils, oculocephalics not
   intact); likely anoxic brain injury.  CT head neg for ICH.  Most likely
   [**2-11**] to hypoperfusion. No improvement in exam noted since admission
   - EEG pending
   - d/c propofol
   - neuro recs appreciated.
   - will likely need to obtain MRI
   .
   # Tongue twitching: neurology c/s feels this is likely myoclonus.
   Seizure also on ddx
   - f/u EEG read
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely due hypoperfusion in setting of cardiac
   arrest.  [**Month (only) 8**] develop ATN.  Still with good UOP.
   - monitor I/O
   - pt may require CVVH but no need for RRT at this time
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - cont lasix gtt with bolus of lasix 60 IV this am.  Goal negative 1-2L
   today
   .
   # Pancreatitis: inflammation surrounding the pancreas noted
   incidentally on  CT chest.  Lipase elevated at 870 last night but down
   to 299 this am.  Pt s/p 7L of fluid
   - will limit further fluid resuscitation given difficulty with resp
   status.
   - trend lipase
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/c statin as discussed above
   .
   # Diabetes: insulin gtt d/c
ed overnight. Pt on humalog insulin sliding
   scale.
   - continue HISS
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ, PPI
   .
   # Code: full.

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes who presented with cardiac arrest. The patient underwent multiple episodes of refractory ventricular tachycardia and cycles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia and respiratory failure due to copious secretions and collapse of the left lower lobe, which is likely causing difficulty with oxygenation. The patient has also been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, possibly related to ventricular tachycardia or ischemia. 

Other conditions include hyperkalemia, mental status changes consistent with severe CNS injury, tongue twitching likely representing myoclonus or seizures, acute renal failure due to hypoperfusion during cardiac arrest, pancreatitis with inflammation around the pancreas, and diabetes. 

The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 18. The patient is also receiving amiodarone, dopamine, and propofol infusions. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, lipase, and amylase, while other lab values such as hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count are within normal limits.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 6047**] is a 62 yo man with CAD, CKD, DM who presents with
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest. Most likely primary arrhythmic event from possible
   hyperkalemia rather than secondary to ischemia.  Pt s/p multiple
   episodes of refractory VT and repeated cycles of CPR/shocks. d/c
   lidocaine gtt yesterday w/o further episodes of VT/arrhythmia.
   - continue amiodarone drip at 1mg/min
   - ACLS & lidocaine if recurs
   .
   # Hypoxia/respiratory failure:  pt with copious secretion and collapse
   of the LLL likely causing difficulty with hypoxia during the day
   yesterday.  s/p bronch by pulm and repeated suctioning to remove
   secretions.  Recruitment maneuver attempted yesterday but was
   unsuccessful [**2-11**] HoTN.  Likely etiology aspiration pneumonitis with
   some component of volume overload . Also consider infection given
   copious secretions but this less likely. Was started on propofol
   yesterday given concern for dysynchronous bretahing, but unclear that
   propofol improved his respiratory status or rate. FiO2 weaned to 70%.
   PEEP increased to 18.
   - f/u pulm recs
   - t/c BAL today to assess for infection
   - t/c esophageal balloon to assess optimal peep pressures.
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as able
   - d/c propofol and continuously eval need for sedation
   - f/u CXR
   - diuresis as below
   - optimize respiratory mechanics
 ie hypoxia improved with Left side
   up.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: may be related to VT versus ischemia.  Pt still
   requiring pressors overnight. Still has Swan in place, but without
   clear utility at this point.
   - will attempt to wean dopamine today
   - d/c Swan today
   - ECHO today
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: LAD and RCA occlusions appeared to be old
   - continue ASA
   - d/c statin given likely elevation in LFT
s and short-tern risk vs
   benefit analysis
   - check LFTs
   - echo to eval for ischemia.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: resolved.  Thought to be primary from ARF & ACE given
   history, but also possibly secondary to acidosis
   - monitor K [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Mental status: has signs of severe CNS injury with bleak prognosis
   (decerebrate posturing; babinski, dilated pupils, oculocephalics not
   intact); likely anoxic brain injury.  CT head neg for ICH.  Most likely
   [**2-11**] to hypoperfusion. No improvement in exam noted since admission
   - EEG pending
   - d/c propofol
   - neuro recs appreciated.
   - will likely need to obtain MRI
   .
   # Tongue twitching: neurology c/s feels this is likely myoclonus.
   Seizure also on ddx
   - f/u EEG read
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely due hypoperfusion in setting of cardiac
   arrest.  [**Month (only) 8**] develop ATN.  Still with good UOP.
   - monitor I/O
   - pt may require CVVH but no need for RRT at this time
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - cont lasix gtt with bolus of lasix 60 IV this am.  Goal negative 1-2L
   today
   .
   # Pancreatitis: inflammation surrounding the pancreas noted
   incidentally on  CT chest.  Lipase elevated at 870 last night but down
   to 299 this am.  Pt s/p 7L of fluid
   - will limit further fluid resuscitation given difficulty with resp
   status.
   - trend lipase

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 62-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus, presented with cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. The patient required multiple episodes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation for refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxia and respiratory failure. 

The patient has been sedated with propofol to facilitate synchronization with the ventilator. He continues to require pressors to maintain blood pressure. The patient's mental status is severely compromised, with signs of severe central nervous system (CNS) injury and bleak prognosis. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is pending to assess for seizure activity. 

The patient's renal function is compromised, likely secondary to hypoperfusion during cardiac arrest. Acute renal failure is suspected, and the patient may require continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) in the future. 

There is evidence of pancreatitis on CT scan, with elevated lipase levels. Fluid resuscitation is being limited due to difficulty with respiratory status. 

The patient's diabetes is being managed with sliding scale insulin. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM) admitted to the ICU after experiencing cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and anoxic encephalopathy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/51 mmHg to 125/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has been weaned off propofol and has had his swan-ganz catheter removed. He has been suctioning purulent secretions and his FiO2 has been decreased to 40%. The patient's urine output has been fluctuating, with positive fluid balance.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, lactate, and liver enzymes. The patient's platelet count is slightly low.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's cardiac arrest was likely caused by hyperkalemia due to ACE inhibitor therapy. Amiodarone has been started, but the dose may need to be decreased due to hypotension.

The patient is still experiencing cardiogenic shock, and low-dose dopamine has been restarted to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 6047**] is a 62 yo man with CAD, CKD, DM who presents with
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest. Most likely primary arrhythmic event from possible
   hyperkalemia rather than secondary to ischemia.  Pt s/p multiple
   episodes of refractory VT and repeated cycles of CPR/shocks. d/c
   lidocaine gtt yesterday w/o further episodes of VT/arrhythmia.
   - continue amiodarone drip at 1mg/min
   - ACLS & lidocaine if recurs
   .
   # Hypoxia/respiratory failure:  pt with copious secretion and collapse
   of the LLL likely causing difficulty with hypoxia during the day
   yesterday.  s/p bronch by pulm and repeated suctioning to remove
   secretions.  Recruitment maneuver attempted yesterday but was
   unsuccessful [**2-11**] HoTN.  Likely etiology aspiration pneumonitis with
   some component of volume overload . Also consider infection given
   copious secretions but this less likely. Was started on propofol
   yesterday given concern for dysynchronous bretahing, but unclear that
   propofol improved his respiratory status or rate. FiO2 weaned to 70%.
   PEEP increased to 18.
   - f/u pulm recs
   - t/c BAL today to assess for infection
   - t/c esophageal balloon to assess optimal peep pressures.
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as able
   - d/c propofol and continuously eval need for sedation
   - f/u CXR
   - diuresis as below
   - optimize respiratory mechanics
 ie hypoxia improved with Left side
   up.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: may be related to VT versus ischemia.  Pt still
   requiring pressors overnight. Still has Swan in place, but without
   clear utility at this point.
   - will attempt to wean dopamine today
   - d/c Swan today
   - ECHO today
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: LAD and RCA occlusions appeared to be old
   - continue ASA
   - d/c statin given likely elevation in LFT
s and short-tern risk vs
   benefit analysis
   - check LFTs
   - echo to eval for ischemia.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: resolved.  Thought to be primary from ARF & ACE given
   history, but also possibly secondary to acidosis
   - monitor K [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Mental status: has signs of severe CNS injury with bleak prognosis
   (decerebrate posturing; babinski, dilated pupils, oculocephalics not
   intact); likely anoxic brain injury.  CT head neg for ICH.  Most likely
   [**2-11**] to hypoperfusion. No improvement in exam noted since admission
   - EEG pending
   - d/c propofol
   - neuro recs appreciated.
   - will likely need to obtain MRI
   .
   # Tongue twitching: neurology c/s feels this is likely myoclonus.
   Seizure also on ddx
   - f/u EEG read
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely due hypoperfusion in setting of cardiac
   arrest.  [**Month (only) 8**] develop ATN.  Still with good UOP.
   - monitor I/O
   - pt may require CVVH but no need for RRT at this time
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - cont lasix gtt with bolus of lasix 60 IV this am.  Goal negative 1-2L
   today
   .
   # Pancreatitis: inflammation surrounding the pancreas noted
   incidentally on  CT chest.  Lipase elevated at 870 last night but down
   to 299 this am.  Pt s/p 7L of fluid
   - will limit further fluid resuscitation given difficulty with resp
   status.
   - trend lipase
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/c statin as discussed above
   .
   #Diabetes: insulin gtt d/c
ed overnight. Pt on humalog insulin sliding
   scale.
   - continue HISS
   .
   # PPX: SQH, PPI
   .
   # Code: full.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and anoxic encephalopathy. The patient's condition has been stable, with improvements observed in oxygenation and respiratory support. However, there are several potential medical complications that could arise:

1. Cardiac arrest: Although the patient has not experienced further episodes of pulseless arrhythmia since the implementation of the rapid response team and amiodarone infusion, there is still a risk of recurrent arrhythmias. Continuous monitoring and close cardiac observation are necessary.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's blood pressure remains within an acceptable range, but dopamine was titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 50s. If the patient's hemodynamics deteriorate or if there is evidence of tamponade, further intervention may be required.

3. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygenation has improved with suctioning of secretions and diuresis. However, the possibility of a pulmonary embolism (PE) remains, especially given the recent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. If the patient's condition worsens or if it becomes difficult to ventilate, a V/Q scan may be considered.

4. Anoxic encephalopathy: The patient's neuro status has remained stable, but there is a need for close neurological follow-up. An MRI head"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 6047**] is a 62 yo man with CAD, CKD, DM who presents with
   cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest. Most likely primary arrhythmic event from possible
   hyperkalemia rather than secondary to ischemia.  Pt s/p multiple
   episodes of refractory VT and repeated cycles of CPR/shocks. d/c
   lidocaine gtt yesterday w/o further episodes of VT/arrhythmia.
   - continue amiodarone drip at 1mg/min
   - ACLS & lidocaine if recurs
   .
   # Hypoxia/respiratory failure:  pt with copious secretion and collapse
   of the LLL likely causing difficulty with hypoxia during the day
   yesterday.  s/p bronch by pulm and repeated suctioning to remove
   secretions.  Recruitment maneuver attempted yesterday but was
   unsuccessful [**2-11**] HoTN.  Likely etiology aspiration pneumonitis with
   some component of volume overload . Also consider infection given
   copious secretions but this less likely. Was started on propofol
   yesterday given concern for dysynchronous bretahing, but unclear that
   propofol improved his respiratory status or rate. FiO2 weaned to 70%.
   PEEP increased to 18.
   - f/u pulm recs
   - t/c BAL today to assess for infection
   - t/c esophageal balloon to assess optimal peep pressures.
   - wean PEEP and FiO2 as able
   - d/c propofol and continuously eval need for sedation
   - f/u CXR
   - diuresis as below
   - optimize respiratory mechanics
 ie hypoxia improved with Left side
   up.
   .
   # Cardiogenic shock: may be related to VT versus ischemia.  Pt still
   requiring pressors overnight. Still has Swan in place, but without
   clear utility at this point.
   - will attempt to wean dopamine today
   - d/c Swan today
   - ECHO today
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: LAD and RCA occlusions appeared to be old
   - continue ASA
   - d/c statin given likely elevation in LFT
s and short-tern risk vs
   benefit analysis
   - check LFTs
   - echo to eval for ischemia.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: resolved.  Thought to be primary from ARF & ACE given
   history, but also possibly secondary to acidosis
   - monitor K [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # Mental status: has signs of severe CNS injury with bleak prognosis
   (decerebrate posturing; babinski, dilated pupils, oculocephalics not
   intact); likely anoxic brain injury.  CT head neg for ICH.  Most likely
   [**2-11**] to hypoperfusion. No improvement in exam noted since admission
   - EEG pending
   - d/c propofol
   - neuro recs appreciated.
   - will likely need to obtain MRI
   .
   # Tongue twitching: neurology c/s feels this is likely myoclonus.
   Seizure also on ddx
   - f/u EEG read
   .
   # Acute renal failure: likely due hypoperfusion in setting of cardiac
   arrest.  [**Month (only) 8**] develop ATN.  Still with good UOP.
   - monitor I/O
   - pt may require CVVH but no need for RRT at this time
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold nephrotoxins
   - cont lasix gtt with bolus of lasix 60 IV this am.  Goal negative 1-2L
   today
   .
   # Pancreatitis: inflammation surrounding the pancreas noted
   incidentally on  CT chest.  Lipase elevated at 870 last night but down
   to 299 this am.  Pt s/p 7L of fluid
   - will limit further fluid resuscitation given difficulty with resp
   status.
   - trend lipase
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/c statin as discussed above
   .
   # Diabetes: insulin gtt d/c
ed overnight. Pt on humalog insulin sliding
   scale.
   - continue HISS
   .
   # PPX: heparin SQ, PPI
   .
   # Code: full.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of cardiac arrest, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He presented with cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. The patient has multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) involving the respiratory system, cardiovascular system, central nervous system (CNS), and renal system.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has copious secretions, collapse of the left lower lobe, and difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. This indicates a high risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The presence of copious secretions and the need for bronchoscopy suggest a possibility of pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient still requires pressors overnight, indicating ongoing hypotension and potential cardiogenic shock.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypoperfusion during cardiac arrest. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary.
5. Seizures: The patient exhibits signs of severe CNS injury, including decerebrate posturing and myoclonus. An EEG is pending to assess for seizure activity.
6. Pancreatitis: The patient has an elevated lipase level and inflammation surrounding the pancreas incidentally noted on CT chest. Close monitoring of pancreatic enzymes and limitation of further fluid resusc"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were stable, with a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 111/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96%, and temperature within normal range. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical history includes a recent myocardial infarction (STEMI) and a history of hypertension. No known drug allergies were reported. The patient received amiodarone and dopamine infusions, as well as other ICU medications.

The patient's review of systems remained unchanged from admission, except for the presence of sputum production. Flowsheet data showed stable hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results were within normal limits.

Lab results indicated elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, lipase, and troponin-T. Electrolyte levels showed hyperkalemia and hyponatremia. Coagulation studies revealed prolonged PT/INR and PTT.

Assessment and plan included impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, ineffective coping, hyperkalemia, altered mental status, and acute myocardial infarction. The patient was also diagnosed with ventricular fibrillation (VF).

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and anoxic encephalopathy. The patient's current condition includes pulseless VT/VF likely secondary to hyperkalemia, cardiogenic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, anoxic encephalopathy, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, pancreatitis, coronary artery disease, and diabetes mellitus. The patient is intubated and comatose, with vital signs stable but requiring close monitoring. Treatment includes amiodarone infusion for arrhythmias, dopamine for hemodynamic support, diuretics for fluid management, and various other medications for specific conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low blood pressure and inadequate organ perfusion put him at risk for further complications related to poor cardiac function, such as organ damage or failure.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's impaired gas exchange may lead to worsening oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in respiratory distress or failure.
3. Anoxic encephalopathy: The patient's brain may continue to suffer from lack of oxygen, leading to persistent neurological deficits or even brain death.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction, which can progress to complete kidney failure if not managed appropriately.

He was admitted to the ICU with cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and anoxic encephalopathy.

The patient experienced an episode of continuous gagging, and propofol was restarted with good effect. He also started tube feeds. Neurology feels that a firm prognosis will be needed in about 7 days due to evolving neurological exam. An MRI was discussed with the family, and they agreed to cancel it.

The patient received an overdose of Lasix and diuresed. He had a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit at 5 am, and samples for sputum, blood, and urine cultures were sent.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 99/55 to 121/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM) who was admitted with cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and anoxic encephalopathy. 

The patient experienced an episode of continuous gagging, which was treated with propofol. Tube feeds were started, but the neurology team believes that a firm prognosis cannot be given for at least 7 days due to evolving neurological findings. An MRI was initially planned, but the family agreed to cancel it. The patient also received an overdose of Lasix and diuresed. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure of 99/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and comatose with pupils equal, reactive to light. The physical examination reveals clear lungs, warm extremities, and dry pitting edema to mid-calves. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), creatinine (Cr), lactate, lactic acid, and troponin-T levels. The blood glucose level is also elevated. Other lab values show abnormalities in potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted to the ICU with cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and anoxic encephalopathy. The patient has been experiencing episodes of gagging, and propofol was restarted successfully. Tube feeds were initiated, but due to a formulation problem, the patient received an overdose of lasix. He diuresed and had a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit at 5 am. Sputum, blood, and urine cultures were sent. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/55 to 121/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is receiving amiodarone infusion and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a pulseless VT/VF during admission, which was likely due to hyperkalemia in the setting of ACE inhibitor therapy. The patient has been on amiodarone infusion since then. The plan is to decrease the amiodarone infusion to 0.5 mg/min given hypotension.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient was initially given low-dose dopamine for mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 50s"

   Conclusions
   Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
   cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is severe regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior, septal and apical
   akinesis (proximal LAD distribution). There is relative preservation of
   the inferolateral segments. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w
   CAD. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-5-6**], right
   ventricular function has normalized. A ""coronary"" regional distribution
   of LV wall motion abnormalities is more apparent on today's study. Mild
   pulmonary hypertension is now seen.
   Assessment and Plan

   Conclusions
   Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
   cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is severe regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior, septal and apical
   akinesis (proximal LAD distribution). There is relative preservation of
   the inferolateral segments. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w
   CAD. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-5-6**], right
   ventricular function has normalized. A ""coronary"" regional distribution
   of LV wall motion abnormalities is more apparent on today's study. Mild
   pulmonary hypertension is now seen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of CAD, CKD, and DM. He was admitted with cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and anoxic encephalopathy. The patient has had several medical complications since admission, including an episode of continuous gagging requiring propofol restart, overdose with Lasix, fever, and an evolving neurological exam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has copious secretions and pseudomonas on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), which increases the risk of developing VAP. The patient's spiked fever also suggests an infection.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, potentially due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from the cardiac arrest and shock.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to marrow suppression or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Hospital-acquired infection: Given the patient's prolonged ICU stay and invasive procedures, there is a risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) or catheter-related urinary tract infection (CAUTI).
5. Delirium: The patient's evolving neurological exam and anoxic encephalopathy put him at risk for delirium or cognitive"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of CAD, CKD, and DM admitted with cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and anoxic encephalopathy. The patient had an episode of continuous gagging and propofol was restarted with good effect. Tube feeds were started. Neurology feels that a firm prognosis cannot be given for at least 7 days due to evolving neurological exam. MRI was discussed with the family and they agreed to cancel the exam. The patient received an overdose of Lasix (due to formulation problem) and diuresed. Temp 101 at 5 am, sent sputum, blood, and urine cultures. The patient is on several medications including amiodarone, ASA, protonix, heparin, and insulin sliding scale. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient has a history of low-grade temperatures/HAP and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has copious secretions and pseudomonas on BAL. Spiked fever yesterday, so started [Doctor Last Name]/Zosyn/Cipro until sputum speciated.
2. Acute kidney injury (ARF): Cr rising, ATN arrest UOP; non-oliguric; will likely require CVVH in the next couple days if c/w family wishes.

   Conclusions
   Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
   cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is severe regional
   left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior, septal and apical
   akinesis (proximal LAD distribution). There is relative preservation of
   the inferolateral segments. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
   ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve is not well seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
   no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w
   CAD. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-5-6**], right
   ventricular function has normalized. A ""coronary"" regional distribution
   of LV wall motion abnormalities is more apparent on today's study. Mild
   pulmonary hypertension is now seen.
   Assessment and Plan
   62 M w/ CAD, CKD, DM admitted with cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock,
   hypoxic respiratory failure, and anoxic encephalopathy.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of CAD (coronary artery disease), CKD (chronic kidney disease), and DM (diabetes mellitus). The patient was admitted with cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and anoxic encephalopathy.

The patient experienced an episode of continuous gagging and required propofol to be restarted. Tube feeds were also initiated. Neurology believes that a firm prognosis will not be possible for at least 7 days due to evolving neurological exam and pupillary response. An MRI was discussed with the family, and they agreed to cancel the exam.

The patient overdosed with Lasix due to a problem with the formulation and received 100mg/hr x 3 hours. This resulted in diuresis. The patient's temperature reached 101 degrees Fahrenheit at 5 am, and samples for sputum, blood, and urine cultures were sent.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics given was Infusions: Amiodarone - 0.5 mg/min. Other medications include ASA 325, protonix, heparin sq, insulin sliding scale, and other ICU medications.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Tcurrent: 38.3 C (101 F)
- HR: 92 bpm (77-93)
- BP: 99/55 mmHg (68/49-121/65)
- RR: 26 breaths/min (17-29)
- SpO2: 97%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus Rhythm

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,029 mL and output of 2,280 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,251 mL. The patient's weight is currently 106.5 kg, with an admission weight of 100 kg.

The patient is intubated and comatose, with pupils equal and reactive. The neck collar is in place, and there is no murmurs, gallops, or rales heard in the chest. Extremities show warm, dry 1+ pitting edema to mid-calves and 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally. Neurological examination reveals no purposeful movements, but toes are upgoing bilaterally.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12.8 K/uL, elevated creatinine at 5.8 mg/dL, and elevated glucose levels. Blood cultures show moderate growth of pseudomonas. Other lab results are within normal limits.

An echocardiogram reveals severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD. There is mild pulmonary hypertension, and the right ventricular function has normalized.

Assessment and plan include the following:
- Cardiac arrest: pulseless VT/VF likely due to hyperkalemia in the setting of ACEi therapy. No further episodes have occurred since ROTC and amiodarone administration.
- Cardiogenic shock: low-dose dopamine was given for MAPs in the 50s but was quickly weaned off. Dopamine should be titrated to maintain MAP >65, and a repeat TTE should be done to evaluate biventricular function and evidence of tamponade.
- Hypoxic respiratory failure: O2 requirements are improving with suctioning of secretions, hypoxic vasoconstriction in atelectactic lung, and diuresis. Multifactorial processes should be considered, including secretions/collapse and mild volume overload. PEEP should be weaned as tolerated hemodynamically, and patient positioning should be maintained.
- Anoxic encephalopathy: neuro status is stable, and close neuro f/u is appreciated. An MRI head was planned for today.
- ARF (acute renal failure): creatinine is rising, and ATN (acute tubular necrosis) arrest UOP; non-oliguric. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) may be required in the next couple of days if consistent with family wishes.
- Low-grade temps/HAP (healthcare-associated pneumonia): sputum cx and BAL growing pseudomonas. Zosyn should be started, and cultures & sensitivities should be followed up.
- Thrombocytopenia: platelet count is stable, and the etiology is unclear. Marrow suppression is suspected, but low pre-test probability for HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) exists. Monitoring and transfusion for platelets <10K or signs of bleeding should be considered.
- Pancreatitis: presumed due to shock; lipase trending down. The patient remains hypervolemic.
- CAD: LAD and RCA occlusions appeared to be old. ASA and statin therapy should be continued, and discharge planning should be initiated.
- Transaminitis: likely due to shock liver from cardiac arrest. LFTs are trending down.

The patient requires full code status and ICU care. Nutrition is being provided through Renal (Full) at a rate of 20 mL/hr. Glycemic control is being maintained. Lines include a Cordis/Introducer and an arterial line. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) is ongoing."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted to the ICU for cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and anoxic encephalopathy. The patient underwent resuscitation efforts and received amiodarone for arrhythmias. He also required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

Since admission, the patient has shown improvement in oxygenation and hemodynamics. However, he developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and was treated with antibiotics. His renal function has deteriorated, leading to acute renal failure (ARF), and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated. The patient's platelet count has been stable but may be due to marrow suppression.

Other medical conditions include congestive heart failure (CHF) with apical akinesis, pancreatitis, and transaminitis, likely caused by shock liver. The patient's diabetes is poorly controlled, and he is receiving insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient developed VAP, which is a common complication in critically ill patients receiving mechanical ventilation. It is characterized by pneumonia occurring 48 hours or more after intubation. Treatment involves appropriate antibiotic therapy based on culture and sensitivity results.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted to the ICU with cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and multi-system organ failure (MSOF). The patient remains intubated and comatose, with controlled blood pressure and heart rate. He has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), anoxic encephalopathy, acute renal failure (ARF), pancreatitis, and transaminitis. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including amiodarone for dysrhythmia, diuretics for fluid overload, anticoagulants for pulmonary embolism (PE) and catheter-related thrombosis, antibiotics for VAP, and renal replacement therapy (RRT) for ARF. The patient's neuro status is stable, but close neurological follow-up is required. The patient's family has been informed about his condition and a code status meeting is planned. The patient is expected to be transferred to the coronary critical care unit (CCU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's current diagnosis of VAP indicates a potential infection associated with mechanical ventilation. It is important to monitor for worsening respiratory symptoms and consider appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Acute kidney injury (AK"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM) who was admitted with cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and multi-system organ failure (MSOF). 

The patient has experienced several medical complications since admission. These include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a pulseless ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) likely related to hyperkalemia in the setting of ACE inhibitor therapy. No further episodes of dysrhythmia have occurred since the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and initiation of amiodarone therapy.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is stable, with improved oxygen requirements after suctioning of secretions, hypoxic vasoconstriction in atelectatic lung, and diuresis. The cause of hypoxic respiratory failure is multifactorial, including infection leading to secretions/collapse, mild volume overload, and possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is already on systemic anticoagulation and is being weaned off PEEP as tolerated hemodynamically.

3. Acute systolic heart failure: The patient has severe regional systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 20%) in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) distribution with anterior, septal, and apical akinesis. The patient is being weaned off dopamine"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM) who was admitted with cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and anoxic encephalopathy. The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including hyperkalemia, acute on chronic heart failure, hypoxic respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), acute renal failure (ARF), low-grade fever with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), thrombocytopenia, pancreatitis, and transaminitis. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications and treatments, including dopamine, heparin, carvedilol, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and propofol. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains dependent on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's underlying CAD and recent cardiac arrest may have led to cardiogenic shock, which can cause poor tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation raise the possibility of ARDS, a life-threatening lung condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's copious secretions and pseudomonas on bronchoscopy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, ineffective coping, hyperkalemia, altered mental status, and acute myocardial infarction. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including heparin sodium, calcium gluconate, dopamine, KCl, propofol, and others. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/50 mmHg to 131/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 50%, PEEP of 14 cmH2O, and a SpO2 of 97%. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient has a history of smoking and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Stress ulcers due to the patient's critical condition and medication use.
4. Further deterioration of renal function if fluid balance is not managed properly.
5. Development of nosocomial infections due to the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM) who was admitted with cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and multi-system organ failure (MSOF). The patient has experienced several medical complications since admission.

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient likely had a pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) secondary to hyperkalemia, possibly due to ACE inhibitor therapy. No further episodes of pulseless arrhythmia have occurred since the initiation of rapid overdrive cardioversion (ROTC) and amiodarone infusion. The amiodarone infusion will be continued at 0.5 mg/min and then converted to oral amiodarone 400 mg.

2. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has acute-on-chronic CHF with cardiogenic shock. An echocardiogram shows apical akinesis. The plan includes titrating dopamine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, starting heparin infusion, and initiating carvedilol 3.125 mg once daily.

3. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen requirements are improving with suctioning of secretions, hypoxic vasoconstriction in atelectatic lung, and diuresis. Multifactorial processes, such as secretions/collapse and mild"

   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 165**] and have reviewed the history with the patient
s wife,
   daughter, and sisters, and was present during the physical examination
   noted above.  I concur with the assessment and treatment plan as
   outline above.   Mr. [**Known lastname 6050**] presented 5 days ago with a prolonged
   cardiac arrest due to pulseless ventricular tachycardia and ventricular
   fibrillation requiring multiple cardioversions.  He developed acute
   respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Cardiac catheterizations
   showed chronic occlusions not amenable to PCI.  He was also noted to
   have severely depressed left ventricular function resulting in acute
   systolic heart failure.  He has developed acute kidney failure
   requiring CVVH.  His primary limiting condition now is his
   encephalopathy (likely anoxic).  Neurology will reassess at 7 days (on
   Tuesday) regarding the underlying brain function and potential for
   recovery.  Our plan is outlined above and involves continued treatment
   of his acute renal failure and ventilatory dependence.  We will give
   him sedation to limit his movement.  This plan was communicated with
   the patient
s wife, son, daughter and two sisters.  [**Name (NI) **] questions were

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM) who presented with cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and multi-system organ failure (MSOF).
- The patient experienced ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) likely due to hyperkalemia in the setting of ACE inhibitor therapy. No further episodes of dysrhythmia have occurred since the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and initiation of amiodarone therapy.
- The patient is stable with hypoxic respiratory failure, improved with suctioning of secretions, hypoxic vasoconstriction in atelectactic lung, diuresis; multifactorial process including infection-related collapse, mild volume overload. Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains on the differential diagnosis but is improving with aforementioned measures, low-dose heparin for prophylaxis, and weaning of PEEP as tolerated hemodynamically.
- The patient has acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with severe regional systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction of 20%) in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) distribution with anterior, septal, and apical akinesis. Dopamine is being weaned but MAP is maintained above 65, prophylactic heparin gtt for akinesis, and carvedilol is continued.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted to the ICU due to cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and multi-system organ failure (MSOF). The patient experienced a cardiac arrest likely caused by hyperkalemia, which was treated with amiodarone. He also has hypoxic respiratory failure, acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), anoxic encephalopathy, acute renal failure (ARF), and presumed pancreatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest likely caused by hyperkalemia. It is important to monitor his potassium levels and continue amiodarone therapy.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's O2 requirements improved with suctioning of secretions and hypoxic vasoconstriction in atelectactic lung. Close monitoring of respiratory status and continued weaning of PEEP as tolerated hemodynamically is essential.
3. Acute systolic CHF: The patient has severe regional systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20% in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) distribution. Weaning dopamine as tolerated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and prophylactic heparin gtt for akinesis should be continued.
4. VAP: The patient has pseudomonal and moraxella infection from sputum/BAL cultures. Continuing antibiotic therapy with [**Last Name (LF) 4075**] and [**First Name3 (LF) **] is necessary. Monitoring for clinical evidence of infection and narrowing the antibiotic coverage as appropriate are important.
5. Anoxic encephalopathy: The patient's neuro status is stable, but close neurologic follow-up is required. Monitoring the neuro exam and re-evaluating prognosis on hospital day 7 is necessary. Low-dose Propofol will be continued to limit posturing.
6. ARF: The patient started citrate CVVH on [**5-10**]. Close renal follow-up and monitoring of ionized calcium levels are important. Repletion of calcium as needed should be done.
7. Pancreatitis: Presumed pancreatitis secondary to hypertriglyceridemia in the setting of acute SHF. Continued monitoring of lipase levels and management of volume status are essential.
8. CAD: The patient has occlusions in the left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA). Continuing aspirin (ASA) and carvedilol therapy is necessary.

Overall, the patient's condition remains critical with multiple organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and management of each complication are crucial for his recovery."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus (DM) who was admitted with cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and multi-system organ failure (MSOF). 

The patient experienced a pulseless ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) likely due to hyperkalemia, which was treated with amiodarone therapy. The patient is currently stable without any further episodes of dysrhythmia.

The patient is also experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which improved with suctioning of secretions, hypoxic vasoconstriction in atelectactic lung, diuresis, and systemic anticoagulation. The patient's PEEP is being weaned as tolerated hemodynamically, and they are being monitored for possible pulmonary embolism (PE) due to risk factors.

Additionally, the patient has acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with severe regional systolic dysfunction in the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) distribution, as shown by a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The patient is being weaned off dopamine while maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65, and prophylactic heparin is being given due to akinesis.

The patient also has ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by pan-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Moraxella catarrhalis. The patient is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, and vanc/zosyn has been discontinued.

Furthermore, the patient has anoxic encephalopathy with a stable neuro status. The neuro exam is being monitored, and the prognosis will be re-evaluated on hospital day 7.

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF), for which citrate continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) has been started. The patient's ionized calcium (iCa) levels are being monitored, and calcium supplementation is being given as needed.

Presumed pancreatitis is also present, with lipase levels trending down. The patient remains hypervolemic and is being managed accordingly.

The patient has a history of CAD with occlusions in the left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA), which are believed to be old. The patient is being continued on aspirin (ASA) and statin therapy, except during episodes of transaminitis.

Transaminitis is also present, likely secondary to ""shock liver"" during the cardiac arrest. The liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down.

Lastly, the patient has diabetes mellitus (DM) that requires close monitoring and management.

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending further evaluation and improvement."

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and multi-system organ failure. He was admitted with hypoxic respiratory failure, acute systolic heart failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), anoxic encephalopathy, acute renal failure (ARF), and presumed pancreatitis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He is receiving multiple medications, including vasopressors, antibiotics, and renal replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Moraxella catarrhalis. This is a common complication in patients who are mechanically ventilated for an extended period of time.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and oliguria. AKI can further complicate the management of fluid balance and medication dosing.
3. Sepsis: Given the presence of infection and multi-organ dysfunction, there is a risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and potentially worsen organ function.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of thromboembolic events. The patient is on prophylactic ant"
