","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse admitted for alcohol withdrawal. The patient has been aggressive and agitated, requiring sedation with haloperidol and lorazepam. He also received Valium, ativan, and haldol overnight. The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating no evidence of a myocardial infarction. The patient has been unable to tolerate peripheral lines due to agitation. His vital signs show sinus tachycardia, and he is on prophylactic heparin for DVT and stress ulcer prevention. The patient is currently on various medications including diazepam, lorazepam, haloperidol, metoprolol, pantoprazole, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is experiencing acute alcohol withdrawal, which can lead to symptoms such as agitation, tremors, seizures, and in severe cases, delirium tremens. The current treatment plan includes diazepam per CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment) for alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
2. Agitation/Psychosis: The patient's agitation and potential psychosis may require further evaluation by a psychiatrist. Psychiatric consults have been recommended, and zyprexa (olanzapine) may be given PRN for agitation.
3. CAD (Coronary artery disease): The patient has a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and was"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of alcohol withdrawal. The patient has a history of spitting in a nurse's face, leading to a code purple event. He was given Haldol and Ativan for sedation, but required additional doses of Valium, Ativan, and Haldol overnight. The patient's mental status was deemed too sedated for an interview by a psychiatrist, and they recommended discontinuing Mirtazapine and Trazodone. The patient has a known allergy to Dilantin (Oral) with a rash as the reaction. His last dose of antibiotics was on 09/29/2023. The patient is currently receiving various ICU medications, including Pantoprazole, Heparin Sodium, Lorazepam, Haloperidol, Diazepam, and Metoprolol. Other medications include changes to his medical and family history. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient's symptoms of agitation, increased heart rate, and spitting at a nurse indicate severe alcohol withdrawal. If left untreated, it can progress to more serious complications such as seizures and delirium tremens.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) suggests a possible infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the source and appropriate treatment.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3317**] is a 52 yo male with known alcohol abuse and multiple
   admissions and AMAs readmitted for ETOH withdrawal now not requiring
   benzos.
   .
   1. Alcohol withdrawal. Patient not requiring any benzos since 3:30pm
   yesterday. Now 6 days out of last ETOH.  Patient
s CIWA scales likely
   confounded by agitation not necessarily related to active withdrawal.
   Patient calmer over last 24 hours. Good response to IV Haldol
   - discontinue CIWA scale, can restart if patient appears to be in
   withdrawal
   - Continue IV Haldol and PO Haldol and uptitrate as needed to control
   agitation
   - Check EKG and QTC on haldol
   - Thiamine (can switch to PO), MVI, folate
   - Psych and social work following, appreciate recs
   .
   2. Agitation/Psych.  Improved overnight on Haldol. Also out of window
   period for acute withdrawal. Not requiring 4pt restraints
   - Switch to 2pt restraints if tolerated
   - Haldol per above
   - continue to hold remeron, trazodone pre psych recs
   - zyprexa PRN for agitation
   - f/u psych recs
   .
   3. CAD: h/o MI.  Had ant ST depressions on admission in setting of
   tachycardia, now resolved.  Ruled out for MI with enzymes x3.
   -daily aspirin
   -consider outpt stress test
   .
   4. Hypertension.  Likely worse secondary to alcohol withdrawal.
   - continue home HCTZ, no need for standing metoprolol
   .
   5. H/o seizure disorder. continue keppra
   .

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and multiple admissions for ethanol withdrawal. He is currently in the ICU and has been treated with various medications including lopressor, ativan, haldol, valium, heparin, and aspirin. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 111/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is alert and calm, but still requires 2-point restraints. His laboratory results show normal levels for white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, glucose, electrolytes, and liver enzymes. The patient's agitation has improved overnight with the use of haldol. The assessment and plan include continuing IV and PO haldol to control agitation, checking EKG and QTc interval, administering thiamine, MVI, and folate, and arranging for psychiatric and social work follow-up. Other conditions such as CAD, hypertension, and seizure disorder are also being managed with appropriate medications. The patient has femoral line access and is on full code status."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 3317**] is a 52 yo male with known alcohol abuse and multiple
   admissions and AMAs readmitted for ETOH withdrawal now not requiring
   benzos.
   .
   1. Alcohol withdrawal. Patient not requiring any benzos since 3:30pm
   yesterday. Now 6 days out of last ETOH.  Patient
s CIWA scales likely
   confounded by agitation not necessarily related to active withdrawal.
   Patient calmer over last 24 hours. Good response to IV Haldol
   - discontinue CIWA scale, can restart if patient appears to be in
   withdrawal
   - Continue IV Haldol and PO Haldol and uptitrate as needed to control
   agitation
   - Check EKG and QTC on haldol
   - Thiamine (can switch to PO), MVI, folate
   - Psych and social work following, appreciate recs
   .
   2. Agitation/Psych.  Improved overnight on Haldol. Also out of window
   period for acute withdrawal. Not requiring 4pt restraints
   - Switch to 2pt restraints if tolerated
   - Haldol per above
   - continue to hold remeron, trazodone pre psych recs
   - zyprexa PRN for agitation
   - f/u psych recs
   .
   3. CAD: h/o MI.  Had ant ST depressions on admission in setting of
   tachycardia, now resolved.  Ruled out for MI with enzymes x3.
   -daily aspirin
   -consider outpt stress test
   .
   4. Hypertension.  Likely worse secondary to alcohol withdrawal.
   - continue home HCTZ, no need for standing metoprolol
   .
   5. H/o seizure disorder. continue keppra
   .
   6.  Ppx: PPI, sc heparin, colace
   .
   Access: femoral line placed in ED.  Unable to get peripherals due to
   agitation, so will remain inplace again today

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and multiple admissions for ethanol (ETOH) withdrawal. He is currently in the ICU for ETOH withdrawal and agitation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/91 mmHg to 147/107 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 94%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient has been on IV Haldol for agitation, which has shown good results. His mental status has improved significantly over the course of the day. He has a history of CAD, hypertension, and a seizure disorder. The patient is being monitored for potential complications related to alcohol withdrawal, including agitation, delirium tremens, seizures, and hallucinations.

In terms of medical complications, the patient may be at risk for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can include symptoms such as tremors, agitation, confusion, hallucinations, seizures, and even delirium tremens. It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, mental status, and level of agitation. The use of benzodiazepines or antipsychotic medications may be necessary to manage withdrawal symptoms and prevent complications.

Additionally, the patient's history of CAD and hypertension should be considered, along with his current blood pressure readings. Appropriate management and follow-up for these conditions will be important during the patient's hospital stay"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently in the ICU for ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal and agitation. The patient's mental status has improved over the course of the day with the administration of haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation. The patient has a history of allergies to dilantin (phenytoin sodium extended) with a rash as a reaction. The patient also has an allergy to antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature within normal range and a heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation within acceptable limits. The patient is also hemodynamically stable, with no significant fluid balance issues.

In terms of laboratory results, the patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, but there are some fluctuations in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet levels. The patient's creatinine level remains consistent across multiple measurements, indicating stable kidney function. Troponin-T levels are below detectable limits, suggesting no evidence of acute cardiac damage. Glucose levels have shown some variation but remain within normal limits.

The patient's medical history indicates poor dentition and absent peripheral pulses in both radial and dorsal pedis arteries. The physical examination also notes the patient's general appearance as anxious and diaphoretic.

The patient's care plan includes ICU care, nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis prevention and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's"
