","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a recent history of small cell carcinoma of the lung, who was treated with chemotherapy and radiation. She presented with weakness, hypoxia, and confusion. She was initially intubated but is now extubated and on nasal cannula oxygen. The patient has been receiving empiric treatment for pneumonia and pulmonary embolism due to unclear etiology. She also has anemia, which is macrocytic and possibly related to her recent chemotherapy treatment. The patient's confusion persists despite good oxygen saturation levels, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. The patient has acute renal failure and poor oral intake. She is currently being advanced to clear liquids and will be transitioned to regular diet as tolerated. The patient's medical history is unclear, and her HCP is her lawyer. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for pneumonia due to her immunocompromised state from chemotherapy and radiation treatment. The presence of crackles in the lung fields and increased markings on the right side of the chest X-ray may indicate pneumonia.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient is also at risk for PE due to her recent chemotherapy and immobilization. The elevated D-dimer level raises suspicion for PE, although further diagnostic tests such as a CT angiogram are needed to confirm the diagnosis.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has acute renal failure"

The patient's physical examination shows crackles in the lungs bilaterally and diminished breath sounds bibasilarly. She has absent pulses in both lower extremities. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds appropriately, and is oriented to person only. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 14.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, sodium of 144 mg/dL, potassium of 3.8 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, and a D-dimer level of 2361 ng/mL. The chest X-ray shows increased markings on the right side. 

The patient's assessment and plan include several issues. Firstly, her hypoxia is unclear etiology but may be due to either pneumonia (PNA) or pulmonary embolism (PE). She received empirical treatment for both conditions and will continue to be monitored for respiratory status. A"

   Assessment and Plan
   66 yoF with SCC of the lung recently treated w/ chemo/XRT and unknown
   prior PMH, presented with weakness, hypoxia and confusion.
   # HYPOXIA:  now extubated on NC.  Unclear etiology, concern for either
   PNA (increased markings on right) vs PE (unable to do CTA b/c of renal
   function).  Not consistent with CHF.  Received emperic treatment for
   PNA and PE.
   - on levoflox emperically.   WBC did rise but she received solumedrol
   at [**Location (un) **]-[**Location (un) 3958**].  Will d/c levoflox (with her renal fx she is
   covered today anyway)
   - monitor resp status
   - consider Pa/L CXR today given her clinical stability
   - V/Q scan unlikely to be helpful given her high pre-test prob and h/o
   radiation to lung
   - cont heparin ggt for PE empirically
   - Ruled out MI
   #  WEAKNESS: Based on conversation with neighbor who found her, seems
   as though this was global and related to dehydration (reports she was
   not taking good PO, supported by ARF) and AMS
   - exam non-focal
   - IVF for hydration
   # Anemia: Macrocytic.  Unknown baseline.  Reportedly received
   chemotherapy recently.  Drifting down, although did receive IVFs
   - guiac stool
   - transfuse for Hct > 21 or rapidly decreasing rate; no evidence of
   bleeding currently.
   - trend daily
   # CONFUSION: Etiology unknown.  Thought may have been due to hypoxia,
   but she remains confused despite good sats.  Head CT negative for acute
   processes.  Unknown diabetic status but glucose has been normal here.
   LFT's wnl.  Per neighbor, this has been sub-acute course, at least
   since [**1-19**], wtih some hallucinations (visual).   Now more somnolent
   - will try to find out who [**Year (2 digits) 3952**] is; trying to get a hold of PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] MRI [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/contrast to better assess for mets
   - send TSH
wnl, B12 wnl, RPR -pending
   - check u/a and culture
   - need to speak with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3952**] about baseline
   # ARF: baseline function unclear, [**Name2 (NI) **]/Cr responding to fluids.  History
   for neighbor indicates poor po intake
   - continue on clears given mental status
   - IVFs
   # NUTRITION: On clears,  IVFs can be hep-locked when taking good PO
   # ACCESS: PIV
   #  PPX: heparin ggt; PPI, bowel regimen
   #  CODE: presumed full; pt is confused and her HCP did not even know
   she had lung cancer

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of small cell carcinoma of the lung, recently treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. She presented with weakness, hypoxia, and confusion. The patient was initially intubated but has now been extubated and is on a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36°C (96.8°F), heart rate of 92 bpm (82-98 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 172/86 mmHg to 106/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute (12-23 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological examination is non-focal, and she responds to commands but is confused. She has a history of dehydration and acute mental status changes. Imaging studies, including a CT scan of the head, have ruled out acute processes. The patient has macrocytic anemia, likely related to her recent chemotherapy treatment. She also has acute renal failure, possibly due to dehydration and poor oral intake. The patient's confusion persists despite good oxygenation, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause. Potential complications that can arise include pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and worsening renal function."

   Assessment and Plan
   Altered Mental Status:  Etiology of the AMS not entirely clear.
   Hypercarbia in setting of COPD exacerbation most likely. MRI brain
   pending.
   -F/u MRI
   -If MS declines again, would check ABG.
   Respiratory failure:  Still has a persistent O2 requirement but doing
   well post-extubation.  Given smoking history, exam and CXR appears
   likely to have COPD.
     -Would give bronchodilators
     -Holding on steroids for now, but would have low threshold for this.
     -Now that GFR improved, consider CTA to rule out PE.
   Acute Renal Failure:
     -Creatinine improving.
     -Mucomyst/hydration in anticipation of contrast.
    Anemia:
     -HCT improve without transfusion overnight. Continue to monitor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of COPD and was admitted with acute respiratory failure. He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation but is now extubated and on supplemental oxygen. The patient's mental status has improved over the past 24 hours. He has no known drug allergies and is currently receiving several medications including heparin, colace, pantoprazole, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC).

Vital signs show a blood pressure of 169/100 mmHg, heart rate of 99 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36 degrees Celsius. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of +3,378 mL since 12 AM, with a total input of 2,055 mL and total output of 4,385 mL. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 35 mmHg, and HCO3- of 26 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal heart sounds with no murmurs, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities.

   Assessment and Plan
   Altered Mental Status:  Etiology of the AMS not entirely clear.
   Hypercarbia in setting of COPD exacerbation most likely. MRI brain
   pending.
   -F/u MRI
   -If MS declines again, would check ABG.
   Respiratory failure:  Still has a persistent O2 requirement but doing
   well post-extubation.  Given smoking history, exam and CXR appears
   likely to have COPD.
     -Would give bronchodilators
     -Holding on steroids for now, but would have low threshold for this.
     -Now that GFR improved, consider CTA to rule out PE.
   Acute Renal Failure:
     -Creatinine improving.
     -Mucomyst/hydration in anticipation of contrast.
    Anemia:
     -HCT improve without transfusion overnight. Continue to monitor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. He has a history of COPD, and his current vital signs include a temperature of 36°C (96.8°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 169/100 mmHg to 156/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications such as Colace, pantoprazole, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC). He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and anemia. The patient's renal function is improving, as indicated by a decreasing creatinine level. The patient's hemoglobin concentration has also improved without transfusion overnight. He is receiving nutrition and glycemic control measures in the ICU. The patient has multiple lines inserted, including 20-gauge and 18-gauge lines. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers are being administered. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and he will be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's history of COPD exacerbation increases the risk of pulmonary complications such as pneumonia or further respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The"
