","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of dementia, atrial fibrillation, and recent hospitalization. She was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, hypernatremia, and hyperkalemia. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 60%. She is also receiving vasopressor support with norepinephrine. 

The patient has a central venous pressure line inserted in the femoral vein, which will be removed prior to re-siting. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is planned to assess cardiac function. The patient is being treated empirically with vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, levofloxacin, and oseltamivir. Lactate levels will be followed up.

The patient's current medical conditions include septic shock with a suspected source of pneumonia and sacral decubitus ulcer, respiratory failure possibly due to bilateral infiltrates, atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury with an unknown baseline, oliguria, and creatinine level of 2.0 at the previous hospital. A renal consultation has been requested.

Additionally, the patient has"

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname 2065**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7826**], whose note above
   reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that this 85 y/o man with
   CHF, DM2, dementia, and decubitus ulcers is admitted with septic
   shock.  Receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics while awaiting cultures,
   with most likely sources being pneumonia or sacral decubitus.  In
   addition, treating and evaluating for influenza.  Remains ventilated
   during acute shock episode.  For ARF, UOP has picked up somewhat with
   hemodynamic management.  Awaiting studies and consultant opinion.
   Other issues as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7826**].

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, congestive heart failure, dementia, and sacral ulcers. He was admitted with septic shock and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics while awaiting cultures. The possible sources of sepsis include pneumonia or sacral decubitus. The patient is also being treated for influenza. He remains ventilated during the acute shock episode.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Septic shock - source possibly pneumonia or sacral decubitus. A central venous pressure (CVP) line has been transduced off the femoral line prior to re-site. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed to assess cardiac function. Empiric vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, levofloxacin, and oseltamivir are being administered. Lactate levels will be followed up.
2. Respiratory failure - possibly due to bilateral infiltrates. The patient is currently on pressure support (PS) 8/5, with 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). If either FiO2 or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) increases, the patient will transition to low tidal volume ventilation.
3. Atrial fibrillation - no mention of rhythm control measures.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF) - unknown baseline. Oliguric with creatinine level of 2.0 at the receiving hospital. Renal consultation is requested.
5. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
6. Hypernatremia.
7. Hyperkalemia - attributed to ARF. Electrolytes and fluid disorder management will be followed up every 6 hours.

ICU Care:
Nutrition: Total parenteral nutrition (TPNs)
Glycemic control: Insulin drip
Lines: 22-gauge and multi-lumen lines have been placed.
Prophylaxis: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with heparin subcutaneously, stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.
Code status: Full code for now, discussion with wife and daughter.
Disposition: Unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient may be at risk for the following potential medical complications:
1. Organ dysfunction due to septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure due to bilateral infiltrates.
3. Acute renal failure.
4. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
5. Electrolyte and fluid disorders, including hypernatremia and hyperkalemia."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old woman with a history of dementia, atrial fibrillation, and septic shock. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions. 

1. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, possibly due to pneumonia or sacral decubitus ulcers. She has been started on various antibiotics empirically.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, likely caused by bilateral infiltrates. She is on mechanical ventilation with a protocol for ARDSnet.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is being treated with amiodarone, transitioning to neo.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine level. It is likely prerenal based on low urine output. Renal consultation has been requested.

5. Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient is being monitored for a possible NSTEMI.

6. Hypernatremia and Hyperkalemia: The patient has hypernatremia and hyperkalemia, which may be related to acute renal failure.

7. Pressure Ulcer Management: The patient has pressure ulcers, specifically a sacral decubitus ulcer.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and multiple interventions have been initiated to address the various complications. Further evaluation and management are ongoing."

   Patient admitted to MICU with hypotension and respiratory failure,

   tachycardia.  Lactate levels falling.  Gram positive bacteria growing
   in blood. FiO2 now down to 0.5 on PSV with PEEP=8.
   On exam, patient intubated and sedated. Chest with scattered rhonchi.
   Heart sounds soft. No gallop or murmur. Abdomen soft, non-tender.
   Extremities cool, and slightly mottled.
   Patient remains pressor dependent. Now that amiodarone load has been
   completed, would consider switching back from phenlyephrine to levophed
   and add vasopressin to regimen. Patients with sepsis are believed to be
   oxygen delivery dependent , which means that they should do better with
   beta agonists/inotropic agents.
   Oxygenation stable. Try to decrease PEEP if he is doing well on
   FIO2=0.5. CT scan does not appear to have diffuse parenchymal
   involvement.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of dementia, atrial fibrillation, and septic shock. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics and is currently on mechanical ventilation. He has a central line infection, with gram-positive bacteria growing in his blood culture. His lactate levels are falling, indicating improvement in his septic shock condition. The patient remains pressor-dependent and is receiving vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. He is also receiving amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by an overwhelming immune response to an infection. It can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which may be caused by bilateral infiltrates seen on imaging. This could indicate pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm that can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient has an elevated creatinine level, suggesting possible kidney dysfunction. This could be due to dehydration or direct kidney injury from sepsis.
5. Myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old male with a chief complaint of septic shock. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, Cefepime, and Metronidazole. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/63 to 90/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.28, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 30 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 166 mmHg, and base excess (BE) of -11. The patient's blood cultures were drawn on 01/06/2102 at 10:56 AM, urine culture was also drawn on the same date and time, arterial line was started on 01/06/2102 at 12:17 PM, EKGs were taken on 01/06/2102 at 01:00 PM and 03:47 PM, trans-thoracic echo was performed on 01/06/2102 at 03:00 PM, and sputum culture was collected on 01/06/2102 at 10:11 PM. The patient has been receiving midazolam, amiodarone, fentanyl, and norepinephrine infusions. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted above and below. The patient's physical examination findings include atrial fibrillation, and no other significant findings due to sedation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, slightly elevated platelet count, and various abnormalities in kidney and liver function tests. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient is experiencing several medical complications including septic shock, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction. These conditions can lead to various complications such as worsening respiratory distress, organ dysfunction (particularly in the kidneys), cardiac arrhythmias, imbalances in electrolytes, and potential infections due to prolonged mechanical ventilation."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), sacral decubitus, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and dementia. He presents with altered mental status, hypotension, and respiratory failure, likely secondary to septic shock from possible pneumonia. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and other conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to septic shock from possible pneumonia. It is important to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is most likely secondary to pneumonia. Aggressive treatment of pneumonia, low tidal volume ventilation, and serial arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis are necessary.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient's AFib with RVR needs to be managed with medications such as amiodarone and digoxin. Rate control should be achieved to prevent further complications.
4. Troponin Leak: The elevated troponin levels indicate possible myocardial ischemia or infarction. Trending troponin levels and performing an echocardiogram to rule out wall motion abnormality are essential.
5. Hypernatremia: The"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), sacral decubitus, atrial fibrillation (AF), and dementia. He presents with altered mental status and hypotension, likely secondary to septic shock from possible pneumonia. The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to septic shock from pneumonia or other sources such as urinary or sacral infections. Aggressive IV fluids, transition to neosynepherin, broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanco, cefepime, levo, flagyl), and osteltamivir for flu treatment are recommended.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is most likely secondary to pneumonia. Treatment includes PNA treatment, low tidal volume ventilation, and serial ABGs.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFIB with RVR): The patient had rates in the 190s with drop in BPs, but now has normalized since being on dilt gtt. Amiodarone loaded, continue gtt, and hold digoxin are advised.

4. Troponin leak: The patient has a troponin leak, likely due to demand ischemia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), sacral decubitus, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and dementia. The patient presents with altered mental status and hypotension, likely secondary to septic shock from possible pneumonia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience respiratory failure due to pneumonia or an inability to protect the airway caused by altered mental status. Treatment includes low tidal volume ventilation and treating the underlying infection.

2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has hypernatremia, which is likely due to poor oral intake and free water deficit. Aggressive IV fluids and D5W administration are recommended for correction.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a history of acute renal failure with a previous creatinine level of 7.2. ARF is likely pre-renal in origin, as indicated by a FeNa of 0.7. Aggressive fluid hydration and renal following are advised.

4. Trop T leak: The patient has elevated troponin levels, indicating possible demand ischemia. Trending troponins and CKs, along with an echo to rule out wall motion abnormality, is recommended.

5. Sacral decubitus wound: The patient has sacral decubitus ulcers, which may require"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, sacral decubitus, atrial fibrillation, and dementia. He presented with altered mental status and hypotension, likely secondary to septic shock from possible pneumonia. The patient has multiple comorbidities including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is most likely secondary to pneumonia. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, low tidal volume ventilation, and weaning from mechanical ventilation as tolerated.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine level. Hydration is improving urine output, and renal dosing of medications will be continued.
3. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to poor oral intake and free water deficit. This has been resolved with D5W administration.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR has been managed with diltiazem and amiodarone. An echocardiogram will be done to rule out wall motion abnormalities.
5. Sacral Decubitus: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer that needs wound care management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, sacral decubitus, atrial fibrillation, and dementia. He presents with altered mental status and hypotension, likely secondary to septic shock from possible pneumonia. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be secondary to septic shock from pneumonia, urinary source, or sacral source. Continuous monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure most likely due to pneumonia. Treatment includes providing broad-spectrum antibiotics, low tidal volume ventilation, and serial arterial blood gas analyses to assess oxygenation and ventilation.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFIB with RVR): The patient has a history of AFIB, which has been exacerbated by peripheral dopamine. Management involves loading with amiodarone, continuing diltiazem drip, and holding digoxin.

4. Troponin Leak: The patient shows signs of cardiac ischemia, indicated by elevated troponin levels. Trending troponin/CK levels and performing an echocardiogram will help determine the extent of myocardial damage.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, sacral decubitus, atrial fibrillation, and dementia. The patient presents with altered mental status and hypotension, likely secondary to septic shock from possible pneumonia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to pneumonia. Treatment includes aggressive IV fluids, low tidal volume ventilation, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to pre-renal etiology. Treatment involves aggressive fluid hydration and monitoring renal function.

3. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient has hypernatremia, likely from poor PO intake and free water deficit. Treatment includes D5W for rehydration.

4. Sepsis: The patient is likely suffering from sepsis, which may be caused by a urinary source, sacral source, or pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and cultures are pending.

5. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient had rapid heart rates during presentation but has since stabilized. Treatment includes loading with amiodarone and continuing glyceryl trinitrate.

6. Troponin Leak: The patient has elevated troponin levels, indicating possible myocardial ischemia. Further evaluation is needed through serial tropon"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, sacral decubitus, atrial fibrillation, and dementia. He presents with altered mental status, hypotension, and suspected septic shock secondary to pneumonia. The patient also has respiratory failure, acute renal failure, electrolyte/fluid disorder, and possible ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to septic shock from possible pneumonia. It is crucial to monitor and manage his fluid resuscitation, aiming for a central venous pressure (CVP) of 8.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is most likely secondary to pneumonia. He still has thick secretions in his airways. Treatment includes pneumonia treatment, low tidal volume ventilation, serial arterial blood gases (ABGs), and weaning off the ventilator as tolerated.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFIB with RVR): The patient had high heart rates during presentation, but now he is in normal sinus rhythm. Further management includes holding digoxin and considering amiodarone as the next treatment.
4. Troponin leak: The elevated troponin levels suggest myocardial ischemia. Trending troponins and creatine kinase (CK) levels will be important, and an echocardiogram will help rule out wall motion abnormalities"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, sacral decubitus, atrial fibrillation, and dementia. The patient presents with altered mental status, hypotension, and respiratory failure. The patient is diagnosed with sepsis secondary to possible pneumonia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and atrial fibrillation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to septic shock from pneumonia or other sources. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is most likely secondary to pneumonia. This can worsen if the patient develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure with a previous creatinine level of 7.2. Acute renal failure can further impair kidney function and lead to electrolyte imbalances.

4. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has hypernatremia and other electrolyte imbalances. These imbalances can affect cardiac function, muscle function, and nerve function.

5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of thromboembolic events, such as stroke. It also affects the heart's pumping"

The patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of multi lumen - stop. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient is currently on several medications including fentanyl, vasopressin, norepinephrine, midazolam, heparin, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/60 to 135/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 90%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's flow sheet data shows normal hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. Physical examination findings are not assessed due to the patient's critical condition. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, potassium, and creatinine levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.29, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 298, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 90%. The patient's platelet count, troponin T, total bilirubin, and liver enzymes are within normal limits."

   I was physically present with the housestaff team on this date for
   discussion of the above history, physical, exam and assessment and plan
   with which I agree.  I would add the following comments.
   Patient is an 85 yo male admitted with sepsis and respiratory failure.
   He has had hospital course complicated by renal failure.  With IVF
   given patient has had some improvement in lactic acidosis but with
   continued pressor requirement and source of infection remains to be
   definitively defined.
   EXAM-
   Patient with continued A/C support
   Lungs-decreased breath sounds but no focal crackles or wheezes.
   LABS-
   Blood Cultures-_Coag negative staph seen in blood culture on initial
   culture with follow ups pending at this time
   CXR-
   ETT, CVL in good position and with R>L LL opacities and concern for
   possible left sided effusion
   A/P
By problems
   1)Sepsis-Will continue with broad spectrum antibiotics pending final
   sensitivities
   -Will continue vasopressin and look to wean levophed as possible-have
   had some improvement
   -With culture concerning for coag negative staph will have to consider
   TTE going forward with TEE likely more high yield to look for seeing if
   true pathogen defined.
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -Will move to PSV as tolerated with stabilization of PaO2 and
   persistent improvement in infiltrates
   -Will maintain Low Vt
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the note above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, dementia, and sacral ulcers. The patient was admitted to the ICU for decreased consciousness and decreased blood pressure. 

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The source of infection is unclear, with possible pathogens including pneumonia versus sacral decubitus ulcers. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, as indicated by low oxygen saturation levels. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with an ARDSnet protocol.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has an irregular heartbeat, which is causing concerns about potential cardiac dysfunction. The patient has been placed on amiodarone and Neo.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's baseline renal function is unknown, but there are signs of oliguria (low urine output) and elevated creatinine levels. This suggests prerenal azotemia, and further evaluation is needed.

5. Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage. Close monitoring of cardiac enzymes is necessary.

6. Non-gastrointestinal acidosis: The patient's blood pH is below normal levels, indicating metabolic acidosis. Further investigation is required to identify the underlying cause.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of dementia, atrial fibrillation, and septic shock. He was admitted to the ICU due to septic shock caused by pneumonia or sacral decubitus. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure, likely secondary to bilateral infiltrates. He also has atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury (ARF), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, and pulmonary embolism (PPM).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is on ARDSnet protocol. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function leading to worsening respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and NSTEMI, there is a high risk of cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, or heart failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's oliguric status and elevated creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury. This condition can worsen and lead to further renal dysfunction.
4. Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic shock, and there is a possibility of recurrence or progression of infection.
5. Deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism: The patient has a known PPM, and there is a risk of developing deep vein thrombosis ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), sacral decubitus, atrial fibrillation (afib), and dementia. He presented with altered mental status and hypotension, likely secondary to septic shock from possible pneumonia. The patient's vital signs have stabilized, and he has been weaned off vasopressors. His respiratory status remains concerning due to thick secretions and the need for mechanical ventilation. The patient's renal function has improved with hydration. He has a history of acute renal failure with a peak creatinine level of 7.2 one month ago. The patient's electrolyte imbalances have been corrected, and he is now on a basic sliding scale for his DM. His nutritional status is being managed with tube feeds. The patient is currently on IV fluids, antibiotics, antivirals, and other medications as needed. His code status is full code, and he is dispositioned to the ICU for further care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to the presence of thick secretions and the need for mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the secretions are not effectively managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient likely has pneumonia as the source of septic shock. Proper antibiotic therapy should be continued to treat the infection.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), sacral decubitus, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and dementia. The patient presents with altered mental status and hypotension, likely secondary to septic shock from possible pneumonia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still relatively low, indicating ongoing hypotension. Close monitoring and management of fluid and medication administration are necessary to maintain stable blood pressure.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure, most likely secondary to pneumonia. Thick secretions in the endotracheal tube (ETT) suggest ongoing respiratory distress. Suctioning and clearance of secretions may be required. The patient may be considered for a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today and possible extubation tomorrow if secretions improve.

3. AFib with RVR (rapid ventricular response): The patient's atrial fibrillation is fairly well controlled with the use of IV diltiazem. However, restarting metoprolol and amiodarone at home should be considered to maintain rhythm control.

4. Troponin leak: No troponin leak is currently observed, indicating no significant cardiac damage at this time.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels are likely due to poor oral intake and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of dementia who presents with shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including levofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/64 mmHg to 129/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a Vt set at 460 mL, RR set at 20, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and RSBI of 85. The patient's physical examination reveals clear chest sounds with bronchial breath sounds at the left base, irregular heart rhythm, and minimal edema. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 27.4 K/uL, elevated troponin-T levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures are negative, and a chest CT suggests a pulmonary source of infection. The patient is being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) with antibiotics, and the plan is to wean sedation and perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today. The patient's mental status, hypoxemia, and secretions are barriers to extubation"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), sacral decubitus, atrial fibrillation (AF), and dementia. The patient presents with altered mental status and hypotension, likely secondary to septic shock from possible pneumonia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing thick secretions, which may lead to continued respiratory failure.
2. Sacral Decubitus: The patient has sacral decubitus, which needs to be addressed to prevent further complications.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a history of acute renal failure with creatinine levels up to 7.2 in the past month. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management is essential.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which may be due to poor oral intake and free water deficit. Monitoring and correcting electrolyte imbalances are crucial.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved but requires close monitoring. Pressors may still be needed depending on the patient's condition.
6. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient's AFib with RVR needs to be managed with appropriate medications and close cardiac monitoring.

It is important to note that this summary is based on the provided information"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, sacral decubitus, atrial fibrillation, and dementia. He presents with altered mental status and hypotension, likely secondary to septic shock from possible pneumonia. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sacral decubitus, dementia, depression, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs, potentially causing organ damage or failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's compromised respiratory function may result in inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, leading to further deterioration in his overall condition.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: This cardiac arrhythmia can lead to an irregular and often rapid heart rate, potentially causing symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and reduced cardiac output.
4. Hypernatremia: Elevated levels of sodium in the blood can lead to dehydration and neurological complications.
5. Acute Renal Failure: Impaired kidney function can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, accumulation of waste products, and potential organ damage.
6. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Underlying COPD"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with pneumonia and sepsis who has been gradually improving in the ICU. He was weaned off pressors yesterday and passed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), indicating that he may be ready for extubation. The patient has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order, but it is noted that he desires re-intubation if needed. The patient's secretions have improved, and he is awake with coughing ability, suggesting that he can protect his airway. His vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/59 mmHg to 144/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation and has hypernatremia. His laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and slightly abnormal liver function tests. Blood cultures are negative, and his chest X-ray is stable.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ability to protect his airway should be monitored closely during the process of extubation. There is a risk of aspiration or further respiratory distress.
2. Renal dysfunction: Although the patient's creatinine levels are improving, renal function should continue to be monitored due to potential ongoing effects of sepsis and medications.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), sacral decubitus, atrial fibrillation (afib), and dementia. He presents with altered mental status and hypotension, likely secondary to septic shock from possible pneumonia. The patient is also complicated by afib with rapid ventricular response (RVR) during presentation.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. 

Hypotension has resolved after receiving vancomycin and cefepime for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). Tamiflu was stopped as the culture was negative for influenza. 

Respiratory failure is improving with better oxygen saturation since extubation. The patient's pneumonia treatment remains the same as above.

Afib with RVR is fairly well controlled but still a little fast. Metoprolol will be up-titrated to the home dose of 25 mg QID today, and consideration will be given to restarting amiodarone tomorrow.

Hypernatremia is due to poor oral intake, and 2L D5W will be administered.

Acute renal failure is resolving, with a trend towards improvement in creatinine levels.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may contribute to respiratory failure, and albuterol/ipratropium"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes mellitus (DM), sacral decubitus, atrial fibrillation (afib), and dementia. He presents with altered mental status and hypotension, likely secondary to septic shock from possible pneumonia. The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions are:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can lead to inadequate perfusion of vital organs and may result in organ dysfunction or failure.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory system is compromised, leading to difficulty in oxygenation and ventilation. This can be further complicated by underlying conditions such as COPD.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can lead to the accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances in the body. ARF can be caused by factors such as sepsis, hypotension, or nephrotoxic drugs.

4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has an imbalance in sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. This can affect various bodily functions, including muscle and nerve function, heart rhythm, and fluid balance.

5. Sacral decubitus: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with pneumonia, sepsis, and respiratory failure. He is currently improving and has been extubated. The patient remains afebrile and stable. His allergies include no known drug allergies. He has been receiving various antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, as well as other ICU medications such as heparin prophylaxis, famotidine, metoprolol, calcium, insulin sliding scale, and Coumadin.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is improving, as indicated by negative cultures and a decrease in white blood cell count.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure has resolved, and he is no longer on mechanical ventilation or pressors.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis has resolved, and he is off pressors.
4. Cardiac rhythm: The patient is in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which needs to be managed by titrating up lopressor today.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which requires increasing free water boluses.
6. Increased right lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray, indicating a potential lung infection or consolidation.
7. Elevated lactate level of 1.8 mmol/L, suggesting possible tissue hypoperfusion.
8. Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine"
