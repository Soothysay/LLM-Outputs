   24 Hour Events:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is an 83M  with hx parosysmal Afib not on coumadin, CAD s/p
   CABG in [**2135**] with LIMA to LAD which is totally occluded after D1,
   SVG-D1 (stent in graft), SVG-OM (chronically occluded), with most
   recent PCI in [**5-26**] with stenting Lcx, s/p hip replacement, with hx
   chronic c.diff infection x 5 years. Pt was in USOH until the night
   prior to admission when he noted that he was unable to get up out of
   bed secondary to weakness, which he noted was worse in his legs than in
   his arms. He struggled to get OOB for a while, eventually becoming SOB,
   with subsequent mid sternal sharp non radiating chest pain experienced,
   similar to his anginal episodes. The pain was not associated with
   diaphoresis or nausea, p.o intake, there was no positional or pleuritic
   component. He took SLNTG x1 and the CP resolved. He continued to
   experience this weakness on the day of admission, called life line,
   with EMS sent to his home. On arrival he was noted to have ? NSVT on
   monitor.  Of note, he has experienced several days of diarrhea with 10
   or more loose stools a day.  Increased from baseline.
   .
   In the ER, initial VS were T97.1, HR 150, BP 73/54 -> 86/59, RR 36, O2
   100% NRB.  EKG showed wide complex tachycardia afib with aberancy.
   Having CP. Labs notable for WBC 26, Cr 1.9 from baseline 1.3. Underwent
   cardioversion for A. Fib with hypotension and subsequently converted to
   sinus rhythm with resolution of his chest pain.  CXR negative for PNA.
   Overall impression was for sepsis [**2-24**] C. diff and patient given
   metronidazole for his diarrhea and 2L of IVF.  Prior to transfer had
   been making urine >800cc.
   .
   Vitals prior to transfer HR72 113/70 17 100%2L.
   .
   ROS is notable for chronic fatigue. He denies recent URIs, cough,
   hemoptysis, fever, chills, rigors, diaphoresis, abdominal pain, sick
   contacts, travel,  prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
   thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
   myalgias, joint pains, cough, black stools or red stools. He denies
   exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems
   were negative.
   .
   Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, dyspnea
   on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
   palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
   .
   On arrival to the CCU he was seen to be in slow A.fib on EKG, and
   hypotensive to the high 80s. IVF boluses were initiated with subsequent
   improvement in pressure.

   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2155-6-5**] demonstrated:
   The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No
   atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
   wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
   dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and
   hypokinesis of the lateral wall. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
   left ventricle. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
   more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] The right
   ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
   hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
   aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
   valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   ,
   IMPRESSION: Moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with
   prior infarction. Moderate mitral regurgitation, likely due to
   tethering of the leaflets. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. Biatrial enlargement.
   .
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-4-20**], the LV
   diastolic dimension has increased. The pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension can be assessed on the current study. The other findings
   are similar.

   CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2151-6-3**] demonstrated:
   1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated a right dominant system
   with two vessel CAD. The left main was without angiographically
   apparent disease. The LAD was totally occluded after the D1. The D1 was
   a small vessel with severe proximal disease. The distal LAD had mild
   luminal irregularities and filled via the LIMA. The LCx had 70%
   in-stent stenosis in the proximal stent. There was a 70% lesion just
   distal to the stent. The OM1 was totally occluded (unchanged). The RCA
   had diffuse disease (less than 50%). The RCA stents were widely
   patent.
   2. Selective graft angiography demonstrated a widely patent LIMA to
   LAD. The SVG-D1 had widely patent stents. There was a 50% stenosis in a
   small subranch of the D1 distal to the vein graft touchdown. The SVG-OM
   is known to be chronically occluded.
   3. Central aortic pressure was normal (while on a nitroglycerin drip).
   4. Left ventriculography was not performed.
   5. Successful PTCA of the LCX with a 3.0 mm balloon proxinally and a
   2.0 mm balloon in the mid LCX. Final angiography showed no residual
   stenosis, no dissection and normal flow (see PTCA comments).

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and chronic Clostridium difficile infection. The patient presented with hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and leukocytosis, which are consistent with sepsis due to C. difficile infection.

The patient was initially volume resuscitated with 2 liters of normal saline in the emergency department. However, he continued to be hypotensive on the floor despite receiving 1 liter of intravenous fluid. The patient remained alert and was making good urine output. 

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Sepsis: The patient should be volume resuscitated and receive intravenous Flagyl every 8 hours to treat the C. difficile infection. The stool cultures should be checked, and the blood cultures from the emergency department should be followed up.
2. Rhythm: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and presented with atrial fibrillation that was hemodynamically unstable. Currently, the patient is in slow atrial fibrillation with a borderline tachycardia. The hold on home lopressor should be continued, and the patient should remain on telemetry.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and chronic C. diff infection. He presented with hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and leukocytosis, initially thought to be related to C. diff infection but now with growth of Gram-negative rods (GNRs) in blood culture.

The patient has been volume-resuscitated with 3.5 liters of normal saline, maintaining blood pressures in the low 100s systolic, and mentating well with good urine output. However, the patient's lactate level is rising, likely secondary to GNR colitis. Liver function tests (LFTs) are not consistent with a biliary source, and abdominal pain is absent. There is a possibility of urine source infection as well.

The patient's rhythm is controlled with antiarrhythmic medication, and consideration is given to prevent future decompensation with atrial fibrillation. The patient's coronary arteries have undergone bypass surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention. He also has a history of hip replacement.

The patient's anemia is chronic normocytic with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 92, near or above baseline. There is a history of chronic anemia of unknown origin requiring multiple transfusions. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (HCT) is stable currently.

Regarding the diarrhea, the patient has a history of"

The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. The patient presented with hypotension and was given three boluses of normal saline. Despite this, the patient's blood pressure remained low, but he was still able to maintain good mental status. Initially, the patient had very low urine output, which then became incontinent. A urinary catheter was placed, and the patient is currently receiving antibiotics for a possible GNR infection. The patient's diarrhea has resolved, and he is now on suppression dose of p.o vancomycin. The patient denies any chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, or palpitations. The patient has allergies to ticlid and Lipitor. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was metronidazole. The patient is currently on various ICU medications and other medications. There are no changes to the patient's medical or family history. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure of 103/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. difficile infection. He presented with hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and leukocytosis, initially thought to be sepsis related to C. difficile. However, gram-negative rods (GNRs) are now growing in the blood cultures. The patient also has elevated risk troponins, suggesting a potential cardiac component. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has signs of sepsis, as indicated by hypotension, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and rising lactate levels. He has been volume-resuscitated with intravenous fluids and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (zosyn). Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to guide further management.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient's elevated troponin levels and history of coronary artery disease suggest the possibility of cardiac ischemia or infarction. Further evaluation with serial EKGs, cardiac enzymes, and possibly a coronary angiogram may be needed to assess the extent of cardiac involvement.
3. C. difficile Infection: Despite initial negative stool culture for C. difficile, the patient's history of recurrent infections and current symptoms raise concern for possible recurrence. Surveillance blood cultures, stool cultures, and repeat testing for fecal leukocytes should be performed to monitor for any"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and chronic C. diff infection. He presented with hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and leukocytosis, initially thought to be sepsis related to C. diff. However, Gram-negative rods (GNRs) are now growing in the blood culture, suggesting a different source of infection.

The patient has been volume-resuscitated with 3.5 liters of normal saline and is currently hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure in the low 100s systolic. He is mentating well and has good urine output. Despite this, his lactate levels are rising, indicating possible ongoing sepsis secondary to GNR colitis.

The patient also has elevated troponin levels, suggesting a cardiac component to the presentation. His coronary artery disease includes previous CABG, PCI, and stenting of the left circumflex artery. An EKG shows atrial fibrillation with aberrancy and slow ventricular tachycardia post-cardioversion.

The patient's liver function tests show elevated AST and ALT, which may not be consistent with a biliary source. Urine source is also a possibility. A CT scan of the abdomen with oral contrast is planned.

The patient has a history of chronic normocytic anemia and requires multiple transfusions. His hematocrit (HCT) is stable"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and chronic C. difficile infection.
- He presented with hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and leukocytosis, initially thought to be related to sepsis from C. difficile colitis, but now with GNRs growing in blood cultures.
- The patient has been volume-resuscitated with 3.5LNS since admission, with stable blood pressures, good mentation, and adequate urine output.
- Lactate levels are rising, likely secondary to GNR colitis.
- LFTs do not indicate a biliary source, and a CT abdomen with PO contrast showed no source of infection.
- Urine source of infection is possible, with a urinalysis showing lots of white blood cells.
- Blood cultures have been positive three times.
- The patient's rhythm includes a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, which presented with atrial fibrillation and hemodynamic instability, cardioverted to slow ventricular tachycardia, then back to atrial fibrillation.
- The rate went up to 120s overnight, with stable blood pressure, controlled with metoprolol and amiodarone.
- The current episode of atrial fibrillation is likely elicited by sepsis.
- Coronary artery disease includes previous CABG and PCI, with a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic C. diff infection. He presented with hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and leukocytosis consistent with sepsis initially thought to be related to C. diff, but now with Gram-negative rods (GNRs) growing in the blood culture.

The patient's condition includes a cardiac component indicated by elevated troponin levels, suggesting possible ischemia due to fixed coronary lesions. There is also a possibility of a non-liver source for the elevated liver enzymes, potentially related to hypotension or cardiac issues. 

The patient has a history of chronic normocytic anemia and has required multiple transfusions. His hematocrit (HCT) is near or above baseline, and there are no active issues at this time. 

The patient has a history of C. diff infection for five years and recently experienced worsened diarrhea. GNRs were found in the blood, which may be due to gastrointestinal translocation, possibly secondary to bowel ischemia caused by hypotension.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 125 bpm, blood pressure of 117/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's temperature is 36.8 degrees Celsius.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and chronic C. difficile infection. He presented with hypotension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and leukocytosis, initially thought to be sepsis related to C. diff, but now with Gram-negative rods (GNRs) growing in blood cultures. The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), hip replacement, and chronic anemia of unknown origin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Bacteremia: The patient has positive blood cultures x 3, indicating a possible ongoing infection. The source is likely urinary, but other possibilities include bacterial translocation from the gut or another source. The patient's lactate has resolved, and he is mentating well with good urine output, suggesting improvement.

2. Rhythm: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and presented with atrial fibrillation, which was hemodynamically unstable and cardioverted to slow ventricular tachycardia, then back to atrial fibrillation. His heart rate overnight increased to the 120s, but his blood pressure remained stable. He is being treated with metoprolol and amiodarone for rate control.

3. Coronaries: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with previous"

","Based on the physician's progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of chronic C. diff infection, atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and chronic normocytic anemia. The patient presented with hypotension, AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR), leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures indicating sepsis initially thought to be related to C. diff infection, but now with Gram-negative rods (GNRs) growing.

The patient has been volume-resuscitated with stable blood pressures in the low 100s systolic, good mentation, and adequate urine output (UOP). The lactate has resolved, and the likely source of infection is urinary. The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities, including chronic C. diff infection, CAD, and chronic anemia of unknown origin requiring multiple transfusions.

The patient's rhythm is consistent with paroxysmal AF, presenting with AF and hemodynamic instability, cardioverted to slow ventricular tachycardia (VT), and then back to AF. The rate increased to 120s overnight, with stable blood pressure controlled with metoprolol and addition of amiodarone. This episode of AF is likely elicited by sepsis.
