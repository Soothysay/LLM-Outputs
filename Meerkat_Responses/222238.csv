   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
   ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size is
   normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
   no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most
   likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with low normal systolic
   function (may be related to tachycardia).

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory failure and pneumonia
   Suspect infectious etiology as patient presented with fevers and
   bandemia. See admit note for ddx of noninfectious causes of SOB and
   bilateral infiltrates in this pregant woman.
   Has bilateral patchy opacities worsening significantly in the last day
   with P/F<200 c/w ARDS. Nl pump function makes cardiogenic pulmonary
   edema less likely. [**Month (only) 60**] have capillary leak secondary to both
   pre-eclampsia and sepsis.
   Suspect sepsis secondary to progressive pneumonia. No pathogen yet
   identified but no respiratory samples had been obtained prior to this
   ICU transfer. History of fevers and myalgias worrisome for influenza,
   could well have a bacterial superinfection.
   --Follow up DFA, no role for tamiflu given duration of sx>72hrs
   --Follow up respiratory cultures, gram stain.
   --Continue ceftriaxone, azithromycin, vancomycin for now. Patient
   formerly relatively healthy community dwelling therefore think she is
   less likely to need expanded gram negative coverage. Added vancomycin
   for double coverage of pneumococcus and empiric coverage of S. aureus
   in setting of ?influenza pna.
   --Check vancomycin trough prior to PM dose of vancomycin per renal, in
   light of changing renal function and uncertain GFR. Would aim to keep
   vancomycin trough between 15-20.
   --Plan for BAL today when patient returns from OR
   --Ventilation per ARDSnet, goal of 6cc/kg.
   2. Sepsis, suspected
   Ventilation as above. Place central line, expect patient will require
   significant additional volume resuscitation but CVP will be helpful in
   this regard. Check SvO2. Goal MAP>65. Follow urine output as below.
   3. Acute renal failure
   Poor urine output, some response to fluid boluses overnight. Suspect
   further fluid resuscitation required. Renal following due to likely
   pre-eclampsia, their review of sediment shows many granular casts c/w
   ATN. Renal recommendations appreciated. Urine electrolytes, eosinophils
   pending. Think obstruction is less likely in her, but if above workup
   unrevealing could pursue renal U/S. Proteinuria likely due to
   pre-eclampsia but given DM may also have had pre-existing renal
   disease.
   4. Asthma
   Continue standing albuterol, IV steroids.
   5. Pregnancy and pre-eclampsia, suspected
   OB following, C/S today. s-Flt to be sent.
   6. Gap acidosis
   Gap closed today, but patient with ketones in blood and urine
 suspect
   DKA. Lactate normal. No osmolar gap. Continue IVF resuscitation as
   above, follow electrolytes at least q6.
   7. Diabetes mellitius
   Patient with h/o type 1 DM, continue insulin drip. Keep glucose<150.
   8. Anemia
   Hct stable, monitor hemolysis labs and follow Hct. Transfuse Hb>7.
   9. Lower extremity swelling
   Stable, probably due to proteinuria. No evidence of severely impaired
   pump function. Has had negative LENIS recently.

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old pregnant female at 34 weeks gestation presenting with increased shortness of breath. She has poor urine output, which improved with IV fluids. An echocardiogram showed normal left and right atrial cavity sizes, normal left ventricular wall thicknesses, and normal regional wall motion with low normal systolic function. The aortic and mitral valves appear structurally normal. There is an anterior space likely representing a fat pad. Chest X-ray shows worsening bilateral patchy opacities. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure and pneumonia: The patient presented with fevers and bandemia, suggesting an infectious etiology. The worsening bilateral patchy opacities on chest X-ray indicate progressive pneumonia, which could be secondary to sepsis. No respiratory samples had been obtained prior to ICU transfer.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of fevers and myalgias, which are worrisome for influenza, potentially with a bacterial superinfection. The patient is being treated with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin for now.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has poor urine output, and renal function tests indicate possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to pre-eclampsia. Further fluid resuscitation is required, and urine electrolytes and eosinophils are pending.
4. Asthma: The patient has a history"

   Assessment and Plan
   #. Pneumonia/respiratory distress. CXR with worsening of the multilobar
   pneumonia. Has received ceftriaxone and azithromycin, although
   azithromycin at 250 mg dose. High suspicion for viral process given
   lack of response to antibiotics x 3 days, but now would be concerned
   about bacterial infection as well. Would also be concerned about PE in
   the setting of pregnancy, immobile state. Patient with increased WOB
   w/RR>30, but currently with reasonable oxygen sats on NRB.
   -Broaden coverage to include vancomycin for coverage of staph; will
   continue ceftriaxone and increase azithromycin dose to 500 mg
   -Methylprednisolone 80 mg IV qd
   -Albuterol nebulizers q4h standing, q2h prn
   -Will follow up blood cultures
   -Will continue ceftriaxone/azithromycin for now for coverage of CAP.
   -Send nasal swab for influenza DFA, sputum culture and gram stain.
   -Tylenol for fever
   -Check ABG when able; patient refusing.
   -DVT prophylaxis with heparin SC; would not start heparin gtt given
   high likelihood of infectious process as source.
   .
   #. Asthma. Currently bronchospastic in the setting of pneumonia.
   -Will give nebs q4h standing, q2h prn.
   -Start methylprednisolone 80 mg IV qd
   .
   #. Concern for preeclampsia. Patient with hypertension on admit (now
   normotensive) and proteinuria.
   -Will monitor BPs
   -Await OB recs
   .
   #. Anion gap metabolic acidosis.
   -Will check lactate
   -Add on serum acetones if blood sugars increase
   .
   #. Anemia. Patient with low hematocrit. stable. Patient's peripheral
   smear initially showed evidence of occasional schistocytes. DIC labs
   unremarkable.
   -Will follow.
   .
   #. Lower extremity swelling. Patient with bilateral LE swelling. Has
   had negative LENIs.
   -DVT ppx
   .
   #. DM1. Continue insulin pump. Currently has a anion gap acidosis but
   sugars WNL.
   -Will follow FS.
   -Check serum acetones if blood sugars elevated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old pregnant female at 34 weeks gestation presenting with increased shortness of breath. She has poor urine output overnight, which improved with intravenous fluids. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and an arterial line has been started. Nasal swabs and sputum cultures were collected. The patient has a fever of 101.8°F and is allergic to erythromycin base. She has received ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin. Insulin, fentanyl, and midazolam infusions are ongoing. The patient is sedated and has not been assessed for movement or tone. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 102/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates a sinus tachycardia rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 554 mL and output of 155 mL, with a total balance of 399 mL. Respiratory support includes a non-rebreather mask, CMV ventilator mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, set respiratory rate of 30, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and plateau pressure of 30 cmH2O. ABG results show a pH of 7.25, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, HCO3 of 22 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation of 96%. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.4 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin at 17.4 g/dL, increased platelet count at 292 K/uL, elevated creatinine at 1.3 mg/dL, and decreased albumin at 2.4 g/dL. Other lab values are within normal range. 

Assessment and plan include broadening antibiotic coverage to include vancomycin for suspected bacterial infection, methylprednisolone for asthma exacerbation, albuterol nebulizers for bronchospasm, and Tylenol for fever. Blood cultures will be followed, and nasal swab, sputum culture, and gram stain will be sent. DVT prophylaxis with heparin SC is recommended due to immobilization and concern for pulmonary embolism. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening pneumonia, asthma exacerbation, preeclampsia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, anemia, lower extremity swelling, and diabetes mellitus type 1."

   Assessment and Plan
   31 y/o F 34 weeks pregnant who was admitted with fever and cough, now
   with worsening hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (ARDS):  Differential broad as per
   admission note, but likely viral pneumonia with bacterial
   superinfection.  Peripartum cardiomyopathy less likely given
   hyperdynamic EF seen on TTE.  Also could have AIP, HP, DAH, pulmonary
   hemosiderosis.
   - Continue antibiotics: ceftriaxone, azithro, vancomycin; f/u sputum
   cultures
   - On bronchodilators and steroids for asthma
   - Currently going to OR for C-section, in case preeclampsia causing
   vascular leak is contributing to her respiratory failure.  When back
   from OR, will adjust ventilator for ideal Vt 6 cc/kg.
   - When back from OR, would consider bronch for BAL/cell count/diff
   - Will get central line in OR, which will be helpful for CVP (as voume
   status is somewhat unclear - [**Name (NI) 950**] is elevated, but [**Name (NI) 949**] low)
   -Intrinsic PEEP at 11
 will increase machine PEEP to 12. With ongoing
   metabolic acidosis, will give bicarbonate to improve serum bicarb and
   allow for lower minute ventilation. This will allow us to reduce tidal
   volume to 8 ml/kg (450 ml) to try to keep with ARDSnet protocol. FIO2
   reduced to 0.4. Plateau pressures now 29.
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Likely due to preeclampsia.  ATN less likely as
   has not been hypotensive.  Also could be volume depleted as her [**Name (NI) 949**]
   tended to respond to boluses overnight.
   - CrCl extremely low and will dose meds appropriately
   - Renal following
   - Send urine lytes, sediment, urine eos
 ASTHMA: As above, on bronchodilators and steroids.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I:  On insulin gtt.
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC: likely due to DKA given ketones in urine and
   serum acetone.  On insulin gtt. Now has non-gap acidosis probably
   related to volume resuscitation with normal saline. Will give bicarb as
   noted above.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 31-year-old female who is 34 weeks pregnant and admitted with fever and cough. She now presents with worsening hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including potential viral pneumonia with bacterial superinfection, peripartum cardiomyopathy (less likely due to hyperdynamic EF seen on TTE), autoimmune encephalitis (AIP), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), drug-induced hypersensitivity (DAH), and pulmonary hemosiderosis.

The patient's respiratory support includes invasive ventilation with a non-rebreather mask and a ventilator mode of controlled mandatory ventilation (CMV). The tidal volume (Vt) is set at 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) is set at 30 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 10 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 60%, and plateau pressure is 30 cmH2O.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate (HR) of 114 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 102/55 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%. The patient is sedated and has coarse crackles throughout her chest on auscultation. Her laboratory results"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 31-year-old female who is 34 weeks pregnant and was admitted with fever and cough.
- She is now experiencing worsening hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- The patient has a history of asthma and is being treated with bronchodilators and steroids.
- She also has a history of type I diabetes mellitus and is on an insulin infusion.
- The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.
- She has several potential medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, asthma, type I diabetes mellitus, and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxemic respiratory failure and ARDS. This could be due to viral pneumonia with bacterial superinfection or other causes such as asthma exacerbation.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest possible acute renal failure, which could be related to preeclampsia or volume depletion.
3. Asthma Exacerbation: The patient has a history of asthma and is receiving bronchodilators and steroids. It is important to monitor her respiratory status and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Type I Diabetes Mellitus: The patient is on an insulin infusion to manage her diabetes. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis likely due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Treatment"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory failure
   Suspect infectious etiology as patient presented with fevers and
   bandemia. Has bilateral patchy opacities. Known NL pump function makes
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema unlikely. P/F = 358 so ARDS not present.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have capillary leak secondary to both pre-eclampsia and sepsis.
   - DFA negative, d/c droplets precautions
   - Follow up respiratory cultures, gram stain negative
   - given poor renal function, this AM
s vanc dose will likely last until
   sputum culture data results are available. Since sputum gram stain is
   negative and influenza DFA also negative, low probablility for staph
   PNA so will d/c vanc after dose today
   - Continue ceftriaxone, azithromycin for CAP. Patient formerly
   relatively healthy community dwelling therefore think she is less
   likely to need expanded gram negative coverage
   2. Sepsis, suspected
   - maintain CVP of > 12
   - Goal MAP>65
   - continue broad spectrum source coverage with vanc (1 dose then d/c),
   ceftriaxone, azithromycin
   3. Acute renal failure
 worsening today, had some response to fluid
   boluses overnight.
   - Given low effective filling pressure, suspect further fluid
   resuscitation required.
   - getting 200cc/hr LR, can bolus prn, keep CVP >12
   - Renal is following due to likely pre-eclampsia, their review of
   sediment shows many granular casts c/w ATN.
   - Urine electrolytes now show FeNa of 0/9% (was 10% overnight).
   - Proteinuria likely due to pre-eclampsia but given DM may also have
   had pre-existing renal disease.
   - anticipate that blood products will improve intravascular volume
   4. Asthma
   - Continue nebs, change steroids to po prednisone and plan for slow
   taper, pt still wheezy on exam.
   5. Pregnancy and pre-eclampsia, suspected
   - OB following
   -s-Flt to be sent.
   6. Gap acidosis - resolved
   - Gap closed today, even when corrected for albumin. Acetones have
   resolved
   - check [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   7. Diabetes mellitius
   Patient with h/o type 1 DM, continue insulin drip. Keep glucose<150.
   8. Anemia
   - Hct drifting lower today, would transfuse 1 unti PRBCs and check PM
   HCT
   9. Lower extremity swelling
   - probably due to intake/output discrepancy, renal failure, and
   proteinuria.
   - Has had negative LENIS recently.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and is currently in labor. The patient underwent an emergency cesarean section and delivered a baby girl. Post-operatively, she experienced worsening renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL and a fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) of 10%. She also had a low central venous pressure (CVP) and required fluid boluses. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis and pneumonia, as well as insulin for diabetes management. Other issues include asthma, suspected pre-eclampsia, anemia, and lower extremity swelling. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has multiple lines inserted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient presented with fevers and bandemia, and has bilateral patchy opacities on imaging. While ARDS is less likely given the P/F ratio of 358, there is a concern for infectious etiology. Continued monitoring and support with mechanical ventilation are necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis due to the presence of fevers, bandemia, and bilateral patchy opacities on imaging. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and ongoing monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory failure and pneumonia
   Suspect infectious etiology as patient presented with fevers and
   bandemia. Has bilateral patchy opacities. Known NL pump function makes
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema unlikely. P/F = 358 so ARDS not present.
   [**Month (only) 60**] have capillary leak secondary to both pre-eclampsia and sepsis.
   - Follow up DFA, no role for tamiflu given duration of sx>72hrs
   - Follow up respiratory cultures, gram stain negative
   --Continue ceftriaxone, azithromycin, vancomycin for now. Patient
   formerly relatively healthy community dwelling therefore think she is
   less likely to need expanded gram negative coverage. Added vancomycin
   for double coverage of pneumococcus and empiric coverage of S. aureus
   in setting of ?influenza pna.
   2. Sepsis, suspected
   - Low TV Ventilation as above.
   - maintain CVP of 12
   - Goal MAP>65
   - continue broad spectrum coverage with vanc (check level this AM),
   ceftriaxone, azithromycin
   3. Acute renal failure
 worsening today, had some response to fluid
   boluses overnight.
   - Given low effective filling pressure, suspect further fluid
   resuscitation required.
   - Renal following due to likely pre-eclampsia, their review of sediment
   shows many granular casts c/w ATN.
   - Urine electrolytes show FeNa of 0/9% (was 10% overnight).
   - Proteinuria likely due to pre-eclampsia but given DM may also have
   had pre-existing renal disease.
   4. Asthma
   - Continue standing albuterol, IV steroids.
   5. Pregnancy and pre-eclampsia, suspected
   - OB following
   -s-Flt to be sent.
   6. Gap acidosis - resolved
   - Gap closed today, even when corrected for albumin. Acetones have
   resolved
   - check [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   7. Diabetes mellitius
   Patient with h/o type 1 DM, continue insulin drip. Keep glucose<150.
   8. Anemia
   - Hct drifting lower today, would transfuse 1 untit PRBCs
   9. Lower extremity swelling
   - probably due to intake/output discrepancy, renal failure, and
   proteinuria.
   - Has had negative LENIS recently.

","Summary:
The patient is a 32-year-old woman who presented to the ICU with respiratory failure and pneumonia. She has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and is currently on an insulin drip. She also has suspected sepsis, acute renal failure, asthma, pregnancy with suspected pre-eclampsia, and diabetes mellitus. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 118/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient is intubated and sedated. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation and increased respiratory rate indicate respiratory distress. She is already on mechanical ventilation, which may help improve her respiratory function.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, bandemia, and bilateral patchy opacities on chest X-ray suggest an infectious etiology. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but additional cultures and tests are pending. Close monitoring of her vitals and organ functions is necessary.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function, as indicated by the increased creatinine levels, and the presence of granular casts in the urine suggest acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Fluid resuscitation and careful management of fluid and electrolytes are important in this case.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 33-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure.
- She delivered a baby via C-section on 03/31/2115.
- The patient has worsening renal failure post-op, with a creatinine level of 2.4.
- She is oliguric and has a low central venous pressure (CVP).
- The patient received multiple infusions, including midazolam, insulin, and fentanyl.
- She has a history of asthma, type I diabetes mellitus, and metabolic acidosis.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 118/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%.
- She is intubated and sedated, with clear breath sounds and symmetric chest expansion.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests.
- Imaging reveals improvement in bilateral airspace opacities, and a new left internal jugular line is in place.
- The patient has pending microbiology and viral culture results.
- She is receiving prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
- The patient's code status is full code, and her current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure, which required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Continuous monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygenation is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the increasing creatinine level of 2.4. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, such as dialysis, may be required.
3. Oliguria: The patient is oliguric, meaning she is producing less urine than expected. This could be a sign of acute kidney injury or dehydration. Monitoring her fluid balance and urine output is crucial.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a history of metabolic acidosis. It is important to monitor her acid-base balance and correct any imbalances promptly to prevent complications.
5. Infection: The patient has pending microbiology and viral culture results. If an infection is identified, appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated promptly to prevent complications.
6. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to immobilization and underlying medical conditions. Prophylactic measures, such as subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin, should be continued to prevent deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
7. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylactic proton pump inhibitor therapy to prevent stress ulcers."

   Sputum pending (gram stain >25 PMNs, no organisms)
   Assessment and Plan
   31 y/o F POD#1 from c-section, with respiratory failure of unclear
   etiology, now improving.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]):  The underlying etiology
   remains unclear, but the fact that her oxygenation has significantly
   improved s/p delivery suggests that pre-eclampsia with capillary leak
   was the primary cause of her ARDS.  Respiratory viral panel negative
   for influenza, so is off precautions.  Gram stain of sputum also
   negative (but has been on antibiotics for several days) so bacterial
   infection still possible.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   - wean sedation and try pressure support
   Will likely need higher PEEP until volume status stabilized given PEEP
   responsive chagnes in regards to resp distress seen this am.
   PSV Reasonable mode for now
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Likely ATN from relative hypotension given
   casts seen on urine sediment (also urine lytes are suggestive of
   this).  However, her UOP increases when her CVP is increased,
   suggesting a component of volume depletion.  Also, preeclampsia likely
   played a role.
   - check pm lytes
   - goal CVP 12 (although recognizing this may worsen respiratory status
   if her UOP remains poor)
   -Follow 24 hour urine output for evidence of improved
 SEPSIS:  Improved.  BP stable.  Source is likely pneumonia although
   pathogen not clear.
 ASTHMA:  Cont bronchodilators and steroids. Change to po steroids.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I:  Cont insulin gtt.
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC:  Resolved.  Likely gap from DKA and non-gap from
   normal saline.
 ANEMIA:  Transfuse today given Hct 21.4 and attempting to keep CVP
   up.  Likely dilutional as well as blood loss from c-section.

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure, although it is improving. The underlying etiology remains unclear, but it could be related to pre-eclampsia with capillary leak or a respiratory infection.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has likely developed acute renal failure, possibly due to ATN (acute tubular necrosis) from relative hypotension. There may also be a component of volume depletion.

3. Sepsis: The patient was previously diagnosed with sepsis, but it appears to have improved. The source of infection is likely pneumonia, although the pathogen is not clear.

4. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, and bronchodilators and steroids should be continued.

5. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type I: The patient has diabetes, and insulin infusion should be continued.

6. Acidosis, Metabolic: The patient previously had metabolic acidosis, likely from DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) and normal saline administration.

7. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and blood transfusion should be considered given the low Hct (hematocrit) level.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient based on the provided progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
   31 y/o F POD#1 from c-section, with respiratory failure of unclear
   etiology, now improving.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]):  The underlying etiology
   remains unclear, but the fact that her oxygenation has significantly
   improved s/p delivery suggests that pre-eclampsia with capillary leak
   was the primary cause of her ARDS.  Respiratory viral panel negative
   for influenza, so is off precautions.  Gram stain of sputum also
   negative (but has been on antibiotics for several days) so bacterial
   infection still possible.
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics
   - wean sedation and try pressure support
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Likely ATN from relative hypotension given
   casts seen on urine sediment (also urine lytes are suggestive of
   this).  However, her UOP increases when her CVP is increased,
   suggesting a component of volume depletion.  Also, preeclampsia likely
   played a role.
   - check pm lytes
   - goal CVP 12 (although recognizing this may worsen respiratory status
   if her UOP remains poor)
 SEPSIS:  Improved.  BP stable.  Source is likely pneumonia although
   pathogen not clear.
 ASTHMA:  Cont bronchodilators and steroids. Change to po steroids.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I:  Cont insulin gtt.
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC:  Resolved.  Likely gap from DKA and non-gap from
   normal saline.
 ANEMIA:  Transfuse today given Hct 21.4 and attempting to keep CVP
   up.  Likely dilutional as well as blood loss from c-section.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxemic respiratory failure following a c-section delivery. The underlying etiology of the respiratory failure is unclear, but it is believed to be related to pre-eclampsia with capillary leak. The patient's oxygenation has significantly improved since delivery.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 22, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show pH 7.44, PaCO2 28 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio 358, and ventilation (Ve) of 13.6 L/min.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate (HR) of 80 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 121/64 to 140/80 mmHg, and respiratory rate (RR) of 26 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 99%. The patient is sedated and unresponsive.

The patient has a history of allergies to erythromycin base, nausea/vom"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Respiratory failure
   Suspect infectious etiology as patient presented with fevers and
   bandemia. Has bilateral patchy opacities. NL pump function makes
   cardiogenic pulmonary edema unlikely. [**Month (only) 60**] have capillary leak secondary
   to both pre-eclampsia and sepsis. Oxygenation improved, good RSBI this
   morning. However still on PEEP of 10, which patient required yesterday
   [**3-16**] wheezing (likely related to fluid, in addn to asthma).
   -- Continue diuresis with lasix goal 1-2 L negative today
   -- Decrease PEEP as tolerated today, ?extubation tomorrow
   -- Follow up respiratory cultures, gram stain negative
   -- Continue ceftriaxone, azithromycin for CAP complete 14d course
   2. Sepsis, suspected
   Hemodyanamically stable off pressors. Keep CVP>12, MAP>65.
   3. Acute renal failure
   Renal following suspect [**3-16**] ATN vs pre-eclampsia. Cr continues to
   climb, though urine output improved yesterday with lasix.
   --Given crystals on renal review of urinalysis will check uric acid
   today
 consider allopurinol if uric acid elevated.
   --Follow urine output, Cr. Renal dose meds. Renal recommendations
   appreciated.
   4. Asthma
   --Continue nebs, change back to IV steroids ?decreased absorption in
   setting of fluid overload
   5. Pregnancy and pre-eclampsia, suspected
   OB following, recommendations appreciated. s/p C section [**3-31**]
   6. Hyperkalemia
   K slightly up this AM in setting of decreased insulin, worsening Cr.
   F/u EKG, kayexalate, repeat PM electrolytes
   7. Diabetes mellitius
   Sugars more poorly controlled on sliding scale. As she is type 1 needs
   basal insulin coverage.  Had some lower sugars yesterday on low level
   insulin drip (60
s per report, not on Metavision). Will be starting
   tube feeds today, will add back insulin drip today. Keep glucose<150.
   8. Anemia
   Transfused 1unit PRBCs yesterday with appropriate Hct bump. No evidence
   of active bleeding. Transfuse Hb>7
   Given concern for pre-eclampsia, check hemolysis labs and smear if
   further decrease in Hct.
   9. Lower extremity swelling
   Probably [**3-16**] proteinuria. Unlikely DVT, has had negative LENIS
   recently.

   -- SBT today ?extubation
   -- Follow up respiratory cultures, gram stain negative
   - Continue ceftriaxone, azithromycin for CAP. Patient formerly
   relatively healthy community dwelling therefore think she is less
   likely to need expanded gram negative coverage
   2. Sepsis, suspected
   Hemodyanamically stable off pressors. Keep CVP>12, MAP>65. Poor urine
   output, as below.
   3. Acute renal failure
 worsening today, had some response to fluid
   boluses overnight.
   Renal following suspect [**3-16**] ATN vs pre-eclampsia. Some initial response
   to fluid boluses, but now likely volume resuscitated with CVP of 14.
   Follow urine output, Cr. Renal dose meds. Renal recommendations
   appreciated.
   4. Asthma
   - Continue nebs, change steroids to po prednisone and plan for slow
   taper, pt still wheezy on exam.
   5. Pregnancy and pre-eclampsia, suspected
   - OB following
   -s-Flt to be sent.
   6. Gap acidosis - resolved

   Transfused 1unit PRBCs yesterday with appropriate Hct bump. No evidence
   of active bleeding. Transfuse Hb>7
   9. Lower extremity swelling
   Probably [**3-16**] proteinuria. Unlikely DVT.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 31-year-old female with diabetes and asthma who presented at 34 weeks pregnant with symptoms of shortness of breath and cough. She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, suspected infectious etiology, and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She also has sepsis, acute renal failure, asthma, suspected pre-eclampsia, and diabetes mellitus. The patient has received transfusion of packed red blood cells and has shown some response to fluid boluses. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 120/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She has a central venous pressure of 14 mmHg and is receiving various medications including midazolam, fentanyl, and ceftriaxone. Lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21,000 cells/mm³ and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low respiratory rate indicate a potential complication related to her respiratory system.
2. Sepsis: The presence of fevers, bandemia, and bilateral patchy opacities on chest X-ray suggest an infectious etiology leading to sepsis.
3. Acute renal failure"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 31-year-old pregnant woman with diabetes and asthma.
- She presented at 34 weeks gestation with shortness of breath and cough.
- She has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, possibly not ARDS, asthma, type I diabetes mellitus, and metabolic acidosis.
- She is currently sedated and unable to provide a medical history.
- She has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including insulin infusion, transfusion of packed red blood cells, administration of lasix, and antibiotics.
- Her vital signs are stable, but she is still dependent on mechanical ventilation.
- Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and blood glucose levels.
- Imaging studies are pending.
- She has been admitted to the ICU and is on full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Preeclampsia or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to renal involvement.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) due to elevated blood glucose levels.
3. Respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization and central venous catheters.
5. Stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications.

   Assessment and Plan
   31 y/o F admitted at 34 weeks pregnant, with fever and hypoxemia,
   developed to ARDS requiring intubation.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]):  Likely due to infection
   initially, with superimposed capillary leak from preeclampsia leading
   to ARDS.  Her oxygenation has improved since she underwent c-section on
   Sunday morning, although because of her renal failure she is still not
   ready for extubation.  She was switched to PSV 10/10 yesterday and has
   tolerated this well.
   - continue to treat pna with abx (ceftriaxone and azithro)
   - continue current ventilator settings - can attempt to decrease PEEP
   - diurese as tolerated today as some component of this is likely now
   volume overload
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Differential includes ATN, preeclampsia, urate
   nephropathy (had urate crystals on UA). Her creatinine continues to
   rise but her UOP is improving with diuresis.  Her CVP is high, again
   c/w volume overload.
   - diurese today with goal negative 1-2 L
 SEPSIS:  Resolved.  Has been hemodynamically stable throughout
   current ICU course.  Likely source pna.
 ASTHMA:  Cont prednisone, bronchodilators.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I:  Insulin gtt. Needs basal SQ insulin
   and sliding scale.
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC: Anion gap only 8.  Likely has a non-gap acidosis
   from renal failure.  Recheck lytes later today.
 SEDATION:  Have had some difficulty with sedation.  Will titrate up
   her fentanyl/versed for comfort.
 ANEMIA:  Hct stable post-transfusion.  Likely dilutional.  Will
   trend.

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old female who was admitted at 34 weeks pregnant with fever and hypoxemia. She developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intubation. Her oxygenation has improved since undergoing a cesarean section, but she is still not ready for extubation. She is being treated with antibiotics for pneumonia and her current ventilator settings are being maintained. She also has acute renal failure with a differential diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis, preeclampsia, and urate nephropathy. Her creatinine level is rising, but her urine output is improving with diuresis. She also has a history of asthma, type I diabetes mellitus, metabolic acidosis, sepsis, and anemia. She is receiving sedation, nutrition, and glycemic control. She is on various medications for prophylaxis and has an arterial line, central line, and peripheral lines in place. She is critically ill. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated with antibiotics, indicating a suspected infection. If the infection progresses or if the antibiotics are ineffective, there could be worsening respiratory symptoms and further deterioration of her condition.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): ARDS is a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure. The patient's initial ARDS may have improved, but there is still a risk of complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or further deterioration"

   Assessment and Plan
   31 y/o F admitted at 34 weeks pregnant, with fever and hypoxemia,
   developed to ARDS requiring intubation.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]):  Likely due to infection
   initially, with superimposed capillary leak from preeclampsia leading
   to ARDS.  Her oxygenation has improved since she underwent c-section on
   Sunday morning, although because of her renal failure she is still not
   ready for extubation.  She was switched to PSV 10/10 yesterday and has
   tolerated this well.
   - continue to treat pna with abx (ceftriaxone and azithro)
   - continue current ventilator settings - can attempt to decrease PEEP
   - diurese as tolerated today as some component of this is likely now
   volume overload
 ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Differential includes ATN, preeclampsia, and
   mix of the two.  I doubt  urate nephropathy (although had urate
   crystals on UA). Her creatinine continues to rise but her UOP is
   improving with diuresis.  Her CVP is high, again c/w volume overload.
   - diurese today with goal negative 1-2 L if possible
 SEPSIS:  Resolved.  Has been hemodynamically stable throughout
   current ICU course.  Likely source pna.
 ASTHMA:  Cont prednisone, bronchodilators.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I:  Insulin gtt. Needs basal SQ insulin
   and sliding scale.
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC: Anion gap only 8.  Likely has a non-gap acidosis
   from renal failure.  Recheck lytes later today.
 SEDATION:  Have had some difficulty with sedation.  Will titrate up
   her fentanyl/versed for comfort.
 ANEMIA:  Hct stable post-transfusion.  Likely dilutional.  Will
   trend.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient, a 31-year-old female who was 34 weeks pregnant, presented with fever and hypoxemia and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
- She underwent an emergency cesarean section and her oxygenation has improved since then.
- However, she still requires mechanical ventilation due to ongoing respiratory failure.
- The patient also has acute renal failure, likely due to preeclampsia and a possible component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
- Her creatinine levels continue to rise, but her urine output is improving with diuresis.
- She has a history of type I diabetes mellitus and asthma.
- The patient has been hemodynamically stable throughout her ICU course, suggesting that the sepsis has resolved.
- She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia.
- Other medical conditions include anemia and metabolic acidosis.
- The patient is critically ill and requires ongoing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
- Prolonged mechanical ventilation may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
- Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to ongoing respiratory failure.

2. Renal Complications:
- Acute renal failure can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not appropriately managed.
- Fluid overload and volume management are crucial to prevent worsening of renal function.

3. Infection-related Complications:

","The patient is a 31-year-old woman who was admitted at 34 weeks pregnant with preeclampsia and respiratory failure, and has since undergone a cesarean section. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The main points from the progress note include:

1. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia, exacerbated by capillary leak from preeclampsia and aggressive fluid administration. The plan is to wean sedation and extubate today.
2. The patient has acute renal failure, which is most likely caused by preeclampsia with a component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Her creatinine levels are increasing but her urine output is good with the use of lasix. It is important to monitor urine output and electrolytes closely.
3. The patient also has asthma, for which she will continue to receive IV steroids until extubation. Inhalers will be used as needed.
4. She has type I diabetes mellitus, which has resulted in episodes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Insulin will be given to prevent hypoglycemia while tube feeds are held.
5. The patient received a red blood cell transfusion due to anemia. Her hemoglobin level will be followed, and she will be transfused if her hemoglobin falls below 21.
6. She has edema, likely due to volume overload and hypoproteinemia from preeclamps"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorder, asthma, type I diabetes mellitus, and metabolic acidosis. The patient is intubated, sedated, and not responding to verbal stimuli. Vital signs show a temperature of 100.7 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 116/78 to 150/104 mmHg, heart rate between 79 and 104 beats per minute, respiratory rate at 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on ventilator support. The patient's current weight is 90 kg. 

The arterial line was restarted due to difficulty drawing from the old line. Creatinine levels continue to increase, but urine output is good with the use of lasix. The patient is being weaned down on PEEP. A culture was taken due to a temperature of 100.7 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient has allergies to erythromycin base, nausea/vomiting, and last received antibiotics on 04/02/2115 at 08:58 AM. 

The patient is receiving infusions of insulin, midazolam (Versed), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include furosemide (Lasix) started on 04/03/2115 at 04:20 AM.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 31-year-old woman who is post-partum and experiencing respiratory and renal failure. She is currently in the ICU. The arterial line was replaced at 08:14 PM, and all other lines are in place due to her critical condition. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate between 71-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/64 to 150/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL and assisted spontaneous breathing. The patient's cardiovascular system appears normal with a sinus rhythm, and her extremities are warm and well-perfused.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging shows bibasilar opacities on chest X-ray. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), acute renal failure, asthma, type I diabetes mellitus, and is being treated accordingly. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with IV insulin, and prophylaxis measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   In setting of underlying asthma, likely CAP, and fluid overload.
   Currently doing well despite fluid overload on CXR.
   -          change to PO steroids and start wean tomorrow
   -          nebulizers PRN
   -          continue ceftriaxone and azithromycin for 14 day course (day

   -          allow patient to autodiurese; goal of -1L today
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Most likely due to preeclampsia with possible ATN.  Suspect she is
   currently in post-ATN diuresis and hence will not be able to
   concentrate her urine.
   -          continue to follow [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -          expect patient

","Summary:
The patient is a 31-year-old woman admitted with preeclampsia and respiratory failure, who has recently undergone a C-section. She is currently in the ICU and is doing well despite fluid overload on her chest X-ray. The patient has a history of asthma and is suspected to have community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and fluid overload. She is being weaned off invasive ventilation and extubated successfully.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which may be due to underlying asthma, CAP, and fluid overload. She is being managed with nebulizers PRN and antibiotics for a 14-day course.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is suspected to have acute renal failure, most likely due to preeclampsia with possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Her urine output and creatinine levels will be closely monitored.
3. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type I: The patient has been diagnosed with type I diabetes mellitus, and her insulin regimen will be transitioned from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin as she begins eating orally.
4. Edema: The patient may experience edema related to proteinuria, but this is unrelated to fluid overload. She will be allowed to autodiurese.
5. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure could be a late manifestation of preeclampsia. It will be closely monitored without immediate treatment.

Please note that the patient's condition is currently stable, and appropriate measures are being taken to manage her various medical complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old woman with a history of type I diabetes and pre-eclampsia who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure related to presumptive community-acquired pneumonia and pre-eclampsia. She has since resolved her respiratory failure and was extubated the previous day.

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications, including:
1. Acute respiratory failure (not ARDS): The patient's condition has improved since extubation, but her chest X-ray worsened, consistent with removal of PEEP and mobilization of third-spaced fluid. It is recommended to allow her to auto-diurese and complete the course of antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function appears to be improving. It is recommended to appreciate renal help.
3. Asthma: The patient should be converted to oral steroids.
4. Type I diabetes mellitus: The patient should begin transitioning to subcutaneous insulin, maintain better control prior to leaving the ICU, and start an oral diet (diabetic).
5. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure could be related to late eclampsia or volume status. It is advised to allow her to auto-diurese, maintain vigilance for escalating hypertension, and consider the underlying cause.
6. Wound separation: The management of this issue should be done by the OB team.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Patient has underlying asthma, likely CAP, and fluid overload due to
   volume resuscitation and increased capillary permeability in setting of
   preeclampsia.
   -          currently 97% on RA, breathing comfortably
   -          would finish ceftriaxone and azithromycin for 14 day course
   (day 1 = [**3-27**])

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Due to preeclampsia and ATN.  Has good urine output and improving Cr.
   -          note that after ATN, she will have isosthenuria and be
   unable to concentrate her urine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old woman admitted to the ICU in respiratory failure due to preeclampsia and possible community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient has a history of asthma, which likely contributed to her respiratory failure. She also has evidence of fluid overload on the chest X-ray.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's severe bilateral diffuse opacities on the chest X-ray, along with her respiratory failure, suggest a high risk for developing ARDS. This condition is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to impaired oxygenation.

2. Pneumonia Progression: The patient has been diagnosed with CAP, but there is still a rare growth of oropharyngeal flora including yeast. There is a possibility that the infection could progress further, potentially leading to worsening respiratory symptoms and systemic involvement.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely secondary to preeclampsia and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). It is important to closely monitor her renal function and manage fluid and electrolyte balance carefully to prevent further deterioration.

4. Hypertension: Although the patient's blood pressure has improved, there is still some elevation, which may be attributed to volume overload. It is crucial to continue monitoring her blood pressure and consider appropriate management strategies to prevent complications associated with high"
