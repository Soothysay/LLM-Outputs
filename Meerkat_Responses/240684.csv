   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 57 year old lady w/ PMhx of cryptogenic cirrhosis cx by
   varices with MELD score of 17, who has chronic total bilirubin of 2.0
   and INR of 1.8 to 2.0 presents with bright red blood per rectum,
   fevers, and resolving abdominal pain.
   Plan:
   1.  Hypotension - Likely secondary to underlying infection (sepsis
   secondary to gastroenteritis or cholangitis) vs hypovolemia (in setting
   of diarrhea and GI bleed)
   -Continue on pressor support: levophed
   -Start flagyl + cefepime (cefepime b/c neutropenia)
   -obtain mixed venous O2 sat to differentiate sepsis vs hypovolemia
   -IV hydration
   -holding nadolol
   -holding furosemide and spirinolactone
   -F/u blood cultures, stool studies, urine cultures
   2. Diarrhea:   Could be secondary to viral (adenovirus, [**Location (un) 10537**]) or
   bacterial (dysentery = Campylobacter, E Coli, Shigella) vs C
   difficile.
   -stool cultures
   -fecal leukocytes
   -stool O + P
   -C diff toxin
   .
   3.  Bright red blood per rectum: HCT fell from 37 -> 32 yesterday.
   Possible sources of BRBPR could be secondary to hemorrhoids,
   diverticula, ischemic colitis, infectious colitis, AVMs.  Recently took
   abx course for cellulitis which may have made her more coagulopathic
   and predisposed her to bleed (INR elevated at 2.2).  CT findings of
   edematous ascending colon and rectum concerning for ischemia especially
   in setting of rising lactate.
   -Maintain active type + screen
   -Follow HCTs q8 hours
   -transfuse if HCT falls below 21
   -IV PPI 40 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -Could be secondary to ischemia as well:  would track lactate for
   improvement.  If increasing suspicion, should notify surgery; they are
   aware.
   .
   4.  Elevated total bilirubin - Secondary to either decompensation of
   liver disease from acute stress of infection or due to obstructive
   picture.  Differential includes cholecysitis, cholangitis.
   -Check LFTs
   -Trend bilirubin
   -Amylase,lipase
   .
   5.  Coagulopathy:  INR is 2.2 (baseline is 1.8 - 2.0)
   -Recently got cephalosporine course for cellulitis as outpatient; may
   have depleted bowel flora -> low vitamin K -> increased INR.
   -Give Vitamin K
   .
   6.  Metabolic Acidosis - Gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to
   increased lactate; also has diarrhea which could be a superimposed
   nongap acidosis.
   -For lactic acidosis continue to hydrate
   -For diarrhea, stool studies as above, continue abx coverage.
   -Continue to follow
   .
   7.  Cryptogenic cirrhosis
   -Holding nadolol, spirinolactone, and furosemide in setting of low BP
   .
   8. Hypoglycemia
 Sugars were low yesterday likely secondary to
   worsening hepatic function in setting of sepsis.
   -Continue D10W and check sugars q1.  As sugars fall, can come back on
   D10W and switch to D5.
   .
   9  Prophylaxis: hold SC heparin, pneumoboots, bowel regimen, IV PPI

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and previous variceal bleeding. She presents with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, and resolving abdominal pain. The patient is currently hypotensive and requires pressor support with levophed. She also has diarrhea, elevated total bilirubin, coagulopathy, metabolic acidosis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, hypoglycemia, and is on prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fever could be indicative of an underlying infection (sepsis secondary to gastroenteritis or cholangitis).
2. Hypovolemia: The patient's low blood pressure and ongoing diarrhea may suggest hypovolemia due to fluid loss.
3. GI Bleed: The bright red blood per rectum could be due to various causes such as hemorrhoids, diverticula, ischemic colitis, infectious colitis, or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The patient's elevated INR may have predisposed her to bleed.
4. Ischemic Colitis: The CT findings of an edematous ascending colon and rectum raise concern for ischemia, especially with the rising lactate levels.
5. Liver Decompensation: The elevated total bilirubin could be due to decompensation"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old lady with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, complex by varices, and a MELD score of 17. She presents with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, and resolving abdominal pain. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for hypotension, likely secondary to underlying infection (sepsis secondary to gastroenteritis or cholangitis) or hypovolemia (in the setting of diarrhea and GI bleed). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are as follows:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fevers indicate a possible underlying infection, which could progress to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. GI bleeding: The patient has bright red blood per rectum, which could be due to various causes such as hemorrhoids, diverticula, ischemic colitis, infectious colitis, or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The elevated INR suggests a predisposition to bleeding.
3. Ischemic colitis: The CT findings of an edematous ascending colon and rectum raise concern for ischemia, especially in the context of rising lactate levels.

   to 2.0 presents with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea and
   apparent septic shock
   1.  Septic shock
 Pt has fever, elevated WBC.  Most likely secondary
   to underlying infection.  Symptoms currently support a GI source,
   likely toxin mediated gastroenteritis, strongyloides, salmonella,
   shigella, Ecoli.  She has bacteremia with GNR, speciation is pending.
    Cholangitis less likely given liver enzymes do not correspond and pt's
   exam is generally benign.   Also on the differential is SBP, although
   quantity of fluid in her abdomen is small and paracentesis would be
   complicated.  .

   - ID following
   -surgery following
   .
   2.  Bright red blood per rectum: HCT fell from 37 -> 32 yesterday.
   Stable today at 34.5.  Possible sources of BRBPR could be secondary to
   hemorrhoids, diverticula, ischemic colitis, infectious colitis, AVMs.
   Recently took abx course for cellulitis which may have made her more
   coagulopathic and predisposed her to bleed (INR elevated at 3.1 today
   ).  Lactate elevated concerning of ischemia, however sigmoidoscopy r/o
   ischemia.
   -Maintain active type + screen
   -Follow HCTs q4 hours
   -transfuse if HCT falls below 30
   -IV PPI 40 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -trend lactate for improvement.  If increasing suspicion, may require
   angiography.
   4.  Elevated total bilirubin - Secondary to either decompensation of
   liver disease from acute stress of infection or due to obstructive
   picture, [**Doctor Last Name 4871**] disease. Remainder of liver enzymes benign.
   -Trend bilirubin

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old lady with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and previous varices who presented with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea, and apparent septic shock. She has an elevated MELD score of 17 and chronic total bilirubin of 2.0 and INR of 1.8 to 2.0. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 103/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is on pressor support with levophed and vasopressin, receiving IV hydration with bicarbonate, and being treated with flagyl and cefepime. Blood cultures, stool studies, and urine cultures are pending. A colonoscopy was performed, ruling out ischemic or infectious colitis, but a biopsy was taken. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, gastrointestinal bleed, lower (hematochezia, BRBPR, GI bleed, GIB), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and potential complications such as strongyloidiasis, SBP, cholangitis, and DIC.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient has fever, elevated WBC, and bacteremia with GNR, indicating a possible underlying infection. Symptoms suggest a GI source, likely toxin-mediated gastroenter"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis presenting with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea, and apparent septic shock. She has a MELD score of 17, chronic total bilirubin of 2.0, and INR of 1.8 to 2.0. The patient is currently on pressor support with levophed and vasopressin, and has been started on flagyl and cefepime. Blood cultures, stool studies, and urine cultures are pending. A diagnostic paracentesis and colon biopsy have been ordered. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock secondary to an underlying infection, possibly toxin-mediated gastroenteritis. Cholangitis is less likely given the liver enzymes and exam findings. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is also a possibility.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient presents with bright red blood per rectum, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. Possible sources include hemorrhoids, diverticula, ischemic colitis, infectious colitis, or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: There is no assessment of the patient's skin integrity in the progress note.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to increased lactate, possibly due to se"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old lady w/ PMhx of cryptogenic cirrhosis cx by varices with
   MELD score of 17, who has chronic total bilirubin of 2.0 and INR of 1.8
   to 2.0 presents with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea and
   apparent septic shock
   1.  Respiratory Failure:  Given accessory muscle use, dyspnea; probably
   compensating for underlying metabolic acidosis. Currently on FiO2 of
   40%, PEEP of 5.   pHs have improved, no longer acidotic and metabolic
   acidosis resolving.  Lactate levels falling.
   -Tx of underlying infection
   -Consider switching to pressure support ventilation
   2.  Septic shock
 Pt has largely resolved fevers and WBC count stable
   between 9 -10.  Most likely secondary to underlying infection.
   Symptoms, CT scan currently support an infectious colitis: possible
   etiologies include a likely toxin mediated gastroenteritis, salmonella,
   shigella, Ecoli.  Other possible sources for sepsis include her
   bacteremia with GNR, speciation is pending.   Cholangitis less likely
   given liver enzymes do not correspond and pt's exam is generally
   benign.   Also on the differential is SBP, although clinically does not
   have any abdominal tenderness or fluid on exam, and radiologically,
   the  quantity of fluid in her abdomen is small.
   -Continue on pressor support: levophed and vasopression (BPs 85 -95)
   -holding nadolol
   -holding furosemide and spirinolactone
   -Continue  flagyl + cefepime (coverage of anaerobes and gram-
   organisms)
   -Summary of culture data:  C diff negative, E Coli O157:H7 negative,
   O+P negative, other fecal cxs pending, Blood cxs: gram - rods: f/u
   other cxs
   -F/u blood cultures, stool studies, urine cultures
   -f/u colon bx
   - defer paracentesis as blood cultures will guide treatment
   - ID, GI following
   .
   3.  Thrombocytopenia -  At admission had low platelets likely secondary
   to cirrhosis (low thrombopoetin, portal HTN, splenic sequestration).
   Platelets continued to [**2126**]6 -> 38 over past few days.  Given
   diarrhea hx, would consider HUS, however there is no renal failure,
   making this less likely.  Consumption/DIC possible given elevation of
   FDP and decrease of fibrinogen, prolonged PTT and INR.
   -Check blood smear to look for microangiopathic changes
   -Does not appear to be active bleeding; trend platelets [**Hospital1 7**], check PM
   coags.  If further platelet drop or begins to actively bleed, consider
   giving platelets.
   -Given hx of bleed,give FFP and Vitamin K now to reverse INR.
   -Treat underlying cause  (sepsis)
   -Not getting any heparin products
   4.  Bright red blood per rectum: HCT fell from 37 -> 32 yesterday.
   Stable today at 34.5.  Possible sources of BRBPR could be secondary to
   hemorrhoids, diverticula, ischemic colitis, infectious colitis, AVMs.
   Recently took abx course for cellulitis which may have made her more
   coagulopathic and predisposed her to bleed (INR elevated at 3.1 today
   ).  Lactate elevated concerning of ischemia, however sigmoidoscopy r/o
   ischemia.
   -Maintain active type + screen
   -Follow [**Hospital1 7**] HCT
   -transfuse if HCT falls below 21
   -IV PPI 40 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -trend lactate for improvement.
   4.  Elevated total bilirubin - Secondary to either decompensation of
   liver disease from acute stress of infection or due to obstructive
   picture. Remainder of liver enzymes benign.
   -Trend bilirubin
   .
   .
   5.  Metabolic Acidosis - Resolving, likely with improved perfusion,
   resolution of lactic acidosis;
   .
   6.  Cryptogenic cirrhosis
   -Holding nadolol, spirinolactone, and furosemide in setting of low BP
   .
   7. Osteoarthritis - hold NSAIDs
   .
   #  Prophylaxis: hold SC heparin, pneumoboots, bowel regimen, IV PPI

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old lady w/ PMhx of cryptogenic cirrhosis cx by varices with
   MELD score of 17, who has chronic total bilirubin of 2.0 and INR of 1.8
   to 2.0 presents with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea and
   apparent septic shock
   1.  Respiratory Failure:  Given accessory muscle use, dyspnea; probably
   compensating for underlying metabolic acidosis. Currently on FiO2 of
   40%, PEEP of 5.   pHs have improved, no longer acidotic and metabolic
   acidosis resolving.  Lactate levels falling.
   -Tx of underlying infection
   -Consider switching to pressure support ventilation
   2.  Septic shock
 Pt has largely resolved fevers and WBC count stable
   between 9 -10.  Most likely secondary to underlying infection.
   Symptoms, CT scan currently support an infectious colitis: possible
   etiologies include a likely toxin mediated gastroenteritis, salmonella,
   shigella, Ecoli.  Other possible sources for sepsis include her
   bacteremia with GNR, speciation is pending.   Cholangitis less likely
   given liver enzymes do not correspond and pt's exam is generally
   benign.   Also on the differential is SBP, although clinically does not
   have any abdominal tenderness or fluid on exam, and radiologically,
   the  quantity of fluid in her abdomen is small.
   -Continue on pressor support: levophed and vasopression (BPs 85 -95)
   -holding nadolol
   -holding furosemide and spirinolactone
   -Continue  flagyl + cefepime (coverage of anaerobes and gram-
   organisms)
   -Summary of culture data:  C diff negative, E Coli O157:H7 negative,
   O+P negative, other fecal cxs pending, Blood cxs: gram - rods: f/u
   other cxs
   -F/u blood cultures, stool studies, urine cultures
   -f/u colon bx
   - defer paracentesis as blood cultures will guide treatment
   - ID, GI following
   .
   3.  Thrombocytopenia -  At admission had low platelets likely secondary
   to cirrhosis (low thrombopoetin, portal HTN, splenic sequestration).
   Platelets continued to [**2126**]6 -> 38 over past few days.  Given
   diarrhea hx, would consider HUS, however there is no renal failure,
   making this less likely.  Consumption/DIC possible given elevation of
   FDP and decrease of fibrinogen, prolonged PTT and INR.
   -Check blood smear to look for microangiopathic changes
   -Does not appear to be active bleeding; trend platelets [**Hospital1 7**], check PM
   coags.  If further platelet drop or begins to actively bleed, consider
   giving platelets.
   -Given hx of bleed,give FFP and Vitamin K now to reverse INR.
   -Treat underlying cause  (sepsis)
   -Not getting any heparin products
   4.  Bright red blood per rectum: HCT fell from 37 -> 32 yesterday.
   Stable today at 34.5.  Possible sources of BRBPR could be secondary to
   hemorrhoids, diverticula, ischemic colitis, infectious colitis, AVMs.
   Recently took abx course for cellulitis which may have made her more
   coagulopathic and predisposed her to bleed (INR elevated at 3.1 today
   ).  Lactate elevated concerning of ischemia, however sigmoidoscopy r/o
   ischemia.
   -Maintain active type + screen
   -Follow [**Hospital1 7**] HCT
   -transfuse if HCT falls below 21
   -IV PPI 40 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   -trend lactate for improvement.
   4.  Elevated total bilirubin - Secondary to either decompensation of
   liver disease from acute stress of infection or due to obstructive
   picture. Remainder of liver enzymes benign.
   -Trend bilirubin
   .
   .
   5.  Metabolic Acidosis - Resolving, likely with improved perfusion,
   resolution of lactic acidosis;
   .
   6.  Cryptogenic cirrhosis
   -Holding nadolol, spirinolactone, and furosemide in setting of low BP
   .
   7. Osteoarthritis - hold NSAIDs
   .
   #  Prophylaxis: hold SC heparin, pneumoboots, bowel regimen, IV PPI

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, complicated by varices, and a MELD score of 17. She presents with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea, and apparent septic shock.
- She is currently on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
- Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 87/51 mmHg to 176/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- She has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 18 mmHg and a urine output of 913 mL over the past 24 hours.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.8 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) of 66,000/mm3, total bilirubin of 30.2 mg/dL, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 3.2.
- Imaging studies reveal a right pleural effusion and worsening basilar atelectasis on chest X-ray, as well as colonic wall thickening involving the ascending colon and rectum with surrounding inflammatory fat stranding on abdominal CT scan.
- Microbiology tests show negative results for Clostridium difficile (C. diff), E. Coli O157:H7, O+P, and aerobic bottle gram stain. The anaerobic bottle gram stain reveals gram-negative rods sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone.
- The patient's assessment and plan include treatment for respiratory failure, septic shock, thrombocytopenia, bright red blood per rectum, and elevated total bilirubin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of developing further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or lung infection due to the presence of fever and worsening basilar atelectasis.

2. Septic shock: Although the patient's fevers have resolved, and WBC count is stable, there is still a risk of septic shock recurrence due to the underlying infection, especially considering the findings of colonic wall thickening and inflammatory changes on the abdominal CT scan.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding. This could be secondary to her liver disease (portal hypertension and splenic sequestration), ongoing diarrhea, or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

4. Gastrointestinal bleeding:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis. She presented with sepsis, blood loss anemia, and is currently in the ICU. The patient's condition has evolved to include respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleed, sepsis, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and various medications for sepsis and other complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to sepsis and altered mental status. She is on assisted ventilation support and will continue with airway and ventilatory support.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient is experiencing lower gastrointestinal bleed, which could be related to acute infection in the GI tract. Continuous monitoring of hematocrit levels and ongoing antibiotic therapy for E. Coli source are necessary. Further examination and biopsy results will guide the treatment plan.
3. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis caused by E. Coli bacteremia. She is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy with cefepime and Flagyl. Vasopressin dosing will be increased to 0.04U/min. Fluid boluses will be given as needed, and the response to treatment will be monitored.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with low urine output and elevated creatinine levels. Targeted urine output today is crucial, and further evaluation for hemolysis and other"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old lady w/ PMhx of cryptogenic cirrhosis cx by varices with
   MELD score of 17, who has chronic total bilirubin of 2.0 and INR of 1.8
   to 2.0 presents with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea and
   apparent septic shock
   1.  Respiratory Failure:  Given accessory muscle use, dyspnea; probably
   compensating for underlying metabolic acidosis. Currently on FiO2 of
   40%, PEEP of 5.   pHs have improved, no longer acidotic Lactate levels
   falling and metabolic acidosis resolved.  Barriers to extubation:
   continued sedation, resolving sepsis, minimal urine output.
   -Follow UOPs today to fluid boluses and ensure adequate UOP
   -Cut back on sedation to watch how mental status evolves
   -Pull back on norepi and continue vasopressin and watch pressures
   -pending above could consider switch to PSV
   -Continue tx of underlying sepsis
   2.  Septic shock
 Pt has largely resolved fevers and WBC count stable
   between 9 -10.  Source of sepsis likely E. Coli bactermia sensitive to
   ceftriaxone.  All other stool studies negative; cholangitis and SBP
   unlikely.
   -D/c cefepime and flagyl start on ceftriaxone as per ID recs: likely
   will need 2 wk course.
   -On .08 of norepi and 2.4 of vasopressin; pull back on pressors can d/c
   the vasopressin.
   -holding nadolol, furosemide and spirinolactone
   - ID, GI following
   .
   3.  Thrombocytopenia -  At admission had low platelets likely secondary
   to cirrhosis (low thrombopoetin, portal HTN, splenic sequestration).
   Platelets continued to [**2126**]6 -> 38 over past few days but are stable
   at 42 today; fibrinogen, FDP, coags stable and not rising and does not
   appear to be actively bleeding.  Blood smear shows no microangiopathic
   changes which further argues against DIC.  Rather than DIC could be
   secondary to acute worsening of liver disease in setting of sepsis.
   -Can check daily coags, platelets; no need to follow FDP or fibrinogen
   -Continue to treat underlying cause  (sepsis)
   .
   4.  Oliguria:  UOP has improved to 25 cc/hr by midnight yesterday and
   today is already above 30 ccs hour; was responsive to fluids.
   -Would continue fluid boluses today and watch Is and Os during the day
   for adequate response.
   .
   5.  Bright red blood per rectum: HCTs have been stable over last three
   days.
   -Maintain active type + screen
   -Follow daily HCTs
   -transfuse if HCT falls below 21
   -IV PPI 40 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   6.  Metabolic Acidosis - Gap on non-gap: Resolving with resolution of
   diarrhea and resolving lactate.
   .
   7.  Cryptogenic cirrhosis
   -Holding nadolol, spirinolactone, and furosemide in setting of low BP
   .
   8. Osteoarthritis - hold NSAIDs
   .
   9. FEN:  Started on TF yesterday.  Repleting electrolytes as
   necessary.
   10.  Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, IV PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old lady with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, presenting with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea, and apparent septic shock. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a high platelet count and thrombocytopenia. The patient's INR is elevated, and she has evidence of renal insufficiency. She has been treated with various antibiotics for an E. coli bacteremia that is sensitive to ceftriaxone. The patient's condition is improving, with resolving sepsis, metabolic acidosis, and oliguria. However, she still requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience difficulty weaning off the ventilator due to continued sedation and resolving sepsis.
2. Septic Shock: Although the patient's fever has resolved, there is a risk of recurrent or persistent infection, which could lead to another episode of septic shock.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, likely secondary to cirrhosis. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
4. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is still below normal, indicating possible ongoing renal dysfunction. Fluid management and"

   to cirrhosis (low thrombopoetin, portal HTN, splenic sequestration).
   Platelets continued to [**2126**]6 -> 38 over past few days but are stable
   at 42 today; fibrinogen, FDP, coags stable and not rising and does not
   appear to be actively bleeding.  Blood smear shows no microangiopathic
   changes which further argues against DIC.  Rather than DIC could be
   secondary to acute worsening of liver disease in setting of sepsis.
   -Can check daily coags, platelets; no need to follow FDP or fibrinogen
   -Continue to treat underlying cause  (sepsis)
   .
   4.  Oliguria:  UOP has improved to 25 cc/hr by midnight yesterday and
   today is already above 30 ccs hour; was responsive to fluids.
   -Would start maintenance fluids today and watch Is and Os during the
   day
   .
   5.  Bright red blood per rectum: HCTs have been stable over last three
   days.
   -Maintain active type + screen
   -Follow daily HCTs
   -transfuse if HCT falls below 21
   -IV PPI 40 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   6.  Metabolic Acidosis - Gap on non-gap: Resolving with resolution of
   diarrhea and resolving lactate.

   7.  Cryptogenic cirrhosis
   -Holding nadolol, spirinolactone, and furosemide in setting of low BP
   .
   8. Osteoarthritis - hold NSAIDs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old lady with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and previous variceal bleeding. She presents with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea, and apparent septic shock. Her current condition is as follows:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Her pH levels have improved, and she no longer has metabolic acidosis. Lactate levels are falling.
2. Septic Shock: The patient has resolved fevers, and her WBC count is stable between 9-10. The source of sepsis is likely E. Coli bacteremia sensitive to ceftriaxone. Other stool studies are negative, ruling out cholangitis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has improved from 38 to 42 today, suggesting a stable condition. Fibrinogen, FDP, and coagulation studies are stable and not rising, indicating no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Oliguria: The patient's urine output has improved to more than 30 cc/hr today, responding well to fluid administration.
5. Bright Red Blood per Rectum: The patient's HCTs have been stable over the last three days.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo female admit with Gi bleed in the setting of cirrhosis and found
   to have E. Coli sepsis in the setting of diarrhea at presenation.  She
   has had reasonable response to intervention for E. Coli sepsis and has
   active issue of persistent respiratory failure with slow to improve
   mental status in the setting of sedation.
   1)Sepsis
   E. Coli found in blood
   Will look to wean pressors today
specifically Levophed
   -CVP is likely 14, fevers resolved, urine function stable
   -Will keep I/O even today
   -Urine output reasonable with IVF bolus needed
   2)Respiratory Failure-Minute ventilation requirement reasonable,
   Pplat=20, no evidence of substantial pulmonary edema
CXR with left
   sided consolidation.
   -Will move to PSV as mental status improves and look to wean to
   extubation as possible across the day
   -Barriers to extubation include
mental status, volume overload and
   continued sepsis as we will need hemodynamic stability to look to move
   to extubation
   3)GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB)-
   -PPI iV
   -Adquate IV access in place
   4)Altered Mental Status-Is consistent with diffuse encephalopathy and
   will look to decrease sedation and follow exam
   -Will continue to wean sedation as possible with Versed and Fentanyl

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a chief complaint of GI bleed, sepsis, and respiratory failure. She was admitted with a history of cirrhosis and found to have E. Coli sepsis. The patient has had a reasonable response to intervention for E. Coli sepsis but continues to have persistent respiratory failure with slow improvement in mental status.

24-hour events include stable thrombocytopenia, antibiotic change to ceftriaxone per ID suggestion, and negative ultrasound for DVT. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Vancomycin, Metronidazole, Cefipime, and Ceftriaxone.

Infusions include Midazolam (Versed), Vasopressin, Fentanyl (Concentrate), Norepinephrine, and Pantoprazole (Protonix). Other ICU medications include Fibersource HN (Full) for nutrition and Glycemic Control.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98°F)
- Heart Rate: 100 bpm
- Blood Pressure: 108/56 mmHg
- Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Oxygen Saturation: 98% on endotracheal tube with FiO2 40%

The patient's lab results show a WBC count of 9.3, Hct of 31.0, Plt of 41, Cr of 0.7, TCO2 of 27, Glucose of 63, and other lab values within normal range.

Imaging shows left-sided consolidation and right-sided effusion, with the ETT and CVL in good position.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Sepsis - E. Coli found in blood. Will look to wean pressors today, specifically Levophed. CVP is likely 14, fevers resolved, urine function stable. Will keep I/O even today.
2) Respiratory Failure - Minute ventilation requirement reasonable, Pplat=20, no evidence of substantial pulmonary edema. Will move to PSV as mental status improves and look to wean to extubation as possible across the day.
3) GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED, GIB) - PPI iV, adequate IV access in place.
4) Altered Mental Status - Consistent with diffuse encephalopathy and will look to decrease sedation and follow exam. Will continue to wean sedation as possible with Versed and Fentanyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis - The patient is at risk of developing further complications due to ongoing sepsis. Close monitoring and prompt treatment are necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure - The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is inadequate ventilation or if the mental status does not improve, leading to prolonged intubation and ventilation support.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding - Continued bleeding can lead to hypovolemia and require additional interventions such as blood transfusions or endoscopic procedures.
4. Altered Mental Status - The patient's encephalopathy may progress if not managed appropriately, potentially leading to increased sedation, confusion, or even coma.

   57 year old lady w/ PMhx of cryptogenic cirrhosis cx by varices with
   MELD score of 17, who has chronic total bilirubin of 2.0 and INR of 1.8
   to 2.0 presents with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea and
   apparent septic shock
   1.  Respiratory Failure:  Intially intubated due to increased WOB in
   setting of pulmonary edema.  Currently on FiO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5.
   Lactate levels falling and metabolic acidosis resolved, improving her
   respiratory status also.   Barriers to extubation:  reduced mental
   status, resolving sepsis, pulmonary edema
   -Diurese as BP tolerates to improve pulmonary edema
   -Of sedation, avoid medications that may affect mental status
   -switch to pressure support
   - diuresis as BP tolerates
   -Continue tx of underlying sepsis
   2.  Septic shock
 Pt has largely resolved fevers and WBC count stable
   between 9 -10.  Source of sepsis likely E. Coli bactermia sensitive to
   ceftriaxone.  All other stool studies negative; cholangitis and SBP
   unlikely.
   - Off pressors
   - On ceftriaxone yesterday as per ID recs: likely will need 2 wk course
   from date of first negative blood culture.  (ID signed off)
   -holding nadolol, spirinolactone.  Restart as pt improves and as BP
   tolerates
   - GI following
   3.  Thrombocytopenia/Elevated Coags -  At admission had low platelets
   likely secondary to cirrhosis (low thrombopoetin, portal HTN, splenic
   sequestration).  Platelets are stable in 30s.  Fibrinogen, FDP, coags
   had been stable and not rising and does not appear to be actively
   bleeding.  Blood smear shows no microangiopathic changes which further
   argues against DIC.  Rather than DIC could be secondary to acute
   worsening of liver disease in setting of sepsis.
   -Can check daily coags, platelets; no need to follow FDP or fibrinogen
   -Continue to treat underlying cause  (sepsis)
   4.  Oliguria:  UOP has improved to 50cc/hr.  UOP is responsive to
   fluids.
   -  Watch I/O's
   - Diuresis as BP allows.
   - PM lytes
   5.  Bright red blood per rectum: HCTs have been stable over last three
   days.
   -Maintain active type + screen
   -Follow daily HCTs
   -transfuse if HCT falls below 21
   -IV PPI 40 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   6.  Metabolic Acidosis
 Lactic acid levels have improved with
   treatment of bacteremia.
   7.  Cryptogenic cirrhosis
   -Holding nadolol, spirinolactone in setting of low BP

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old lady with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and previous variceal bleeding, presenting with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea, and signs of septic shock. She has respiratory failure requiring intubation, impaired skin integrity, gastrointestinal bleed, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. Her current vital signs show tachycardia, stable blood pressure, and normal oxygen saturation. She is on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Fluid balance shows an input-output mismatch with significant fluid administration and positive fluid balance. Laboratory results indicate elevated WBC count, stable platelets, normal liver function tests, and metabolic acidosis that has resolved. Imaging and microbiology reports are unremarkable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but barriers to extubation include reduced mental status, resolving sepsis, and pulmonary edema. Diuretics may be needed to improve pulmonary edema.
2. Sepsis: The patient has resolved fevers, and the WBC count is stable. E. Coli bacteremia sensitive to ceftriaxone is the likely source of sepsis. Ceftriaxone should be continued for a 2-week course from the date of the first negative blood culture.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female admitted with gastrointestinal bleed in the setting of cirrhosis, E.coli sepsis, and respiratory failure in the setting of large volume resuscitation. The patient's conditions include sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and gastrointestinal bleed.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has E.coli sepsis, which is a serious infection that can lead to organ dysfunction if not properly managed.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to her large volume resuscitation. This can be a result of fluid overload and compromised lung function.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to factors such as immobility, pressure from medical devices, or poor perfusion. This can increase the risk of pressure ulcers or infections.

4. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a lower gastrointestinal bleed, which can lead to significant blood loss and compromise the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable thrombocytopenia, which is a decrease in platelet count. This increases the risk of bleeding complications.

6. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's cirrhosis, there is a possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old lady w/ PMhx of cryptogenic cirrhosis cx by varices with
   MELD score of 17, who has chronic total bilirubin of 2.0 and INR of 1.8
   to 2.0 presents with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea and
   apparent septic shock
   1.  Respiratory Failure:  Intially intubated due to increased WOB in
   setting of pulmonary edema.  Currently on FiO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5.
   Lactate levels falling and metabolic acidosis resolved, improving her
   respiratory status also.   Barriers to extubation:  reduced mental
   status, resolving sepsis, pulmonary edema
   -Diurese as BP tolerates to improve pulmonary edema
   -Of sedation, avoid medications that may affect mental status
   -switch to pressure support
   - diuresis as BP tolerates
   -Continue tx of underlying sepsis
   2.  Septic shock
 Pt has largely resolved fevers; although WBC count
   has increased to 15 O/N.  Source of sepsis likely E. Coli bactermia
   sensitive to ceftriaxone.  All other stool studies negative;
   cholangitis and SBP unlikely.
   -F/u Bcxs, repeat Ucx
   - Off pressors
   - On ceftriaxone yesterday as per ID recs: likely will need 2 wk course
   from date of first negative blood culture.  (ID signed off)
   -holding nadolol, spirinolactone.  Restart as pt improves and as BP
   tolerates
   - GI following
   3.  Thrombocytopenia/Elevated Coags -  At admission had low platelets
   likely secondary to cirrhosis (low thrombopoetin, portal HTN, splenic
   sequestration).  Platelets are stable in 30s.  Fibrinogen, FDP, coags
   had been stable and not rising and does not appear to be actively
   bleeding.  Blood smear shows no microangiopathic changes which further
   argues against DIC.  Rather than DIC could be secondary to acute
   worsening of liver disease in setting of sepsis.
   -Can check daily coags, platelets; no need to follow FDP or fibrinogen
   -Continue to treat underlying cause  (sepsis)
   4.  Oliguria:  UOP has improved to 75cc/hr.  UOP is responsive to
   fluids.
   -  Watch I/O's
   - Diuresis as BP allows.
   - PM lytes
   5.  Bright red blood per rectum: HCTs have been stable over last three
   days.
   -Maintain active type + screen
   -Follow daily HCTs
   -transfuse if HCT falls below 21
   -IV PPI 40 mg [**Hospital1 7**]

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, who presented with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea, and apparent septic shock. She was initially intubated due to increased work of breathing in the setting of pulmonary edema. Currently, she is on supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. Her respiratory status is improving, but she remains at high risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and extubation failure. 

She has resolved her fevers and metabolic acidosis, indicating improvement in septic shock. The source of sepsis is likely E. coli bacteremia, which is sensitive to ceftriaxone. The patient is being treated with a two-week course of ceftriaxone following ID recommendations. 

Her thrombocytopenia and elevated coagulation studies are likely secondary to her cirrhosis. The platelet count is stable in the 30s, and there are no signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The patient's oliguria has improved, and her blood pressure is stable. She is being closely monitored for any changes in her I/O's, and diuresis is planned as her blood pressure allows. 

Her hemoglobin levels have been stable over the last three days, so there is no"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints include septic shock, respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, who was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding. She has developed E. coli sepsis and respiratory failure after receiving a large volume of resuscitation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition. It is essential to continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy to treat the E. coli infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The main barrier to extubation is the patient's mental status. As she starts to move spontaneously and respond to noxious stimuli, the possibility of weaning off mechanical ventilation may increase. Positive pressure ventilation (PPSV) is being continued.

3. Gastrointestinal Bleed: The patient has lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is being administered intravenously. Her hemoglobin concentration is stable, so the bleeding appears to be under control for now.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, but it is stable. Monitoring of platelet levels will be continued.

Other issues mentioned in the progress note include electrolyte and fluid disorders, impaired skin integrity, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient is receiving"

   setting of pulmonary edema.  Currently on pressure support with FiO2 of
   40%, PEEP of 10.  Lactate levels falling and metabolic acidosis
   resolved, improving her respiratory status also.   Barriers to
   extubation continue to be:  reduced mental status, resolving sepsis,
   pulmonary edema
   -Continue to hold sedation, now has been 4 days.  Mental status
   continues to improve
   -Tolerating pressure support with gases of 7.54, 35, 72;
   -Recheck gas this AM:  if PaO2 has improved > 80 can consider weaning
   down further on Peep to 5
   -Continue tx of underlying sepsis
   -Restart home nadolol; would hold on spirinolactone and lasix given
   worsening creatinine and BUN over past several days; likely prerenal
   etiology.
   .
   2.  Sepsis
 Pt has increasing WBC count to 19.7.   Has been
   afebrile.   Source of prior sepsis likely E. Coli bacteremia but
   unclear why leukocytosis is worsening.  Repeat UA from yesterday shows
   pyuria, urine culture is pending.  All other cultures including stool
   studies negative; cholangitis and SBP unlikely.
   -F/u Bcxs, repeat Ucx; could have new ventilator acquired PNA; obtain
   CXR today, send sputum cxs if secretions
   -Off pressors
   -On ceftriaxone yesterday as per ID recs: likely will need 2 wk course
   from date of first negative blood culture.  (ID signed off)
   3.  Hypertension - BPs were mostly in the 150s - 170s; got labetalol IV
   5 mg X 2 yesterday.
   -Restarting home nadolol, holding spirinolactone and lasix
   -Can give labetalol IV to keep SBP < 160
   4.  Thrombocytopenia/Elevated Coags -  At admission had low platelets
   likely secondary to cirrhosis (low thrombopoetin, portal HTN, splenic
   sequestration).  Platelets are stable in 30s to 50s.  Fibrinogen, FDP,
   coags had been stable and not rising and does not appear to be actively
   bleeding.  Blood smear shows no microangiopathic changes which further
   argues against DIC.  Rather than DIC could be secondary to acute
   worsening of liver disease in setting of sepsis.
   -Can check daily coags, platelets; no need to follow FDP or fibrinogen
   -Continue to treat underlying cause  (sepsis)
   5.  Oliguria:  UOP responded yesterday to lasix boluses but drops off
   when lasix stopped.  Creatinine and BUN have also been slowly trending
   up:  Cr went from 0.7 to 1.1, likely secondary to prerenal etiology.
   - Would obtain urine electrolytes
   - Hold off on diuresis (was -1 L yesterday and could be becoming
   intravascularly dry)
   - Watch Is and Os today; if continues to be oliguric . . .
   6.  Bright red blood per rectum: HCTs have been stable over last three
   days.
   -Maintain active type + screen
   -Follow daily HCTs
   -transfuse if HCT falls below 21
   -IV PPI 40 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   7.  Metabolic Acidosis
 Lactic acid levels have improved with
   treatment of bacteremia.
   8.  Cryptogenic cirrhosis
   -Restarting nadolol; continue spirinolactone and lasix.
   9. FEN:  Started on TF three days ago.  Repleting electrolytes as
   necessary.
   10.  Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, IV PPI

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old lady with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis who presented with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea, and apparent septic shock. She was initially intubated due to increased work of breathing in the setting of pulmonary edema and is currently on pressure support with FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 10. Her respiratory status has been improving, with falling lactate levels and resolution of metabolic acidosis.

The patient's mental status continues to improve as she has been off sedation for over 3 days. However, barriers to extubation include reduced mental status, resolving sepsis, and pulmonary edema. She is tolerating pressure support well, and her gases show a PaO2 of 180.

The patient has increasing white blood cell count to 19.7, indicating a possible worsening of sepsis. Her urine culture is pending, and she has pyuria on repeat urinalysis. All other cultures, including stool studies, are negative, making cholangitis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis unlikely.

The patient's blood pressure has been mostly in the 150s-170s, and she received IV labetalol to control it. She will restart home nadolol but will hold spirinolactone and lasix due to worsening creatinine and BUN, likely secondary to prerenal etiology.

   MELD score of 17, who has chronic total bilirubin of 2.0 and INR of 1.8
   to 2.0 presents with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea and
   apparent septic shock
   1.  Sepsis
 Pt has increasing WBC count to 19.7.   Has been
   afebrile.   Source of prior sepsis likely E. Coli bacteremia but
   unclear why leukocytosis is worsening.  Repeat UA from yesterday shows
   pyuria, urine culture is pending.  All other cultures including stool
   studies negative; cholangitis and SBP unlikely.
   -F/u Bcxs, repeat Ucx; could have new ventilator acquired PNA; obtain
   CXR today, send sputum cxs if secretions
   -Off pressors
   -CT abdomen to eval for new infectious etiology given rising WBC count
   -given mental status change, would obtain CT head
   -On ceftriaxone day 3 as per ID recs: likely will need 2 wk course from
   date of first negative blood culture.  (ID signed off)
   2.  Respiratory Failure:  Desatted this AM, unclear etiology could have
   underlying VAP given increased secretions.
   -Obtain CXR
   -Maintain on current settings, recheck gas this PM; if improved with
   PaO2 > 80 can consider weaning down on FiO2
   -Continue tx of underlying sepsis
   3.  Hypertension - BPs were mostly in the 150s - 170s; got labetalol IV
   5 mg X 2 yesterday.
   -Would continue to hold nadolol, sprininolactone, lasix in setting of
   rising creatinine
   -Give labetalol PRN SBP > 160
   4.  Thrombocytopenia/Elevated Coags -  At admission had low platelets

   when lasix stopped.  Creatinine and BUN have also been slowly trending
   up:  Cr went from 0.7 to 1.1, likely secondary to prerenal etiology.
   - Would obtain urine electrolytes
   - Hold off on diuresis (was -1 L yesterday and could be becoming
   intravascularly dry)
   - Watch Is and Os today; could even consider giving some fluids if
   urine output continues to be low.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, who presented with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea, and apparent septic shock. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, respiratory failure, hypertension, thrombocytopenia/elevated coagulation, oliguria, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/79 mmHg to 188/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.7 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels from 0.7 to 1.1 mg/dL, and thrombocytopenia with platelet counts ranging from 34 to 50 K/uL. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, vasopressors, diuretics, and others.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old lady w/ PMhx of cryptogenic cirrhosis cx by varices with
   MELD score of 17, who has chronic total bilirubin of 2.0 and INR of 1.8
   to 2.0 presents with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea and
   apparent septic shock
   #  Sepsis
 Pt has increasing WBC count to 21.5.   Has been afebrile
   >24hr.   Source of prior sepsis likely E. Coli bacteremia but unclear
   why leukocytosis is worsening.  Repeat UA shows pyuria, urine culture
   is pending.  All other cultures including stool studies negative;
   cholangitis unlikely.  Given AMS and leukocytosis, concern for SBP
   - Diagnostic paracentesis
   -F/u Bcxs, repeat Ucx; could have new ventilator acquired PNA;
   -Sputum studies sent
   -Off pressors
   -CT abdomen to eval for new infectious etiology given rising WBC count
   pending
   -On ceftriaxone day 4 as per ID recs: likely will need 2 wk course from
   date of first negative blood culture, but will start zosyn/vanc and re
   consult ID
   - Stool for c.diff
   # [**Name (NI) 10704**] unclear etiology, sedation weaned, continues to have poor neuro
   exam.  Likely toxic/metabolic from liver failure, sepsis, also consider
   ischemia/hemorrhage.
   -given mental status change, obtained CT head- nothing acute
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Maintained sats, improving  secretions.
   - CXR with bilateral lung collapse
   - optimize vent settings, increase PEEP
   - continue to monitor gases; if improved with PaO2 72 yesterday pm,
   pending this am if PaO2 > 80 can consider weaning down on FiO2
   - Continue tx of underlying sepsis
   - f/u records to determine if PE was considered
   - pull back ET tube
   # Hypertension - BPs were mostly in the 150s - 170s; got labetalol IV 5
   mg X 1 this am.
   -Would continue to hold nadolol, sprininolactone, lasix in setting of
   rising creatinine
   -Give labetalol PRN SBP > 160
   #  Thrombocytopenia/Elevated Coags -  At admission had low platelets
   likely secondary to cirrhosis (low thrombopoetin, portal HTN, splenic
   sequestration).  Platelets are stable in 30s to 50s.  Fibrinogen, FDP,
   coags had been stable and not rising and does not appear to be actively
   bleeding.  Blood smear shows no microangiopathic changes which further
   argues against DIC.  Rather than DIC could be secondary to acute
   worsening of liver disease in setting of sepsis.
   -Can check daily coags, platelets; no need to follow FDP or fibrinogen
   -Continue to treat underlying cause  (sepsis)
   #  Oliguria:  UOP responds to lasix, given x1. UOP drops off when lasix
   stopped.  However reatinine and BUN have also been slowly trending up:
   Cr went from 0.7 to 1.1 to 1.2, likely secondary to prerenal etiology
   also concern for hepatorenal syndrome.
   - Give albumin 50 and monitor UOP for response
   - Urine electrolytes, UNa <10, UCr 130, UOsm 475, send urine sediment
   - Hold off on diuresis to avoid becoming intravascularly dry, however
   can consider lasix gtt
   - Monitor  Is and Os today; could even consider giving some fluids if
   urine output continues to be low.
   #  Cryptogenic cirrhosis: LFTs increasing, TBili 6.9
   - RUQ u/s for signs of obstruction
   - Hemolysis labs
   -Holding nadolol; continue spirinolactone and lasix.
   #  Bright red blood per rectum: HCTs have been stable over last 4
   days.
   -Maintain active type + screen
   -Follow daily HCTs
   -transfuse if HCT falls below 21
   -IV PPI 40 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
    # Metabolic Acidosis
 Lactic acid levels have improved with treatment
   of bacteremia.
   # FEN:  Started on TF three days ago.  Repleting electrolytes as
   necessary.
   # Access: L IJ
   -pull back line, it is in azygous vein
   #  Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, IV PPI
   -d/c SQ heparin
   #  Code Status: Full (confirmed with family)

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old lady w/ PMhx of cryptogenic cirrhosis cx by varices with
   MELD score of 17, who has chronic total bilirubin of 2.0 and INR of 1.8
   to 2.0 presents with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea and
   apparent septic shock
   #  Sepsis
 Pt has increasing WBC count to 21.5.   Has been afebrile.
    Source of prior sepsis likely E. Coli bacteremia but unclear why
   leukocytosis is worsening.  Repeat UA shows pyuria, urine culture is
   pending.  All other cultures including stool studies negative;
   cholangitis and SBP unlikely.
   -F/u Bcxs, repeat Ucx; could have new ventilator acquired PNA;
   -Sputum studies sent
   -Off pressors
   -CT abdomen to eval for new infectious etiology given rising WBC count
   pending
   -given mental status change, would obtain CT head- nothing acute
   -On ceftriaxone day 4 as per ID recs: likely will need 2 wk course from
   date of first negative blood culture, but will start zosyn/vanc and re
   consult ID
   - RUQ ultrasound
   - Diagnostic paracentesis
   - Stool for c.diff
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Maintained sats, increased secretions.
   -Obtain CXR
   -Maintain on current settings, continue to monitor gases; if improved
   with PaO2 72 yesterday pm, pending this am if PaO2 > 80 can consider
   weaning down on FiO2
   -Continue tx of underlying sepsis
   # Hypertension - BPs were mostly in the 150s - 170s; got labetalol IV 5
   mg X 1 this am.
   -Would continue to hold nadolol, sprininolactone, lasix in setting of
   rising creatinine
   -Give labetalol PRN SBP > 160
   #  Thrombocytopenia/Elevated Coags -  At admission had low platelets
   likely secondary to cirrhosis (low thrombopoetin, portal HTN, splenic
   sequestration).  Platelets are stable in 30s to 50s.  Fibrinogen, FDP,
   coags had been stable and not rising and does not appear to be actively
   bleeding.  Blood smear shows no microangiopathic changes which further
   argues against DIC.  Rather than DIC could be secondary to acute
   worsening of liver disease in setting of sepsis.
   -Can check daily coags, platelets; no need to follow FDP or fibrinogen
   -Continue to treat underlying cause  (sepsis)
   #  Oliguria:  UOP responds to lasix, given x1. UOP drops off when lasix
   stopped.  Creatinine and BUN have also been slowly trending up:  Cr
   went from 0.7 to 1.1 to 1.2, likely secondary to prerenal etiology.
   - Urine electrolytes, UNa <10, UCr 130, UOsm 475
   - Hold off on diuresis to avoid becoming intravascularly dry
   - Monitor  Is and Os today; could even consider giving some fluids if
   urine output continues to be low.
   #  Bright red blood per rectum: HCTs have been stable over last 4
   days.
   -Maintain active type + screen
   -Follow daily HCTs
   -transfuse if HCT falls below 21
   -IV PPI 40 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
    # Metabolic Acidosis
 Lactic acid levels have improved with treatment
   of bacteremia.
   #  Cryptogenic cirrhosis
   -Restarting nadolol; continue spirinolactone and lasix.
   # FEN:  Started on TF three days ago.  Repleting electrolytes as
   necessary.
   #  Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, IV PPI
   #  Code Status: Full (confirmed with family)
   #.  Communication - husband, children

   -On ceftriaxone day 4 as per ID recs: likely will need 2 wk course from
   date of first negative blood culture.  (ID signed off)
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Maintained sats, increased secretions.
   -Obtain CXR
   -Maintain on current settings, continue to monitor gases; if improved
   with PaO2 72 yesterday pm, pending this am if PaO2 > 80 can consider
   weaning down on FiO2
   -Continue tx of underlying sepsis
   # Hypertension - BPs were mostly in the 150s - 170s; got labetalol IV 5
   mg X 1 this am.
   -Would continue to hold nadolol, sprininolactone, lasix in setting of
   rising creatinine
   -Give labetalol PRN SBP > 160
   #  Thrombocytopenia/Elevated Coags -  At admission had low platelets
   likely secondary to cirrhosis (low thrombopoetin, portal HTN, splenic
   sequestration).  Platelets are stable in 30s to 50s.  Fibrinogen, FDP,
   coags had been stable and not rising and does not appear to be actively
   bleeding.  Blood smear shows no microangiopathic changes which further
   argues against DIC.  Rather than DIC could be secondary to acute
   worsening of liver disease in setting of sepsis.
   -Can check daily coags, platelets; no need to follow FDP or fibrinogen
   -Continue to treat underlying cause  (sepsis)
   #  Oliguria:  UOP responds to lasix, given x1. UOP drops off when lasix
   stopped.  Creatinine and BUN have also been slowly trending up:  Cr
   went from 0.7 to 1.1 to 1.2, likely secondary to prerenal etiology.
   - Urine electrolytes, UNa <10, UCr 130, UOsm 475
   - Hold off on diuresis to avoid becoming intravascularly dry
   - Monitor  Is and Os today; could even consider giving some fluids if
   urine output continues to be low.
   #  Bright red blood per rectum: HCTs have been stable over last 4
   days.
   -Maintain active type + screen
   -Follow daily HCTs

    # Metabolic Acidosis
 Lactic acid levels have improved with treatment
   of bacteremia.
   #  Cryptogenic cirrhosis
   -Restarting nadolol; continue spirinolactone and lasix.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and previous variceal bleeding. She presents with symptoms of sepsis, including fever, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple complications, including respiratory failure, hypertension, thrombocytopenia with elevated coagulation parameters, oliguria, bright red blood per rectum, and metabolic acidosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are:

1. Sepsis: The patient's worsening white blood cell count and fever suggest ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis. It is important to continue treatment with antibiotics and monitor for any signs of organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's increased secretions and low oxygen saturation indicate respiratory distress. Maintaining current ventilator settings and obtaining a chest X-ray are necessary to evaluate for new infectious etiology or ventilator-associated pneumonia.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings in the 150s-170s suggest uncontrolled hypertension. Continuing to hold certain medications and giving labetalol as needed for blood pressure above 160 are recommended.

4. Thrombocytopenia/Elevated Coags: The patient's low platelets are likely secondary to cirrhosis. Daily monitoring of coagulation parameters and platelets is advised. Treating the underlying cause of sepsis is crucial.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU with gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, and respiratory failure. The patient has experienced a significant blood loss leading to anemia and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She also has impaired skin integrity and altered mental status due to liver failure. The patient's condition remains critical, and she requires ongoing intensive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially had E. coli sepsis, which has since resolved, but there is a risk of developing secondary infections due to the invasive procedures and immobility.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate further if the volume loss continues or if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: There is a risk of re-bleeding or continued blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract, which can lead to further anemia and hypotension.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate potential renal impairment, which can be exacerbated by fluid overload or inadequate renal perfusion.
5. Liver Failure: The patient's deteriorating liver function may result in worsening encephalopathy and coagulopathy, increasing the risk of bleeding and infection.
6. Pressure Ulcers: Prolonged immobility and impaired skin integrity increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can be difficult to manage in critically ill patients"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old lady with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and previous variceal bleeding. She presented with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea, and apparent septic shock. Her MELD score was initially 17 but has now increased to 30 due to worsening liver function. She has been treated with various antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and flagyl, for suspected infections. Her blood cultures are pending. The patient's respiratory status has improved with increased PEEP and FiO2. She is still on mechanical ventilation. Her blood pressure remains high despite receiving labetalol. Her urine output has improved with albumin administration but her creatinine and BUN levels are rising, indicating possible prerenal azotemia or hepatorenal syndrome. Her platelet count remains low but stable. She has evidence of portal hypertension and splenomegaly on imaging. Her hemoglobin levels are decreasing, possibly due to hemolysis. She has thrombocytopenia but no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Her liver enzymes are elevated, and she has increased total bilirubin. Her MELD score is now 30, indicating a high urgency for liver transplantation. She has a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and is currently on total parenteral nutrition (TF)."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old lady with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and previous variceal bleeding. She has a MELD score of 17, indicating severe liver disease. She presents with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea, and apparent septic shock. Her initial labs show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and coagulopathy. Imaging studies reveal cirrhotic liver, moderate ascites, cholelithiasis, mild splenomegaly, and portal hypertension. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and has had a diagnostic paracentesis attempted. Cultures are pending. She is also experiencing respiratory failure, hypertension, oliguria, decreased hematocrit, thrombocytopenia, and elevated coagulation parameters. Her MELD score has been recalculated to 30, indicating a high urgency for liver transplantation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and previous varices, presenting with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea, and apparent septic shock. The patient has had several medical complications, including respiratory failure, decreased Hct (hematocrit), oliguria (low urine output), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and elevated coagulation factors. The patient's condition has been improving, but there are still concerns regarding potential medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with signs of septic shock, and although the infection seems to be improving, it is important to continue monitoring and treating any remaining infection sources.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still on mechanical ventilation, and there is a concern for worsening respiratory failure due to effusions and moderate ascites.
3. Decreased Hct: The patient's Hct is decreasing, which could be due to hemorrhage, hemolysis, or hepatorenal syndrome. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
4. Oliguria: The patient's urine output has improved with albumin administration, but there is a concern for prerenal etiology or hepatorenal syndrome. Monitoring of urine output and electrolytes is necessary.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which is likely secondary to cirrhosis"

The patient has been treated for sepsis with antibiotics (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl) and shows clinical improvement.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, with maintained oxygen saturation levels and improving secretions. Ventilator settings are being weaned as tolerated.

There is a decrease in hemoglobin concentration (Hct), which is trending down at 22.4%. This could be due to hemolysis or TTP, as indicated by low haptoglobin levels and an increase in direct bilirubin. The cause of Hct drop is unclear, and a repeat peripheral smear is negative.

The patient has hypertension, with blood pressures mostly in the 150s-170s. Labetalol has been started, and the goal is to keep systolic blood pressure below 160.

Oliguria is present, but urine output has improved with albumin administration. Creatinine and BUN levels are improving, likely secondary to prerenal etiology or hepatorenal syndrome.

The patient's mental status has improved, and she is now interactive and moving all extremities. Sedation"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis who was admitted with gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of cirrhosis, E.coli sepsis, and respiratory failure due to large volume resuscitation. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) as indicated by the presence of fever and elevated white blood cell count. The prescribed treatment includes continuing vancomycin and adding zosyn for fevers. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, indicating a positive response to the antibiotics.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation support and is tolerating pressure-controlled assisted ventilation (PSV). Efforts are being made to wean off fluid, but large effusions are currently limiting this process. Close monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

3. GI Bleed: Despite the initiation of treatment for the GI bleed, no source has been identified, and the patient's hemoglobin levels continue to fall. The absence of bloody stools suggests that the bleeding may have stopped or is minimal. Further evaluation, such as a CT scan of the abdomen, may be required to identify the source of the bleed.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's creat"

   57 year old lady w/ PMhx of cryptogenic cirrhosis cx by varices with
   MELD score of 17, who has chronic total bilirubin of 2.0 and INR of 1.8
   to 2.0 presents with bright red blood per rectum, fevers, diarrhea and
   apparent septic shock
   #  Sepsis
 Pt with stable WBC, afebrile.   Paracentesis with ANC 247,
   Gram stain negative, culture negative currently, still likely SBP.
   Abx: vanc/zosyn/flagyl day 4.  Source of prior sepsis likely E. Coli
   bacteremia.  Repeat Cx: negative stool  remainder pending.  All other
   cultures to date including stool studies negative. Cholangitis unlikely
   given negative u/s and CT.
   - Clinical improvement, off pressors, flagyl, vanc and zosyn
   - F/u ID recs
   - F/u Bcxs, repeat Ucx; could have new ventilator acquired PNA;
   #  Respiratory Failure:  Maintained sats, improving  secretions.
   Alkalosis, PEEP decreased yesterday, tolerated PSV for longer.  Likely
   worsened by effusions and moderate ascites.
   - Wean vent settings as tolerated
   - continue to monitor gases
   - Continue tx of underlying sepsis and encourage UOP as discussed below
   # Decreased Hct- trending down now stable, trace heme positive, CT
   negative, unclear etiology. concern for hemolysis/TTP given hapto <20,
   TBili 8.9-> 10.4 (Direct 4.5), repeat peripheral smear negative
   - No comment on hemorrhage during u/s for paracentesis
   - Consider Repeat CT abd with contrast if hct drops futher, premedicate
   for renal protection
   - Trend hct, [**Hospital1 7**]
   - active T&S
   # Hypertension - BPs were mostly in the 150s - 170s; labetolol 100mg
   PO, no IV needed
   -Give labetalol PRN SBP > 160
   #  Oliguria:  UOP 55cc/hr  improved with albumin, now given [**Hospital1 7**].
   However creatinine and BUN improving:  Cr 1.0 , likely secondary to
   prerenal etiology also concern for hepatorenal
   - Urine electrolytes, UNa <10, UCr 130, UOsm 475
   - Continue albumin and monitoring of UOP
   - Trial Lasix gtt to encourage UOP goal 100/hr- 40cc bolus, 2-15/hr
   (home dose 120, 80)
   # [**Name (NI) 10704**] unclear etiology, sedation weaned, improving metal status, now
   interacitve, moving all extremities.  Likely toxic/metabolic from liver
   failure, sepsis, also consider ischemia/hemorrhage.
   - CT head- nothing acute
   - given improvement, continue to monitor
   #  Thrombocytopenia/Elevated Coags -  At admission had low platelets
   likely secondary to cirrhosis (low thrombopoetin, portal HTN, splenic
   sequestration).  Platelets are stable in 30s to 50s.  INR improved 3.8
   -> 2.8 with Vitamin K and FFP for procedure.
   -Can check daily coags, platelets; no need to follow FDP or fibrinogen
   -Continue to treat underlying cause  (sepsis)
   #  Cryptogenic cirrhosis: LFTs increasing, TBili rising, MELD
   recalculated to 30
   - 24hr Urine copper for Wilsons
   - RUQ u/s negative for obstruction but with reverse flow
   - Holding nadolol, spirinolactone and lasix.
   - Follow Liver recs
   #  Bright red blood per rectum: heme positive but no gross bleeding
   -Maintain active type + screen

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old lady with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, who initially presented with bloody diarrhea and fevers. She developed apparent septic shock from E. coli bacteremia and respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple conditions, including sepsis, respiratory failure, decreased hematocrit, oliguria, hypertension, mental status changes, coagulopathy, and cryptogenic cirrhosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Wilson's disease: The patient has not been tested for Wilson's disease, which is a condition that can cause liver damage and neurological symptoms. A 24-hour urine copper test may be needed to rule out this condition.

2. Variceal bleed: The patient has a history of varices, which are enlarged veins in the esophagus or stomach that can bleed. If the patient experiences any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as hematemesis (vomiting blood) or melena (black, tarry stools), immediate medical attention is required.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: This is a condition characterized by mental status changes due to liver dysfunction. The patient's mental status has been improving, but ongoing monitoring is necessary.

4. Renal failure: The patient's urine output has been low, and there has been a decrease in hemoglobin concentration. Close monitoring of kidney function and ongoing efforts to improve urine output are important.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with cryptogenic cirrhosis who was admitted with gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of cirrhosis, E.coli sepsis, and respiratory failure after a large volume resuscitation.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently on piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for sepsis. The sepsis is caused by an E.coli infection. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is within normal range, indicating that the infection has been controlled.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Large effusions and volume overload are the main barriers to extubation. Lasix will be started to address this issue, but the patient's electrolytes need to be closely monitored.

3. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of GI bleed in the setting of cirrhosis. Her hematocrit (Hct) level is stable since yesterday. Gastric lavage will continue to be performed to identify any ongoing bleeding. An endoscopy will be needed for further evaluation of varices.

4. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing renal failure. Diuretic therapy will be restarted as it is the main barrier to extubation. Close monitoring of electrolytes is required.

5. Diminished Mental Status: The patient"

   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to underlying congestive heart
   failure.  Maintaining saturations at FiO2 40% and PEEP of 5 despite
   congestion and secretions.  Is +25 L.
   - Continue to wean ventilator settings: attempt to transition to
   pressure support.
   - Diuresis goal: 100 cc/hr of urine:  increase lasix to 10 cc/hr now
   regardless of Creatinine: follow Is and Os; if not responsive, increase
   lasix further to max of 15/hr.  Can give one-time diuril.  If not at
   goal of -2 L today, consult renal tomorrow re: possibility of CVVH.
   .
   # Decreased Hct- trending down now stable, trace heme positive with h/o
   varices, Differential: hemolysis vs GI bleed.   Hemolysis less likely
   given absence of schistocytes on smear.  GI Bleed more likely given
   trace + guiaic; sources could include known hx of esophageal varices
   (2+ on EGD from [**2124**]), portal gastropathy, ulcer disease, AVMs.  B/c
   not fast bleed and no frank blood, diverticula less likely.
   - HCTs [**Hospital1 7**]
   -Guiaic all stools
   -Active type and screen
   -If acute drop in HCT, call GI for possible endoscopy.
   -Follow up Coomb's test
   #  Oliguria:  UOP 55cc/hr  improved with [**Hospital1 7**] albumin, Cr stable at 1.0,
   BUN remains elevated
   - Continue albumin and monitoring of UOP
   - Continue Lasix gtt with UOP goal 100 cc/hr (between 2-15 cc/hr of
   lasix) (on home Lasix dose 120, 80)
   - PM lytes
   #Hypernatremia
   -Increase free water flushes 200 ml q4
   -Check PM sodium

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 57-year-old lady with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, who initially presented with bloody diarrhea and fevers. She then developed apparent septic shock from E. coli bacteremia and respiratory failure.
- The patient's current assessment includes sepsis, likely secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), congestive heart failure (CHF), respiratory failure, decreased hematocrit (Hct), oliguria, hypernatremia, hypertension, coagulopathy, and cryptogenic cirrhosis.
- The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics (Zosyn), diuretics (Lasix), pressors, ventilator support, and fluid restriction.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count (Plt), bilirubin levels (TBili), liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and lactate levels, but stable creatinine (Cr) and blood glucose levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old lady w/ PMhx of cryptogenic cirrhosis cx by varices
   initially presended with bloody diarrhea and fevers, developed apparent
   septic shock from E Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure.
   # Sepsis
 Pt with stable WBC, afebrile.   Likely SPB given
   paracentesis with ANC 247, Gram stain negative, culture negative
   currently, Abx: zosyn day 5.  Stool cultures negative for c. diff,
   blood and urine pending.  All other cultures to date including stool
   studies negative. Cholangitis unlikely given negative u/s and CT
   ([**10-7**]).  Clinical improvement, off pressors.
   - ID: , cont Zosyn on day 5 to complete 7 day course, ppx with Cipro
   750mg qweek lifelong.
   - F/u repeat cxs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to underlying congestive heart
   failure.  Maintaining saturations at FiO2 40% and PEEP of 5 despite
   congestion and secretions.  Is +25 L.
   - Continue to wean ventilator settings: attempt to transition to
   pressure support.
   - Diuresis goal: -500 ccs to -1 L: creatinine may elevate but continue
   to push diuresis - continue lasix drip at 6 cc/hr and follow I's and Os
   throughout day; adjust accordingly.
   .
   # Decreased Hct- trending down now stable, trace heme positive with h/o
   varices, Differential: hemolysis vs GI bleed.   Hemolysis less likely
   given absence of schistocytes on smear.  GI Bleed more likely given
   trace + guiaic; sources could include known hx of esophageal varices
   (2+ on EGD from [**2124**]), portal gastropathy, ulcer disease, AVMs.  B/c
   not fast bleed and no frank blood, diverticula less likely.
   - HCTs [**Hospital1 7**]
   -Guiaic all stools
   -Active type and screen
   -If acute drop in HCT, call GI for possible endoscopy.
   -Follow up Coomb's test
   #  Oliguria:  UOP 55cc/hr  improved with [**Hospital1 7**] albumin, Cr stable at 1.0,
   BUN remains elevated
   - Continue albumin and monitoring of UOP
   - Continue Lasix gtt with UOP goal 100 cc/hr (between 2-15 cc/hr of
   lasix) (on home Lasix dose 120, 80)
   - PM lytes
   #Hypernatremia
   -Increase free water flushes 200 ml q4
   -Check PM sodium
   # Hypertension - BPs were stable; no IV labetolol needed
   - Labetolol 100mg [**Hospital1 7**] PO
   - Give labetalol PRN SBP > 160
   # Coagulopathy -  Thrombocytopenia likely [**1-28**] cirrhosis, plts stable in
   30s to 60s.  INR stable s/p Vitamin K and FFP for procedure 2d ago.
   -Can check daily coags, platelets
   #  Cryptogenic cirrhosis: LFTs increasing, TBili rising, MELD
   recalculated to 30. Has had o/p workup prior to admission, but no
   testing for Wilsons disease.  Has had negative RUQ u/s for obstruction
   - F/u 24hr Urine copper
   - Holding home nadolol and spirinolactone
   - Follow Liver recs
   # FEN:  Started on TF four days ago.  Repleting electrolytes as
   necessary.   Holding on giving fluids given congestion.
   # Access: L IJ
   #  Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, IV PPI
   #  Code Status: Full (confirmed with family)
   #.  Communication - husband, children

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old lady with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, presenting with bloody diarrhea and fevers, which led to apparent septic shock from E. coli bacteremia and respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several ongoing medical issues and plans.

1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) due to paracentesis with ANC 247, Gram stain negative, culture negative. She is being treated with Zosyn and will continue for a 7-day course. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and stool cultures are negative. Cholangitis is unlikely given negative ultrasound and CT.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure secondary to underlying congestive heart failure. She is maintaining saturations at FiO2 40% and PEEP of 5 despite congestion and secretions. She has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation.

3. Decreased Hct: The patient's hematocrit levels are decreasing, and there is a trace amount of heme-positive result with a history of varices. Hemolysis is less likely given the absence of schistocytes on smear. GI bleed is more likely given the trace + guaiac, which could be due to known esophageal varices, portal gastropathy, ulcer disease, or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old lady w/ PMhx of cryptogenic cirrhosis cx by varices
   initially presended with bloody diarrhea and fevers, developed apparent
   septic shock from E Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure.
   # Sepsis
 Pt with stable WBC, afebrile.   Likely SPB given
   paracentesis with ANC 247, Gram stain negative, culture negative
   currently, Abx: zosyn day 5.  Stool cultures negative for c. diff,
   blood and urine pending.  All other cultures to date including stool
   studies negative. Cholangitis unlikely given negative u/s and CT
   ([**10-7**]).  Clinical improvement, off pressors.
   - ID: , cont Zosyn on day 6 to complete 7 day course, then ppx with
   Cipro 750mg qweek lifelong.
   - F/u repeat cxs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to underlying congestive heart
   failure.  Maintaining saturations at FiO2 40% and PEEP of 8 despite
   congestion and secretions.  Is +24 L.    Barrier to extubation:
   pulmonary edema.
   -Continue to wean ventilator settings: attempt to decrease PEEP to 5.
   -Diuresis: was about 500 mL negative w/ lasix at 12 mg/hr (120 mg) and
   diuril X 2.  Creatinine holding steady this AM at 1.0.  Can push up
   lasix to 15 cc/hr and give diuril [**Hospital1 7**]; check lytes and Cr [**Hospital1 7**] and
   follow urine output with goal of -2 L today.
   .
   # Decreased Hct- trending down now stable, trace heme positive with h/o
   varices, Differential: hemolysis vs GI bleed.   Hemolysis less likely
   given absence of schistocytes on smear.  GI Bleed more likely given
   trace + guiaic; sources could include known hx of esophageal varices
   (2+ on EGD from [**2124**]), portal gastropathy, ulcer disease, AVMs.  B/c
   not fast bleed and no frank blood, diverticula less likely.
   - HCTs [**Hospital1 7**]
   -Guiaic all stools
   -Active type and screen
   -If acute drop in HCT, call GI for possible endoscopy.
   -Follow up Coomb's test
   #Hypernatremia
   -Currently getting free water flushes 200 q4.  Check PM lytes.  Give
   free water if necessary for Na > 150.
   # Hypertension - BPs were stable 130-150 systolic
   - Labetolol 100mg [**Hospital1 7**] PO
   - Give labetalol PRN SBP > 160
   # Coagulopathy -  Platelets, coags stable.
   -Can check daily coags, platelets
   #  Cryptogenic cirrhosis: LFTs increasing, TBili rising, MELD
   recalculated to 30. Has had o/p workup prior to admission, but no
   testing for Wilsons disease.  Has had negative RUQ u/s for obstruction
   - F/u 24hr Urine copper
   -Restart home nadolol
   -Continue to hold spirinolactone
   - Follow Liver recs
   # FEN:  Started on TF six days ago.  Repleting electrolytes as
   necessary.   Decreased TF volume yesterday.  Holding on giving fluids
   given congestion although may need to give free water for Na > 150.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old lady with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and previous presentation with bloody diarrhea and fevers. She developed apparent septic shock from E. coli bacteremia and respiratory failure. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including sepsis, respiratory failure, decreased hemoglobin concentration (Hct), hypernatremia, hypertension, coagulopathy, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. 

For sepsis, the patient is currently receiving antibiotic therapy with Zosyn. 

For respiratory failure, the patient's ventilator settings are being weaned, with attempts to decrease PEEP to 5. 

The patient's Hct has been trending down and is stable. There is a trace amount of heme positivity, which suggests possible gastrointestinal bleeding. 

Hypernatremia is being managed with free water flushes every 4 hours. 

Hypertension is being managed with labetalol 100mg PO and PRN administration if systolic blood pressure exceeds 160. 

Coagulopathy is being monitored with daily platelet counts and coagulation tests. 

Cryptogenic cirrhosis is being managed with follow-up liver recommendations, including restarting home nadolol, checking 24-hour urine copper levels, and holding spironolactone. 

The patient is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TF) and repleting electrolytes as necessary.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and previous presentation with bloody diarrhea and fevers. She developed apparent septic shock from E. coli bacteremia and respiratory failure. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period and has multiple medical complications. These include sepsis, likely secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), respiratory failure likely due to underlying congestive heart failure, hypernatremia, hypertension, coagulopathy, and complications related to her liver disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to SBP. She is currently being treated with antibiotics (Zosyn). It is important to monitor her vital signs and laboratory results closely to ensure that the infection is being appropriately managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to underlying congestive heart failure. It is crucial to maintain her oxygen saturation levels and continue weaning ventilator settings to decrease PEEP to 5 and FiO2 to 40%. Pulmonary edema is a barrier to extubation, so continued monitoring and management are necessary.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, with a sodium level above 150 mEq/L. Free water flushes have been increased to 200 mL every 4 hours. Sodium levels should be closely monitored,"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old lady w/ PMhx of cryptogenic cirrhosis cx by varices
   initially presended with bloody diarrhea and fevers, developed apparent
   septic shock from E Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure.
   # Sepsis
 Resolving:  afebrile, stable WBC, resolved mental status, no
   pressor requirement for several days.  Likely source of sepsis:  E Coli
   bacteremia w/probable translocation of gut.  Also has SBP.       Likely
   SPB given paracentesis with ANC 247, Gram stain negative, culture
   negative currently, Abx: zosyn day 5.  Stool cultures negative for c.
   diff, blood and urine pending.  All other cultures to date including
   stool studies negative. Cholangitis unlikely given negative u/s and CT
   ([**10-7**]).  Clinical improvement, off pressors.
   - Last day of zosyn today to cover SBP but still needs to finish course
   for E Coli bacteremia:  switch to ceftriaxone tomorrow and continue
   until [**10-18**].  Also start ppx with Cipro 750mg qweek lifelong.
   - F/u repeat cxs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Since midnight, has been on pressure support,
   maintaining good saturations at FiO2 40% and PEEP of 8. RSBI 58.
   Barrier to extubation: pulmonary edema (is 21 L positive).
   -Diuresis: was 3.5 L negative w/ lasix at 12 mg/hr (120 mg) and
   switched to 10 mg / hr O/N and recevied diuril X [**Hospital1 7**].  Creatinine
   yesterday AM was 1.3 and with continued diuresis, improved to 1.0 this
   AM.  Would continue lasix 10 cc/hr and continue diuril [**Hospital1 7**]; check lytes
   and Cr [**Hospital1 7**] and follow urine output with goal of -2 L.
   -This afternoon, wean PEEP down to 5 as tolerated.  Once doing well on
   PEEP of 5, can consider SBT.
   .
   #Hypernatremia - Likely secondary to diuresis.  Na rebounding up to 150
   despite free water flushes.
   -Would increase from 200 q4 to 250 q4.  Check PM lytes.  Give one-time
   free water bolus if necessary for Na > 150.
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  INR has increased from 2.4 to 5.0 over last five
   days.  PTT has also been increasing from 46 to 61.  Differential
   includes Vit K deficiency secondary to initiation of Zosyn course
   versus worsening hepatic function.  Vit K deficiency less likely since
   this should not affect PTT significantly, and pt has been receiving
   Vitamin K 10 mg PO over last three days.  Worsening of hepatic function
   supported by rising total bilirubin from 10 -> 20 over last five days.
   Causes of worsening hepatic function could be secondary to hepatic
   congestion given significant volume overload.  Recent US on [**10-8**]
   showed no obstruction and alk phos stable.
   -Continue Vit K 10 mg today and finish 3 day course tomorrow
   -Continue diuresis to reduce hepatic congestion
   -Touch base w/ liver whether they want further work-up, i.e. repeat of
   US.
   .
   # Hypertension - BPs were stable 130-150 systolic
   - Labetolol 100mg [**Hospital1 7**] PO
   - Give labetalol PRN SBP > 160
   .
   #  Cryptogenic cirrhosis: LFTs increasing, TBili rising, MELD
   recalculated to 30. Has had o/p workup prior to admission, but no
   testing for Wilsons disease.  Has had negative RUQ u/s for obstruction
   -Continue labetalol for HTN and variceal prophylaxis
   -Continue to hold spirinolactone given diuresis
   -F/u 24 hr copper
   -Follow Liver recs
   .
   # FEN:  On full tube feeds.  Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**].  Free water flushes
   increased; can give D5W bolus if Na > 150.
   # Access: L IJ
   #  Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, IV PPI
   #  Code Status: Full (confirmed with family)
   #.  Communication - husband, children

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old lady with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and previous varices. She presented with bloody diarrhea and fevers, developed apparent septic shock from E. coli bacteremia, and respiratory failure. She also has small bowel perforation (SBP) and pulmonary edema. The patient's current medications include lasix, labetalol, and Zosyn.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/69 mmHg to 150/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. Her weight is currently 111.2 kg.

The patient has been on diuresis with furosemide and reached -3 liters by morning nurse. Free water boluses have been increased to 200 q4. The patient attempted to switch to pressure support today and is maintaining good saturations at FiO2 40% and PEEP of 8. RSBI is 58. Barrier to extubation is pulmonary edema.

The patient has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 150 mg/dL, likely secondary to diuresis. The plan is to increase free water flushes to 250 q4 and check electrolytes and creatinine tomorrow."

   until [**10-18**].  Also start ppx with Cipro 750mg qweek lifelong.
   - F/u repeat cxs
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:  Since midnight, has been on pressure support,
   maintaining good saturations at FiO2 40% and PEEP of 8. RSBI 58.
   Barrier to extubation: pulmonary edema (is 21 L positive).
   -Diuresis: was 3.5 L negative w/ lasix at 12 mg/hr (120 mg) and
   switched to 10 mg / hr O/N and recevied diuril X [**Hospital1 7**].  Creatinine
   yesterday AM was 1.3 and with continued diuresis, improved to 1.0 this
   AM.  Would continue lasix 10 cc/hr and continue diuril [**Hospital1 7**]; check lytes
   and Cr [**Hospital1 7**] and follow urine output with goal of -2 L.
   -This afternoon, wean PEEP down to 5 as tolerated.  Once doing well on
   PEEP of 5, can consider SBT.
   .
   #Hypernatremia - Likely secondary to diuresis.  Na rebounding up to 150
   despite free water flushes.
   -Would increase from 200 q4 to 250 q3.  Check PM lytes.  Give one-time
   free water bolus if necessary for Na > 150.
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  INR has increased from 2.4 to 5.0 over last five
   days.  PTT has also been increasing from 46 to 61.  Differential
   includes Vit K deficiency secondary to initiation of Zosyn course
   versus worsening hepatic function.  Vit K deficiency less likely since
   this should not affect PTT significantly, and pt has been receiving
   Vitamin K 10 mg PO over last three days.  Worsening of hepatic function
   supported by rising total bilirubin from 10 -> 20 over last five days.
   Causes of worsening hepatic function could be secondary to hepatic
   congestion given significant volume overload.  Recent US on [**10-8**]
   showed no obstruction and alk phos stable.
   -Continue Vit K 10 mg today and finish 3 day course tomorrow
   -Continue diuresis to reduce hepatic congestion
   -Touch base w/ liver whether they want further work-up, i.e. repeat of
   US.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis who presented with bloody diarrhea, fevers, septic shock from E. Coli bacteremia, and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and is currently being treated with antibiotics. The patient's respiratory support has been gradually reduced from CPAP to pressure support ventilation (PSV). She is receiving diuretics to manage pulmonary edema and has shown improvement in her creatinine levels. Her sodium levels are high due to diuresis, so free water flushes are being increased, and a one-time free water bolus will be given if necessary. The patient's coagulopathy is worsening, likely due to worsening hepatic function. Vitamin K supplementation is being continued, and diuretics are being continued to reduce hepatic congestion. The patient's hypertension is being managed with labetalol. She is receiving full tube feeds, and her electrolytes will be monitored. The patient's condition is stable, but there are potential medical complications such as hypernatremia, worsening coagulopathy, and hepatic congestion that need to be addressed."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis who was admitted due to gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, respiratory failure, and sepsis. She has been in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for sepsis and is now being switched to ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis.

The patient's respiratory failure is mainly due to volume overload, and the goal is to achieve at least 2L negative fluid balance today. The GI bleed is stable with no active bleeding, and her hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable. There are concerns about renal failure, as indicated by an elevated creatinine (Cr) level, and close monitoring of electrolytes is necessary. The patient also has signs of liver failure, with rising total bilirubin (T bili) levels, which may indicate liver congestion.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition remains in the ICU. She is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is primarily due to volume overload. If not managed appropriately, there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.

2. GI Bleed: Although the GI bleed is currently stable, there is a"

   septic shock from E Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure.
   # Sepsis
 Resolving:  afebrile, WBC down, not tachycardic.  pCO2=35
   but RR>20.  Respiratory status more likely a cause of pulmonary edema.
   Continue to treat her inital E Coli bacteremia w/probable translocation
   of colonic bacteria.  Course was further c/b SPB, now treated X 5
   days.  cholangitis r/o by abdominal u/s
   - Stop Zosyn, and start ceftriaxone until [**10-18**].
   - after which she will require SBP ppx with Cipro 750mg qweek lifelong.
   - F/u repeat cxs
   # Respiratory Failure:  Tolerating weaning to PS 12/5  FiO2 40% and
   PEEP of 8. RSBI 58.  Barrier to extubation: pulmonary edema (is 18 L
   positive).   3L negative.
   -Diuresis: Continue lasix ggt and diuril [**Hospital1 7**]; check lytes and Cr [**Hospital1 7**]
   and follow urine output with goal of -2 L.
   - Continue to wean pressure support ventilation today.  Based on CXR,
   she may not tolerate extubation today.  .
   #Hypernatremia - Likely secondary to diuresis.  Na at 149 today.  3.8 L
   free water deficit.
   -Continue free water flushes at 250 q3.  Check PM lytes.  Give one-time
   free water bolus if necessary for Na > 150.
   # Coagulopathy:  INR has increased from 2.4 to 5.2 over last five
   days.  PTT has also been increasing from 46 to 61.  Worsening of
   hepatic function supported by rising total bilirubin, perhaps from
   hepatic congestion given significatn volume overload.  Vit K deficiency
   in the setting of antibiotic treatment inhibiting Vit K production
   lless likely since this should not affect PTT significantly, and pt has
   received 3 day course of Vit K without improvement in INR.  Recent US
   on [**10-8**] showed no obstruction and alk phos stable.
   -Continue diuresis to reduce hepatic congestion
   -Touch base w/ liver about ? liver work up for transplant.
   # Hypertension - BPs were stable 130-150 systolic
   - Labetolol 100mg [**Hospital1 7**] PO
   - Give labetalol PRN SBP > 160
   #  Cryptogenic cirrhosis: LFTs increasing, TBili rising, MELD
   recalculated to 30. Has had o/p workup prior to admission, but no
   testing for Wilsons disease.  Has had negative RUQ u/s for obstruction
   -Continue labetalol for HTN and variceal prophylaxis

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, who initially presented with bloody diarrhea and fevers. She developed apparent septic shock from E. coli bacteremia and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypertension, altered mental status, electrolyte and fluid disorder, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, gastrointestinal bleed, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. She is being treated for her initial E. coli bacteremia, suspected translocation of colonic bacteria, and has undergone treatment for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She also has pulmonary edema, hypernatremia, coagulopathy, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's respiratory status is more likely a cause of pulmonary edema, which can be exacerbated by factors such as fluid overload or increased intravenous fluid administration.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, which can be exacerbated by factors such as stress ulcers or variceal bleeding due to portal hypertension from cirrhosis.
3. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently improving, there is a risk of recurrent sepsis if bacterial infection is not properly managed.
4. Liver failure: The patient has cryptogenic cirrhosis and worsening hepatic function, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, respiratory failure, and sepsis. She has been on mechanical ventilation and received large volume resuscitation. Her current condition includes hypertension, altered mental status, electrolyte and fluid disorder, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, GI bleed, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis due to an E.coli infection. It is important to monitor her vital signs, blood cultures, and continue antibiotic therapy.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, possibly related to large volume resuscitation. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary. Extubation may be considered once her condition improves.
3. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of GI bleed in the setting of cirrhosis. It is important to monitor her hemodynamic status and hematocrit levels. Further diagnostic evaluation and management of the GI source of bleeding should be considered.
4. Renal Failure: The patient may be at risk for renal failure due to hypotension and inadequate renal perfusion. Close monitoring of her urine output and renal function tests is required.
5. Liver Failure: The patient has a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, which can lead to liver failure. Monitoring of liver function tests and"

   -Continue free water flushes at 250 q3.  Check PM lytes.  Give one-time
   free water bolus if necessary for Na > 150.
   # Coagulopathy:  INR has increased from 2.4 to peak of 5.2.  PTT has
   also been increasing from 46 to 61.  Worsening of hepatic function
   supported by rising total bilirubin, perhaps from hepatic congestion
   given volume overload.   INR improving in the setting of receiving Vit
   K.  PTT still elevated.  Liver is following.  Also bleieve her hepatic
   function is worsening.  Started workup for transplant yesterday.
   Recent US on [**10-8**] showed no obstruction and alk phos stable.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old lady with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, who initially presented with bloody diarrhea and fevers. She developed apparent septic shock from E Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been tolerating pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) mode with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. She is also on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to oliguria and acute kidney injury (AKI). Her blood pressure is stable, and she is receiving diuretics for volume overload. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are worsening, and there is a concern for hepatic congestion. She has a history of hypertension, which is being managed with labetalol. The patient's electrolytes and fluid balance are being closely monitored, and she is receiving IV fluids and diuretics as needed. Her urine output is low, and there is a goal to achieve -2 L of urine output per day. The patient's coagulation profile shows an increased international normalized ratio (INR) and prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating a coagulopathy. She has also been diagnosed with respiratory failure, sepsis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. There are plans for a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today and further evaluation for liver transplantation. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management"

   57 year old lady w/ PMhx of cryptogenic cirrhosis cx by varices
   initially presended with bloody diarrhea and fevers, developed apparent
   septic shock from E Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure.
   # Respiratory Failure:  Tolerating weaning to PS 12/5  FiO2 40% and
   PEEP of 8. RSBI 58.  Barrier to extubation: volume overload (is 16 L
   positive).
   -Diuresis: Continue lasix ggt check lytes and Cr [**Hospital1 7**] and follow urine
   output with goal of -2 L.
   - SBT trial today
   - d/c diuril
    # Sepsis
 Resolved:  afebrile, WBC down, not tachycardic.  pCO2=35
   but RR>20.  Respiratory status more likely a cause of pulmonary edema.
   Continue to treat her inital E Coli bacteremia w/probable translocation
   of colonic bacteria.  Course was further c/b SPB, now treated X 5
   days.  cholangitis r/o by abdominal u/s
   - Continue ceftriaxone until [**10-18**].
   - after which she will require SBP ppx with Cipro 750mg qweek lifelong.
   - F/u repeat cxs
   #Hypernatremia - Likely secondary to diuresis.  Na at 147 today.
   -Continue free water flushes at 250 q3.  Check PM lytes.  Give one-time
   free water bolus if necessary for Na > 150.
   # Coagulopathy:  INR has increased from 2.4 to peak of 5.2.  PTT has
   also been increasing from 46 to 61.  Worsening of hepatic function
   supported by rising total bilirubin, perhaps from hepatic congestion
   given volume overload.   INR improving in the setting of receiving Vit
   K.  PTT still elevated.  Liver is following.  Also bleieve her hepatic
   function is worsening.  Started workup for transplant yesterday.
   Recent US on [**10-8**] showed no obstruction and alk phos stable.
   - Continue diuresis to reduce hepatic congestion
   - f/u liver recs
   # Hypertension - BPs were stable 130-150 systolic
   - Labetolol 100mg [**Hospital1 7**] PO
   - Give labetalol PRN SBP > 160
   # Cryptogenic cirrhosis: LFTs increasing, TBili rising, MELD
   recalculated to 30. Has had o/p workup prior to admission, but no
   testing for Wilsons disease.  Has had negative RUQ u/s for obstruction
   -Continue labetalol for HTN and variceal prophylaxis
   -Continue to hold spirinolactone given diuresis

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old lady with a past medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis who initially presented with bloody diarrhea and fevers. She developed apparent septic shock from E Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute gastrointestinal bleed, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypertension, altered mental status, electrolyte and fluid disorder, impaired skin integrity, and cryptogenic cirrhosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening of liver failure, potential liver transplant, worsening of hepatic congestion, volume overload, pulmonary edema, further bacteremia or translocation of colonic bacteria, hypernatremia, coagulopathy, worsening of hepatic function, obstructive jaundice, portal hypertension, variceal bleeding, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatomegaly, ascites, and potentially hepatocellular carcinoma.

These potential complications need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition."

","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with respiratory failure and gastrointestinal bleed. They were extubated this morning and are doing well. The patient has a history of anemia, hypertension, altered mental status, electrolyte and fluid disorder, respiratory failure (not ARDS), impaired skin integrity, gastrointestinal bleed, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and benign hypertension. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1 C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 135/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on aerosol-cool face tent with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The patient has edema in both lower extremities and is alert and attentive with warm skin. Lab results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, increased creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and they are on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation, indicating ongoing respiratory support requirements. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if the patient's condition worsens.
2. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, as evidenced by the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis who initially presented with bloody diarrhea and fevers. She developed apparent septic shock from E. coli bacteremia and respiratory failure. The patient was intubated but has now been extubated. 

The patient's current condition includes bleeding around the Foley catheter, but no blood in the urine. It is unclear if there is vaginal bleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/47 mmHg to 141/102 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 313 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 6 cmH2O, and spontaneous respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, elevated platelet count of 99,000/mm3, and elevated liver enzymes including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 94 U/L and aspartate a"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old lady with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis who presented with bloody diarrhea and fevers. She developed apparent septic shock from E. Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure, and was subsequently extubated. 

The patient experienced about 400 cc of bleeding from the rectum, with potential vaginal bleeding as well. A flexible sigmoidoscopy showed non-bleeding hemorrhoids and polyps. Her hematocrit (HCT) levels have been stable, currently at 24, and her last INR remains elevated at 3.5. 

Possible sources for the bleed include esophageal varices, portal gastropathy, other varices (rectal), polyps, and coagulopathy. 

The plan is to monitor the patient's HCT every 8 hours and transfuse if it falls below 21. Coagulation tests will be followed up this morning. Nadolol will be restarted for long-term prophylaxis against variceal bleeding, and an active type and screen will be maintained. IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) will continue, and additional units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) will be transfused if there is continued active bleeding. Vitamin K can be discontinued today since the patient has received 10 mg for three days. Liver recommendations will be followed up.

The patient's sepsis has resolved, and she is now afebrile,"

          Sepsis (now resolved)
          Respiratory failure (now resolved)

          Coagulopathy
          ?hypercalcemia
   Doing well from a sepsis/respiratory failure standpoint
   The bleeding episode from yesterday appears to have stopped.  Felt by
   hepatology to be most likely related to hemorrhoidal bleeding.  Still
   passing a couple of clots.
   However, there was some concern for whether there might be vaginal
   component to bleeding (nothing clearly seen on vaginal exam).
   Once she is more stable, would consider evaluation for:
          Polyp removal (see GI note)
          Potential vaginal ultrasound/further evaluation
   Recheck calcium in next day or two.  If still elevated, check ionized
   calcium and consider further evaluation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old woman with multiple medical complications. The key findings and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Chief Complaint: Sepsis, GI bleed, cirrhosis
2. HPI: Substantial LGIB (lower gastrointestinal bleeding), old blood present, grade 3 internal hemorrhoids, and polyps found during lower endoscopy.
3. Review of Systems: Constitutional - fatigue, Cardiovascular - no chest pain, Respiratory - no dyspnea, Gastrointestinal - no abdominal pain, Genitourinary - Foley, Heme/Lymph - anemia, Pain - no pain/appears comfortable.
4. Physical Examination: Well-nourished, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic, S1 and S2 normal, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, right lower extremity edema 1+, left lower extremity edema 1+, warm skin, attentive neurologically.
5. Labs: Hemoglobin (Hb) 7.8 g/dL, leukocyte count (WBC) 107 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) 111 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) 1.0 mg/dL, blood glucose (Glucose) 129 mg/dL, PT/PTT/INR 36.1/53.7/3.7, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T 59//, ALT/AST 98/258, Alk Phos/T Bili 73/23.8, Amylase/Lipase 45/14, etc.
6. Assessment and Plan: The patient has bleeding (presumptive LGIB from hemorrhoids), sepsis (now resolved), respiratory failure (now resolved), cirrhosis (cryptogenic), anemia secondary to blood loss, coagulopathy, and hypercalcemia.
7. Critical Care Attending Addendum: Urgent colonoscopy performed with findings of rectal varices. Injected with Dermabond. Will maintain in ICU. Transfuse as needed. If rebleeds and does not stop may require balloon tamponade.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Rebleeding: The patient had a significant lower gastrointestinal bleed, and there is a risk of rebleeding.
2. Infection: Although sepsis has been resolved, the patient may still be at risk for developing infections due to immunosuppression.
3. Liver failure: The presence of cirrhosis indicates potential liver dysfunction, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, and hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile indicates a coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding and clotting disorders.
5. Hypercalcemia: The"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old lady with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis. She initially presented with bloody diarrhea and fevers, leading to apparent septic shock from E Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure. She was successfully extubated but now has worsening liver failure, receiving transplant workup and new onset rectal and vaginal bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has experienced rectal and vaginal bleeding, which may be due to her liver disease, specifically esophageal varices, portal gastropathy, other varices, or polyps. Given her coagulopathy, she is at an increased risk for bleeding.

2. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's electrolytes and fluid balance are out of order, as indicated by her elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. This could be due to impaired kidney function or fluid shifts.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised, as mentioned in the physical examination section. Further assessment is required to determine the extent of skin impairment.

4. Sepsis: The patient had an initial episode of sepsis caused by E Coli bacteremia and subsequent respiratory failure. Although she has completed the treatment course, there is a risk of recurrent infection due to her weakened immune system.

5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings have been stable in"

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis who presented initially with bloody diarrhea and fevers. She developed apparent septic shock from E Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure, and has now been extubated. The patient is currently experiencing worsening liver failure, receiving transplant workup, and new-onset rectal and vaginal bleeding.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of known varices, which are dilated blood vessels that can rupture and cause significant bleeding. The recent bleeding episodes and injection of rectal varices suggest that this could be a potential complication.

2. Sepsis: The patient had an initial E Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure, indicating an infection that led to sepsis. It is crucial to monitor for any signs of recurrent sepsis or infection.

3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers or bedsores. Proper skin care and repositioning should be implemented to prevent further complications.

4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's laboratory results show imbalances in electrolytes and fluids, such as low sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and magnesium (Mg++). Close monitoring and correction of these imbalances are necessary to prevent complications.

5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure"

   Patient is critically ill.
   Total time spent: 40minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaints include sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and cirrhosis. 

The patient has ongoing oozing varices, with a recent injection of rectal varices. Their hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable at 23. The patient is unable to provide a medical history due to a language barrier. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 36.7 C (98.5 F), current temperature (Tcurrent) of 36.6 C (97.9 F), heart rate (HR) of 93 bpm with a range of 82-95 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 125/64 mmHg to 139/64 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 23 breaths per minute with a range of 16-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100%. 

The patient's weight is currently 104.8 kg, with a height of 63 inches. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,193 mL and total output of 1,270 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate the following values: white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 7.4 to 8.2 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) ranging from 23.7% to 25.5%, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 95 to 114 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 0.7 to 0.9 mg/dL, glucose ranging from 61 to 152 mg/dL, and liver function tests showing elevated levels of ALT/AST, bilirubin, and PT/INR. Other lab values are within normal ranges or do not significantly impact the patient's condition. 

The patient has several medical conditions and potential complications, including cryptogenic cirrhosis with worsening numbers, altered mental status (not delirium) that has improved today, rectal varices requiring injection, anemia due to blood loss with suspected vaginal bleeding, and sepsis. 

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition through a pulmonary tube and glycemic control measures. Prophylaxis is given for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's code status is unknown, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU. The patient is critically ill, and further evaluation and management are required to address their complex medical issues."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old lady with a past medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, initially presenting with bloody diarrhea and fevers, who developed apparent septic shock from E Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure. She was extubated but now presents with worsening liver failure, receiving a transplant workup and new onset rectal and vaginal bleeding.

Her current condition includes:
- Hypertension, benign
- Altered mental status (not delirium)
- Electrolyte & fluid disorder, other
- Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
- Impaired skin integrity
- Gastrointestinal bleed, lower (hematochezia, BRBPR, GI bleed, GIB)
- Sepsis without organ dysfunction

The patient's bleeding is being managed conservatively, with plans to check HCT every 4 hours and transfuse if Hct < 25. She is also receiving FFP to maintain normal INR, daily vitamin K, and a transvaginal ultrasound. An active type and screen is being maintained, and options for management such as TIPS, repeat flex sig and banding or clipping of varices, and surgical intervention will be discussed if she continues to bleed.

Her cryptogenic cirrhosis is worsening, with increased liver function tests (LFTs), total bilirubin (t bili), and coagulation parameters. The cause of this worsening is unclear but"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old lady with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, previously complicated by varices. She initially presented with bloody diarrhea and fevers, developed apparent septic shock from E. coli bacteremia, and respiratory failure, now post-extubation. The patient is currently experiencing worsening liver failure, receiving a transplant workup, and new-onset rectal and vaginal bleeding. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient has active bleeding, with a decreasing hemoglobin level. Possible sources of bleeding include esophageal varices, portal gastropathy, other varices (rectal), polyps, mucosal bleeding, endometrial bleeding, or a rectovaginal fistula (unlikely given recent scope). Conservative management is being provided, with plans for transfusion if hemoglobin drops below 25 and monitoring of coagulation parameters.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings have been stable between 110-130 systolic, despite held antihypertensives. All blood pressure-lowering agents will be held, and Lasix and spirinolactone will be continued.

3. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient is experiencing volume overload, likely due to recent blood product transfusions. Measures are being taken to avoid fluid overload, including the use of diuretics like Lasix.

4. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is a function of volume overload"

   Patient is critically ill.
   Total time spent: 35 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple ongoing medical complications. These include:

1. Cryptogenic cirrhosis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs), total bilirubin, and coagulation profile have worsened, indicating decompensation of liver function. The cause of cirrhosis is unknown, and workup is underway. Imaging and biopsy may be necessary.

2. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient is increasingly encephalopathic, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose is being administered to manage this condition.

3. Fluid status: The patient appears to be fluid overloaded, which needs to be addressed.

4. Rectal varices: The patient is experiencing significant blood loss from rectal varices. Variceal ligation has been performed, and the liver service is following up on the patient.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated sodium levels, which require management.

6. Anemia due to blood loss: The patient has significant blood loss, leading to anemia. Blood transfusion and iron supplementation may be necessary.

7. Vaginal bleeding: The patient is experiencing vaginal bleeding, which could be due to a fistula or endometriosis. A transvaginal ultrasound is planned to assess the situation.

8. Sepsis: The patient initially had an E. coli bacteremia secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old lady with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis who presented with bloody diarrhea and fevers. She developed apparent septic shock from E Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure but has since been extubated. The patient is currently experiencing worsening liver failure and receiving a transplant workup by Hepatology. She also has new-onset rectal and vaginal bleeding.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of liver disease and likely worsened over the past week, which may lead to bleeding complications. Sources of bleeding can include esophageal varices (known), portal gastropathy, other varices (rectal), or polyps. Vaginal bleeding may be due to mucosal bleeding, endometrial bleeding, or a rectovaginal fistula (unlikely given recent scope). Conservative management is currently being provided.

2. Cryptogenic cirrhosis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs), total bilirubin, and coagulation profile have increased over the past week. Mental status is fairly clear, and a flexible sigmoidoscopy on Friday showed rectal varices that were injected with glue. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is contraindicated due to a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. The patient is"

- The patient is a 57-year-old female with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis who initially presented with bloody diarrhea and fevers. She developed apparent septic shock from E Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure, and was subsequently extubated.
- The patient is now experiencing worsening liver failure, receiving transplant workup by Hepatology, and has new-onset rectal and vaginal bleeding.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.4 C (99.4 F), current temperature 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate 105 bpm (98-107 bpm), blood pressure 121/49 mmHg (65-147/62-80 mmHg), respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute (17-26 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation 94%.
- The patient's physical examination reveals a soft, distended abdomen with no tenderness to palpation, along with 2/6 systolic murmurs best at right upper sternal border (RUSB) and left upper sternal border (LUSB). There is also pitting edema to the knees and some anasarca in the thighs.
- The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 11.4 (11.8-13.1 K/uL), decreased hematocrit (Hct"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old lady w/ PMhx of cryptogenic cirrhosis cx by varices
   initially presended with bloody diarrhea and fevers, developed apparent
   septic shock from E Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure now s/p
   extubation.  Now with worsening liver failure, receiving transplant
   workup by Hepatology and new onset rectal and vaginal bleeding.
   1. Bleeding--Flex sigmoidoscopy showing rectal varices were injected.
   Hct holding steady in 24's and last INR trending upwards, currently
   2.7.  Possible sources for her bleed: given liver disease that has
   likely worsened over past week: esophageal varices (known), portal
   gastropathy, other varices (rectal), polyps;  vaginal bleeding may be
   [**1-28**] to mucosal bleeding, endometrial bleeding, or rectovaginal fistula
   (unlikely given recent scope).  Currently receiving conservative
   management.
   --Hct currently stable for several days, will trend Hct
s qday
   --Transfuse for signs of active bleeding or large drop in Hct
   --Lasix with all blood products
   --Will give more FFP today and f/u 4 pm coags, CBC
   --Maintain active T&S
   --Continue daily VitK
   --Consult Gyn, unclear if increased endometrial stripe is source of
   blood loss
   --F/u liver recs re: further interventions for rectal varices
    2. Cryptogenic cirrhosis: LFTs, Tbili, and coags have overall
   increased over the past week, however mental status today is fairly
   clear. Flex sig on Friday showing rectal varices which were injected
   with glue. TIPS contraindicated due to high MELD score.  Currently
   being worked up by Liver for transplant.

   --Continue Rifaxamin
   --F/u ceruloplasmin and copper, still pending
   --Cipro change to 250mg daily instead of qwk per liver recs for SBP

","The patient is a 57-year-old lady with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis who presented initially with bloody diarrhea and fevers, developed apparent septic shock from E Coli bacteremia, and respiratory failure. She underwent extubation and is now experiencing worsening liver failure, receiving a transplant workup and new onset rectal and vaginal bleeding.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient has new onset rectal and vaginal bleeding. Possible sources of bleeding include esophageal varices (known), portal gastropathy, other varices (rectal), polyps, and endometrial bleeding. Conservative management is currently being provided.

2. Cryptogenic cirrhosis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs), total bilirubin, and coagulation parameters have increased over the past week. The worsening hepatic function could be due to obstruction, hepatic congestion, or an ischemic insult in the setting of sepsis. The patient is now becoming more encephalopathic.

3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress is a function of volume overload with fluid resuscitation. Measures to avoid repeat intubation include avoiding intravenous fluids, giving Lasix with blood products as blood pressure allows, and maintaining a goal of avoiding repeat intubation.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures were stable at 110-130 systolic in the setting of held antihypertens"

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old lady w/ PMhx of cryptogenic cirrhosis cx by varices
   initially presended with bloody diarrhea and fevers, developed apparent
   septic shock from E Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure now s/p
   extubation.  Now with worsening liver failure, receiving transplant
   workup by Hepatology and new onset rectal and vaginal bleeding.
   1. Bleeding--Flex sigmoidoscopy showing rectal varices, were injected.
   Hct holding steady in 24's and last INR 2.4. Liver consulted yesterday,
   recommended octreotide gtt.
   --Hct currently stable for several days, will trend Hct
s qday
   --Transfuse for signs of active bleeding or large drop in Hct
   --Lasix with all blood products
   --Coags improved with yesterday's FFP, 2.7 --> 2.4
   --Maintain active T&S
   --Continue daily VitK
   --Gyn consulted, plan to perform endometrial biopsy today to assess if
   source of bleed, ?malignancy as part of transplant workup
   --Continue octreotide gtt for rectal varices
    2. Cryptogenic cirrhosis: LFTs, Tbili, and coags have overall
   increased over the past week, however mental status today is fairly
   clear. Flex sig on Friday showing rectal varices which were injected
   with glue. TIPS contraindicated due to high MELD score.  Currently
   being worked up by Liver for transplant, to be discussed tomorrow.
   --Start Octrotide gtt
   --Lactulose 30mL q6hrs, uptitrate to for [**3-31**] BM
s daily; pt appears to
   have only had 2 BM yesterday, increase lactulose.
   --T. Bili trending up from 31.3 -->35
   --Continue Rifaxamin
   --F/u ceruloplasmin and copper, still pending
   --Cipro change to 250mg daily instead of qwk per liver recs for SBP
   prophylaxis
   --Continue furosemide, and spironolactone
   --Tranplant workup requires mammography and pap smear, can be done as
   outpt
   --Continue to trend LFT
s daily
   3. Increased endometrial stripe
Unclear whether this represents normal
   physiologic response to increased estrogen in setting of cirrhosis or
   if this is pathologic. Also unclear if this is source of bleeding.
   --Gyn consult (appreciated) who will perform Bx today with stirrup
   strecher from ED
   4. Fluid overload
   --Lasix with all blood products
   --negative fluid balance achieved yesterday, pt negative 443 mL
   yesterday
   --Continue maintenance 20mg PO Lasix qday and will give extra 80mg IV
   Lasix today
   --Continue Spironolactone 50mg PO qday

- The patient is being evaluated for a potential liver transplant due to contraindications for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure.
- She is also being assessed for malignancy as part of the transplant workup.
- The patient's mental status is fairly clear, but her liver function tests (LFTs), total bilirubin (T Bili), and coagulation parameters have increased over the past week.
- She has a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and is being worked up by Liver for transplant.
- The patient's increased endometrial stripe is unclear whether it represents a normal physiological response or a pathological condition.
- She has fluid overload, for which Lasix and spironolactone are being administered.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 year old lady w/ PMhx of cryptogenic cirrhosis cx by varices
   initially presended with bloody diarrhea and fevers, developed apparent
   septic shock from E Coli bacteremia and respiratory failure now s/p
   extubation.  Now with worsening liver failure, receiving transplant
   workup by Hepatology and new onset rectal and vaginal bleeding.
   1. Bleeding--Flex sigmoidoscopy showing rectal varices, were injected.
   Hct holding steady in 24's and last INR 2.4. Liver consulted yesterday,
   recommended octreotide gtt.
   --Hct currently stable for several days, will trend Hct
s qday
   --Transfuse for signs of active bleeding or large drop in Hct
   --Lasix with all blood products
   --Coags improved with yesterday's FFP, 2.7 --> 2.4, no plan for FFP for
   now unless patient bleeds or INR>3.
   --Maintain active T&S
   --Continue daily Vit K
   --Gyn consulted, plan to perform endometrial biopsy today to assess if
   source of bleed, ?malignancy as part of transplant workup
   --Continue octreotide gtt for rectal varices (day#[**1-31**])
    2. Cryptogenic cirrhosis: LFTs, Tbili, and coags have overall
   increased over the past week, mental status also appears to be
   declining today. Flex sig on Friday showing rectal varices which were
   injected with glue. TIPS contraindicated due to high MELD score.
   Currently being worked up by Liver for transplant. Liver recs
   ?infection as source of increasing bilirubin, but today patient had
   downward trend in WBC count, afebrile, making infectious cause less
   likely.

   --T. Bili trending up from 31.3 -->35
   --Continue Rifaxamin
   --F/u ceruloplasmin and copper, still pending
   --Cipro 250mg daily per liver recs for SBP prophylaxis
   --Continue furosemide, and spironolactone
   --Tranplant workup requires mammography and pap smear, can be done as
   outpt
   --Continue to trend LFT
s daily
   3. Increased endometrial stripe
Unclear whether this represents normal
   physiologic response to increased estrogen in setting of cirrhosis or
   if this is pathologic. Also unclear if this is source of bleeding.
   --S/p Gyn consult (appreciated), who performed endometrial biopsy today
   at bedside.
   -- F/u endometrial biopsy
   4. Fluid overload
   --Lasix with all blood products

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old lady with a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis who initially presented with bloody diarrhea and fevers. She developed apparent septic shock from an E. coli bacteremia and respiratory failure, after which she was extubated. Currently, she is experiencing worsening liver failure, receiving transplant workup by Hepatology, and new onset rectal and vaginal bleeding.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Bleeding: The patient has been experiencing rectal and vaginal bleeding. Flex sigmoidoscopy showed rectal varices, which were injected. Her hematocrit (Hct) is currently stable, and there is no plan for fresh frozen plasma (FFP) unless there are signs of active bleeding or a large drop in Hct. Lasix will be given with all blood products, and coagulation parameters will be monitored.

2. Cryptogenic cirrhosis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs), total bilirubin (Tbili), and coagulation parameters have increased over the past week. Mental status decline is also observed. Flex sigmoidoscopy on Friday showed rectal varices that were injected with glue. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is contraindicated due to a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. The patient is being worked up by liver transplant"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old lady with a medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and previous variceal bleeding. She presented initially with bloody diarrhea and fevers, developed apparent septic shock from E. coli bacteremia, and subsequently experienced respiratory failure. The patient was extubated and now presents with worsening liver failure, receiving a transplant workup. She also has new-onset rectal and vaginal bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient has rectal varices, which were injected but may continue to bleed. Her Hct is stable for now, but close monitoring is required. She should be transfused for signs of active bleeding or a large drop in Hct.
2. Cryptogenic cirrhosis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs), total bilirubin, and coagulation parameters are worsening. Mental status decline is also observed. The patient has been worked up for liver transplantation. 
3. Increased endometrial stripe: The patient has an increased endometrial stripe, which could be a physiological response to increased estrogen in the setting of cirrhosis or potentially pathological. Further evaluation of the endometrial biopsy is needed.
4. Fluid overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance and is at risk of fluid overload. Lasix will be given with all blood products, and the dose of Lasix and spironolactone will be increased.
