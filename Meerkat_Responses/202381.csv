   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o M with hx of HIV, systemic scleroderma, ILD with UIP and
   hypothyroidism who presents with fevers, rigors and no localizing
   symptoms.  Remained hypotensive despite fluid resuccitation.
   .
   # Fevers: Unclear etiology at this time; has chronic cough and only has
   no true localizing symptoms elsewhere besides fevers and generalized
   body aches.  Chest CT did possibly show an underlying infection, but
   difficult to detemine given his underlying ILD.  Does have HIV,
   although CD4 count is high, but differential should be broadened.
   Differential includes viral vs. bacterial PNA; in addition,  LDH is
   elevated, so need to consider PCP (less likley given high CD4 count).
   Outside lung pathology, his LP and head CT were normal so do not
   suspect encephalitis or meningitis.  Abd benign, so do not suspect abd
   process, although has elevated AST. Patient continued febrile
   overnight. Responsive to Tylenol, cooling blanket.  DFA negative.
   - Stop tamiflu given DFA negative
   - Continue vanco/CTX/levo as well as Bactrim for UTI
   - F/U BCx, legionella UA
   - Repeat sputum cx including PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Consider ABG if continues febrile, coughing
   # Hypotension: was normotensive on presentation to the ED and then was
   hypotensive with SBPs in 70s for approximately 2 hours.  Did not
   initially respond to fluid boluses.  Has since normalized.  Most likely
   secondary to infection and venodilation.  .  Could be adrenal
   insufficiency, although hasn't been on chronic steroids.  Cardiac shock
   less likely given normal EKG and lack of chest pain.
   - continue IVF boluses PRN for MAP <60
   - would use LR if boluses because of mild acidosis
   - consider CVL and pressors if not responsive to IVFs
   - trend lactates, urine output
   # ARF: new ARF from baseline of 1.0; making appropriate urine.  FeNa is
   0.5% which suggest prerenal, although after 6L of NS, his creatinine
   did not improve.  Did start Bactrim recently, although would be strange
   to have this rise in Cr after only one dose. Creatinine persistently
   elevated at 1.8.
   - trend Cr
   - continue fluid resuccitation
   - check urine eos, consider re-check urine lytes if no improvement
   - renally dose meds; avoid nephrotoxins
   # Low magnesium. Unclear etiology. Was not checked on admission so
   difficult to establish trend.
   - Recheck PM lytes
   - Replete PRN
   # High LDH: unclear etiology, although could be consistent with PCP
   pneumonia vs. new lymphoma, which given hx of HIV is more possible.
   - trend LDH
   - pcp sputum smears as above
   - follow up on recent CD4 counts
   # Headache: is mild, less worrisome for meningitis, although given
   relative [**Name (NI) 12352**], could represent underlying infection.  Has
   negative LP and CT head in ED.
   - tylenol PRN for pain
   - f/u CSF cultures, but no abx coverage for meningitis
   # Conjunctivitis: again, likely from a viral illness.  Is asymptomatic
   at this point, but will monitor clinically.
   - saline eye gtts for now
   - consider cipro gtt if patient becomes more symptomatic
   .
   # ILD: has underlying ILD that has been stable, and today seems at
   baseline.  Reviewing CT scan has stable honeycombing in the peripheries
   and more ground glass infiltrates consistent with different process,
   likely infectious as discussed above.
   - continue nebs
   - PNA/flu treatment as above
   .
   # HIV: on HARRT and per old labs, has high CD4 around 600.  Will need
   to contact outpatient doctor to review meds, recent labs and
   prophylaxis plans for him.
   - continue current regimen
   - contact PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] consider adding prophylaxis based on CD4 count
   .
   # Scleroderma: stable, continue to monitor for now
   .
   # Anemia: had normal hct on presentation and down from 41 to 37 after
   6L of IVFs, so value is likley dilutional.  No reason to suspect
   bleeding elsewhere.
   - guiac stools
   - trend hct
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: mild today, has hx of ITP in [**2136**] after a lung
   biopsy.  He was treated with IVIG and improved.  Steroids were avoided
   at that time in order to prevent a possible scleroderma steroid induced
   renal crisis.  Today's platelets are below his new normal baseline of
   around 160s.
   .
   # Gout: stable, asymptomatic.
   - hold allopurinol in setting of renal failure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: stable, asymptomatic
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, systemic scleroderma, ILD with UIP, and hypothyroidism. He presents with fevers, rigors, and no localizing symptoms. The patient has been hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation.

The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 103.3 F, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 81/59 to 103/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13,400 cells/mm³, elevated creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL, and an elevated lactate level of 7.0 K/uL. Other lab results include elevated liver enzymes, low magnesium level, and elevated LDH.

The patient's chest CT shows worsening right lower lobe infiltrate. He has been started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin due to a history of MRSA in skin wounds. Blood cultures have been sent, and Legionella antigen test is pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include several potential medical complications. These include:

1. Fevers: The cause of the fevers is unclear at this time, with possible etiologies including viral or bacterial pneumonia, and PCP"

   Assessment and Plan
   44 y/o M with hx of HIV, systemic scleroderma, ILD with UIP and
   hypothyroidism who presents with fevers, rigors and no localizing
   symptoms.  Remained hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation.
   .
   # Fevers: Unclear etiology at this time; has chronic cough and has no
   true localizing symptoms elsewhere besides fevers and generalized body
   aches.  Chest CT did possibly show an underlying infection, but
   difficult to detemine given his underlying ILD.  Does have HIV,
   although CD4 count is high, but differential should be broadened.
   Differential includes viral vs. bacterial PNA; in addition,  LDH is
   elevated, so need to consider PCP (less likley given high CD4 count).
   Outside lung pathology, his LP and head CT were normal so do not
   suspect encephalitis or meningitis.  Abd benign, so do not suspect abd
   process, although has elevated AST. Patient continued febrile
   overnight. Responsive to Tylenol, cooling blanket.  DFA negative.
   - Stop tamiflu given DFA negative
   - Continue vanco/CTX/levo for pneumonia as well as Bactrim for UTI
   - F/U BCx, legionella UA
   - Repeat sputum cx including PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Consider ABG if continues febrile, coughing
   - Consider Infectious disease consult
   # Hypotension: was normotensive on presentation to the ED and then was
   hypotensive with SBPs in 70s for approximately 2 hours.  Did not
   initially respond to fluid boluses.  Has since normalized.  Most likely
   secondary to infection and venodilation.  .  Could be adrenal
   insufficiency, although hasn't been on chronic steroids.  Cardiac shock
   less likely given normal EKG and lack of chest pain.
   - continue IVF boluses PRN for MAP <60
   - would use LR if boluses because of mild acidosis
   - consider CVL and pressors if not responsive to IVFs
   - trend lactates, urine output
   # ARF: new ARF from baseline of 1.0; making appropriate urine.  FeNa is
   0.5% which suggest prerenal, although after 6L of NS, his creatinine
   did not improve.  Did start Bactrim recently, although would be strange
   to have this rise in Cr after only one dose. Creatinine persistently
   elevated at 1.8.
   - trend Cr
   - continue fluid resuscitation
   - check urine eos, consider re-check urine lytes if no improvement
   - renally dose meds; avoid nephrotoxins
   # Low magnesium. Unclear etiology. Was not checked on admission so
   difficult to establish trend.
   - Recheck PM lytes
   - Replete PRN
   # High LDH: unclear etiology, although could be consistent with PCP
   pneumonia vs. new lymphoma, which given hx of HIV is more possible.
   - trend LDH
   - pcp sputum smears as above
   - follow up on recent CD4 counts
   # Headache: is mild, less worrisome for meningitis, although given
   relative [**Name (NI) 12352**], could represent underlying infection.  Has
   negative LP and CT head in ED.
   - tylenol PRN for pain
   - f/u CSF cultures, but no abx coverage for meningitis
   # Conjunctivitis: again, likely from a viral illness.  Is asymptomatic
   at this point, but will monitor clinically.
   - saline eye gtts for now
   - consider cipro gtt if patient becomes more symptomatic
   .
   # ILD: has underlying ILD that has been stable, and today seems at
   baseline.  Reviewing CT scan has stable honeycombing in the peripheries
   and more ground glass infiltrates consistent with different process,
   likely infectious as discussed above.
   - continue nebs
   - PNA/flu treatment as above
   .
   # HIV: on HARRT and per old labs, has high CD4 around 600.  Will need
   to contact outpatient doctor to review meds, recent labs and
   prophylaxis plans for him.
   - continue current regimen
   - contact PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] consider adding prophylaxis based on CD4 count
   .
   # Scleroderma: stable, continue to monitor for now
   .
   # Anemia: had normal hct on presentation and down from 41 to 37 after
   6L of IVFs, so value is likley dilutional.  No reason to suspect
   bleeding elsewhere.
   - guiac stools
   - trend hct
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: mild today, has hx of ITP in [**2136**] after a lung
   biopsy.  He was treated with IVIG and improved.  Steroids were avoided
   at that time in order to prevent a possible scleroderma steroid induced
   renal crisis.  Today's platelets are below his new normal baseline of
   around 160s.
   .
   # Gout: stable, asymptomatic.
   - hold allopurinol in setting of renal failure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: stable, asymptomatic
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, systemic scleroderma, ILD with UIP, and hypothyroidism. The patient presents with fevers, rigors, and no localizing symptoms. The vital signs indicate tachycardia, regular heart rhythm, hypotension, and normal respiratory rate. The patient has a high fever and is responsive to Tylenol and a cooling blanket. Blood cultures were sent, and the patient is receiving antibiotics for pneumonia and a urinary tract infection. 

The patient's lungs are shallow with faint bibasilar crackles, and there is evidence of worsening right lower lobe infiltrate on a chest X-ray. The patient has mild conjunctivitis, which is likely from a viral illness. The abdominal exam is soft with no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly. 

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, normal glucose levels, slightly elevated creatinine, and low magnesium. The patient's platelet count is low, but this could be due to his history of immune thrombocytopenia. 

The patient's condition requires close monitoring in the ICU. Potential medical complications that can arise include sepsis secondary to the suspected pneumonia and urinary tract infection, further deterioration of renal function, development of respiratory failure, and complications related to his underlying conditions such as scleroderma and HIV."

   Assessment and Plan
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   44 y/o M with hx of HIV, systemic scleroderma, ILD with UIP and
   hypothyroidism who presents with fevers, rigors and no localizing
   symptoms.  Remained hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation.
   .
   # Fevers: Unclear etiology at this time; has chronic cough and has no
   true localizing symptoms elsewhere besides fevers and generalized body
   aches.  Chest CT did possibly show an underlying infection, but
   difficult to detemine given his underlying ILD.  Does have HIV,
   although CD4 count is high, but differential should be broadened.
   Differential includes viral vs. bacterial PNA; in addition,  LDH is
   elevated, so need to consider PCP (less likley given high CD4 count).
   Outside lung pathology, his LP and head CT were normal so do not
   suspect encephalitis or meningitis.  Abd benign, so do not suspect abd
   process, although has elevated AST. Patient continued febrile
   overnight. Responsive to Tylenol, cooling blanket.  DFA negative. Most
   likely, this is a viral syndrome.
   - Stop tamiflu given DFA negative
   - D/C vanco, CTX
   - Continue levo for pneumonia as well as Bactrim for UTI
   - F/U BCx, legionella UA
   - Repeat sputum cx including PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Consider ABG if continues febrile, coughing
   - Consider Infectious disease consult
   # Hypotension: was normotensive on presentation to the ED and then was
   hypotensive with SBPs in 70s for approximately 2 hours.  Did not
   initially respond to fluid boluses.  Has since normalized.  Most likely
   secondary to infection and venodilation.  .  Could be adrenal
   insufficiency, although hasn't been on chronic steroids.  Cardiac shock
   less likely given normal EKG and lack of chest pain.
   - continue IVF boluses PRN for MAP <60
   - would use LR if boluses because of mild acidosis
   - consider CVL and pressors if not responsive to IVFs
   - trend lactates, urine output
   # ARF: new ARF from baseline of 1.0; making appropriate urine.  FeNa is
   0.5% which suggest prerenal, although after 6L of NS, his creatinine
   did not improve.  Did start Bactrim recently, although would be strange
   to have this rise in Cr after only one dose. Creatinine persistently
   elevated at 1.8.
   - trend Cr
   - continue fluid resuscitation
   - check urine eos, consider re-check urine lytes if no improvement
   - renally dose meds; avoid nephrotoxins
   # Low magnesium. Unclear etiology. Was not checked on admission so
   difficult to establish trend.
   - Recheck PM lytes
   - Replete PRN
   # High LDH: unclear etiology, although could be consistent with PCP
   pneumonia vs. new lymphoma, which given hx of HIV is more possible.
   - trend LDH
   - pcp sputum smears as above
   - follow up on recent CD4 counts
   # Headache: is mild, less worrisome for meningitis, although given
   relative [**Name (NI) 12352**], could represent underlying infection.  Has
   negative LP and CT head in ED.
   - tylenol PRN for pain
   - f/u CSF cultures, but no abx coverage for meningitis
   # Conjunctivitis: again, likely from a viral illness.  Is asymptomatic
   at this point, but will monitor clinically.
   - saline eye gtts for now
   - consider cipro gtt if patient becomes more symptomatic
   .
   # ILD: has underlying ILD that has been stable, and today seems at
   baseline.  Reviewing CT scan has stable honeycombing in the peripheries
   and more ground glass infiltrates consistent with different process,
   likely infectious as discussed above.
   - continue nebs
   - PNA/flu treatment as above
   .
   # HIV: on HARRT and per old labs, has high CD4 around 600.  Will need
   to contact outpatient doctor to review meds, recent labs and
   prophylaxis plans for him.
   - continue current regimen
   - contact PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] consider adding prophylaxis based on CD4 count
   .
   # Scleroderma: stable, continue to monitor for now
   .
   # Anemia: had normal hct on presentation and down from 41 to 37 after
   6L of IVFs, so value is likley dilutional.  No reason to suspect
   bleeding elsewhere.
   - guiac stools
   - trend hct
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: mild today, has hx of ITP in [**2136**] after a lung
   biopsy.  He was treated with IVIG and improved.  Steroids were avoided
   at that time in order to prevent a possible scleroderma steroid induced
   renal crisis.  Today's platelets are below his new normal baseline of
   around 160s.
   .
   # Gout: stable, asymptomatic.
   - hold allopurinol in setting of renal failure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: stable, asymptomatic
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals 18 g x2

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, systemic scleroderma, ILD with UIP, and hypothyroidism. The patient presents with fevers, rigors, and no localizing symptoms. He remains hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation. 

The patient has a high fever of 102.0, which is responsive to antipyretics. He has a chronic cough and no true localizing symptoms elsewhere. His chest CT shows possible underlying infection but it's difficult to determine given his underlying ILD. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 7.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.8 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) of 113 K/uL. His creatinine level is persistently elevated at 1.8 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure (ARF). His magnesium level is low and his lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is elevated at 268 IU/L. 

The patient is being treated with antibiotics for suspected pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). He is also receiving medication for his HIV and other underlying conditions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, as indicated by tachypnea and faint bibasilar crackles bilaterally. There"

   Assessment and Plan
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   44 y/o M with hx of HIV, systemic scleroderma, ILD with UIP and
   hypothyroidism who presents with fevers, rigors and no localizing
   symptoms.  Remained hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation.
   .
   # Fevers: Unclear etiology at this time; has chronic cough and has no
   true localizing symptoms elsewhere besides fevers and generalized body
   aches.  Chest CT did possibly show an underlying infection, but
   difficult to detemine given his underlying ILD.  Does have HIV,
   although CD4 count is high, but differential should be broadened.
   Differential includes viral vs. bacterial PNA; in addition,  LDH is
   elevated, so need to consider PCP (less likley given high CD4 count).
   Outside lung pathology, his LP and head CT were normal so do not
   suspect encephalitis or meningitis.  Abd benign, so do not suspect abd
   process, although has elevated AST. Patient continued febrile
   overnight. Responsive to Tylenol, cooling blanket.  DFA negative.
   - Stop tamiflu given DFA negative
   - Continue vanco/CTX/levo for pneumonia as well as Bactrim for UTI
   - F/U BCx, legionella UA
   - Repeat sputum cx including PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Consider ABG if continues febrile, coughing
   - Consider Infectious disease consult
   # Hypotension: was normotensive on presentation to the ED and then was
   hypotensive with SBPs in 70s for approximately 2 hours.  Did not
   initially respond to fluid boluses.  Has since normalized.  Most likely
   secondary to infection and venodilation.  .  Could be adrenal
   insufficiency, although hasn't been on chronic steroids.  Cardiac shock
   less likely given normal EKG and lack of chest pain.
   - continue IVF boluses PRN for MAP <60
   - would use LR if boluses because of mild acidosis
   - consider CVL and pressors if not responsive to IVFs
   - trend lactates, urine output
   # ARF: new ARF from baseline of 1.0; making appropriate urine.  FeNa is
   0.5% which suggest prerenal, although after 6L of NS, his creatinine
   did not improve.  Did start Bactrim recently, although would be strange
   to have this rise in Cr after only one dose. Creatinine persistently
   elevated at 1.8.
   - trend Cr
   - continue fluid resuscitation
   - check urine eos, consider re-check urine lytes if no improvement
   - renally dose meds; avoid nephrotoxins
   # Low magnesium. Unclear etiology. Was not checked on admission so
   difficult to establish trend.
   - Recheck PM lytes
   - Replete PRN
   # High LDH: unclear etiology, although could be consistent with PCP
   pneumonia vs. new lymphoma, which given hx of HIV is more possible.
   - trend LDH
   - pcp sputum smears as above
   - follow up on recent CD4 counts
   # Headache: is mild, less worrisome for meningitis, although given
   relative [**Name (NI) 12352**], could represent underlying infection.  Has
   negative LP and CT head in ED.
   - tylenol PRN for pain
   - f/u CSF cultures, but no abx coverage for meningitis
   # Conjunctivitis: again, likely from a viral illness.  Is asymptomatic
   at this point, but will monitor clinically.
   - saline eye gtts for now
   - consider cipro gtt if patient becomes more symptomatic
   .
   # ILD: has underlying ILD that has been stable, and today seems at
   baseline.  Reviewing CT scan has stable honeycombing in the peripheries
   and more ground glass infiltrates consistent with different process,
   likely infectious as discussed above.
   - continue nebs
   - PNA/flu treatment as above
   .
   # HIV: on HARRT and per old labs, has high CD4 around 600.  Will need
   to contact outpatient doctor to review meds, recent labs and
   prophylaxis plans for him.
   - continue current regimen
   - contact PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] consider adding prophylaxis based on CD4 count
   .
   # Scleroderma: stable, continue to monitor for now
   .
   # Anemia: had normal hct on presentation and down from 41 to 37 after
   6L of IVFs, so value is likley dilutional.  No reason to suspect
   bleeding elsewhere.
   - guiac stools
   - trend hct
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: mild today, has hx of ITP in [**2136**] after a lung
   biopsy.  He was treated with IVIG and improved.  Steroids were avoided
   at that time in order to prevent a possible scleroderma steroid induced
   renal crisis.  Today's platelets are below his new normal baseline of
   around 160s.
   .
   # Gout: stable, asymptomatic.
   - hold allopurinol in setting of renal failure
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: stable, asymptomatic
   - continue levothyroxine at home dose
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals 18 g x2

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, systemic scleroderma, ILD with UIP, and hypothyroidism. He presents with fevers, rigors, and no localizing symptoms. He remains hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation. The differential diagnosis includes viral vs. bacterial pneumonia, and the patient is already on antibiotics for pneumonia and a urinary tract infection (UTI). Other potential complications that can arise from the patient's condition include respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), adrenal insufficiency, acute renal failure (ARF), and low magnesium levels. The patient also has an elevated LDH level, which could be consistent with PCP pneumonia or new lymphoma, especially given his history of HIV. Additionally, the patient has mild conjunctivitis, stable ILD, stable scleroderma, anemia, thrombocytopenia, gout, hypothyroidism, and is on prophylactic heparin for DVT."
