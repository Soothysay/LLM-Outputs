","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, NSAID use, and cirrhosis who presented with hematemesis. She was found to have an esophageal clot overlying a bleeding vessel and received 4 liters of packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and platelets. She is currently intubated and sedated, receiving antibiotics and other ICU medications. 

Her vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 138/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She has a sinus tachycardia rhythm and a fluid balance of 1,165 mL total input and 850 mL output. 

Her lab results indicate a white blood cell count of 16.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 16.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 47.6%, platelet count of 57 K/uL, blood glucose of 175 mg/dL, sodium of 117 mEq/L, potassium of 3.6 mEq/L, chloride of 21 mg/dL, bicarbonate of 17 mEq/L, BUN of 47.6%, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, total bilirubin of 1.9 mg/dL, and albumin of 2.8 g/dL. Her ECG shows a sinus tachycardia rhythm. 

The patient's assessment and plan include gastrointestinal bleed, respiratory failure, and possible hepatopulmonary syndrome. She is being treated for upper gastrointestinal bleeding with proton pump inhibitor and octreotide, and is also being considered for surgery. The respiratory failure is due to a combination of factors such as vocal cord spasm, pulmonary edema, and possibly hepatopulmonary syndrome. 

The patient also has abdominal distention with a bladder pressure of 26, likely caused by massive resuscitation and third spacing. This may require paracentesis. There is also left lower lobe consolidation, which is likely community-acquired pneumonia. The patient is being weaned off sedation, and her glycemic control and nutrition are being monitored."

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of polysubstance abuse, active alcoholism, alcoholic cirrhosis, and chronic NSAID use. She was transferred from another hospital with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which is likely due to bleeding gastric varices. The patient is currently stable, with a small output from the orogastric (OG) tube.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, as she is intubated for vocal cord spasm during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at the previous hospital. She has a large A-a gradient, which is surprising for this indication, and left lower lobe (LLL) consolidation could be contributing. Initially, she was quite acidotic in the setting of ethanol intoxication and volume repletion.

The patient also has leukocytosis and will be treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for a 7-day course starting from [**10-25**]. She has a history of significant alcohol abuse, with an admission level of 200. She will be given versed for withdrawal but will transition to CIWA upon extubation.

The patient's liver function tests show elevated liver enzymes, and she has evidence of portal gastropathy on EGD. She has been diagnosed with alcoholic cirrhosis, chronic NSAID use, acute respiratory failure, and upper GI bleed.

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Ms. [**Known lastname **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], whose note above
   reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize that this 57-year-old woman
   with cirrhosis presents with GI bleeding (total ~12u PRBCs) and severe
   hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to basilar opacities.  GI
   bleed appears to have stabilized somewhat, and we are following
   expectantly at present while continuing octreotide, PPI, etc.  On
   low-Vt ventilation with adequate plateau pressures.  Differential of
   respiratory failure is relatively [**Name2 (NI) 9548**], but CXR + GNR growing in
   sputum makes pneumonia most likely.  Will add additional GNR coverage
   while awaiting speciation/sensitivies.  Agree that TTE is reasonable to
   assess for intracardiac shunt.  Will resite lines, since they are from
   OSH.  Other issues as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]

   on:[**2181-10-26**] 20:49 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, NSAID use, and cirrhosis presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has received 12 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently on low-Vt ventilation with adequate plateau pressures.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has ongoing GI bleeding, which could lead to further blood loss and potential need for additional transfusions or surgical intervention.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to basilar opacities seen on the chest X-ray. This may be caused by pneumonia or another underlying lung condition. The patient is currently on low-Vt ventilation, but there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other complications related to mechanical ventilation.

3. Hepatopulmonary syndrome: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) could be contributing to the respiratory failure. HPS is a condition characterized by intrapulmonary vascular dilatations leading to hypoxemia.

4. Collapsed lung: The patient has a collapsed left lower lobe (LLL) with air bronchograms on the abdominal CT scan. This may be due to aspiration, pneumonia, or another cause.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, NSAID use, and cirrhosis. She presents with respiratory failure and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is currently intubated due to vocal cord spasm but now has a low Pa/FiO2 ratio. She has a history of cirrhosis and may have hepatopulmonary syndrome contributing to her respiratory failure. Her chest X-ray shows progression, particularly at the right base, and there is also evidence of collapsed left lower lobe (LLL) with air bronchograms on the base of the abdomen CT.

The patient has received blood products, including 12 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC), 2 fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 1 cryoprecipitate, and 1 platelet transfusion. She is on pantoprazole (Protonix) infusion, fentanyl (Concentrate) infusion, and octreotide infusion. Other ICU medications include furosemide (Lasix).

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.9°C, heart rate 101 bpm, blood pressure 110/51 mmHg, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. The patient's blood gases show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 111 and pH of 7.34.

   with cirrhosis presents with GI bleeding (total ~12u PRBCs) and severe
   hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to basilar opacities.  GI
   bleed appears to have stabilized somewhat, and we are following
   expectantly at present while continuing octreotide, PPI, etc.  On
   low-Vt ventilation with adequate plateau pressures.  Differential of
   respiratory failure is relatively [**Name2 (NI) 9548**], but CXR + GNR growing in
   sputum makes pneumonia most likely.  Will add additional GNR coverage
   while awaiting speciation/sensitivies.  Agree that TTE is reasonable to

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, NSAID use, and cirrhosis who presented with hematemesis. The patient has been intubated due to vocal cord spasm and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. The patient also has signs of abdominal distention, likely due to massive resuscitation and third spacing.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of cirrhosis, which is a known risk factor for variceal bleeding. This can lead to significant blood loss and potential need for blood transfusion.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's low PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio indicates severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. There are several possible causes, including ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or hepatopulmonary syndrome. Further evaluation with a CT scan and TTE (transesophageal echocardiogram) is needed to determine the exact cause.

3. Abdominal distention: The patient has evidence of abdominal distention with a high bladder pressure of 15. This is likely due to massive resuscitation and third spacing. It may require further evaluation and management to prevent complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome.

4. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol use, and there is a concern for alcohol withdrawal syndrome. App"

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, NSAID use, and cirrhosis. She presented with hematemesis and was found to have an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) with evidence of varices and possible peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The patient is currently intubated due to vocal cord spasm but now has respiratory failure with a low PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio. There is concern for hepatopulmonary syndrome given her history of cirrhosis, and the chest X-ray shows progression, particularly at the right base. The patient also has abdominal distention likely secondary to massive resuscitation and third spacing. The patient's albumin level is low at 2.8 g/dL, and there is no ascites amenable to paracentesis. The patient is expected to undergo a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) prior to probable transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. Surgical consultation has been obtained for further management."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications. These include alcohol withdrawal, upper gastrointestinal bleed, lower gastrointestinal bleed, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. They have no known drug allergies and have been receiving antibiotics, specifically ceftriaxone and vancomycin.

The vital signs indicate that the patient's temperature is within normal range, but their heart rate is slightly elevated. Their blood pressure is on the lower side, and their respiratory rate is within normal limits. The patient's oxygen saturation is at 98% while on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,813 mL with 1,782 mL given through intravenous fluids. The output includes 2,115 mL of urine, 75 mL of nasogastric drainage, and 30 mL of chest tube drainage. The net fluid balance is positive at 698 mL.

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. The positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is set at 12 cmH2O, and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 70%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a slightly acidic pH with normal partial pressures of oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was transferred from OSH with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, now with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and likely pneumonia/sepsis. The patient is currently intubated for vocal cord spasm in the setting of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at OSH. She is also being treated for ethanol (ETOH) withdrawal and abuse.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Upper GI bleed recurrence: The patient had a stable upper GI bleed but still has a small output from the OG tube. Monitoring for any signs of rebleeding and continuing with prophylactic measures like PPI and octreotide drip.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has likely pneumonia, as indicated by LLL consolidation. It is important to continue treatment with antibiotics and monitor for any worsening respiratory status.

3. Sepsis: Given the presence of ARDS and pneumonia, there is a risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is crucial.

4. ARDS progression: The patient is already diagnosed with ARDS. It is important to closely monitor her respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings accordingly.

5. ETOH withdrawal symptoms: The patient has a significant history of ETOH abuse, and she is currently experiencing withdrawal symptoms. It is important to manage her withdrawal symptoms appropriately with medications such"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of polysubstance abuse, active alcoholism, alcoholic cirrhosis, and chronic NSAID use. She was transferred from the operating room with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which is now stable. The cause of the bleed could be bleeding gastric varices, an ulcer, gastritis, or Mallory-Weiss tear. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed extensive portal gastropathy. The patient is currently intubated for vocal cord spasm during an EGD at OSH. There is left lower lobe (LLL) consolidation, possibly due to aspiration in the setting of hematemesis. The patient has leukocytosis and will be treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for a 7-day course starting from [**10-25**]. The patient also has a history of significant alcohol abuse with an admission level of 200. She will be given versed for alcohol withdrawal but will transition to CIWA upon extubation. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.2 C, heart rate 86 bpm, blood pressure 87/49 mmHg, respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 99%, and sinus rhythm. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's plan includes a proton"

   1. UGIB
 diff dx includes varices, PUD.  Appreciate liver input.
   Likely will need repeat EGD- if varix visualized will likely need
   TIPS.  Has only needed plt/cryo while in house.
     - q6h hct, transfusion threshold 25
       - cont protonix gtt,
     -  octreotide gtt x5
     - surgery following
   2. Respiratory failure
 ARDS. Intubated for vocal cord spasm but now
   w/ low P/F ratio. ? shunt given high oxygen requirement and lack of
   correction.   Given h/o cirrhosis, may well have hepatopulmonary
   syndrome contributing.   CXR concerning for progression particularly at
   R base.  Collapse at bases due to abd distention likely
   underappreciated on CXR.   Also component of V/Q given worsening
   interstitial edema
 pulmonary edema vs TRALI vs aspiration vs.
   Definitely has collapsed LLL w/ air bronchograms on base of abd CT from
   [**9-23**].
   - Given GNRs in sputum double covering pseudomonas, repeat sputum
   culture.
   - change abx to vanc/cefepime x 8days.
   - wean FIO2 as tolerated, continue PEEP 8.
   -TTE to r/o intracardiac shunt.
   - repeat CXR
   - ARDS net vent (given b/l opacities).
   - will try propofol addition to attempt to maintain low Vt.
   3. Low grade fever

   translocation.   Has remained w/o a vasopressor requirement thus far.
   Is on appropriate broad spectrum coverage.
   4. Abd distention- bladder pressure 15.  Likely due to massive
   resuscitation and third spacing.  Doubt ischemic bowel given
   hemodynamic stability.  Albumin 2.8  No ascites amenable to
   paracentesis when evaluated w/ u/s yesterday.  Dramatically improved
   today.

","Summary:
- 57-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, NSAID use, and cirrhosis presenting with respiratory failure and gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Patient is intubated and sedated.
- Hemodynamic monitoring shows low blood pressure and high heart rate.
- The patient has received multiple blood products and has a low platelet count.
- Lab results indicate low sodium, potassium, and albumin levels.
- Chest X-ray shows progression of lung disease, possibly ARDS.
- Sputum culture is positive for Gram-negative rods, and antibiotics have been changed to cover pseudomonas.
- The patient's fever may be due to a central venous line infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Abdominal distention is likely due to massive resuscitation and third spacing.
- The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and further evaluation is needed for possible TIPS procedure.
- The patient has been weaned off vasopressors and is hemodynamically stable.
- Alcohol withdrawal symptoms have been managed with versed.
- The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to ARDS, possibly exacerbated by hepatopulmonary syndrome.
- Further imaging studies and interventions are planned, including a repeat endoscopy to visualize varices, repeat sputum culture, and CT scan of the abdomen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) - likely due to esophageal varices or peptic ulcer"

   Likely will need repeat EGD prior to probable TIPS.
     - q6h hct, transfusion threshold 31
     - check fibrinogen level
     - cont protonix gtt,
     - octreotide x5
     - surgery following
   2. Respiratory failure - intubated for vocal cord spasm but now w/ low
   P/F ratio. ? shunt given high oxygen requirement and lack of
   correction.   Given h/o cirrhosis, may well have hepatopulmonary
   syndrome contributing.   CXR concerning for progression particularly at
   R base.  Collapse at bases due to abd distention likely
   underappreciated on CXR.   Also component of V/Q given worsening
   interstitial edema
 pulmonary edema vs TRALI vs aspiration vs.
   Definitely has collapsed LLL w/ air bronchograms on base of abd CT from
   [**9-23**].
   -wean FIO2 as tolerated, continue PEEP 8.
   -TTE to r/o intracardiac shunt.
   - repeat CXR
   - ARDS net vent (given b/l opacities).
   - will try propofol addition to attempt to maintain low Vt.
   - change abx to vanc/cefepime x 8days.
   4. Abd distention- bladder pressure 15.  Likely due to massive
   resuscitation and third spacing.  Doubt ischemic bowel given
   hemodynamic stability.  Albumin 2.8  No ascites amenable to
   paracentesis when evaluated w/ u/s yesterday.  Dramatically improved
   today.
   3. Alcohol w/d- versed
   5. Non gap acidosis -  renal fxn intact.   If needs fluids will plan
   for D5 w/ bicarb.
   6. Leukocytosis- UA/blood/sputum.  Likely pulmonary as above.

   Critical Care Attending:
   Patient admitted to ICU with GI bleed (hemetemesis) and acute
   respiratory failure following endoscopy. Portal gastropathy identified
   at endoscopy. No additional  transfusions required, although seems to
   be oozing small amount of blood. Melena still p resent. Hemodynamically
   stable. On octreotide and protonix. Respiratory status consistent with
   ARDS physiology although CXR not that impressive. Now down to FIO2=0.6.
   On vanco, zosyn, cipro (gram negative rods in sputum).
   On exam, patient intubated and sedated. Chest is very clear
   anteriorally and laterally. Heart sounds are soft. No gallop or murmur
   heard. Abdomen distended with reduced bowel sounds. Extremities warm
   and well perfused; good capillary refill.
   Patient still has moderate drainage of bloody material from OG tube,
   although Hct is stable at 40. Due for repeat endoscopy on Monday.
   Oxygenation improving. Would come down on FIO2 tonight to 50 and then
   try to reduce the PEEP further.
   Critical Care 30 mins.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, NSAID use, and cirrhosis presenting with respiratory failure and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient is currently intubated and sedated due to vocal cord spasm and low P/F ratio. 

The patient's medical history includes hematemesis, and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed portal gastropathy. The patient has been receiving octreotide and pantoprazole (Protonix) for ongoing bleeding. 

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 28 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The patient's oxygenation has been improving, and the attending physician plans to reduce the FiO2 to 50 tonight and then further decrease PEEP.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.1 x 10^3/mcL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and abnormal kidney function tests (creatinine). The patient's albumin level is low at 2.8 g/dL, indicating possible malnutrition or chronic liver disease.

The patient's abdomen is distended, likely due to massive resuscitation and third spacing. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who was transferred from another hospital with an upper gastrointestinal bleed. She now presents with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and likely pneumonia/sepsis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but she requires intensive care unit (ICU) support. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been receiving sedation and analgesia, as well as antibiotics for suspected pneumonia. She also has a history of significant alcohol abuse and is being treated for alcohol withdrawal. The patient's gastrointestinal bleed appears to have stabilized, but she will undergo an upper endoscopy to further evaluate the source of bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS may progress, leading to worsening respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. Adjustments to sedation and ventilator settings may be required.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's current presentation suggests pneumonia, which can worsen and lead to sepsis. Continuous monitoring of temperature, white blood cell count, and other signs of infection is essential. Antibiotics should be continued as per the current regimen.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Although the patient's upper gastrointestinal bleed seems to have stabilized, there is a risk of rebleeding or progression to lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Regular monitoring of vital signs, hemoglobin levels, and stool output is necessary. Upper"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-inch tall individual with a weight of 200 pounds. They were admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS). The patient's medical history includes alcohol withdrawal, gastrointestinal bleed (upper and lower), and respiratory failure. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: 
- Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
- Heart rate: 84 bpm (82-97 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 103/54 mmHg (73/49-122/64 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute (27-28 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set Vt 400 mL, set RR 28, PEEP 10 cmH2O, FiO2 50%, PIP 36 cmH2O, plateau pressure 23 cmH2O, SpO2 98%, ABG 7.31/39/86, Ve 12.3 L/min, PaO2/FiO2 174.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 9 mmHg (9-15 mmHg), bladder pressure of 22 mmHg (22-22 mmHg), total in of 5,032 mL (+/-489 mL), and total out of 1,278 mL (+/-211 mL). Fluid balance is 3,754 mL (+/-278 mL).

The patient's labs show:
- WBC: 13.0 / 11.6 K/uL
- Hemoglobin: 13.5 g/dL
- Sodium: 121 mg/dL
- Potassium: 1.0 mg/dL
- Chloride: 18 mEq/L
- Glucose: 38.7%
- Creatinine: 22 mg/dL
- AST/ALT: 22/49
- INR: 1.2
- PT/PTT: 14.2/31.6
- TCO2: 21-22
- Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
- LDH: 185 IU/L
- Calcium: 7.7 mg/dL
- Magnesium: 1.3 mg/dL
- Phosphate: 2.6 mg/dL

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a potential risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of both upper and lower gastrointestinal bleeding. There is a potential risk of ongoing bleeding and need for endoscopic intervention.
3. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal, which can lead to complications such as seizures, delirium tremens, and autonomic dysregulation.
4. Fluid Balance: The patient has an ongoing positive fluid balance, which may increase the risk of fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests renal dysfunction, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid retention.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged INR and PT/PTT indicate coagulopathy, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and other lab abnormalities may indicate an ongoing infection.

Please note that this is a summary of the progress note, and further evaluation and assessment are required for an accurate diagnosis and management plan."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who was transferred to the ICU with upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and likely pneumonia/sepsis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She is being treated for alcohol withdrawal, upper GI bleed, and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of upper GI bleed, which could potentially recur or worsen.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS and requires mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Sepsis: The patient is likely suffering from pneumonia/sepsis, which can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
4. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has a significant history of alcohol abuse and is currently experiencing withdrawal symptoms. If not appropriately managed, this could lead to complications such as seizures and delirium tremens.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status and cognitive dysfunction.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of GI bleeding and is at risk of developing coagulopathy due to ongoing blood loss and the use of anticoagulant medications.

   1. UGIB
 diff dx includes varices, PUD.  Appreciate liver input.
   Await repeat EGD- if varix visualized will likely need TIPS.  Continues
   to ooze BRB and have melana, although Hct trend has been slow.  Has
   only needed plt/cryo while in house.

     -  surgery following
   2. Respiratory failure
 ARDS, although physiologically compliance has
   not dropped. Intubated for vocal cord spasm but now w/ low P/F ratio.
   Collapse at bases due to abd distention likely underappreciated on
   CXR.   Also component of V/Q given worsening interstitial edema
   pulmonary edema vs TRALI vs aspiration, as well.  Definitely has
   collapsed LLL w/ air bronchograms on base of abd CT from [**9-23**] but has
   continued to expand over the last several days.
   - Given GNRs in sputum double covering pseudomonas, repeat sputum
   culture.
   - change abx to vanc/cefepime x 8days.
   - wean FIO2 as tolerated, continue to decrease PEEP.
   -TTE to r/o intracardiac shunt.
   - repeat CXR
   - ARDS net vent (given b/l opacities).
   3. Low grade fever
 possibly [**1-1**] OSH CVL (removed) vs. VAP vs. GIB and
   translocation.   Has remained w/o a vasopressor requirement thus far.
   Is on appropriate broad spectrum coverage.
   4. Abd distention- bladder pressure 15.  Likely due to massive
   resuscitation and third spacing.  Doubt ischemic bowel given
   hemodynamic stability.  Albumin 2.8  No ascites amenable to
   paracentesis when evaluated w/ u/s yesterday.  Dramatically improved

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, NSAID use, and cirrhosis. She presented with hematemesis and was found to have an esophageal-gastric junction (EGD) clot overlying a bleeding vessel. She received 4 liters of blood products and 2 fresh frozen plasma units. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide history. She has been intubated for vocal cord spasm but now requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient also has a low-grade fever, abdominal distention, alcohol withdrawal symptoms, non-gap metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, and potential complications related to cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and NSAID use, both of which are risk factors for variceal bleeding. The presence of an EGD clot suggests that the bleeding may be due to esophageal varices or peptic ulcer disease.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has a history of cirrhosis, which may contribute to hepatopulmonary syndrome. The chest X-ray shows concern for progression, particularly at the right base, and there is evidence of interstitial edema. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis indicates hypoxemia, and further investigations are needed to determine the cause of the"

   I was physically present with the housetaff team on this date for
   discussion of the above history, exam, data and assessment and plan
   with which I agree.  I would add the following comments.
   Patient is a 57 yo female admitted with hematemesis and given large
   volume transfusion with HCT=47 and was intubated prior to EGD at the
   OSH.  Patient did have EGD here with clot in stomach and portal
   gastropathy seen.  No intervention performed.
   Now
   EXAM-
   -Patient with limited RR in PSV and baseline Ve appears to be 12 for
   requirement
   CXR
Left sided SC catheter in good position.  ETT in good position and
   OGT in good position.  He has significant left sided effusion noted
   with some improvement in aeration.
   A/P-By problems
   1)Respiratory Failure
patient with bilateral infiltrates and left lower
   lobe collapse noted as possible contributors to persistent failure.
   -Continue A/C support
   -Will move to wean PEEP as tolerated
   -Look to move to PSV with further wean of sedation given
   apnea/bradypnea on PSV today
   2)GI Bleed-
   -EGD tomorrow for eval for intervention
   -Octreotide
   -PPI in place
   -HCT check to determine transfusion need
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, NSAID use, and cirrhosis. The patient presented with hematemesis and was initially stabilized in the operating room with an endotracheal tube (ETT) placement.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. UGIB (Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding): The patient has ongoing bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, likely secondary to esophageal varices or peptic ulcer disease. Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned to visualize and potentially intervene if varices are identified. The patient continues to ooze blood and has melena. The hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has been slowly trending downward, but the patient has only required platelets and cryoprecipitate transfusions so far.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may be associated with aspiration, pulmonary edema, or transient receptor-mediated asthma syndrome (TRALI). The patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters are being closely monitored, and the ventilator settings are being adjusted accordingly. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and a repeat sputum culture is pending. The possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) should also be considered.
3. Low-grade fever: The patient has a low-grade fever, which could be attributed to various"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with an upper gastrointestinal bleed. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and likely pneumonia/sepsis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/60 to 134/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 50%, and temperature within normal range. The patient is intubated due to vocal cord spasm during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at a previous hospital.

The patient's laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, slightly increased platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging reveals bilateral opacities on chest X-ray, indicating possible pneumonia or lung consolidation. Microbiology cultures indicate the presence of gram-negative rods and budding yeast, suggesting a possible infection.

The patient's current medications include propofol, fentanyl, midazolam, octreotide, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. She is also receiving prophylactic treatment for stress ulcers with pantoprazole.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include further deterioration of respiratory status, development"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis who presented with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She is currently intubated and in the ICU for respiratory failure, likely pneumonia/sepsis, and has a history of significant alcohol abuse.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 126/60 to 134/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's temperature is within normal range.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including PPI (proton pump inhibitor), octreotide, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). She has also been monitored closely with frequent checks of her hemoglobin (Hct) levels, INR (international normalized ratio), and coagulation profile.

The patient's blood culture results indicate the presence of gram-negative rods and budding yeast. The respiratory culture shows sparse growth of commensal respiratory flora and yeast.

The patient's current plan includes continuing the administration of PPI, octreotide, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. She will undergo an upper endoscopy to further evaluate the source of the GI bleed. Her Hct levels will be monitored, and she will be kept sedated"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 57-year-old female with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and UGIB (upper gastrointestinal bleeding). The patient has undergone an endoscopy that revealed a potential ulcer in the fundus of the stomach and portal hypertensive gastropathy, but no gastric varices were seen. The patient was started on Carafate 1 gram QID, IV PPI (proton pump inhibitor), and the octreotide drip was discontinued.

The patient is currently intubated for vocal cord spasm and has failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) due to an increased respiratory rate, likely as a compensatory mechanism for metabolic acidosis. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is receiving multiple IV medications including propofol, antibiotics (Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam), pantoprazole, and others.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 176/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 26 mmHg, HCO3- of 18 mEq/L, and base excess of -3 mEq/L.

The patient's lab results indicate a"

   small adherent ulcer and portal gastropathy seen
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **] plus Carafate
   -d/c octreotide drip
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct, with goal to keep Hct > 30 if acute drop from 38.7 and 25 if

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) and UGIB (upper gastrointestinal bleeding). The patient underwent an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) which revealed a potential ulcer in the fundus of the stomach, no gastric varices, and prescribed Carafate 1 gram QID, IV PPI, and discontinuation of octreotide. The patient is unable to provide history as she is sedated. She has been receiving antibiotics, specifically Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and decreased oxygen saturation. She has been intubated due to vocal chord spasm and failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for RR > 35. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, set Vt of 400 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 10, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 106. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and metabolic acidosis. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal. She is currently on propofol for withdrawal but will transition to CIWA upon extubation. The patient's medical team is considering feeding options, monitoring"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She is currently intubated for airway protection due to GIB. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) yesterday, which did not reveal any active bleeding lesions but identified a likely source for a previous upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed. The patient's respiratory rate has increased this morning, and she is now back on pressure support ventilation (PSV). She has no known drug allergies. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, propofol, pantoprazole, albuterol/atrovent, insulin sliding scale, folic acid, MVI, thiamine, carafate, and lactulose as needed.

24-hour events:
- EGD without active bleeding lesion but identified likely source for prior UGI bleed.
- Increased respiratory rate this morning with spontaneous breathing trial (SBT); now back on PSV.

Vital signs:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
- Heart rate: 103 bpm (80-108 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 182/91 mmHg (130/72-198/105 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute (18-36 breaths per minute)

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), who has been intubated for airway protection. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) yesterday, which did not reveal any active bleeding lesion but identified a likely source for a previous upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed. The patient's respiratory rate has increased this morning, and she is now back on pressure support ventilation (PSV). The patient has no known drug allergies. She has been receiving antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and vancomycin. The patient is currently on propofol infusion and receiving other ICU medications such as pantoprazole, albuterol/atrovent, insulin sliding scale, folic acid, MVI, thiamine, carafate, and lactulose as needed.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the increased respiratory rate. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure of 182/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is in sinus tachycardia. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,269 mL and output of 2,310 mL,"

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics given were ciprofloxacin on 10/30/2181 at 12:00 AM, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 10/30/2181 at 08:38 AM, and vancomycin on 10/30/2181 at 08:38 AM.

The patient is currently on various infusions and medications, including propofol, pantoprazole (Protonix), albuterol/atropine, insulin sliding scale, folic acid, MVI (multivitamins), thiamine, carafate, and lactulose as needed.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
- Heart rate: 103 beats per minute (bpm) with a normal range of 80-108 bpm
- Blood pressure: 182/91 mmHg with a normal range of 120/72-198/105 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute with a normal range of 18-36 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 92%
- Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a maximum temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), current temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 182/91 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,269 mL and output of 2,310 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -41 mL. The patient's urine output is 2,060 mL, NG (nasogastric) output is 50 mL, and stool output is 200 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 106. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.45, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 450, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 26.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She has been intubated for airway protection due to GIB. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) yesterday, which did not reveal any active bleeding lesion but identified a likely source for a prior upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed.

The patient's respiratory rate (RR) has increased this morning, and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) was performed, resulting in being placed back on pressure support ventilation (PSV). Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate (HR) of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 182/91 mmHg to 130/72 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 92%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,269 mL and output of 2,310 mL, with urine output of 2,060 mL. She is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and ICU medications. The patient has allergies to no known drugs.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the noted respiratory changes. Physical examination reveals clear anterior fields on chest, regular rapid regular rhythm with no murmur on"

   A/P
   57 yo F with alcoholic cirrhosis transferred from OSH with upper GI
   bleed now w/ ARDS and likely PNA/sepsis
   # Resp status: Intubated for vocal chord spasm in setting of EGD at
   OSH. A-a gradient surprisingly large for this indication; does not have
   ARDS but may have significant shunt from LLL consolidation vs collapse
   (which is slowly improving on CXR. Failed SBT this am for increased RR
   after weening from sedation. Developing worsening respiratory
   alkalosis. Possibly due to hepatopulmonary vs. agitated delirium vs.
   withdrawal.
   - Treat PNA w/ 7 days vanc/piptazo; double GNR covg with cipro given
   GNRs in sputum
   -Continue sedation for now, haldol had no effect yesterday
   - serial ABGs, vent adjustments. Decrease PEEP and FiO2 today as
   oxygenation good
   #  Upper GI bleed:, now stable.  Hct stable with slightly improved
   bloody OG and rectal tube output. No active bleeding seen on EGD but
   small adherent ulcer and portal gastropathy seen
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **] plus Carafate
   -Daily Hct, with goal to keep Hct > 30 if acute drop from 38.7 and 25
   if continued slow drop.
   - monitor for coagulopathy
   - >= 2 peripheral IVs at all times.
   - ABX ppx in setting of GIB (cipro & zosyn)
   - if decompensates, would refer to IR for TIPS per GI recs
   - GI/ hepatology following, follow up recs
   - follow fibrinogen, calcium, platelets
   #Metabolic acidosis: Non-gap acidosis. On no medications (diuretics)
   that could be contributing. Renal function normal.  Elevated osmolar
   gap but unlikely to be ethanol or methanol this late. [**Month (only) 11**] be starvation
   ketosis.
   -Consider feeding with tube feeds vs. IV D5W
   # ETOH withdrawal: Hx of signicant ETOH abuse, level of 200 on

","Summary:
- The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, active alcoholism, alcoholic cirrhosis, and chronic NSAID use.
- She was transferred from another hospital with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
- She is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and likely pneumonia/sepsis.
- She has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
- Her condition includes delirium tremens, seizures, metabolic acidosis, and ethanol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS and likely pneumonia/sepsis put her at risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. Infection: Pneumonia and sepsis are potential complications due to her compromised immune system.
3. Bleeding: Although her upper GI bleeding has stabilized, there is a risk of rebleeding or development of a lower GI bleed.
4. Hepatopulmonary Syndrome: As a complication of liver cirrhosis, the patient may develop hepatopulmonary syndrome, which can lead to hypoxemia.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver dysfunction may progress to hepatic encephalopathy, causing altered mental status and cognitive impairment.
6. Ethanol Withdrawal: With a history of significant alcohol abuse, the patient is at risk for severe ethanol withdrawal symptoms, including seizures and delirium tremens.
7. Metabolic Imbalance: The patient's"

   # Resp status: Intubated for vocal chord spasm in setting of EGD at
   OSH. A-a gradient surprisingly large for this indication; does not have
   ARDS but may have significant shunt from LLL consolidation vs collapse
   (which is slowly improving on CXR. Failed SBT this am for increased RR
   after weening from sedation. Developing worsening respiratory
   alkalosis. Possibly due to hepatopulmonary vs. agitated delirium vs.
   withdrawal.vs agitation from small ETT. Haldol had little effect
   yesterday
   - Treat PNA w/ 7 days vanc/piptazo, d/c cipro
   -Change sedation to Precedex with anticipated extubation tomorrow am
   -Diurese with IV lasix, goal ->1L
   - serial ABGs, vent adjustments. Decrease PEEP and FiO2 today as
   oxygenation good
   #  Upper GI bleed:, now stable.  Hct stable with slightly improved
   bloody OG and rectal tube output. No active bleeding seen on EGD but
   small adherent ulcer and portal gastropathy seen
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **] plus Carafate
   -Daily Hct, with goal to keep Hct > 30 if acute drop from 38.7 and 25
   if continued slow drop.
   - monitor for coagulopathy
   - >= 2 peripheral IVs at all times.
   - ABX ppx in setting of GIB (cipro & zosyn)

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of polysubstance abuse, active alcoholism, and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was transferred from another facility with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient is currently intubated due to vocal cord spasms and is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, with a high respiratory system resistance and inadequate oxygenation despite being on CPAP/PSV mode. She failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) this morning due to increased respiratory rate after weaning from sedation. The patient also has worsening respiratory alkalosis, possibly due to hepatopulmonary syndrome, agitation, delirium, or withdrawal symptoms.

In terms of laboratory results, the patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is elevated, hemoglobin (Hct) is within normal range, and platelet count is slightly low. Liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated bilirubin levels, while kidney function is within normal limits. Blood cultures revealed yeast infection.

The patient's abdominal exam shows soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. Lower extremity edema is noted, but no other significant findings.

The patient is being treated for pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and her sedation regimen is being changed to precedex with anticipated extub"

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a high RSBI and respiratory alkalosis when off sedation, suspecting anxiety/pain response. Sedation seems to be a primary issue driving respiratory rate. The patient may require further sedation or other interventions to manage respiratory status.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes (somnolent, does not respond to commands) could be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy, which is common in patients with cirrhosis. This condition requires careful management and may necessitate lactulose or other treatments.
3. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) and is on appropriate antibiotic therapy. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.
4. Bleeding: The patient's history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding indicates a risk for further bleeding episodes. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and maintaining appropriate prophylaxis is crucial.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient has an imbalance in fluid intake and output, leading to fluid overload. Careful management of fluid balance is necessary to prevent complications such as pulmonary edema or hepatic hydrothorax.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels have been well-controlled, but close monitoring is required to prevent hypoglycemia, especially during diuresis and other interventions.
7. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's abnormal liver function tests (ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, INR) indicate ongoing hepatic dysfunction. Monitoring these values and adjusting medication dosages accordingly is important.
8. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine level"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who was transferred from another hospital with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She is now experiencing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and likely pneumonia/sepsis. The patient was intubated due to vocal cord spasm during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). She failed a spontaneous breathing trial this morning due to increased respiratory rate after weaning from sedation. She is developing worsening respiratory alkalosis, possibly due to hepatopulmonary syndrome or agitation from the endotracheal tube.

Plan:
- Treat pneumonia with 7 days of vancomycin/piperacillin-tazobactam, discontinue ciprofloxacin
- Change sedation to precedex with anticipated extubation tomorrow morning
- Diurese with intravenous lasix, goal output of 1 liter
- Monitor serial arterial blood gases (ABGs) and make vent adjustments. Decrease positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and fractional inspiration of oxygen (FiO2) today as oxygenation is good
- Continue pantoprazole and carafate for upper GI bleed
- Monitor hematocrit (Hct) and aim to keep it above 30 if there is an acute drop, or 25 if there is a continued slow drop
- Monitor for coagulopathy and follow up with GI/hepatology for further recommendations
- Monitor fibrinogen, calcium, and platelets levels
- Continue lactulose and rifaximin via nasogastric tube for esophageal varices
- Transition from propofol to CIWA for ethanol withdrawal upon extubation
- Consider thiamine, folate, social work support for ethanol abuse
- Provide total parenteral nutrition (TPN) if intubation continues past tomorrow
- Provide proton pump inhibitor (PPI), bowel regimen, and other necessary treatments as per plan."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who was transferred from another hospital with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and is now experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and likely pneumonia/sepsis. The patient was recently extubated and is currently on a 70% face mask with ongoing treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (HR) within the normal range, blood pressure (BP) within normal limits, respiratory rate (RR) slightly above normal, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 95%. The patient's temperature (Tcurrent) is slightly below normal, and maximum temperature (Tmax) is within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals upper airway wheeze while moaning, no crackles, trace lower extremity edema, and soft abdomen with no tenderness, normal bowel sounds, and positive blood sugars. The patient is alert and speaking but not oriented.

The patient's laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet (Plt) levels. However, the creatinine (Cr) level is slightly elevated, and the blood glucose level is high. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and was transferred with an upper GI bleed. She is currently being treated for AR"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She was initially intubated for airway protection but was extubated on [**10-31**]. The patient continues to have ongoing diuresis and is showing improvement in her neurological status. However, she still requires respiratory support with the use of bronchodilators and aggressive pulmonary toilet to clear secretions. Her blood pressure is elevated, and she has been started on chlorthalidone for hypertension. The patient's white blood cell count is trending upwards, and repeat cultures, urinalysis, and Clostridium difficile testing are needed. The patient remains in the ICU until oxygenation improves and she can be weaned off the face mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia and respiratory failure: The patient may experience further respiratory distress or develop pneumonia due to prolonged intubation and immobilization.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: There is a risk of re-bleeding or worsening of the gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis and ongoing diuresis may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, causing confusion and altered mental status.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests a potential infection. If left untreated, it could lead to sepsis or organ failure.
5. Deep vein thrombosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and now presents with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and likely pneumonia/sepsis. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 144/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a high-flow nasal cannula. The patient's lab results show elevated potassium levels, hyponatremia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and impaired kidney function. She is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, diuretics, and medications for gastrointestinal protection. The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to prolonged intubation and sedation. Her upper gastrointestinal bleed is stable, but she requires ongoing monitoring and management of her coagulopathy. She also has evidence of hepatic encephalopathy and ESLD (end-stage liver disease) with a MELD score of 14. The patient's ethanol abuse is being addressed with thiamine, folate, and social work support. She has an arterial line and multi-lumen central venous catheter in place. The plan is to continue weaning off mechanical ventilation and consider extubation if the patient's condition improves."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis who is currently in the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She has been extubated for two days and remains in the ICU due to oxygenation issues. The patient has experienced diuresis yesterday, is febrile this morning, and has difficulty following commands with disorientation. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presents with monophasic upper airway sound and slight wheezing, indicating possible respiratory failure. A chest X-ray has been ordered to further evaluate the situation. Diuretics will be continued gently, aiming for a target negative fluid balance of 500 mL.
2. Delirium: The patient is exhibiting signs of delirium, which could be caused by toxic-metabolic factors. Haloperidol (Haldol) will be administered to manage hypoactive delirium. Benzodiazepines and narcotics should be avoided.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): Although the GIB has resolved, the patient's hematocrit (HCT) remains stable. 
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, but cdiff negativity has been confirmed. Blood cultures, urine, and urine culture tests will be conducted to further investigate. Arterial lines will be discontinued, and a peripheral IV line will be established if possible. An ultrasound abdomen will be performed to assess"

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She has been extubated for two days and is currently in the ICU due to oxygenation issues. The patient experienced diuresis yesterday, is febrile this morning, and has been receiving various medications including antibiotics, diuretics, and proton pump inhibitors.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 147/70 mmHg to 103/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,037 mL and output of 6,215 mL, with a negative balance of 3,178 mL. Respiratory support is provided through high-flow nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 97% and ABG results indicating respiratory alkalosis.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be awake but disoriented, with difficulty following commands. There are diffuse monophasic high-pitched expiratory sounds in the chest, regular rapid regular rhythm in the cardiovascular system, and mildly distended abdomen with 2+ edema in the extremities.

Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and slightly increased plate"

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   57 yo F with alcoholic cirrhosis transferred from OSH with upper GI
   bleed now w/ ARDS and likely PNA/sepsis
   # Resp status: Has been tachypnic/hyperpnic w/ a respiratory alkalosis
   since extubation. Also exhibited same behavior prior to extubation with
   weaning. Pt. appears very anxious with tachycardia and hypertension,
   appears hypervigilant. Still has significant O2 requirement but
   responded well to suctioning and diuresis.
   -          Wean O2
   -    Continue diuresis today, goal >1L negative
   -          Chest PT/suctioning
   -   Will check LENIS for risk stratification of PE but less likely
   # Altered mental status: Slowly improving. Nonfocal likely
   toxic/metabolic given prolonged intubation/sedation. Could be [**1-1**]
   infection, possibly SBP. Likely from prolonged intubation/ slow
   clearance of sedating medications.
   -          follow neuro exam
   -        PRN haldol for agitation
   #Leukocytosis: Cdiff negative yesterday. Concern for possible line
   infection, line sites are not significantly erythematous w/ no
   purulence. Would also consider SBP in this cirrhotic but para negative.
   Could also be secondary to skin breakdown around anus w/ frequent
   stooling. Improving today.
   -d/c CVL and a-line
   -F/U cultures
   - Hold Abx for now
   .
   #  Upper GI bleed:, Stable, no e/o continued bleeding.
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **] plus Carafate
   -Daily Hct, with goal to keep Hct > 30 if acute drop from 38.7 and 25
   if continued slow drop.
   - monitor for coagulopathy
   - >= 2 peripheral IVs at all times.
   - if decompensates, would refer to IR for TIPS per GI recs
   - GI/ hepatology following, follow up recs
   #ESLD:  MELD 14. Doubt that her confusion is [**1-1**] ESLD given low MELD.
   Continue lactulose and rifaxamin via NGT
   -          F/u liver recs
   -          Avoid benzos, NSAIDs
   # HTN: Still elevated  today on Captopril 50mg TID
   -Consider adding amlodipine today, hopefully will improve with
   decreased agitation

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who was transferred from another hospital with upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding. She now has acute respiratory failure (not ARDS) and likely pneumonia (PNA)/sepsis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 162/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her general appearance is well-nourished, with no signs of distress. The physical examination reveals normal cardiovascular and peripheral vascular findings, as well as symmetric chest expansion and resonant percussion. Bowel sounds are present, and the abdomen is soft and non-tender. Neurologic examination shows no focal deficits, but the patient appears anxious with tachycardia and hypertension.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.6 K/uL and a hemoglobin level of 12.5 g/dL. Blood cultures are pending. Imaging shows improvement in pulmonary edema and left upper lobe opacity, but there is a persistent left retrocardiac basilar opacity likely due to atelectasis, which cannot be excluded as an infection. The abdominal ultrasound is still pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, altered mental status, leuk"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was transferred from another hospital with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She now has acute respiratory failure (not ARDS) and likely pneumonia/sepsis. The patient's respiratory status has been characterized by tachypnea and hyperpnea with respiratory alkalosis since extubation. She also exhibited similar behavior prior to extubation during weaning. The patient appears anxious with tachycardia and hypertension, appearing hypervigilant. Despite significant O2 requirements, she responded well to suctioning and diuresis.

The patient's altered mental status is slowly improving, likely due to prolonged intubation/sedation. It could be a result of infection, possibly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). There is concern for possible line infection or SBP given leukocytosis, but the para-negative result reduces the likelihood of SBP. Another possibility is secondary to skin breakdown around the anus due to frequent stooling.

The patient's upper GI bleed is stable, with no evidence of continued bleeding. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and Carafate are being administered. Daily hemoglobin (Hct) monitoring is planned, aiming to keep Hct > 30 if there is an acute drop from 38.7, and 25 if there is a continued slow"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and required intubation. She remains hypoxemic following extubation. The patient underwent an abdominal ultrasound, which showed minimal ascites, and subsequently had a paracentesis without evidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She experienced an episode of increased hypoxemia overnight, which improved with suctioning and diuresis. The patient's blood pressure increased, so her anti-hypertensive medications were uptitrated. She is currently on multiple medications, including haloperidol, morphine sulfate, labetalol, pantoprazole, furosemide, and others.

Flowsheet data shows that her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/66 mmHg to 189/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm, and her height is 65 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,301 mL, output of 1,171 mL, and a negative balance of 426 mL. She has received a total of 1,890 mL of blood products.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC)"

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis who presented with an upper gastrointestinal bleed and is currently stable and improving in oxygenation. The patient was previously on mechanical ventilation but has been weaned off and is now on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/61 to 158/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's temperature is within normal range, and their rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient has received various medications including haloperidol, sucralfate, heparin sodium, pantoprazole, folic acid, MVI, insulin sliding scale, PPI, carafate, rifaximin, captopril, amlodipine, and nystatin.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted improvement in oxygenation. The flowsheet data shows stable vital signs, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypoxemia: Improving overall, with mild volume overload and secretions. Continue pulmonary toilet and incentive spirometer, and initiate diuresis with a goal of reducing tidal volume by 500-1000 mL.
2. Neuro: Improving encephalopathy, possibly medication-related. Hold lactulose due to copious stool.
3. ID: Leukocytosis without a clear source. Cdiff negative. CVL discontinued yesterday. Continue treatment for pneumonia and monitor without antibiotics.
4. CV: HTN - continue with captopril and amlodipine.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory complications such as pneumonia due to the patient's compromised respiratory status.
2. Bleeding complications due to the patient's history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and the use of anticoagulants like heparin.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy due to the patient's cirrhosis and abnormal liver function tests.
4. Infection complications such as catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) or Clostridioides difficile infection (Cdiff) due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay.
5. Cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias due to the patient's hypertension and tachycardia.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."
