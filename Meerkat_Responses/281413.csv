   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Acute onset with associated tachycardia, clear cxr, and known extensive
   DVTs is highly suspicious for PE even in the setting of known IVC
   filter. Clot may have formed on the filter or bypassed the filter. No
   signs of aspiration, no wheezes to indicate bronchoconstriction, no
   obvious murmurs or cause for intracardiac shunt. However, given ICH,
   will not be able to anticoagulate for now. A-a gradient 147. Less
   likely to be primary cardiac event as new ST depressions are likely
   rate related. Pt was successfully extubated yesterday and plan was made
   for pt to be DNR/DNI and [**Year (4 digits) 115**].
   .
   #. Acute ICH: In the setting of metastatic melanoma and
   supratherapeutic anticoagulation. Pt then with altered mental status,
   aphasia, and right hemiparesis. Neurosurgery was aware and there is no
   intervention.  After extubation yesterday pt
s mental status improved.
   He is alert, oriented to self, and following basic commands.  Pt is [**Name (NI) 115**]
   and thus all BP meds, steroids, and antiseizure meds were discontinued.

The patient is an 80-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who initially presented with bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). He now presents with acute intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) associated with metastases, hypoxic respiratory failure, and tachycardia. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday and has shown improvement in mental status. However, he still has altered mental status, aphasia, and right hemiparesis. Neurosurgery was aware of the situation but did not intervene. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/71 to 140/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97% on room air, and sinus rhythm. The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 4.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, platelet count of 144 K/uL, blood glucose of 197 mg/dL, sodium level of 17 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.8 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL.

   will not be able to anticoagulate for now. A-a gradient 147. Less
   likely to be primary cardiac event as new ST depressions are likely
   rate related.
   -On PS 50% with good oxygenation now, ween as tolerated
   -Hold on CTA for now as would not change management
   -Trend CEZ, first set negative
   .
   #. Acute ICH: In the setting of metastatic melanoma and
   supratherapeutic anticoagulation. Now with altered mental status,
   aphasia, and right hemiparesis. Neurosurgery aware but holding off for
   intervention right now. Rhythmic movements may be rigors vs. seizures
   -Active reversal with protamine
   -Repeat head CT
   -Allow autoregulation of SBP, goal 140-160, will use labetolol drip if
   above 160
   -He is currently hyperventilating himself, likely decreasing ICP
   -Appreciate neurosurgery input
   -Keppra load and continue IV
   -Con't dexamethasone, change to IV
   .
   #. Fever: Clear CXR so less suspicion for aspiration or pneumonia.
   Could be from clot burden or possible central fever from head bleed.
   -U/A and urine culture
   -Blood cx
   -Sputum cx
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Creatinine slightly elevated to 1.2 this am.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old male with metastatic melanoma, presenting with acute intracranial hemorrhage associated with metastases, hypoxic respiratory failure, and tachycardia. The patient has a history of bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 129/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is extubated and receiving CPAP/PSV+ApnVol ventilation support.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, normal heart sounds, and clear breath sounds. Neurologically, the patient is sedated, non-purposeful movement in right extremities, and Babinski sign is down bilaterally. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated creatinine, and abnormal coagulation profile.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE) due to acute onset of hypoxia, tachycardia, and known extensive DVTs. However, given the acute intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), anticoagulation cannot be initiated at this time."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 80 yo male with metastatic melanoma who presented initially
   with bilateral DVTs who now presents with acute intracranial hemorrhage
   associated with metastases accompanied by hypoxic respiratory failure
   and tachycardia.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Acute onset with associated tachycardia, clear cxr, and known extensive
   DVTs is highly suspicious for PE even in the setting of known IVC
   filter. Clot may have formed on the filter or bypassed the filter. No
   signs of aspiration, no wheezes to indicate bronchoconstriction, no
   obvious murmurs or cause for intracardiac shunt. However, given ICH,
   will not be able to anticoagulate for now. A-a gradient 147. Less
   likely to be primary cardiac event as new ST depressions are likely
   rate related. Pt was successfully extubated yesterday and plan was made
   for pt to be DNR/DNI and [**Year (4 digits) 115**].
   .
   #. Acute ICH: In the setting of metastatic melanoma and
   supratherapeutic anticoagulation. Pt then with altered mental status,
   aphasia, and right hemiparesis. Neurosurgery was aware and there is no
   intervention.  After extubation yesterday pt
s mental status improved.
   He is alert, oriented to self, and following basic commands.  Pt is [**Name (NI) 115**]
   and thus all BP meds, steroids, and antiseizure meds were discontinued.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who presented with bilateral deep vein thromboses (DVTs) and now presents with acute intracranial hemorrhage associated with metastases, accompanied by hypoxic respiratory failure and tachycardia. The patient has a comfort care plan in place and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute onset hypoxic respiratory failure with associated tachycardia. This could be due to a pulmonary embolism (PE), even in the setting of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient's clear chest X-ray and known extensive DVTs make PE a likely possibility. Given the acute intracranial hemorrhage, the patient cannot be anticoagulated at this time.
2. Acute Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH): The patient has an acute ICH in the setting of metastatic melanoma and supratherapeutic anticoagulation. The patient is now showing signs of altered mental status, aphasia, and right hemiparesis. Neurosurgery is aware of the situation but is holding off on intervention for now. The patient may also be experiencing rhythmic movements, which could be rigors or seizures.
3. Fever: The patient has a fever, but there are no signs of aspiration or pneumonia on the clear chest X-ray. The fever could"

2. Acute Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH): The patient has developed an acute ICH in the setting of metastatic melanoma and supratherapeutic anticoagulation. This has resulted in altered mental status, aphasia, and right hemiparesis. Neurosurgery was aware but chose not to intervene.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, but no longer following labs due to the patient's code status.

4. Other Complications: The patient has multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). These conditions can contribute to further complications if not managed appropriately.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 80 yo male with metastatic melanoma who presented initially
   with bilateral DVTs who now presents with acute intracranial hemorrhage
   associated with metastases accompanied by hypoxic respiratory failure
   and tachycardia.
   .
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Acute onset with associated tachycardia, clear cxr, and known extensive
   DVTs is highly suspicious for PE even in the setting of known IVC
   filter. Clot may have formed on the filter or bypassed the filter. No
   signs of aspiration, no wheezes to indicate bronchoconstriction, no
   obvious murmurs or cause for intracardiac shunt. However, given ICH,
   will not be able to anticoagulate for now. Pt was successfully
   extubated on [**5-18**] and plan was made for pt to be DNR/DNI and [**Month/Year (2) 115**].  Pt
   currently satting well on room air.
   .
   #. Acute ICH: In the setting of metastatic melanoma and
   supratherapeutic anticoagulation. Pt then with altered mental status,
   aphasia, and right hemiparesis. Neurosurgery was aware and there is no
   intervention.  After extubation on [**5-18**] pt
s mental status improved.
   He is alert, oriented to self, and following basic commands.  Only
   moving left side of body this AM but was moving right hands and foot
   weakly yesterday.  Pt is [**Name (NI) 115**] and thus all BP meds, steroids, and
   antiseizure meds were discontinued.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:
   -no longer following labs given pt [**Name (NI) 115**].
   .
   #[**Name (NI) 115**]:
   -discontinued meds for HL, glaucoma, BPH
   -family consider taking pt home with hospice vs a hospice facility,
   spoke with case management and they are looking into oprions
   -will allow patient to sip water through a straw unless he begins to
   cough a lot, for comfort from dry mouth
   -continue morphine, ativan, and scopolamine.  Acetaminophen prn fever
   for comfort
   .
   #. Access - PIV, port
   .
   #. Code - [**Name (NI) 115**]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who initially presented with bilateral deep vein thromboses (DVTs). The patient now presents with acute intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) associated with metastases, accompanied by hypoxic respiratory failure and tachycardia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute onset of respiratory failure, along with tachycardia and clear chest x-ray, suggests a possible pulmonary embolism (PE), even though there is an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place. This could be due to the clot forming on the filter or bypassing it. Since the patient has a known ICH, anticoagulation cannot be administered at this time.

2. Acute Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH): The patient has an acute ICH in the setting of metastatic melanoma and supratherapeutic anticoagulation. This has resulted in altered mental status, aphasia, and right hemiparesis. Neurosurgery is aware of the situation, but there is no intervention planned. The patient's mental status has improved after extubation, and he is alert, oriented to self, and following basic commands. However, he is only moving the left side of his body.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who presented initially with bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and now presents with acute intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) associated with metastases, accompanied by hypoxic respiratory failure and tachycardia. The patient has been extubated and is currently alert, oriented to self, and following basic commands. He is moving only the left side of his body and has weak movement in his right hand and foot. The patient has been made DNR/DNI and all BP medications, steroids, and antiseizure medications have been discontinued. Glaucoma drops were restarted yesterday due to concerns about potential blindness. The patient's family prefers comfort measures only and is discussing options for hospice care, either at a facility or at home.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in respiratory arrest.
2. Acute ICH: The presence of ICH increases the risk of rebleeding, brain herniation, and neurological decline. This could worsen the patient's mental status and lead to increased disability.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further, leading to an increase in serum creatinine and urea levels, which can result in fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic symptoms.

   Assessment and Plan
 COMFORT CARE ([**Year (4 digits) 115**], COMFORT MEASURES)
   This is an 80 yo male with metastatic melanoma who presented initially
   with bilateral DVTs who now presents with acute intracranial hemorrhage
   associated with metastases accompanied by hypoxic respiratory failure
   and tachycardia.
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Acute onset with associated tachycardia, clear cxr, and known extensive
   DVTs is highly suspicious for PE even in the setting of known IVC
   filter. Clot may have formed on the filter or bypassed the filter. No
   signs of aspiration, no wheezes to indicate bronchoconstriction, no
   obvious murmurs or cause for intracardiac shunt. However, given ICH,
   will not be able to anticoagulate for now. Pt was successfully
   extubated on [**5-18**] and plan is for pt to be DNR/DNI and [**Month/Year (2) 115**].
   .
   #. Acute ICH: In the setting of metastatic melanoma and
   supratherapeutic anticoagulation. Pt then with altered mental status,
   aphasia, and right hemiparesis. Neurosurgery was aware and there is no
   intervention.  After extubation on [**5-18**] pt
s mental status improved.
   He is alert, oriented to self, and following basic commands.  Only
   moving left side of body this AM but was moving right hands and foot
   weakly yesterday.  Pt is [**Name (NI) 115**] and thus all BP meds, steroids, and
   antiseizure meds were discontinued.

   -restarted glaucoma drops yesterday given concern that pt might not die
   immediately and concern  that he could become blind in the interterm.
   #. Acute renal failure:
   -no longer following labs given pt [**Name (NI) 115**].
   #[**Name (NI) 115**]:
   -discontinued meds for HL & BPH

   spoke with case management and they are looking into oprions
