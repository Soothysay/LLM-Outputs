   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis admitted with
   hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus.
   She is transferred from the floor to the MICU initiate CVVH.  She is
   undergoing liver transplant evaluation.
   # Hypotension: SBPs remain 70-80s despite fluids.  Likely due to
   splanchic vasodilation from liver failure.  No evidence of sepsis.  No
   signs or symptoms of active bleeding although hematocrit trending down
   slightly.   Need to improve pressure for perfusion and to be able to
   remove fluid necessary to complete transplant work-up. Hypotension not
   fluid responsive, will remain off albumin.
   - Start levophed, MAP >60
   - Octreotide and midodrine
   - Monitor
   # Renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis: Diagnosis likely
   hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Renal failure likely precipitated by large
   volume paracentesis at OSH and SBP.  Creatinine continues to rise and
   patient is anuric.  AG metabolic acidosis due to renal failure which is
   improved with bicarbonate tablets.  Dialysis catheter in place.
   - Renal following; appreciate recs
   - CVVH on pressors, goal negative 2 liters today
   - On maximum doses of octreotide 200 mg tid and midodrine 15 mg
   - Liver transplant evaluation ongoing
   # Liver disease/Alcoholic cirrhosis: MELD score 32 today.  Liver
   disease most likely secondary to alcohol but evaluating for other
   possible etiologies and pursuing transplant evaluation.  No known
   varices. Refractory ascites.  Currently not encephalopathic.  INR 2.2,
   albumin 3.5, platelets stable.  Awaiting colposcopy, PFTs and stress
   before can be listed for transplant
   - Protonix 40 mg IV
   - Checking [**Doctor First Name **], [**Last Name (un) 4195**], AMA, hepatitis serologies, ceruloplasmin, IgG,
   toxo, CMV, HSV
   - Continue pretransplant evaluation - will confirm pending tests with
   Liver/Transplant services
   - Received vitamin K 10 mg PO x 2 days without improvement in INR; will
   repeat tomorrow
   # Ileus: Ileus most likely secondary to infection/SBP.  No history of
   prior abdominal surgeries per patient.  Patient with stool output
   within 24 hours.
   - NG tube to low intermittent wall suction
   - Continue NPO for now
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam
   - Zofran PRN
   # Leukocytosis: White count remains elevated but trending down.
   Patient has been afebrile. PMN < 250 on paracentesis [**1-3**].  Urine
   culture growing yeast which is likely from antibiotic use.  No evidence
   of abscess, perforation or focal collection on CT.  C. difficile
   negative x 1.
   - Culture data no growth to date; monitor
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam * 14 days
   - Recheck urine culture and consider discontinuation of fluconazole
   # Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Patient with SBP on OSH
   paracentesis.  [**Month (only) 51**] have had microperforation on initial paracentesis
   resulting in slow resolution of infection.  PMN < 250 on paracentesis
   [**1-3**].  Currently broadly covering.
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam * 14 days
   - Received albumin days 1 and 3
   # Dyspnea: Likely secondary to restriction from large volume ascites as
   well as bilateral pleural effusions.  No consolidation on chest x-ray.
   - Initiate CVVH
   - Oxygen by nasal cannula as needed
   # Anemia: Normocytic.  Likely anemia of chronic disease and from
   chronic kidney disease.  Trending down during admission.
   - Monitor
   # Candiduria: Receiving Diflucan for planned 7-day course.
   - Recheck urine culture
   # Pain: patient with arthritis pain, not responsive to tylenol.
   Avoiding NSAIDS given renal failure.
   - Morphine 1 to 2 mg prn

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis admitted with
   hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus.
   She is transferred from the floor to the MICU initiate CVVH.  She is
   undergoing liver transplant evaluation.
   # Renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis: Diagnosis likely
   hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Renal failure likely precipitated by large
   volume paracentesis at OSH and SBP.  Creatinine continues to rise and
   patient is anuric.  AG metabolic acidosis due to renal failure which is
   improved with bicarbonate tablets.  Dialysis catheter placed today.
   - Renal following; appreciate
   - Initiate CVVH
   - On maximum doses of octreotide 200 mg tid and midodrine 15 mg tid
   discuss ongoing need with renal, however, likely improving blood
   pressures
   - Will discontinue albumin for now
   - Liver transplant evaluation ongoing
   # Liver disease/Alcoholic cirrhosis: MELD score 32 today.  Liver
   disease most likely secondary to alcohol but evaluating for other
   possible etiologies and pursuing transplant evaluation.  No known
   varices. Refractory ascites.  Currently not encephalopathic.  INR 2.2,
   albumin 3.5, platelets stable.
   - Protonix 40 mg IV
   - Checking [**Doctor First Name **], [**Last Name (un) 4195**], AMA, hepatitis serologies, ceruloplasmin, IgG,
   toxo, CMV, HSV
   - Continue pretransplant evaluation - will confirm pending tests with
   Liver/Transplant services
   - Received vitamin K 10 mg PO x 2 days without improvement in INR; will
   repeat tomorrow
   # Ileus: Ileus most likely secondary to infection/SBP.  No history of
   prior abdominal surgeries per patient.  Patient with stool output
   within 24 hours.
   - NG tube to low intermittent wall suction
   - Continue NPO for now
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam
   - Zofran PRN
   # Leukocytosis: White count remains elevated but trending down.
   Patient has been afebrile. PMN < 250 on paracentesis [**1-3**].  Urine
   culture growing yeast which is likely from antibiotic use.  No evidence
   of abscess, perforation or focal collection on CT.  C. difficile
   negative x 1.
   - Culture data no growth to date; monitor
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam and clarify course in the
   morning
   - Recheck urine culture and consider discontinuation of fluconazole
   # Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Patient with SBP on OSH
   paracentesis.  [**Month (only) 51**] have had microperforation on initial paracentesis
   resulting in slow resolution of infection.  PMN < 250 on paracentesis
   [**1-3**].  Currently broadly covering.
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam for now
   - Received albumin days 1 and 3
   # Hypotension: SBPs remain 70-80s.  Likely due to splanchic
   vasodilation from liver failure.  No evidence of sepsis.  No signs or
   symptoms of active bleeding although hematocrit trending down
   slightly.
   - Octreotide and midodrine
   - Monitor
   # Dyspnea: Likely secondary to restriction from large volume ascites as
   well as bilateral pleural effusions.  No consolidation on chest x-ray.
   - Initiate CVVH
   - Oxygen by nasal cannula as needed
   # Anemia: Normocytic.  Likely anemia of chronic disease and from
   chronic kidney disease.  Trending down during admission.
   - Monitor
   # Candiduria: Receiving Diflucan for planned 7-day course.
   - Recheck urine culture and consider discontinuation of fluconazole

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus. She is undergoing liver transplant evaluation. The patient's current conditions include renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to hepatorenal syndrome type 1, liver disease/Alcoholic cirrhosis with a MELD score of 32, ileus secondary to SBP, leukocytosis with an elevated white count, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hypotension, dyspnea, anemia, and candiduria.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal syndrome type 1: This is a serious complication characterized by kidney failure in patients with advanced liver disease. It is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment.
2. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): This is a potentially life-threatening infection of the fluid in the peritoneal cavity surrounding the liver. It can lead to sepsis and organ failure if not promptly treated.
3. Liver disease/Alcoholic cirrhosis: The patient's liver disease may progress and lead to hepatic encephalopathy, portal hypertension, variceal bleeding, or liver cancer.
4. Ileus: The patient's bowel movement may continue to be impaired, leading to further complications such as bowel obstruction or infection.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of renal failure. They have a history of hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and liver failure. The patient is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to volume overload and progressive renal failure. They are also receiving antibiotics for SBP. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure and dyspnea. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, elevated creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Infection: Despite being on antibiotics, there is a risk of developing further infections, especially with the patient's compromised immune system due to liver failure.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's volume overload increases the risk of pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is severely impaired, and there is a risk of further deterioration in kidney function if CVVH is not effective.
5. Hepatorenal syndrome: This syndrome can progress and result in worsening renal failure and increased mortality.
6. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, putting them at risk for hepatic encephalopathy"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill female with a history of renal failure, hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and liver failure. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times and currently presents with volume overload, progressive renal failure, and is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She is also receiving antibiotics for SBP and has a pending evaluation for liver transplantation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 35.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 69/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is in sinus rhythm.

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Her electrolytes indicate hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. Her liver enzymes are within normal range, and her albumin level is slightly decreased.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is awake, alert, and oriented but experiences dyspnea and cannot tolerate a supine position. She has poor chest excursions with respirations, crackles in her lungs, a soft abdomen with large ascites and diffuse tenderness, and trace bilateral edema.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal failure, infection due to immunosuppression, liver transplantation"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis admitted with
   hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus.
   She is transferred from the floor to the MICU initiate CVVH.  She is
   undergoing liver transplant evaluation.
   # Hypotension: SBPs remain 70-80s despite fluids.  Likely due to
   splanchic vasodilation from liver failure.  No evidence of sepsis.  No
   signs or symptoms of active bleeding although hematocrit trending down
   slightly.   Need to improve pressure for perfusion and to be able to
   remove fluid necessary to complete transplant work-up. Hypotension not
   fluid responsive, will remain off albumin.
   - Start levophed, MAP >60
   - Octreotide and midodrine
   - Monitor
   # Renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis: Diagnosis likely
   hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Renal failure likely precipitated by large
   volume paracentesis at OSH and SBP.  Creatinine continues to rise and
   patient is anuric.  AG metabolic acidosis due to renal failure which is
   improved with bicarbonate tablets.  Dialysis catheter in place.
   - Renal following; appreciate recs
   - CVVH on pressors, goal negative 2 liters today
   - On maximum doses of octreotide 200 mg tid and midodrine 15 mg
   - Liver transplant evaluation ongoing
   # Liver disease/Alcoholic cirrhosis: MELD score 32 today.  Liver
   disease most likely secondary to alcohol but evaluating for other
   possible etiologies and pursuing transplant evaluation.  No known
   varices. Refractory ascites.  Currently not encephalopathic.  INR 2.2,
   albumin 3.5, platelets stable.  Awaiting colposcopy, PFTs and stress
   before can be listed for transplant
   - Protonix 40 mg IV
   - Checking [**Doctor First Name **], [**Last Name (un) 4195**], AMA, hepatitis serologies, ceruloplasmin, IgG,
   toxo, CMV, HSV
   - Continue pretransplant evaluation - will confirm pending tests with
   Liver/Transplant services
   - Received vitamin K 10 mg PO x 2 days without improvement in INR; will
   repeat tomorrow
   # Ileus: Ileus most likely secondary to infection/SBP.  No history of
   prior abdominal surgeries per patient.  Patient with stool output
   within 24 hours.
   - NG tube to low intermittent wall suction
   - Continue NPO for now
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam
   - Zofran PRN
   # Leukocytosis: White count remains elevated but trending down.
   Patient has been afebrile. PMN < 250 on paracentesis [**1-3**].  Urine
   culture growing yeast which is likely from antibiotic use.  No evidence
   of abscess, perforation or focal collection on CT.  C. difficile
   negative x 1.
   - Culture data no growth to date; monitor
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam * 14 days
   - Recheck urine culture and consider discontinuation of fluconazole
   # Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Patient with SBP on OSH
   paracentesis.  [**Month (only) 51**] have had microperforation on initial paracentesis
   resulting in slow resolution of infection.  PMN < 250 on paracentesis
   [**1-3**].  Currently broadly covering.
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam * 14 days
   - Received albumin days 1 and 3
   # Dyspnea: Likely secondary to restriction from large volume ascites as
   well as bilateral pleural effusions.  No consolidation on chest x-ray.
   - Initiate CVVH
   - Oxygen by nasal cannula as needed
   # Anemia: Normocytic.  Likely anemia of chronic disease and from
   chronic kidney disease.  Trending down during admission.
   - Monitor
   # Candiduria: Receiving Diflucan for planned 7-day course.
   - Recheck urine culture
   # Pain: patient with arthritis pain, not responsive to tylenol.
   Avoiding NSAIDS given renal failure.
   - Morphine 1 to 2 mg prn

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis admitted to the MICU for hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus. She is undergoing liver transplant evaluation. The patient has several medical complications that require attention.

1. Hypotension: The patient's systolic blood pressures remain in the 70-80s despite fluids. This is likely due to splanchic vasodilation from liver failure. No evidence of sepsis or active bleeding is observed, but the patient's hematocrit is trending down slightly. The goal is to improve pressure for perfusion and remove fluid necessary for the transplant work-up.

- Start levophed, MAP >60
- Octreotide and midodrine

2. Renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's renal failure is likely hepatorenal syndrome type 1, precipitated by large volume paracentesis at OSH and SBP. The patient is anuric, and AG metabolic acidosis due to renal failure has been observed. Bicarbonate tablets have improved the acidosis, and dialysis catheter placement has been done.

   60 year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis admitted with
   hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus.
   She is transferred from the floor to the MICU initiate CVVH.  She is
   undergoing liver transplant evaluation.
   # Hypotension: SBPs remain 70-80s despite fluids.  Likely due to
   splanchic vasodilation from liver failure.  No evidence of sepsis.  No
   signs or symptoms of active bleeding although hematocrit trending down
   slightly.   Need to improve pressure for perfusion and to be able to
   remove fluid necessary to complete transplant work-up. Hypotension not
   fluid responsive, will remain off albumin.
   - Start levophed, MAP >60
   - Octreotide and midodrine
   - Monitor
   # Renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis: Diagnosis likely
   hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Renal failure likely precipitated by large
   volume paracentesis at OSH and SBP.  Creatinine continues to rise and
   patient is anuric.  AG metabolic acidosis due to renal failure which is
   improved with bicarbonate tablets.  Dialysis catheter in place.
   - Renal following; appreciate recs
   - CVVH on pressors, goal negative 2 liters today
   - On maximum doses of octreotide 200 mg tid and midodrine 15 mg
   - Liver transplant evaluation ongoing
   # Liver disease/Alcoholic cirrhosis: MELD score 32 today.  Liver
   disease most likely secondary to alcohol but evaluating for other
   possible etiologies and pursuing transplant evaluation.  No known
   varices. Refractory ascites.  Currently not encephalopathic.  INR 2.2,
   albumin 3.5, platelets stable.  Awaiting colposcopy, PFTs and stress
   before can be listed for transplant
   - Protonix 40 mg IV
   - Checking [**Doctor First Name **], [**Last Name (un) 4195**], AMA, hepatitis serologies, ceruloplasmin, IgG,
   toxo, CMV, HSV
   - Continue pretransplant evaluation - will confirm pending tests with
   Liver/Transplant services
   - Received vitamin K 10 mg PO x 2 days without improvement in INR; will
   repeat tomorrow
   # Ileus: Ileus most likely secondary to infection/SBP.  No history of
   prior abdominal surgeries per patient.  Patient with stool output
   within 24 hours.
   - NG tube to low intermittent wall suction
   - Continue NPO for now
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam

   # Leukocytosis: White count remains elevated but trending down.
   Patient has been afebrile. PMN < 250 on paracentesis [**1-3**].  Urine
   culture growing yeast which is likely from antibiotic use.  No evidence
   of abscess, perforation or focal collection on CT.  C. difficile
   negative x 1.
   - Culture data no growth to date; monitor
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam * 14 days
   - Recheck urine culture and consider discontinuation of fluconazole
   # Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Patient with SBP on OSH
   paracentesis.  [**Month (only) 51**] have had microperforation on initial paracentesis
   resulting in slow resolution of infection.  PMN < 250 on paracentesis
   [**1-3**].  Currently broadly covering.
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam * 14 days
   - Received albumin days 1 and 3
   # Dyspnea: Likely secondary to restriction from large volume ascites as
   well as bilateral pleural effusions.  No consolidation on chest x-ray.
   - Initiate CVVH
   - Oxygen by nasal cannula as needed
   # Anemia: Normocytic.  Likely anemia of chronic disease and from
   chronic kidney disease.  Trending down during admission.
   - Monitor
   # Candiduria: Receiving Diflucan for planned 7-day course.
   - Recheck urine culture
   # Pain: patient with arthritis pain, not responsive to tylenol.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who has been admitted with hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus. She is currently undergoing liver transplant evaluation and is in the ICU.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is on pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 due to splanchic vasodilation from liver failure. There is concern for another etiology of hypotension, such as new infection. No signs or symptoms of active bleeding have been observed.

2. Renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient likely has hepatorenal syndrome type 1, which is diagnosed by the presence of renal failure precipitated by large volume paracentesis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The anion gap metabolic acidosis is likely due to renal failure and has been improved with bicarbonate tablets. The patient is anuric (not producing urine), and dialysis catheter placement has been done.

3. Liver disease/Alcoholic cirrhosis: The patient's liver disease is most likely secondary to alcohol use, but other possible etiologies are being evaluated. A MELD score of 32 was recorded on admission to the MICU, indicating severe liver dysfunction. The patient is awaiting colposcopy, pulmonary function tests, and stress evaluation before she can be listed for a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with a medical history of alcoholic cirrhosis, type I hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and septicemia who is currently in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is anasarca, which refers to generalized edema or swelling throughout the body.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU for anuric renal failure and initiation of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She was started on arterial line and CVVH at 12:15 PM, with a positive fluid removal of 500cc. However, the patient is still not tolerating fluid removal, so Levophed was started overnight to facilitate fluid removal.

The patient's allergies include Lisinopril, Penicillins, Zocor (Oral) (Simvastatin), Tetracycline, Theophylline, and Macrolide Antibiotics. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Levofloxacin at 11:45 AM on [2124-1-5], Aztreonam at 04:00 AM on [2124-1-6], and Metronidazole at 08:00 AM on [2124-1-6].

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a blood pressure ranging from 60-148 mmHg, heart rate between 77-142 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15-27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula, and temperature within normal limits. Fluid balance shows an input of 4,383 mL and output of 3,872 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 511 mL. The patient's blood products transfused include 2,037 mL of whole blood and 1,857 mL of packed red blood cells. Her urine output is low at 118 mL. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.35, PCO2 of 35 mmHg,"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis admitted with
   hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus ->
   transferred from the floor to the MICU initiate CVVH.  She is
   undergoing liver transplant evaluation.
   # Hypotension: Patient has splanchic vasodilation from liver failure
   and is on pressors in order to perform CVVH.  The need for rapid
   uptitration of her pressors is concerning for another etiology of
   hypotension such as new infection.  No signs or symptoms of active
   bleeding although hematocrit trending down slightly.
   - Continue neosynephrine for goal MAP > 55
   - Albumin 100 gm IV today
   - Goal even on CVVH for today
   - Repeat blood cultures
   - CT torso in the afternoon to evaluate for source of infection
   - Start vancomycin in addition to aztreonam/levofloxacin/flagyl for
   potential gram positive infection
   - Continue octreotide and midodrine
   - Monitor
   # Renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis: Diagnosis likely
   hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Renal failure likely precipitated by large
   volume paracentesis at OSH and SBP.  Creatinine continues to rise and
   patient is anuric.  AG metabolic acidosis due to renal failure which is
   improved with bicarbonate tablets.  Dialysis catheter in place.
   - Renal following; appreciate recommendations
   - CVVH -> goal even today given hypotension as above
   - On maximum doses of octreotide 200 mg tid and midodrine 15 mg
   - Liver transplant evaluation ongoing
   # Liver disease/Alcoholic cirrhosis: MELD score 32 on admission to
   MICU.  Liver disease most likely secondary to alcohol but evaluating
   for other possible etiologies and pursuing transplant evaluation.  No
   known varices. Refractory ascites.  Currently not encephalopathic.  INR
   2.2, albumin 3.5, platelets stable.  Awaiting colposcopy, PFTs and
   stress before can be listed for transplant
   - Protonix 40 mg IV
   - Continue pretransplant evaluation - will confirm pending tests with
   Liver/Transplant services
   - Blood for HLA typing walked down to laboratory
   # Leukocytosis: White count remains elevated and is now trending up.
   Patient has been afebrile, although not reliable in setting of CVVH.
   PMN < 250 on paracentesis [**1-3**].  Urine culture growing yeast which is
   likely from antibiotic use.  No evidence of abscess, perforation or
   focal collection on CT.  C. difficile negative x 1.
   - Culture data no growth to date; monitor
   - Start vancomycin now
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam x 14 days
   - Continue fluconazole x 7 days
   # Ileus: Patient passing gas and stooling.  Ileus most likely secondary
   to infection/SBP.  No history of prior abdominal surgeries per
   patient.
   - NG tube in place
   - Attempt tube feeds
   - Zofran PRN
   # Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Patient with SBP on OSH
   paracentesis.  [**Month (only) 51**] have had microperforation on initial paracentesis
   resulting in slow resolution of infection.  PMN < 250 on paracentesis
   [**1-3**].  Currently broadly covering.
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam x 14 days
   - Received albumin days 1 and 3
   # Dyspnea: Likely secondary to restriction from large volume ascites as
   well as bilateral pleural effusions.  Question consolidation on chest
   x-ray.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - CVVH to remove fluid when stable
   - Oxygen by nasal cannula as needed
   # Anemia: Normocytic.  Likely anemia of chronic disease and from
   chronic kidney disease.  Trending down during admission.
   - Monitor
   # Candiduria: Receiving Diflucan for planned 7-day course.
   # Pain: patient with arthritis pain, not responsive to tylenol.
   Avoiding NSAIDS given renal failure.
   - Morphine 1 to 2 mg prn

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis admitted with hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus. She is undergoing liver/kidney transplant evaluation. The patient is experiencing hypotension, renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, leukocytosis, ileus, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, dyspnea, anemia, candiduria, and pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's high pressure requirement is concerning for another etiology of hypotension such as abdominal compartment syndrome or new infection. Close monitoring of bladder pressures and consideration of paracentesis every other day are recommended. The patient is on pressors to maintain MAP > 55.

2. Renal Failure/Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The diagnosis is likely hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Renal failure likely precipitated by large volume paracentesis at OSH and SBP. Creatinine continues to rise, and the patient is anuric. AG metabolic acidosis due to renal failure is improved with bicarbonate tablets. Dialysis catheter in place. CVVH to remove 50cc/hr now that blood pressures improved.

3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: MELD score 32 on admission to MICU. Liver disease most likely secondary to alcohol but evaluating for other possible etiologies and pursuing transplant evaluation. No known var"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis admitted with
   hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus ->
   transferred from the floor to the MICU initiate CVVH.  She is
   undergoing liver transplant evaluation.
   # Hypotension: Patient has splanchic vasodilation from liver failure
   and is on pressors in order to perform CVVH.  The need for rapid
   uptitration of her pressors is concerning for another etiology of
   hypotension such as new infection.  No signs or symptoms of active
   bleeding although hematocrit trending down slightly.
   - Continue neosynephrine for goal MAP > 55
   - Albumin 100 gm IV today
   - Goal even on CVVH for today
   - Repeat blood cultures
   - CT torso in the afternoon to evaluate for source of infection
   - Start vancomycin in addition to aztreonam/levofloxacin/flagyl for
   potential gram positive infection
   - Continue octreotide and midodrine
   - Monitor
   # Renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis: Diagnosis likely
   hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Renal failure likely precipitated by large
   volume paracentesis at OSH and SBP.  Creatinine continues to rise and
   patient is anuric.  AG metabolic acidosis due to renal failure which is
   improved with bicarbonate tablets.  Dialysis catheter in place.
   - Renal following; appreciate recommendations
   - CVVH -> goal even today given hypotension as above
   - On maximum doses of octreotide 200 mg tid and midodrine 15 mg
   - Liver transplant evaluation ongoing
   # Liver disease/Alcoholic cirrhosis: MELD score 32 on admission to
   MICU.  Liver disease most likely secondary to alcohol but evaluating
   for other possible etiologies and pursuing transplant evaluation.  No
   known varices. Refractory ascites.  Currently not encephalopathic.  INR
   2.2, albumin 3.5, platelets stable.  Awaiting colposcopy, PFTs and
   stress before can be listed for transplant
   - Protonix 40 mg IV
   - Continue pretransplant evaluation - will confirm pending tests with
   Liver/Transplant services
   - Blood for HLA typing walked down to laboratory
   # Leukocytosis: White count remains elevated and is now trending up.
   Patient has been afebrile, although not reliable in setting of CVVH.
   PMN < 250 on paracentesis [**1-3**].  Urine culture growing yeast which is
   likely from antibiotic use.  No evidence of abscess, perforation or
   focal collection on CT.  C. difficile negative x 1.
   - Culture data no growth to date; monitor
   - Start vancomycin now
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam x 14 days
   - Continue fluconazole x 7 days
   # Ileus: Patient passing gas and stooling.  Ileus most likely secondary
   to infection/SBP.  No history of prior abdominal surgeries per
   patient.
   - NG tube in place
   - Attempt tube feeds
   - Zofran PRN
   # Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Patient with SBP on OSH
   paracentesis.  [**Month (only) 51**] have had microperforation on initial paracentesis
   resulting in slow resolution of infection.  PMN < 250 on paracentesis
   [**1-3**].  Currently broadly covering.
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam x 14 days
   - Received albumin days 1 and 3
   # Dyspnea: Likely secondary to restriction from large volume ascites as
   well as bilateral pleural effusions.  Question consolidation on chest
   x-ray.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - CVVH to remove fluid when stable
   - Oxygen by nasal cannula as needed
   # Anemia: Normocytic.  Likely anemia of chronic disease and from
   chronic kidney disease.  Trending down during admission.
   - Monitor
   # Candiduria: Receiving Diflucan for planned 7-day course.
   # Pain: patient with arthritis pain, not responsive to tylenol.
   Avoiding NSAIDS given renal failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted with hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus. The patient underwent a liver transplant evaluation and is currently in the ICU. She is undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to renal failure. The patient has hypotension, anion gap metabolic acidosis, elevated white blood cell count, leukocytosis, and candiduria. She also has refractory ascites and is awaiting colposcopy, PFTs, and stress testing before she can be listed for a transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient requires pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55. The need for rapid uptitration of her pressors suggests the possibility of another etiology of hypotension, such as a new infection.
2. Renal Failure/Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has likely hepatorenal syndrome type 1, which is causing renal failure. The anion gap metabolic acidosis is due to renal failure, which is improved with bicarbonate tablets. Dialysis catheter placement is in progress.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis admitted with
   hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus ->
   transferred from the floor to the MICU initiate CVVH.  She is
   undergoing liver transplant evaluation.
   # Hypotension: Patient has splanchic vasodilation from liver failure
   and is on pressors in order to perform CVVH.  The need for rapid
   uptitration of her pressors is concerning for another etiology of
   hypotension such as new infection.  No signs or symptoms of active
   bleeding although hematocrit trending down slightly.
   - Continue neosynephrine for goal MAP > 55
   - Albumin 100 gm IV today
   - Goal even on CVVH for today
   - Repeat blood cultures
   - CT torso in the afternoon to evaluate for source of infection
   - Start vancomycin in addition to aztreonam/levofloxacin/flagyl for
   potential gram positive infection
   - Continue octreotide and midodrine
   - Monitor
   # Renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis: Diagnosis likely
   hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Renal failure likely precipitated by large
   volume paracentesis at OSH and SBP.  Creatinine continues to rise and
   patient is anuric.  AG metabolic acidosis due to renal failure which is
   improved with bicarbonate tablets.  Dialysis catheter in place.
   - Renal following; appreciate recommendations
   - CVVH -> goal even today given hypotension as above
   - On maximum doses of octreotide 200 mg tid and midodrine 15 mg
   - Liver transplant evaluation ongoing
   # Liver disease/Alcoholic cirrhosis: MELD score 32 on admission to
   MICU.  Liver disease most likely secondary to alcohol but evaluating
   for other possible etiologies and pursuing transplant evaluation.  No
   known varices. Refractory ascites.  Currently not encephalopathic.  INR
   2.2, albumin 3.5, platelets stable.  Awaiting colposcopy, PFTs and
   stress before can be listed for transplant
   - Protonix 40 mg IV
   - Continue pretransplant evaluation - will confirm pending tests with
   Liver/Transplant services
   - Blood for HLA typing walked down to laboratory
   # Leukocytosis: White count remains elevated and is now trending up.
   Patient has been afebrile, although not reliable in setting of CVVH.
   PMN < 250 on paracentesis [**1-3**].  Urine culture growing yeast which is
   likely from antibiotic use.  No evidence of abscess, perforation or
   focal collection on CT.  C. difficile negative x 1.
   - Culture data no growth to date; monitor
   - Start vancomycin now
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam x 14 days
   - Continue fluconazole x 7 days
   # Ileus: Patient passing gas and stooling.  Ileus most likely secondary
   to infection/SBP.  No history of prior abdominal surgeries per
   patient.
   - NG tube in place
   - Attempt tube feeds
   - Zofran PRN
   # Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Patient with SBP on OSH
   paracentesis.  [**Month (only) 51**] have had microperforation on initial paracentesis
   resulting in slow resolution of infection.  PMN < 250 on paracentesis
   [**1-3**].  Currently broadly covering.
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam x 14 days
   - Received albumin days 1 and 3
   # Dyspnea: Likely secondary to restriction from large volume ascites as
   well as bilateral pleural effusions.  Question consolidation on chest
   x-ray.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - CVVH to remove fluid when stable
   - Oxygen by nasal cannula as needed
   # Anemia: Normocytic.  Likely anemia of chronic disease and from
   chronic kidney disease.  Trending down during admission.
   - Monitor
   # Candiduria: Receiving Diflucan for planned 7-day course.
   # Pain: patient with arthritis pain, not responsive to tylenol.
   Avoiding NSAIDS given renal failure.
   - Morphine 1 to 2 mg prn

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, admitted with hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus. She is undergoing a liver transplant evaluation. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis, liver disease/Alcoholic cirrhosis, leukocytosis, ileus, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, dyspnea, anemia, candiduria, and pain.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions are as follows:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may be due to splanchic vasodilation from liver failure. She is already on pressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55. The need for rapid uptitration of her pressors suggests a possible new etiology of hypotension, such as infection. Continuous monitoring and appropriate adjustments in the pressor therapy will be necessary.

2. Renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has been diagnosed with hepatorenal syndrome type 1, likely precipitated by large volume paracentesis at OSH and SBP. Her renal function continues to deteriorate, resulting in anuria. The anion gap metabolic acidosis is likely due to renal failure and is being managed with bicarbonate tablets. Continuous renal monitoring is required, and the patient is planned for continuous veno-venous hemofiltration"

   Assessment and Plan
   Plan as per resident note. Briefly, 60 y/o woman with ESLD, now Type I
   HRS in MICU for CVVH. Hypotension seems out of proportion to fluid
   removal and in any case CVVH has been running even o/n. Ddx included
   sepsis and  (less likely) abdominal compartment syndrome. S/P LVP, will
   give albumin to replace portion of what was taken off.  Neo/vasopressin
   for MAP < 55 (goal less because of likely baseline low SVR). Follow
   bladder pressure.  Abx regimen now vanc/levo/flagyl/aztreonam. Latest
   tap not c/w peritonitis. Cultures pending, chest/abdmn/pelvis CT today.
   Hope to resume fluid removal as soon as possible, but difficult  in the
   setting of high pressor requirement. Aim even today. Respiratory status
   is tenuous but stable and improved post LVP.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She has type I hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and is experiencing hypotension that seems out of proportion to fluid removal. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis and abdominal compartment syndrome. The patient underwent large-volume paracentesis (LVP) and will receive albumin to replace the portion of fluid removed.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 65/37 mmHg to 82/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. She is on multiple medications including vasopressin, calcium gluconate, phenylephrine, potassium chloride, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate.

Her laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, increased creatinine, decreased total bilirubin, and other abnormal values. Chest and abdominal CT scans have been ordered.

The patient's respiratory status is described as tenuous but stable and improved post-LVP. She is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management. Potential medical complications that can arise include septic shock, worsening renal function, hepatopulmonary syndrome"

   Assessment and Plan
   Plan as per resident note. Briefly, 60 y/o woman with ESLD, now Type I
   HRS in MICU for CVVH. Hypotension seems out of proportion to fluid
   removal and in any case CVVH has been running even o/n. Ddx included
   spesis and  (less likely) abdominal compartment syndrome. S/P LVP, will
   give albumin to replace what was taken off.  Neo/vasopressin for MAP <
   55 (goal less because of likely baseline low SVR). Follow bladder
   pressure.  Abx regimen now vanc/levo/flagyl/aztreonam. Latest tap not
   c/w peritonitis. Cultures pending, chest/abdmn/pelvis CT today. Hope to
   resume fluid removal as soon as possible, but difficult  in the setting
   of high pressor requirement. Aim even today. respiratory status is
   tenuous but stable and improved post LVP.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) who has been admitted to the ICU for CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). She is experiencing hypotension and has been diagnosed with Type I hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). The patient's vital signs indicate low blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and respiratory rate (RR). She is also on mechanical ventilation with an oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine, and liver enzymes such as AST and ALT. Her blood glucose levels are within normal range, but other electrolyte levels like potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) are abnormal. Her international normalized ratio (INR) is significantly elevated, indicating severe liver dysfunction.

The patient's abdominal examination reveals non-tender distension, and her extremities have 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. The respiratory examination shows diminished breath sounds at the bases of both lungs. 

The patient's medical history includes ESLD, etoh abuse, and allergies to lisinopril, penicillins, simvastatin, tetracycline, theophylline, macrolide antibiotics, and unknown medications. She has received multiple blood transfusions and is currently on several medications including vasopressin, calcium gluconate, phenylephrine, potassium chloride, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate.

The patient's fluid balance shows a significant intake-output discrepancy, with a total input of 5833 mL and total output of 5730 mL since midnight. Her urine output is very low at 75 mL in the past 24 hours. 

The patient's assessment and plan involve suspicion of sepsis and abdominal compartment syndrome. She has undergone a large volume paracentesis (LVP) and will receive albumin to replace the fluid removed. She is being treated with vasopressin for low mean arterial pressure (MAP) and will have her bladder pressure monitored. Antibiotics have been initiated, and cultures are pending. A chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT scan is planned for today. The goal is to resume fluid removal as soon as possible, but it is challenging due to high pressor requirements. The patient's respiratory status is tenuous but stable and improved post LVP."

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis admitted with
   hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus ->
   transferred from the floor to the MICU initiate CVVH.  She is
   undergoing liver/kidney transplant evaluation.
   # Hypotension: Patient has splanchic vasodilation from liver failure
   and is on pressors in order to perform CVVH.  Her high pressure
   requirement is concerning for another etiology of hypotension such as
   abdominal compartment syndrome or new infection.  Pressures improved
   somewhat after paracentesis today, albumin and blood yesterday, and
   addition of vancomycin.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding
   status post 2U pRBC to improve CvO2.
   - Continue neosynephrine and vasopressin for goal MAP > 55
   - Monitor bladder pressures
 consider paracentesis every other day
   - Repeat albumin 100 gm IV today after paracentesis
   - CVVH
 attempt to remove 50cc/hr now that blood pressures improved
   - Blood cultures
 NGTD
   - CT torso in the afternoon to evaluate for source of infection
   - Continue broad coverage with vancomycin/aztreonam/levofloxacin/flagyl
   - Continue octreotide and midodrine
   - Monitor
   # Renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis: Diagnosis likely
   hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Renal failure likely precipitated by large
   volume paracentesis at OSH and SBP.  Creatinine continues to rise and
   patient is anuric.  AG metabolic acidosis due to renal failure which is
   improved with bicarbonate tablets.  Dialysis catheter in place.
   - Renal following; appreciate recommendations
   - CVVH
 attempt to remove 50cc/hr now that blood pressures improved
   - On maximum doses of octreotide 200 mg tid and midodrine 15 mg
   - Liver/kidney transplant evaluation ongoing
 will obtain cardiology
   consult
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: MELD score 32 on admission to MICU.  Liver
   disease most likely secondary to alcohol but evaluating for other
   possible etiologies and pursuing transplant evaluation.  No known
   varices.  Refractory ascites.  Currently not encephalopathic.
   Laboratories stable.  No response to vitamin K supplementation.
   - Continue protonix 40 mg IV
   - Continue pretransplant evaluation
 will obtain cardiology consult
   # Leukocytosis: White count remains elevated but is now trending down.
   Patient has been afebrile, although not reliable in setting of CVVH.
   PMN < 250 on paracentesis [**1-7**].  Urine culture growing yeast which is
   likely from antibiotic use.  No evidence of abscess, perforation or
   focal collection on CT.  C. difficile negative x 1.
   - Culture data no growth to date; monitor
   - Continue broad coverage with vancomycin/aztreonam/levofloxacin/flagyl
   - Continue fluconazole x 7 days
   # Ileus: Patient passing gas and stooling, however persistent
   residuals.  Ileus most likely secondary to infection/SBP.  No history
   of prior abdominal surgeries per patient.
   - NG tube in place
   - Attempt tube feeds when decreased residuals
   - Zofran PRN
   # Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Patient with SBP on OSH
   paracentesis.  [**Month (only) 51**] have had microperforation on initial paracentesis
   resulting in slow resolution of infection.  PMN < 250 on paracentesis
   [**1-7**].  Currently broadly covering.
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam x 14 days
   - Received albumin days 1 and 3
   # Dyspnea: Likely secondary to restriction from large volume ascites as
   well as bilateral pleural effusions.  Question consolidation on chest
   x-ray.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - CVVH to remove fluid when stable
   - Oxygen by nasal cannula as needed
   # Anemia: Normocytic.  Likely anemia of chronic disease and from
   chronic kidney disease.  Status post 2U pRBC to improve CvO2.
   - Monitor
   # Candiduria: Receiving Diflucan for planned 7-day course.
   # Pain: Abdominal and arthritic pain.  Avoiding NSAIDS given renal
   failure.
   - Morphine 1-2 mg PRN

The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted with hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus. The patient is undergoing evaluation for liver/kidney transplant. She is currently in the ICU and is on various medications including vasopressin, neosynephrine, vancomycin, aztreonam, levofloxacin, flagyl, octreotide, midodrine, and fluconazole. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension, renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, leukocytosis, ileus, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, dyspnea, anemia, candiduria, and pain. The patient has multiple lines including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and PICC line. She also has a nasogastric tube in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's high pressure requirement may indicate another etiology of hypotension such as abdominal compartment syndrome or new infection. Close monitoring of bladder pressures and consideration of paracentesis every other day is recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis admitted with
   hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus ->
   transferred from the floor to the MICU initiate CVVH.  She is
   undergoing liver/kidney transplant evaluation.
   # Hypotension: Patient has splanchic vasodilation from liver failure
   and is on pressors in order to perform CVVH.  Her high pressure
   requirement is concerning for another etiology of hypotension such as
   abdominal compartment syndrome or new infection.  Pressures improved
   somewhat after paracentesis today, albumin and blood yesterday, and
   addition of vancomycin.  No signs or symptoms of active bleeding
   status post 2U pRBC to improve CvO2.
   - Continue neosynephrine and vasopressin for goal MAP > 55
   - Monitor bladder pressures
 consider paracentesis every other day
   - Repeat albumin 100 gm IV today after paracentesis
   - CVVH
 attempt to remove 50cc/hr now that blood pressures improved
   - Blood cultures
 NGTD
   - CT torso in the afternoon to evaluate for source of infection
   - Continue broad coverage with vancomycin/aztreonam/levofloxacin/flagyl
   - Continue octreotide and midodrine
   - Monitor
   # Renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis: Diagnosis likely
   hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Renal failure likely precipitated by large
   volume paracentesis at OSH and SBP.  Creatinine continues to rise and
   patient is anuric.  AG metabolic acidosis due to renal failure which is
   improved with bicarbonate tablets.  Dialysis catheter in place.
   - Renal following; appreciate recommendations
   - CVVH
 attempt to remove 50cc/hr now that blood pressures improved
   - On maximum doses of octreotide 200 mg tid and midodrine 15 mg
   - Liver/kidney transplant evaluation ongoing
 will obtain cardiology
   consult
   # Alcoholic cirrhosis: MELD score 32 on admission to MICU.  Liver
   disease most likely secondary to alcohol but evaluating for other
   possible etiologies and pursuing transplant evaluation.  No known
   varices.  Refractory ascites.  Currently not encephalopathic.
   Laboratories stable.  No response to vitamin K supplementation.
   - Continue protonix 40 mg IV
   - Continue pretransplant evaluation
 will obtain cardiology consult
   # Leukocytosis: White count remains elevated but is now trending down.
   Patient has been afebrile, although not reliable in setting of CVVH.
   PMN < 250 on paracentesis [**1-7**].  Urine culture growing yeast which is
   likely from antibiotic use.  No evidence of abscess, perforation or
   focal collection on CT.  C. difficile negative x 1.
   - Culture data no growth to date; monitor
   - Continue broad coverage with vancomycin/aztreonam/levofloxacin/flagyl
   - Continue fluconazole x 7 days
   # Ileus: Patient passing gas and stooling, however persistent
   residuals.  Ileus most likely secondary to infection/SBP.  No history
   of prior abdominal surgeries per patient.
   - NG tube in place
   - Attempt tube feeds when decreased residuals
   - Zofran PRN
   # Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Patient with SBP on OSH
   paracentesis.  [**Month (only) 51**] have had microperforation on initial paracentesis
   resulting in slow resolution of infection.  PMN < 250 on paracentesis
   [**1-7**].  Currently broadly covering.
   - Continue levofloxacin, flagyl, aztreonam x 14 days
   - Received albumin days 1 and 3
   # Dyspnea: Likely secondary to restriction from large volume ascites as
   well as bilateral pleural effusions.  Question consolidation on chest
   x-ray.
   - Antibiotics as above
   - CVVH to remove fluid when stable
   - Oxygen by nasal cannula as needed
   # Anemia: Normocytic.  Likely anemia of chronic disease and from
   chronic kidney disease.  Status post 2U pRBC to improve CvO2.
   - Monitor
   # Candiduria: Receiving Diflucan for planned 7-day course.
   # Pain: Abdominal and arthritic pain.  Avoiding NSAIDS given renal
   failure.
   - Morphine 1-2 mg PRN

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and ileus. She is undergoing a liver/kidney transplant evaluation. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, renal failure, anion gap metabolic acidosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, leukocytosis, ileus, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, dyspnea, anemia, candiduria, and pain. The patient is receiving various treatments and medications to manage these conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's high pressure requirement is concerning for another etiology of hypotension such as abdominal compartment syndrome or new infection. Close monitoring of bladder pressures and consideration of paracentesis every other day is recommended.
2. Renal failure/anion gap metabolic acidosis: The diagnosis likely hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Renal failure likely precipitated by large volume paracentesis at OSH and SBP. Creatinine continues to rise and the patient is anuric. AG metabolic acidosis due to renal failure which is improved with bicarbonate tablets.
3. Alcoholic cirrhosis: MELD score 32 on admission to MICU. Liver disease most likely secondary to alcohol but evaluating for other possible etiologies and pursuing transplant evaluation.
4. Leukocytosis: White count remains elevated but is now"

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), a heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on several medications including vasopressin, calcium gluconate, KCl, phenylephrine, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate. 

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes. The WBC count is within normal range. The Hct level is slightly low, while the platelet count is slightly elevated. Glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is ill-appearing, with tenderness and distension in the abdomen, as well as a large amount of ascites. She has clear breath sounds with crackles at the bases of the lungs. Peripheral pulses are present bilaterally in both upper and lower extremities. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to self, location, and date, with purposeful movement and normal muscle tone.

The patient's goals of care have been changed to comfort, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Plan as per resident note.
   Briefly, 60 y/o woman with ESLD, now Type I HRS in MICU for CVVH.
   Hypotension seems out of proportion to fluid removal and in any case
   CVVH has been running even o/n. Ddx included sepsis and  (less likely)
   abdominal compartment syndrome. S/P LVP, will give albumin to replace
   portion of what was taken off.  Neo/vasopressin for MAP < 55 (goal less
   because of likely baseline low SVR). Follow bladder pressure.  Abx
   regimen now vanc/levo/flagyl/aztreonam. Latest tap not c/w peritonitis.
   Cultures pending, chest/abdmn/pelvis CT today. Hope to resume fluid
   removal as soon as possible, but difficult  in the setting of high
   pressor requirement. Aim even today. Respiratory status is tenuous but
   stable and improved post LVP.

","The patient is a 60-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who presented with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and type I hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with anuric renal failure and initiated on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).

The patient underwent paracentesis, with 2.5 liters of fluid removed. Her bladder pressure was measured at 28 mmHg. The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) was noted, and she expressed her desire to be made a comfort measure only (CMO). The family was in agreement with her decision.

The patient has multiple allergies to medications, including lisinopril, penicillins, simvastatin, tetracycline, theophylline, and macrolide antibiotics. Her last doses of antibiotics were levofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole, and aztreonam.

The patient is currently receiving several infusions, including vasopressin, calcium gluconate (CRRT), phenylephrine, and potassium chloride (CRRT). She is also receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and morphine sulfate.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), a heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with end-stage liver disease who has been admitted to the ICU with systemic bacterial peritonitis and type I hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She is currently experiencing anuric renal failure and has been started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to low blood pressure. The patient has expressed her wish to be made a comfort measures only (CMO) patient and her family is in agreement with this decision. The focus will be on comfort care, discontinuing all nonessential medications, and providing morphine, Ativan, and scopolamine as needed. The patient's arterial and central venous lines will be removed, and she will no longer receive nutritional support through a nasogastric tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to ESLD and the presence of systemic bacterial peritonitis, there is a risk of developing additional infections in the ICU.
2. Bleeding: The patient's elevated INR and prolonged PTT indicate a coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially considering the use of anticoagulant medications.
3. Renal failure: Despite being on CVVH, the patient's anuric renal failure may progress further, leading to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: As the patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was transferred from another hospital with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and type I hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). She is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with anuric renal failure and has been started on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient underwent a paracentesis, with 2.5 liters of ascites fluid removed. She also experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) this morning. The patient has allergies to lisinopril, penicillins, simvastatin, tetracycline, theophylline, and macrolide antibiotics. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is receiving vasopressin, calcium gluconate (CRRT), phenylephrine, and potassium chloride (CRRT). The patient has a history of alcohol use disorder (EtOH) and is now requesting to be made a comfort measures only (CMO) patient. Her family is in agreement with this decision.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). She is experiencing hypotension that seems out of proportion to the fluid removal, and CVVH has been running overnight. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis and abdominal compartment syndrome. The patient underwent large-volume paracentesis (LVP) and will receive albumin to replace the portion of fluid taken off. She is also receiving neosynthesis for mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 55 (with a goal of keeping it lower due to likely baseline low systemic vascular resistance), and bladder pressure will be monitored. The patient's antibiotic regimen includes vancomycin, levofloxacin, metronidazole, and aztreonam. Chest, abdominal, and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scans are planned for today. The goal is to resume fluid removal as soon as possible, but it is difficult in the setting of high pressor requirement. The patient's respiratory status is tenuous but stable and improved post LVP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's antibiotic regimen suggests a concern for sepsis, which is a potential complication given her immunocompromised state due to ESLD and the presence of multiple lines and catheters.
2. Abdominal compartment syndrome:"
