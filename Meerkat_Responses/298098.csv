","The patient is an elderly female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who presented with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient also has a pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's recent events include:
- Invasive ventilation started on [date]
- Sheath placement started on [date]
- EKG performed at [date]
- OR sent at [date]
- Sheath stopped at [date]

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:
1. Pericardial effusion with tamponade: The patient has a significant pericardial effusion that led to cardiac tamponade. She received an emergency pericardiocentesis and drainage of approximately 1 liter of blood. Repeat echocardiogram did not show further tamponade physiology. The patient received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and her hematocrit (Hct) is stable.
2. RV perforation: During the pacemaker placement, the patient experienced RV perforation, which required surgical intervention. The patient received a total of 5 units of pRBC and her"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) that was not successfully treated via percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and her hematocrit (Hct) is stable. She also has a pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and acute respiratory failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent MI and RV perforation increase the risk of further cardiac events such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or recurrent tamponade.
2. Respiratory complications: Due to the patient's COPD and acute respiratory failure, there is a risk of exacerbations, pneumonia, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Infection: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection, which may require antibiotics and further investigation.
4. Renal complications: The patient's recent use of intravenous fluids (IVF) and medications could potentially lead to acute kidney injury (AKI).
5. Thrombotic events: With the presence of PVD and critical limb"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, presenting with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) that was not successfully treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient is currently on medical management and has a pericardial effusion with tamponade. Other medical conditions include peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, airway compromise, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, and possible ischemic bowel.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion with tamponade: The patient has a significant pericardial effusion with tamponade, which can lead to impaired cardiac function and hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of hemodynamics and repeat echocardiography are necessary to assess the ongoing tamponade physiology.
2. Right leg ischemia: The patient experienced loss of distal pulses in the right leg after the placement of a femoral arterial line. Surgical intervention, including thrombectomy and endarterectomy, was performed. Continuous monitoring of peripheral pulses and serial Doppler examinations are recommended to evaluate the patency of the right leg vessels.
3. Fever/hypotension/leukocytosis: The patient developed fever and hypotension, which may indicate an infection, sepsis, or another"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), who presented with an anterior MI that failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient also has pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, airway management issues, and chronic respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is febrile and hypotensive, which may indicate sepsis related to lines or new hardware, or ischemic bowel. Blood cultures, urine analysis, and urine culture have been sent.
2. Ischemic bowel: The patient's abdominal tenderness and slightly tense abdomen raise concerns for ischemic bowel. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) has been ordered.
3. Cardiac tamponade: Although the patient's recent echocardiogram did not show further tamponade physiology after drainage, ongoing monitoring is required due to the possibility of reaccumulation.
4. Leg ischemia: The patient's right leg initially had lost pulses after femoral arterial line placement. She underwent a left superficial femoral artery (SFA) thrombectomy, femoral end"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and coronary artery disease, presenting with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) that failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient also has a pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, leukocytosis, hypertension, COPD exacerbation, and hyperglycemia. The patient is intubated and on invasive ventilation. The arterial line was placed due to the need for continuous blood pressure monitoring and frequent arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. The patient has received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and has a stable hematocrit level.

The patient underwent surgical procedures, including left femoral artery thrombectomy, femoral endarterectomy, and right femoral fasciotomy. The patient's right leg pulses were initially lost but regained after the procedures. The patient's creatinine kinase (CK) levels are within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low platelet count (Plt), normal troponin-T levels, and normal lactate levels. The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable.

The patient has a pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, airway compromise, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, acute myocardial infarction, RV perforation, and right leg ischemia. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pericardial effusion with tamponade: Continue close monitoring of hemodynamics, repeat echocardiogram (ECHO) today, check Hct every 8 hours, maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg, and continue to monitor for any signs of tamponade.
2. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia: Appreciate vascular recommendations, continue to check Doppler signals, monitor wound site, trend creatine kinase (CK) levels, and no anticoagulation given RV perforation.
3. Airway compromise: Continue current ventilation settings"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, airway inability to protect, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), RV perforation, and right leg ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has a fever, elevated white blood cell count, and positive cultures for GNR and GPC. She is being treated with vancomycin, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin due to penicillin allergy. The source of infection is suspected to be pneumonia, as indicated by the left retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray.
2. Pericardial effusion with tamponade: The patient had a small pericardial effusion that was initially thought to be causing tamponade. However, subsequent echocardiograms did not confirm tamponade, and the drain was removed. Close monitoring of hemodynamics and repeat echocardiogram if necessary are recommended.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including COPD, pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and a history of acute myocardial infarction. The patient is currently experiencing sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and is at risk for aspiration due to an inability to protect her airway.

The patient has undergone several interventions and procedures, including pacemaker placement complicated by right ventricular perforation and right leg ischemia. She also had a failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for an anterior myocardial infarction.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure ranging from 100/50 mmHg to 130/66 mmHg, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slight anemia, and normal renal function. Her cardiac enzymes are within normal limits.

The patient's current treatment plan includes antibiotics for pneumonia, anticoagulation therapy for peripheral vascular disease, and management of her COPD exacerbation with steroids and bronchodilators.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening sepsis leading to organ dysfunction, further deterioration of the patient's respiratory status, progression of peripheral vascular"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction and failed percutaneous coronary intervention. She underwent pacemaker placement complicated by right ventricular perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has a rising white blood cell count, fever, and positive cultures for gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci. She is being treated with vancomycin, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin due to penicillin allergy.

2. Pericardial effusion with tamponade: The patient had a small pericardial effusion, which initially caused tamponade but has since resolved. She underwent drainage, and the effusion has stabilized.

3. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia: The patient experienced loss of distal pulses after the placement of a right femoral arterial line. She underwent thrombectomy and endarterectomy of the left superficial femoral artery, as well as a right femoral fasciotomy. Dopplerable pulses were regained post-procedure, and her creatine kinase levels are within normal range.

4. Airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough): The patient required intubation after developing tamponade. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned off"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, presenting with an anterior myocardial infarction and failed percutaneous coronary intervention. She has undergone pacemaker placement complicated by right ventricular perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient is currently on medical management for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has a rising white blood cell count, fevers, and a positive sputum culture growing GNR and GPC. She is on antibiotics, but the source of infection needs to be identified and treated appropriately.
2. Pericardial effusion with tamponade: The patient has a small pericardial effusion, which was initially causing tamponade. Although the effusion size is stable, the patient should be monitored closely for any signs of recurrent tamponade.
3. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia: The patient has lost distal pulses in her right leg, indicating critical limb ischemia. She has undergone procedures such as left superficial femoral artery thrombectomy, femoral endarterectomy, and right fasciotomy. Close monitoring of pulses and wound sites is necessary.
4. Airway, inability to protect: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure and tamponade. She requires close monitoring of her airway and respiratory status.
5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, presenting with multiple medical complications. The patient underwent an angiography and experienced multi-lumen placement. She also had a trans-thoracic echo, during which an echogenic mass was noted in her right carotid artery, but carotid duplex did not show any mass. A central line was placed by interventional radiology (IR), and the patient was weaned off neo.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 132/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's weight has increased from 48.2 kg to 59.6 kg since admission.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues. She has impaired skin integrity, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. The patient also experienced a myocardial infarction (MI) and had a failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to a tight proximal lesion. She underwent pacemaker placement complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7030**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   intubated.  Sedation lessened.  Problems with afib with rapid response
   assoc with drop in BP and intermittent neo.
   on Meripenim and vanc with WBC 22.3.
   Good diuresis with lasix with Cr 1.1.
   Medical Decision Making
   Will add Amiodarone to try to restore NSR.
   Will try to move to extubation over next 48 hrs.
   Would avoid high dose beta blocker with severe COPD.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction and failed percutaneous coronary intervention. She underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient also has sepsis without organ dysfunction, pericardial effusion with tamponade, and peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 121 beats per minute, blood pressure of 64/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2. The patient is in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is being treated with metoprolol.

The patient's arterial blood gas results show pH of 7.25, PaCO2 of 24 mmHg, PaO2 of 80 mmHg, bicarbonate level of 21 mEq/L, base excess of -2 mEq/L, and lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L. The patient's complete blood count shows a white blood cell count of 23.8 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 31.5%, platelet count of 164 K/uL, and mean corpuscular volume of 97 fL"

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to a tight proximal lesion. The patient underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including impaired skin integrity, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. The patient also experienced an acute myocardial infarction.

The patient's current medications include meropenem, vancomycin, levofloxacin, metoprolol, amiodarone, aspirin, and plavix. 

The patient's recent lab results show stable white blood cell (WBC) count, normal hemoglobin (Hct), and elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), lactate, and lactic acid. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate (HR) of 121 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) of 64/37 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). 

The patient's physical examination reveals a cuffed, barrel-chested appearance with coarse breath sounds and transmitted ventricular sounds. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender without hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. 

The patient's medical plan includes continuing antibiotic therapy with meropenem, monitoring for allergic reactions due to penicillin allergy, and re-dosing vancomycin if necessary. The patient will also be monitored for fever, trend WBC count, and have daily chest X-rays. 

In terms of the potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for aspiration due to inability to protect the airway, altered gag reflex, and impaired airway clearance. The patient also has a history of COPD with acute exacerbation and requires close monitoring of respiratory status. Additionally, the patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections. The patient's peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia puts her at risk for further complications related to limb perfusion. The patient's recent RV perforation and pericardial effusion with tamponade indicate a need for careful cardiac monitoring."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD and is currently intubated due to respiratory failure.
- She presented with an anterior myocardial infarction and underwent a failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on a tight proximal lesion.
- The patient then underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia.
- She has a history of pneumonia and is currently being treated with meropenem.
- The patient also has impaired skin integrity, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pericardial effusion with tamponade, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia.
- She has an airway inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation.
- The patient is also diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, which can progress to septic shock if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is currently being treated with meropenem. There is a risk of developing further respiratory infections due to her compromised respiratory status.
3. RV perforation: The patient had a complication of RV perforation after pacemaker placement"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She has undergone pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient also has sepsis with pneumonia and is being treated with meropenem. Additionally, she has pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is already being treated for HAP with meropenem, so it is crucial to monitor her response to the antibiotic and continue with appropriate respiratory support.
2. RV perforation: Although the patient has had a drain placed and the effusion is trivial, there is still a risk of recurrent tamponade or other cardiac complications. Close monitoring of her hemodynamics and further evaluation by a cardiologist are recommended.
3. Right leg ischemia: The patient underwent femoral endarterectomy and right fasciotomy, but there is still a risk of complications such as wound infection or reoccurrence of ischemia. Regular assessment of her distal pulses and monitoring of the wound site are essential.
4. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD may worsen due to the recent respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, presenting with multiple medical complications. She was admitted for an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to a tight proximal lesion. The patient underwent pacemaker placement but experienced right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. She also has sepsis without organ dysfunction, pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation.

The patient has been on various medications including antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin) for a hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas, IV steroids for respiratory failure, albuterol/ipratropium for COPD exacerbation, and metoprolol for rate control in atrial fibrillation. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuating vital signs and multiple organ dysfunctions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and there is a risk of failure to extubate.
2. RV Perforation: Although the patient has a trivial effusion and no evidence of tamponade, close monitoring of hemodynamics and further evaluation are necessary.
3. Right Leg Ischemia: The patient's distal pulses were lost after the placement"

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to pressure ulcers. This can lead to increased risk of infection and potential complications if not properly managed.

2. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has an infection indicated by elevated white blood cell count and presence of pneumonia. If left untreated or not managed appropriately, it can progress to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.

3. Pericardial effusion with tamponade: The patient had a pericardial effusion with tamponade, which is a serious condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac, compressing the heart and affecting its function. This can lead to cardiac arrest if not promptly addressed.

4. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia: The patient has PVD and critical limb ischemia, which means there is reduced blood flow to the extremities. This increases the risk of tissue damage and potential amputation if not managed correctly.

5. Airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough): The patient's airway is currently secured through intubation due to respiratory failure. However, once extubation is attempted, there is a risk of aspiration and difficulty in maintaining airway clearance.

6. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerb"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, presenting with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She has undergone pacemaker placement complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient also has sepsis without organ dysfunction, pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation.

The patient's current condition includes impaired skin integrity, pneumonia with pseudomonas infection, RV perforation, right leg ischemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and acute myocardial infarction.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.9°C
- Heart rate: 86 bpm (71-117 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 64/37 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 19 inspiratory movements per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on supplemental oxygen

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hemoglobin (Hct), normal platelet count (Plt), and normal electrolyte levels.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing meropenem for hospital-acquired pneumonia, monitoring for allergic reaction due to penicillin allergy, maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), presenting with multiple comorbidities including sepsis without organ dysfunction, pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, airway inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough), myocardial infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI), and RV perforation. The patient has been on various medications including amiodarone, vancomycin, meropenem, prednisone, albuterol/ipratropium, and methylprednisolone. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 64/37 mmHg and heart rate of 76 bpm. The patient's recent laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.2 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, and decreased albumin level of 2.1 g/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, indicating a systemic infection. The presence of leukocytosis and positive cultures for pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas suggests ongoing bacterial infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and antibiotic therapy is necessary to prevent complications associated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presented with an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and myocardial infarction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. It is important to monitor her vital signs, blood culture results, and treat the infection promptly to prevent further deterioration.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and skin infections. Regular turning, proper positioning, and wound care should be implemented to prevent complications.
3. Pericardial Effusion with Tamponade: The patient experienced RV perforation during pacemaker placement, leading to a pericardial effusion with tamponade. Close monitoring of hemodynamics and echocardiogram results are necessary to detect any recurrence of tamponade.
4. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) with Critical Limb Ischemia: The patient's right leg"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction and failed PCI. She underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient has multiple comorbidities including sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute myocardial infarction.

Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has a history of HAP with WBC improvement, but now has a growing stenotrophomonas infection, which is sensitive to bactrim. However, the patient has an allergy to bactrim, so treatment is on hold pending sensitivity results.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, likely due to immobility and poor nutrition.
3. Pericardial effusion with tamponade: The patient developed a pericardial effusion after RV perforation during pacemaker placement. However, subsequent echocardiograms showed a trivial effusion without evidence of tamponade, and the drain was removed.
4. Peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia: The patient experienced loss of distal pulses after placement of a right femoral a-line, leading to right leg ischemia. She"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including COPD, myocardial infarction, impaired skin integrity, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and pericardial effusion with tamponade. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- She has an active infection indicated by the growth of pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas in her sputum cultures. She is currently on meropenem and vancomycin antibiotics, but there is a concern about a possible allergy to bactrim, which is sensitive to stenotrophomonas.
- She is experiencing dysphagia and impaired airway protection, requiring non-invasive ventilation support.
- She has a history of right leg ischemia, for which she underwent a femoral endarterectomy and right fasciotomy.
- She also has a history of right ventricular (RV) perforation during pacemaker placement, but the recent echocardiogram showed only a trivial effusion without evidence of tamponade. The drain was removed.
- She has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation.
- She has a history of myocardial infarction, specifically an anterior wall MI, and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to a tight proximal lesion.
- She has been on medical management and has a permanent pac"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical complications. The key findings and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be due to prolonged immobility or pressure ulcers.

2. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, indicated by an elevated white blood cell count and the presence of a hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She is currently receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy.

3. Pericardial effusion with tamponade: The patient experienced a pericardial effusion with tamponade after a pacemaker placement, but it has since resolved. The effusion was managed conservatively.

4. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia: The patient developed right leg ischemia after the placement of a femoral arterial line. She underwent surgical intervention, including thrombectomy and endarterectomy, and her pulses were restored.

5. Airway, inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough): The patient had a respiratory failure requiring invasive ventilation. She has since been successfully extubated and is on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation support.

6. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient has a history of COPD, but the accuracy of this diagnosis is questionable as there is mention of evaluating for"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to a tight proximal lesion. She underwent pacemaker placement but experienced right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia.
- The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is pansensitive. She is currently on meropenem, and vancomycin was discontinued yesterday.
- She also has a culture growing Stenotrophomonas, which is sensitive to levofloxacin and bactrim. However, the ID physician considers it as a colonizer and may not require treatment.
- The patient has respiratory failure and is on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) support. Her SpO2 is maintained at 99% with the use of a nasal cannula. She has been experiencing intermittent desaturation in the low 80s and required NIV+Shovel mask.
- Steroids were increased due to wheezing, and the patient's COPD exacerbation is being managed with methylprednisolone and albuterol/ipratropium nebulizations.
- The patient's right leg ischemia occurred after the placement of a right femoral arterial"

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient is currently on medical management for her conditions.

However, the ID physician may hold off on additional antibiotics for now.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) via a nasal cannula due to respiratory failure. She is also on albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers every four hours. A chest X-ray is recommended daily.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), presenting with multiple medical complications. She was admitted due to an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She had a pacemaker placed but experienced right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. She also has sepsis without organ dysfunction, pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and an inability to protect the airway.

The patient's arterial line stopped at 05:00 PM on [**2185-8-1**]. She was able to take nectar-thick oral intake and had her medications changed over. She intermittently desaturated to low 80s early in the day and was placed on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with a nasal cannula. Despite nebulizer treatments and NIPPV, she continued to wheeze. Her dose of albuterol/ipratropium was increased, and she was started on prednisone, which was later changed to her home dose of 60mg due to severe COPD.

The patient's amiodarone was switched from intravenous to oral, and her vancomycin was discontinued after seven days. Her wound care was consulted, and she underwent debridement of her right groin dressing due to a critical"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, dysphagia, impaired skin integrity, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, and a recent myocardial infarction (MI).

The patient presented with an anterior MI and failed PCI due to a tight proximal lesion. She underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient is currently on medical management for her conditions, including antibiotics for a hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.

The patient also has respiratory failure, for which she was successfully extubated and is now on nasal cannula oxygen support. Her COPD is being managed with corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and daily chest X-rays. The patient's RV perforation has resolved, and she has trivial effusion without evidence of tamponade. Her right leg ischemia required a femoral endarterectomy and right femoral fasciotomy.

The patient's rhythm is currently slow atrial fibrillation with atrioventricular dissociation, and she underwent pacemaker placement. She is being treated with amiodarone and beta"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), presenting with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to a tight proximal lesion. The patient underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including atrial fibrillation (AFIB), dysphagia, impaired skin integrity, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pericardial effusion with tamponade, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with critical limb ischemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. 

The patient was previously on mechanical ventilation but has been successfully extubated and is now on nasal cannula support. She is also receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and has an arterial line in place.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.0 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, and normal platelet count of 236 K/uL. Blood cultures are negative, but sputum is growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is sensitive to meropenem. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 111/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen.

Overall, the patient's medical condition is complex, with multiple comorbidities and recent complications. Close monitoring and management of her vital signs, oxygenation, respiratory status, infection, and cardiac function are essential for her recovery."

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, presenting with anterior myocardial infarction and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient underwent pacemaker placement complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. She has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is pansensitive to meropenem. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has also been identified, but its sensitivity to antibiotics is uncertain. The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and she requires non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). She also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AFib), RV perforation, right leg ischemia, and a previous myocardial infarction. The patient's current medications include amiodarone, beta-blockers, aspirin, and clopidogrel. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is expected to remain there until her respiratory status improves. Potential complications include sepsis, respiratory failure, RV dysfunction, and peripheral vascular disease."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presents with anterior myocardial infarction and failed percutaneous coronary intervention. She also has a complicated medical history, including RV perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient is currently on medical management and has undergone pacemaker placement. She is also experiencing respiratory failure, HAP with pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas infections, right leg ischemia, atrial fibrillation, and a recent NSTEMI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and she is dependent on non-invasive ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration leading to the need for endotracheal intubation.
2. HAP with Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas Infections: The patient has a rising WBC count and ongoing respiratory distress. There is a concern for progression of the infections, especially with pseudomonas, which is known to be resistant to many antibiotics.
3. Right Leg Ischemia: The patient's right leg previously experienced critical ischemia, and there is a risk of further complications such as tissue necrosis or gangrene if adequate blood flow is not restored.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and recent events have led to an increase in heart rate and possible cardiac remodeling. This can"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, presenting with anterior myocardial infarction and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She has undergone pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient is currently on medical management.

The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and she is being treated with meropenem. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has also been identified in the sputum culture, but treatment for this organism may not be necessary as it may be a colonizer. However, due to continued respiratory distress and worsening chest X-ray, levofloxacin therapy has been initiated.

The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) support, and steroids are being tapered off. Diuretics are being used to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1-1.5 liters.

The patient's RV perforation has resolved, but she had a trivial effusion and no evidence of tamponade. Daily hemoglobin levels are being monitored, and repeat echocardiography is considered if there are any hemodynamic changes.

The patient has right leg ischemia due to loss of distal pulses after the placement of a right femoral arterial line. She underwent a left superficial femoral artery thrombectomy, femoral endarterectomy, and right fasc"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient is currently on medical management and has several ongoing medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has COPD and requires non-invasive ventilation support. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and current ICU stay.
2. RV Perforation: Although the patient had a trivial effusion and no evidence of tamponade, there is a potential risk of recurrent hemodynamic instability or cardiac tamponade.
3. Right Leg Ischemia: The patient experienced critical limb ischemia in the right leg. Close monitoring of peripheral pulses and wound site is necessary to prevent further complications such as tissue necrosis or amputation.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AFib) and is currently being treated with amiodarone. There is a risk of recurrent AFib or development of heart rhythm disturbances.
5. Sepsis: The patient has a rising white blood cell count and positive cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which may indicate a bacterial infection. Close monitoring for signs of se"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction and failed percutaneous coronary intervention. She is currently on medical management and has had complications including RV perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient is also being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and respiratory failure. She has a pacemaker in place due to slow atrial fibrillation with AV dissociation, but this was complicated by RV perforation. The patient also has right leg ischemia, which required vascular interventions. Her coronary arteries have focal LAD lesions that could not be intervened upon. Her left ventricular ejection fraction is 45-50%. The patient is being treated for COPD exacerbation with steroids and bronchodilators. She has labile blood pressures but is currently stable. The patient has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place and her lines have been replaced.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with worsening COPD exacerbation and a small pneumothorax. Close monitoring and management of oxygen delivery, ventilation, and potential need for intubation are necessary.
2. HAP: The patient is being treated for HAP with antibiotics targeting pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas. Monitoring of fever curve and white blood cell count is important, as well as ensuring appropriate antibiotic coverage.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient is currently on medical management and has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She is being treated with antibiotics for pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas infections. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen requirement at home suggests a risk of respiratory failure. She is currently on 40mg prednisone and tapering, as well as albuterol/ipratropium Q4. Daily chest X-rays should be monitored, and the patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored.
2. RV Perforation: The patient had a tamponade after the perforation of the RV during pacemaker placement. However, a repeat echocardiogram showed a trivial effusion and no evidence of tamponade. The drain was removed on [**7-26**]. Daily hematocrit levels should be monitored, and a repeat echocardiogram should be considered if there are any hemodynamic changes.
3. Right Leg Ischemia: The patient lost distal pulses after the placement of the right femoral a-line. She underwent a left superficial femoral artery thrombectomy, femoral end"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She underwent pacemaker placement but experienced right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient is currently on medical management for her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient is at risk of developing HAP due to prolonged hospital stay and the presence of comorbidities such as COPD. The patient is already being treated with antibiotics for suspected pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas infections.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and requires supplemental oxygen. There is a concern for worsening respiratory status, especially with the presence of a small right pneumothorax.
3. RV perforation: Although the patient had a tamponade initially, it has resolved, and the drain was removed. However, there is a potential for recurrent tamponade or cardiac complications.
4. Right leg ischemia: The patient has lost distal pulses in the right leg, leading to ischemia. Previous interventions have been done, but ongoing monitoring and evaluation are necessary to assess the wound site and vascular status.
5. Rhythm disturbances: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (Afib) and presented with slow Afib and atriovent"

2. The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is pansensitive to meropenem. The patient is currently on meropenem, and levofloxacin has been added due to worsening respiratory distress and the worsening chest X-ray on [**8-2**].

3. The patient also has respiratory failure and is on non-invasive ventilation (NC support) because she required supplemental oxygen at home. The plan includes tapering steroids, continuing bronchodilators, and monitoring respiratory status.

4. The patient had a complication of RV perforation after pacemaker placement. An echocardiogram showed trivial effusion and no evidence of tamponade. The drain was removed on [**7-26**]. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) trended down to 27 from 29 today.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7347**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Multiple episodes of brief desaturation required too much nursing
   attention on [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 3 so transferred back to CCU.
   Still with intermittent resp distress.
   Medical Decision Making
   Continue regular neb and now prednisone at 50.
   Consider transfer to rehab soon.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to a tight proximal lesion. She is currently on medical management and has had a pacemaker placement complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. 

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient is being treated for pseudomonas and levofloxacin for stenotrophomonas, as per the Infectious Disease (ID) recommendation. The ID believes that stenotrophomonas may be a colonizer but started levofloxacin due to continued respiratory distress. The patient remains afebrile and is on steroids due to COPD.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient had an increased oxygen requirement at home and was returned to the CCU because of frequent desaturations. She is on 50mg prednisone and tapering, along with albuterol/ipratropium Q4, on home doses of Spiriva and Advair. Daily chest X-ray (CXR) is recommended, along with monitoring respiratory status, especially for pneumothorax. The patient is also on 40mg PO Lasix, with a goal of slightly negative fluid balance today, along with additional prn.

3. RV perforation: The patient had a tamponade after perforation"

The patient's recent events include being taken to the hospital ward, experiencing episodes of tachypnea and desaturation to low 80's, triggering twice, and eventually returning to the critical care unit (CCU) due to frequent nursing needs. The patient was unable to participate in physical therapy (PT) due to being out of breath and a Dobhoff catheter remained in place as the patient was not getting adequate oral intake.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, methyldopa, clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and Tylenol (anaphylaxis). The last dose of antibiotics administered was meropenem on [**2185-8-5**] at 11:00 PM.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She underwent pacemaker placement but developed right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient is currently on medical management and has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), respiratory failure, RV perforation, and right leg ischemia.

Medical Complications:

1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient is being treated with antibiotics for pseudomonas and levofloxacin for stenotrophomonas. The WBC count is trending down, indicating a positive response to the antibiotics. However, the patient remains on steroids due to COPD exacerbation.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient had an increased oxygen requirement at home and returned to the CCU due to frequent desaturations. She is currently on prednisone and tapering, albuterol/ipratropium every 4 hours, home doses of Spiriva and Advair, and Lasix for fluid management. Daily chest X-rays will be performed to monitor respiratory status, especially for pneumothorax.

3. RV perforation: The patient experienced tamponade after perforation of the RV during pacemaker placement. A repeat echocardiogram showed trivial effusion and no evidence of tamponade. The drain was removed on ["

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old female with COPD who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction and failed percutaneous coronary intervention. She underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular perforation and right leg ischemia.
- She has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics for pseudomonas and levofloxacin for stenotrophomonas.
- The patient has respiratory failure and is on steroids due to COPD. She requires oxygen and is being treated with albuterol and ipratropium.
- She experienced right ventricular perforation after pacemaker placement but now has a trivial effusion without evidence of tamponade. The drain was removed on [**7-26**].
- The patient underwent femoral endarterectomy and right fasciotomy for right leg ischemia. Her pulses are now dopplerable post-procedure.
- Her rhythm is slow atrial fibrillation with atrioventricular dissociation. She has had a pacemaker placed and is on amiodarone for rate control.
- She was transferred for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and underwent catheterization that showed focal left anterior descending artery lesions that could not be intervened upon. She is currently being medically managed.
- Her left ventricular ejection fraction is 45-50%. She has had a positive fluid balance overnight.
- She has been diagnosed with COPD and"

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on a tight proximal lesion. She is currently on medical management and has undergone pacemaker placement complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. 

The patient has been diagnosed with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), for which she is being treated with antibiotics targeting pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas. She remains afebrile but is on steroids due to her COPD. 

She has respiratory failure requiring oxygen supplementation and is on prednisone tapering weekly. She is also on albuterol/ipratropium nebulizers, Spiriva, and Advair for her respiratory condition. 

The patient experienced RV perforation after pacemaker placement, but subsequent echocardiography showed trivial effusion and no evidence of tamponade. The drain was removed on [**7-26**]. 

She also has right leg ischemia, which was treated with a femoral endarterectomy and right fasciotomy. Dopplerable pulses were regained post-procedure. 

The patient's rhythm is slow atrial fibrillation with AV dissociation, for which she underwent pacemaker placement. 

She previously had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation but presented with slow atrial fibrillation and AV dissociation.

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presents with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on a tight proximal lesion. The patient is currently on medical management, post pacemaker placement complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. 

The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and is being treated with meropenem and levofloxacin. She remains afebrile but is on steroids due to COPD exacerbation. 

The patient's respiratory status is monitored closely, especially for pneumothorax. She is receiving albuterol/ipratropium every four hours, as well as home doses of Spiriva and Advair. 

The patient's RV perforation has resolved, with a trivial effusion and no evidence of tamponade. A drain was removed on [**7-26**]. Daily Hct is stable, and a repeat echocardiogram will be considered if there are hemodynamic changes. 

The patient's right leg ischemia occurred after the placement of a right femoral arterial line. She underwent left superficial femoral artery (SFA) thrombectomy, femoral endarterectomy, and right femoral fasciotomy. Dopplerable pulses were restored after the procedure, and her CK levels are within normal range. 

The patient has a history of paroxys"

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo F with COPD presents with anterior MI and failed PCI on a tight
   proximal lesion currently on medical management, s/p pacemaker
   placement complicated by RV perforation and right leg ischemia.
   # HAP : WBC trending down, now on [**Last Name (un) **] for pseudomonas and levo for
   stenotrophomonas. Per ID, steno may be a colonizer, but started on Levo
   due to continued respiratory distress.
   - last day of meropenem today, #14/14
   - cont levo day #[**7-20**]
   - f/u CXR
   - blood cx and urine cx negative (final)
   - monitor temperature and trend WBC (normalized)
   - will be important to continue to mobilize her daily.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Pt had O2 requirement at home.  Returned to CCU
   because of frequent desaturations.  Has small, stable, right-sided
   pneumothorax.
   - On 50mg prednisone and tapering weekly (very slowly).
   - on home doses of Spiriva and Advair, plus standing ipratropium.  Also
   PRN Albuterol nebulizers.
   - On standing 40mg PO Lasix, yesterday was even, received extra 20mg
   lasix, -500 since midnight.  Goal today slightly negative.
   - pulmonary consult for optimization of COPD management.
   .
   # RV PERFORATION: Pt with tamponade after perforation of RV during
   pacer placement. Repeat ECHO showed trivial effusion and no e/o
   tamponade. Drain was removed [**7-26**]. Hct steady.
   -daily Hct - now stable, consider repeat ECHO if hemodynamic changes.
   .
   # RIGHT LEG ISCHEMIA: Distal pulses were lost after placement of right
   femoral a-line. s/p left SFA thrombectomy, femoral endarterectomy,
   right fasciotomy. +dopplerable pulses post-procedure. CK wnl
   - wound site slightly dusky.  Will talk with vascular surgery and
   consider wound nurse consult.
   - appreciate vascular recs
   - cont to check dopplers
   - monitor wound site, keep groin dry w/ desitin
   # RHYTHM: H/O paroxysmal Afib but presents with slow afib and AV
   dissociation.  Pt underwent pacemaker placement that was complicated by
   RV perforation. Pt previously with a-fib with RVR, now A-paced. Treated
   with amio
   - appreciate EP recs
   - Now on Amiodarone 400mg PO BID and metoprolol 25mg TID for rate
   control.
   - no warfarin; on asa/plavix
   - cont to monitor on tele
   # CORONARIES: Pt transferred for NSTEMI and is s/p cath that showed
   focal LAD lesions that could not be intevened . Pt was being medically
   managed and stable.

   # PUMP: EF 45-50
   - will continue strict I/Os for goal of negative 1-2 L.
   #ANEMIA: Hct trending down very slowly since admission, now at 24.2.
   Most likely iatrogenic.
   - Cont to monitor.  Transfusion goal Hct >21.
   # COPD: Pt on steroids for flare. Pulm was consulted prior to RV
   perforation. Recommended non-con CT for eval for right hilum. Question
   as to whether pt truly as COPD or other process given recent worsening
   over the last year.
   - cont steroids with taper.
   - cont albuterol/ipratropium

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a complex medical history. The note details multiple medical complications and interventions.

1. Coronary artery disease: The patient had an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to a tight proximal lesion. She is currently being managed medically and has undergone pacemaker placement.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and experienced respiratory distress at home. She was returned to the critical care unit (CCU) due to frequent desaturations and was found to have a small, stable right-sided pneumothorax. She is on various respiratory medications including prednisone, Spiriva, Advair, ipratropium, and albuterol nebulizers. A pulmonary consult is recommended for optimization of COPD management.

3. Right leg ischemia: The patient developed distal pulses loss after the placement of a right femoral arterial line. She underwent left superficial femoral artery thrombectomy, femoral endarterectomy, and right fasciotomy. Dopplerable pulses were restored post-procedure, but there is a concern about the wound site, which is slightly dusky. A wound nurse consult and communication with vascular surgery are recommended.

4. Right ventricular (RV) perforation: The patient experienced tamponade after RV perforation during pacemaker placement. However, subsequent echocardi"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to a tight proximal lesion. The patient has undergone pacemaker placement complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia.

The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and is currently being treated with levofloxacin for pseudomonas and levofoxacin for stenotrophomonas. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is trending down, indicating improvement. The patient's respiratory distress has also improved.

The patient has a small, stable right-sided pneumothorax and is receiving treatment with prednisone and inhaled bronchodilators. The patient's fluid balance needs to be monitored closely, with a goal of slightly negative intake/output (I/O) status.

The patient previously had a cardiac tamponade secondary to RV perforation during pacemaker placement, but this has resolved, and the drain was removed. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable.

The patient also experienced right leg ischemia, which resulted in loss of distal pulses after the placement of a right femoral arterial line. The patient underwent a left superficial femoral artery (SFA) thrombectomy, femoral endarterectomy, and right fasciotomy. Dop"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction and failed percutaneous coronary intervention. She underwent pacemaker placement but experienced right ventricular perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient is currently on medical management and has been diagnosed with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), respiratory failure, right ventricular perforation, and right leg ischemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with HAP, which may lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased oxygen requirements, and potential sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and small, stable right-sided pneumothorax may progress to severe respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
3. Right Leg Ischemia: The patient's right leg ischemia could worsen, leading to tissue necrosis and potential amputation if blood flow is not restored.
4. Right Ventricular Perforation: Although the patient has a trivial effusion and no evidence of tamponade, there is a risk of developing cardiac tamponade or persistent pericardial effusion, which can compromise cardiac function.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's focal LAD lesions could progress to further myocardial ischemia or infarction, potentially leading to heart failure or arrhythmias.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note, and additional clinical evaluation"

   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 659**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Eating a bit better with intermittent tube feedings.
   Less respiratory distress but still periods of agitation and decr sats
   with better sats and lower RR with sleep.
   Concern about some maceration of groin wound.
   Medical Decision Making
   Complete antibiotic course.
   Incr mobility.
   Taper prednisone to 40.
   Wound care.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on a tight proximal lesion. She is currently on medical management, post pacemaker placement complicated by right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient has a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), respiratory failure, RV perforation, right leg ischemia, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and is being treated with antibiotics. It is important to monitor her response to the treatment and watch for any worsening respiratory symptoms.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and requires supplemental oxygen. Close monitoring of her oxygen saturation levels is essential. Pulmonary consult may be needed for optimization of COPD management.
3. RV Perforation: The patient had a complication of RV perforation following pacemaker placement. Although the effusion has resolved, daily Hct monitoring should be continued, and repeat echo may be considered if there are any hemodynamic changes.
4. Right Leg Ischemia: The patient experienced right leg ischemia after the placement of a right femoral arterial line. She underwent thrombectomy, endarterectomy, and fasciotomy. Close monitoring of the wound site for signs of infection or worsening ischem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on a tight proximal lesion. She underwent pacemaker placement but developed right ventricular (RV) perforation and right leg ischemia. The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, anemia, and chronic kidney disease. She is currently on medical management and is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a small, stable right-sided pneumothorax and requires supplemental oxygen. She is at risk of further respiratory distress and potential failure.
2. RV Perforation: Although the patient had a trivial effusion and no evidence of tamponade, there is a risk of recurrent tamponade or cardiac dysfunction.
3. Right Leg Ischemia: The patient has lost distal pulses and underwent femoral endarterectomy, right fasciotomy, and revascularization. There is a risk of wound infection or non-healing of the leg wound.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been labile, and there is a need for close monitoring and adjustment of antihypertensive medications.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been trending down since admission, indicating iatrogenic anemia. Close monitoring and possible transfusion may be required.
6. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's creatinine levels indicate some degree of kidney dysfunction. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly will be necessary.
7. Infection: The patient has been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and has negative blood and urine cultures. However, there is still a risk of developing further infections due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, cardiac function, and wound healing. Regular assessments of kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood counts are also essential to manage the patient's comorbidities effectively and prevent further complications."

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction and failed percutaneous coronary intervention. She has undergone pacemaker placement, which was complicated by right ventricular perforation and right leg ischemia. 

The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and is being treated with levofloxacin for Stenotrophomonas. Her white blood cell count is trending down, and she is no longer on meropenem. 

She also has respiratory failure with a small, stable right-sided pneumothorax. She is on 40mg of prednisone for COPD flare, which is being tapered by 10mg weekly. 

The patient had a right ventricular perforation after pacemaker placement, but subsequent echocardiograms showed trivial effusion and no evidence of tamponade. The drain was removed on [**7-26**]. 

She also has right leg ischemia due to lost distal pulses after the placement of her right femoral a-line. She underwent a left SFA thrombectomy, femoral endarterectomy, and right fasciotomy. Dopplerable pulses were restored post-procedure. 

Her rhythm is slow atrial fibrillation with AV dissociation, for which she underwent pacemaker placement. She is being treated with amiodarone.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, who presented with an anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She has also experienced right leg ischemia, RV perforation, and is currently on medical management. The patient's condition includes hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), respiratory failure, RV perforation, right leg ischemia, and atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response (AFib). She underwent pacemaker placement, which was complicated by RV perforation. The patient has a history of NSTEMI and focal LAD lesions that could not be intervened upon. Her ejection fraction (EF) is 45-50%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and small, stable right-sided pneumothorax pose a risk of further respiratory failure. Pulmonary consult is recommended for optimization of COPD management.
2. RV Perforation: Although the patient's tamponade has resolved, there is a risk of recurrent tamponade or cardiac complications due to the previous RV perforation. Daily Hct monitoring and repeat ECHO if hemodynamic changes are observed are advised.
