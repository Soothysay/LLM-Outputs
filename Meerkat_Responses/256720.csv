   MICU INTERN PROGRESS NOTE
   [**2130-8-1**]
   .
   A/P: 73yo Russian speaking woman with h/o DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   hypothyroidism and gastroparesis who initially presented with  N/V and
   chest discomfort & subsequently found to be found to be hyponatremic
   who subsequently became acutely tachypneic and coded in the setting of
   a seizure and AMI; now transferred to the ICU.  Per patient's friend,
   had lost weight and having trouble for 6 months before with decreased
   appetite.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])- Initially unclear etiology
   but pt severely tachypnic causing marked respiratory alkalosis.
   Inciting event unclear but may be related to an ischemic event vs PE vs
   salicylate toxicity. Now seems to be an aspiration pna type picture and
   pulm edema.
   -still intubated bc failed extubation yesterday for upper airway
   inflammation from ET tube trauma-will give her few days to heal and try
   extubation on Monday. Hopefully son will be able to be here for that.
   Will try extubation that day with Cook Cath valve
   -consider ENT consult once pt intubated
   - Sputum showed moderate strep pneumo-pan sensitive-Continue Levo and
   Vanc
   - follow CXR-no interval change
   -for agitation, start on regular dose of haldol 2.5mg q6h and
   supplement benzos for prn agitation
   -continue lasix as needed for diuresis
   - Monitor serial ABGs
   .
Pneumonia: Pt had mild rising leukocytosis; currently has been
   febrile. CXR consistant with aspiration pna especially given history of
   seizure and code
   -white count down  10.4
   -F/u blood, sputum, urine cultures-none positive so far
   -continue Abx of Levaquin/Vanc
   -Repeat CXR
   .
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE, HYPERTENSION, BENIGN Pt had
   initial presentation of chest discomfort.  STE in I, AVL and STD in II,
   III and AVF.  Stat echo shows large anterior wall hypokinesis c/w
   ischemic event.  Troponin peaked at 0.71 on [**7-26**]
   - cardiology following, deferred on cath [**1-28**] concerns of infection
   - ECHO as above-showed MR, may be more significant than originally
   thought, contributing to her CHF
   - continue plavix
   - Atorvastatin 80 and asa 325mg daily
   - Increase BB to metoprolol 50mg QID, monitor for hypotension -may need
   to add another [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - f/u Lipid panel pending
   - Hold lisinopril as per renal for ARF
   .
Hypotension:  Resolving, etiology unknown either sepsis picutre vs
   cardiogenic shock and decreased EF
   -transfuse as needed
   -consider GI involvement after getting records from [**Hospital1 1817**]
   -Off levophed
   -continue to monitor
   .
Anemia- Hct 30s early in stay, went down to 24, this am down to 22.9.
   On Heparin for MI.  No source identified.  Groin site shows no evidence
   of hematoma but etiologies could be GI vs retroperitoneal bleed
   considering she got femoral line during code. Now with decrease in HCT
   of 22.9, then went back to 28.5 down, repeat 26.7 and up to 27.4 which
   seems stable.
   -Follow Hct continue to transfuse as needed
   -Guiac stools neg but will repeat
   -guiac NG tube fluids neg
   -consider EGD or colonscopy considering hx of diverticulosis and FamHx
   GI malignancy
   .
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS - Most likely pt seized in the
   setting of marked hyponatremia in addition to her profound alkalosis.
   An ABG was done when markedly tachypneic and pH was 7.7.  CT head was
   unremarkable.
   -no repeat seizure activity with corrected Na
   -Neuro following
   .
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)Resolved. Unclear etiology;
   pt may have been hyponatremic in the setting of poor PO intake in
   addition to her HCTZ; however pts Na was not responsive to fluids and
   Urine Na high; making concern for SIADH. CT head without evidence of
   tumor.  Pt not on any psych meds/SSRIs
   - Hold HCTZ
   - Renal signed off
   - follow urine electrolytes-try to establish etiology for ARF, Fena 1%
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need additional imaging to look for other possible tumor or cause
   of SIADH
   .
 Metabolic Acidosis-Pt initially presented with metabolic acidosis &
   AG of 18 on admission and post-code her lactate 11.4. Improved, now no
   gap.
   -If fluids needed, avoid more Cl so use LR or blood or NaBicarb
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 73yo Russian speaking woman with h/o DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   hypothyroidism and gastroparesis who initially presented with  N/V and
   chest discomfort & subsequently found to be found to be hyponatremic
   who subsequently became acutely tachypneic and coded in the setting of
   a seizure and AMI; now transferred to the ICU.  Per patient's friend,
   had lost weight and having trouble for 6 months before with decreased
   appetite.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])- Initially unclear etiology
   but pt severely tachypnic causing marked respiratory alkalosis.
   Inciting event unclear but may be related to an ischemic event vs PE vs
   salicylate toxicity. Now seems to be an aspiration pna type picture and
   pulm edema.
   -still intubated bc failed extubation yesterday for upper airway
   inflammation from ET tube trauma-will give her few days to heal and try
   extubation on Monday. Hopefully son will be able to be here for that.
   Will try extubation that day with Cook Cath valve
   -consider ENT consult once pt intubated
   - Sputum showed moderate strep pneumo-pan sensitive-Continue Levo and
   Vanc
   - follow CXR-no interval change
   -for agitation, start on regular dose of haldol 2.5mg q6h and
   supplement benzos for prn agitation
   -continue lasix as needed for diuresis
   - Monitor serial ABGs
   .
Pneumonia: Pt had mild rising leukocytosis; currently has been
   febrile. CXR consistant with aspiration pna especially given history of
   seizure and code
   -white count down  10.4
   -F/u blood, sputum, urine cultures-none positive so far
   -continue Abx of Levaquin/Vanc
   -Repeat CXR
   .
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE, HYPERTENSION, BENIGN Pt had
   initial presentation of chest discomfort.  STE in I, AVL and STD in II,
   III and AVF.  Stat echo shows large anterior wall hypokinesis c/w
   ischemic event.  Troponin peaked at 0.71 on [**7-26**]
   - cardiology following, deferred on cath [**1-28**] concerns of infection
   - ECHO as above-showed MR, may be more significant than originally
   thought, contributing to her CHF
   - continue plavix
   - Atorvastatin 80 and asa 325mg daily
   - Increase BB to metoprolol 50mg QID, monitor for hypotension -may need
   to add another [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - f/u Lipid panel pending
   - Hold lisinopril as per renal for ARF
   .
Hypotension:  Resolving, etiology unknown either sepsis picutre vs
   cardiogenic shock and decreased EF
   -transfuse as needed
   -consider GI involvement after getting records from [**Hospital1 1817**]
   -Off levophed
   -continue to monitor
   .
Anemia- Hct 30s early in stay, went down to 24, this am down to 22.9.
   On Heparin for MI.  No source identified.  Groin site shows no evidence
   of hematoma but etiologies could be GI vs retroperitoneal bleed
   considering she got femoral line during code. Now with decrease in HCT
   of 22.9, then went back to 28.5 down, repeat 26.7 and up to 27.4 which
   seems stable.
   -Follow Hct continue to transfuse as needed
   -Guiac stools neg but will repeat
   -guiac NG tube fluids neg
   -consider EGD or colonscopy considering hx of diverticulosis and FamHx
   GI malignancy
   .
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS - Most likely pt seized in the
   setting of marked hyponatremia in addition to her profound alkalosis.
   An ABG was done when markedly tachypneic and pH was 7.7.  CT head was
   unremarkable.
   -no repeat seizure activity with corrected Na
   -Neuro following
   .
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)Resolved. Unclear etiology;
   pt may have been hyponatremic in the setting of poor PO intake in
   addition to her HCTZ; however pts Na was not responsive to fluids and
   Urine Na high; making concern for SIADH. CT head without evidence of
   tumor.  Pt not on any psych meds/SSRIs
   - Hold HCTZ
   - Renal signed off
   - follow urine electrolytes-try to establish etiology for ARF, Fena 1%
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need additional imaging to look for other possible tumor or cause
   of SIADH
   .
 Metabolic Acidosis-Pt initially presented with metabolic acidosis &
   AG of 18 on admission and post-code her lactate 11.4. Improved, now no
   gap.
   -If fluids needed, avoid more Cl so use LR or blood or NaBicarb

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and gastroparesis. She presented initially with nausea and chest discomfort and was found to be hyponatremic. She subsequently became acutely tachypneic and experienced a seizure and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). She is now in the ICU for respiratory failure, acute but not ARDS, pneumonia, acute systolic heart failure, hypertension, benign, hypotension, anemia, seizure with status epilepticus, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe tachypnea has caused marked respiratory alkalosis. The inciting event is unclear but may be related to an ischemic event, pulmonary embolism, or salicylate toxicity. Now it seems to be an aspiration pneumonia type picture and pulmonary edema.

2. Pneumonia: The patient had mild rising leukocytosis and is currently febrile. The chest X-ray is consistent with aspiration pneumonia, especially considering the history of seizure and code. White blood cell count has decreased from 10.4, and cultures have not shown any positive results so far. Antibiotics (Levofloxacin and Vancomycin) should be continued, and a repeat chest X-ray should be done.

3. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's initial presentation was chest discomfort, and an electrocardiogram showed ST elevation in leads I, AVL, and STD in II, III, and AVF. A stat echo revealed large anterior wall hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic event. Troponin peaked at 0.71 on July 26th. Cardiology is following up, and a cardiac catheterization has been deferred due to concerns of infection. An echocardiogram showed mitral regurgitation, which may be more significant than initially thought and could be contributing to her heart failure. The patient should continue Plavix, Atorvastatin 80 mg, and aspirin daily. Metoprolol should be increased to 50 mg QID, and monitoring for hypotension should be done. Another beta-blocker may need to be added. A lipid panel is pending, and lisinopril should be held due to acute renal failure.

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is resolving, but the etiology is unknown. It could be septic shock, cardiogenic shock, or decreased ejection fraction. Transfusion as needed should be done, and consideration should be given to gastrointestinal involvement after obtaining records from Hospital1. Levophed should be discontinued, and continued monitoring should be done.

5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels have fluctuated, ranging from 30s early"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU for multiple medical conditions. The patient's arterial line stopped, and an unplanned removal of the line was attempted by the patient. The patient also experienced periods of apnea after receiving Haldol, labile blood pressure, and puritic skin on the back. The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, community-acquired pneumonia, benign hypertension, and status epilepticus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently unstable, with readings ranging from 79/49 mmHg to 166/644 mmHg. This indicates a risk of hypotension, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) suggests a possible infection. Given the patient's history of pneumonia and the current use of antibiotics, it is important to monitor for signs of infection and ensure appropriate treatment.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids over the past 24 hours, with a total input of 1,892 mL and output of 1,440 mL. This indicates a potential fluid overload, which can contribute to pulmonary edema and worsening heart failure symptoms.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's sodium level is low (325 K/uL), indicating hyponat"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including hypotension, respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, pneumonia, hypertension, seizure with status epilepticus, and sodium imbalance. The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications to manage these conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable with some fluctuations, and they are on mechanical ventilation support. The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in several parameters, indicating ongoing monitoring and intervention. The patient's overall condition remains critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: Given the presence of pneumonia and the patient's immunocompromised state due to multiple comorbidities, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Regular surveillance and prophylaxis measures should be implemented.
4. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of heart failure and myocardial infarction puts them at an increased risk for arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
5. Bleeding complications: Anticoagulation therapy for preventing throm"

   hypothyroidism and gastroparesis who initially presented with  N/V and
   chest discomfort & subsequently found to be found to be hyponatremic
   who subsequently became acutely tachypneic and coded in the setting of
   a seizure and AMI; now transferred to the ICU.  Per patient's friend,
   had lost weight and having trouble for 6 months before with decreased
   appetite.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])- Pt failed 2^nd trial of
   extubation due to upper airway edema, likely aspirated again as pt has
   had increased secretions overnight.  Component can be CHF and pulm
   edema.
   -still intubated bc fwill give her few days to heal and try extubation
   on Monday. Hopefully son will be able to be here for that. Will try
   extubation that day with Cook Cath valve. Now having episodes of apnea.
   -pt having periodic breathing could be central due to hypocapnia vs
   CHF, decreaseing resp drive, benzos could be contributing, pt on MMV
   for backup rate but entire process is likely benign and being
   exacerbated by ventilator
   -consider ENT consult once pt extubated

   ischemic event.  Troponin peaked at 0.71 on [**7-26**]
   - cardiology following, deferred on cath [**1-28**] concerns of infection-plus
   pt has declined cath in past
   - ECHO as above-showed MR, may be more significant than originally
   thought, contributing to her CHF
   - highly labile BP, hypotension seems to taper UO
   -continue plavix
   - Atorvastatin 80 and asa 325mg daily
   - on metoprolol 50mg QID but held for low BP
   - f/u Lipid panel pending
   - Hold lisinopril as per renal for ARF

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and gastroparesis. She presented with nausea, vomiting, chest discomfort, and was found to be hyponatremic. She subsequently became acutely tachypneic and experienced a seizure and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). She is currently intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by aspiration pneumonia and has a history of weight loss and decreased appetite. The patient's condition includes acute systolic heart failure (CHF), hypertension, pneumonia, hypotension, anemia, and a seizure with status epilepticus. She is being treated with various medications and interventions to manage her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to aspiration pneumonia. If not properly managed, it could lead to further deterioration in lung function and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration pneumonia can worsen if not adequately treated, leading to increased inflammation, infection, and potential sepsis.
3. Acute Systolic Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's CHF can progress if her cardiac function does not improve, leading to fluid accumulation and pulmonary edema.
4. Hypotension: If the patient's hypotension is not appropriately managed, it could result in inadequate tissue"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 73yo Russian speaking woman with h/o DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   hypothyroidism and gastroparesis who initially presented with  N/V and
   chest discomfort & subsequently found to be found to be hyponatremic
   who subsequently became acutely tachypneic and coded in the setting of
   a seizure and AMI; now transferred to the ICU.  Per patient's friend,
   had lost weight and having trouble for 6 months before with decreased
   appetite.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])- Initially unclear etiology
   but pt severely tachypnic causing marked respiratory alkalosis.
   Inciting event unclear but may be related to an ischemic event vs PE vs
   salicylate toxicity. Now seems to be an aspiration pna type picture and
   pulm edema.
   - Advance tube approx 3-4 cm.
   -still intubated bc failed extubation yesterday for upper airway
   inflammation from ET tube trauma-will give her few days to heal and try
   extubation on Monday. Hopefully son will be able to be here for that.
   Will try extubation that day with Cook Cath valve
   -IP consult prior to extubation
   - Sputum showed moderate strep pneumo-pan sensitive-Continue Levo and
   Vanc
   - follow CXR-no interval change except as noted above
   -for agitation, start on regular dose of haldol 2.5mg q6h and
   supplement benzos or haldol for prn agitation
   -continue lasix as needed for diuresis
   - Monitor serial ABGs
   .
Pneumonia: Pt had mild rising leukocytosis; currently has been
   febrile. CXR consistant with aspiration pna especially given history of
   seizure and code
   -white count down  10.4
   -F/u blood, sputum, urine cultures-none positive so far
   -continue Abx of Levaquin/Vanc
   -Repeat CXR
   .
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE, HYPERTENSION, BENIGN Pt had
   initial presentation of chest discomfort.  STE in I, AVL and STD in II,
   III and AVF.  Stat echo shows large anterior wall hypokinesis c/w
   ischemic event.  Troponin peaked at 0.71 on [**7-26**]
   - cardiology following, deferred on cath [**1-28**] concerns of infection
   - ECHO as above-showed MR, may be more significant than originally
   thought, contributing to her CHF
   - continue plavix, Atorvastatin 80 and asa 325mg daily
   - Increase BB to metoprolol 50mg QID, monitor for hypotension -may need
   to add another [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - Lipid panel resulted (HDL 64, LDL 64, Total cholesterol 143)
   - Restart Lisinopril at 5 mg as Cr is normalizing, monitor BP
   .
Hypotension:  Resolving, etiology unknown either sepsis picture vs
   cardiogenic shock and decreased EF
   -transfuse as needed
   -consider GI involvement after getting records from [**Hospital1 1817**]
   -continue to monitor
Anemia- Hct 30s early in stay, went down to 24, this am down to 22.9.
   On Heparin for MI.  No source identified.  Groin site shows no evidence
   of hematoma but etiologies could be GI vs retroperitoneal bleed
   considering she got femoral line during code. Now with decrease in HCT
   of 22.9, then went back to 28.5 down, repeat 26.7 and up to 27.4 which
   seems stable.
   -Follow Hct continue to transfuse as needed
   - Guiac POSITIVE stool, continue to monitor
   -guiac NG tube fluids neg
   -consider EGD or colonscopy considering hx of diverticulosis and FamHx
   GI malignancy, will consult if Hct continues to drop
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS - Most likely pt seized in the
   setting of marked hyponatremia in addition to her profound alkalosis.
   An ABG was done when markedly tachypneic and pH was 7.7.  CT head was
   unremarkable.
   -no repeat seizure activity with corrected Na
   -Neuro following
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)Resolved. Unclear etiology;
   pt may have been hyponatremic in the setting of poor PO intake in
   addition to her HCTZ; however pts Na was not responsive to fluids and
   Urine Na high; making concern for SIADH. CT head without evidence of
   tumor.  Pt not on any psych meds/SSRIs
   - Hold HCTZ
   - Renal signed off
   - follow urine electrolytes-try to establish etiology for ARF, Fena 1%
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need additional imaging to look for other possible tumor or cause
   of SIADH in future
 Metabolic Acidosis-Pt initially presented with metabolic acidosis &
   AG of 18 on admission and post-code her lactate 11.4. Improved, now no
   gap.
   -If fluids needed, avoid more Cl so use LR or blood or NaBicarb

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:  In ICU while intubated, will plan on extubation on Monday
   and reassess then.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and gastroparesis. She initially presented with nausea, vomiting, and chest discomfort before experiencing an acute respiratory failure event that led to a code and subsequent admission to the ICU.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe tachypnea causing marked respiratory alkalosis. Initially, the etiology was unclear, but it may be related to an ischemic event, pulmonary embolism, or salicylate toxicity. Now, it seems to be an aspiration pneumonia type picture with laryngeal edema. The tube has been advanced, and she remains intubated due to failed extubation yesterday for upper airway inflammation from ET tube trauma. Extubation is planned for Monday with IP consult prior to extubation.

2. Pneumonia: The patient had mild rising leukocytosis and is febrile. CXR is consistent with aspiration pneumonia, especially given her history of seizure and code. Blood, sputum, and urine cultures are negative so far. Antibiotics (Levo and Vanc) will be continued, and a repeat CXR will be done.

3. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute, Hypertension, Benign: The patient presented with chest discomfort,"

Anemia- Hct 30s early in stay, went down to 24, this am down to 22.9.
   On Heparin for MI.  No source identified.  Groin site shows no evidence
   of hematoma but etiologies could be GI vs retroperitoneal bleed
   considering she got femoral line during code. Now with decrease in HCT
   of 22.9, then went back to 28.5 down, repeat 26.7 and up to 27.4 which
   seems stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and gastroparesis. She initially presented with nausea, vomiting, chest discomfort, and subsequent acute respiratory failure. She experienced a seizure and cardiac arrest during the course of her stay, requiring resuscitation. She was intubated and transferred to the ICU.

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, hypotension, anemia, and hyponatremia. She also had a myocardial infarction with ST elevations in leads I, AVL, and STD in II, III, and AVF. A stat echo showed large anterior wall hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic event. Troponin peaked at 0.71 on [7-26].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with severe tachypnea causing marked respiratory alkalosis. The inciting event is unclear but may be related to an ischemic event, pulmonary embolism, or salicylate toxicity. Now, it seems to be an aspiration pneumonia type picture and pulmonary edema. She remains intubated due to failed extubation yesterday for upper airway inflammation from ET tube trauma.

2. Pneumonia: The patient had mild rising leukocytosis and is febr"

   FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**8-4**], the tip of the endotracheal
   tube
   lies approximately 5.3 cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube and right
   IJ
   catheter remain in place. Little overall change in the appearance of
   the
   heart and lungs, with opacification at the left base consistent with
   some
   combination of atelectasis, effusion, or even consolidation.
   A/P: 73yo Russian speaking woman with h/o DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   hypothyroidism and gastroparesis who initially presented with  N/V and
   chest discomfort & subsequently found to be found to be hyponatremic
   who subsequently became acutely tachypneic and coded in the setting of
   a seizure and AMI; now transferred to the ICU.  Per patient's friend,
   had lost weight and having trouble for 6 months before with decreased
   appetite.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])- Initially unclear etiology
   but pt severely tachypnic causing marked respiratory alkalosis.
   Inciting event unclear but may be related to an ischemic event vs PE vs
   salicylate toxicity. Now seems to be an aspiration pna type picture and
   pulm edema.
   -still intubated bc failed extubation  for upper airway inflammation
   from ET tube trauma-will give her few days to heal and try extubation
   on Monday. Hopefully son will be able to be here for that. Will try
   extubation that day with Cook Cath valve
   -IP consult prior to extubation
   -can also check cuff link and consider steroids prior to extubation for
   laryngeal edema
   - Sputum showed moderate strep pneumo-pan sensitive-Continue Levo and
   Vanc
   - follow CXR-no interval change except as noted above
   -for agitation, start on regular dose of haldol 2.5mg q6h and
   supplement benzos or haldol for prn agitation-follow EKG for prolonged
   QTc
   -continue lasix as needed for diuresis-keep I/Os even
   - Monitor serial ABGs
Pneumonia: Pt had mild rising leukocytosis; currently has been
   febrile. CXR consistent with aspiration pna especially given history of
   seizure and code
   -white count down  10.4
   -F/u blood, sputum, urine cultures-none positive so far
   -continue Abx of Levaquin/Vanc
   -Repeat CXR
   .
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE, HYPERTENSION, BENIGN Pt had
   initial presentation of chest discomfort.  STE in I, AVL and STD in II,
   III and AVF.  Stat echo shows large anterior wall hypokinesis c/w
   ischemic event.  Troponin peaked at 0.71 on [**7-26**]
   - cardiology following, deferred on cath [**1-28**] concerns of infection, pt
   has also refused cath in past so will need to discuss with her once
   extubated
   - ECHO as above-showed MR, may be more significant than originally
   thought, contributing to her CHF
   - continue plavix, Atorvastatin 80 and asa 325mg daily
   - Increase BB to metoprolol 50mg QID, monitor for hypotension -may need
   to add another [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - Lipid panel resulted (HDL 64, LDL 64, Total cholesterol 143)
   - Restart Lisinopril at 5 mg as Cr is normalizing, monitor BP
Hypotension:  Resolving, etiology unknown either sepsis picture vs
   cardiogenic shock and decreased EF
   -transfuse as needed
   -consider GI involvement after getting records from [**Hospital1 1817**]
   -continue to monitor
Anemia- Hct 30s early in stay, went down to 24, this am down to 22.9.
   On Heparin for MI.  No source identified.  Groin site shows no evidence
   of hematoma but etiologies could be GI vs retroperitoneal bleed
   considering she got femoral line during code. Now with decrease in HCT
   of 22.9, then went back to 28.5 down, repeat 26.7 and up to 27.4 which
   seems stable.
   -Follow Hct continue to transfuse as needed
   - Guiac POSITIVE stool, continue to monitor
   -guiac NG tube fluids neg
   -consider EGD or colonscopy considering hx of diverticulosis and FamHx
   GI malignancy, will consult if Hct continues to drop
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS - Most likely pt seized in the
   setting of marked hyponatremia in addition to her profound alkalosis.
   An ABG was done when markedly tachypneic and pH was 7.7.  CT head was
   unremarkable.
   -no repeat seizure activity with corrected Na
   -Neuro following
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)Resolved. Unclear etiology;
   pt may have been hyponatremic in the setting of poor PO intake in
   addition to her HCTZ; however pts Na was not responsive to fluids and
   Urine Na high; making concern for SIADH. CT head without evidence of
   tumor.  Pt not on any psych meds/SSRIs
   - Hold HCTZ
   - Renal signed off
   - follow urine electrolytes-try to establish etiology for ARF, Fena 1%
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need additional imaging to look for other possible tumor or cause
   of SIADH in future
 Metabolic Acidosis-Pt initially presented with metabolic acidosis &
   AG of 18 on admission and post-code her lactate 11.4. Improved, now no
   gap.
   -If fluids needed, avoid more Cl so use LR or blood or NaBicarb

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She was admitted with hyponatremia and seizure, resulting in respiratory failure. The patient has undergone two failed extubations due to upper airway trauma and compromise. Her overall ventilator status has shown reasonable improvement, with a favorable Respiratory System Compliance Index (RSBI) and good ventilation requirement. However, there are concerns about upper airway compromise after repeated re-intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which led to her admission. Despite improvement in ventilator status, there is a risk of further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or exacerbation of the current condition.
2. Tracheobronchial Disease: The patient has experienced trauma to the trachea/bronchus during the attempted extubations. This can lead to tracheobronchial injury or inflammation, potentially affecting her ability to breathe properly.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient has been agitated and confused, indicating the possibility of delirium. This condition can worsen if not managed appropriately and may delay her recovery.
4. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's ECG changes and cardiac symptoms raise concerns for an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). This condition requires immediate attention and management.
5. Heart Failure: The patient's symptoms suggest acute heart failure,"

   some combination of atelectasis, effusion, or even consolidation. The
   right
   lung remains essentially clear.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 73yo Russian speaking woman with h/o DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   hypothyroidism and gastroparesis who initially presented with  N/V,
   chest discomfort, and hyponatremia who subsequently became acutely
   tachypneic and coded in the setting of a seizure and AMI.  Per
   patient's friend, had lost weight and having trouble for 6 months
   before with decreased appetite.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])- Initially unclear
   etiology; may be related to an ischemic event vs PE vs salicylate
   toxicity. Now seems to be an aspiration pna type picture with pulm
   edema.
   - still intubated bc failed extubation  for upper airway inflammation
   from ET tube trauma-will give her few days to heal and try extubation
   on Monday. Hopefully son will be able to be here for that. Will try
   extubation that day with Cook Cath valve.
   - SBT today for 30-60 min on PS 8, PEEP 0. Evaluate clinically during
   trial.
   - Check I/Os this PM and decide on whether to give lasix with the goal
   of keeping her even.
   - Increase lisinopril to 7.5 this PM if BP can tolerate, in order to
   minimize pulmonary edema for extubation tomorrow.
   - IP consult prior to extubation
   - follow CXR
   - for agitation, start on regular dose of haldol 2.5mg q6h and
   supplement benzos or haldol for prn agitation-follow EKG for prolonged
   QTc
   - Monitor serial ABGs with ventilation settings changes.
 Chest pain: Pt complains of new, L-sided chest pain during rounds
   today.
   -          EKG this AM, prior to SBT.
   -          Cardiac enzymes this PM.
   -          Continue all current cardiac meds.
Pneumonia: Pt has mild rising leukocytosis (to 12.0 from 9.5).
   Afebrile and clinical respiratory status is stable. CXR relatively
   unchanged.
   - Levaquin/Vanc 10 day courses were finished yesterday.
   - Follow CXR
 Leukocytosis: Mild and rising only gradually. Pt is afebrile and
   clinically stable.
   - Follow WBC.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE, HYPERTENSION, BENIGN Pt had
   initial presentation of chest discomfort.  STE in I, AVL and STD in II,
   III and AVF.  Stat echo shows large anterior wall hypokinesis c/w
   ischemic event.  Troponin peaked at 0.71 on [**7-26**]
   - cardiology following, deferred on cath [**1-28**] concerns of infection, pt
   has also refused cath in past so will need to discuss with her once
   extubated
   - ECHO as above-showed MR, may be more significant than originally
   thought, contributing to her CHF
   - Lipid panel resulted (HDL 64, LDL 64, Total cholesterol 143)
   - continue plavix, Atorvastatin 80 and asa 325mg daily
   - continue metoprolol 50mg QID, monitor for hypotension
   - Continue Lisinopril at 5 mg as Cr is normali, monitor BP
Hypotension:  BP low but fairly stable (SBP maintained above 88).
   Etiology likely cardiogenic shock and decreased EF.
   - transfuse as needed; no indication now
   - continue to monitor BP
Anemia-  Hct has been hovering between 26 and 30 for duration of stay.
   29.4 yesterday and 27.8 today.  No source of bleed identified.  Groin
   site shows no evidence of hematoma but etiologies could be GI vs
   retroperitoneal bleed considering she got femoral line during code.
   Stool was guiac positive then negative on [**7-30**].
   - Repeat Hct this PM.
   - If hct continues to drop, guiac and get hemolysis labs (haptoglobin
   and LDH).
   - Transfuse as needed.
   - consider EGD or colonscopy considering hx of diverticulosis and FamHx
   GI malignancy, will consult if Hct continues to drop.
 Elevated PTT: 63.6 today.
   -          Holding SC heparin.
   -          Monitor.
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS - Most likely pt seized in the
   setting of marked hyponatremia in addition to her profound alkalosis.
   An ABG was done when markedly tachypneic and pH was 7.7.  CT head was
   unremarkable.
   -no repeat seizure activity with corrected Na
   -Neuro following
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)Resolved. Unclear etiology;
   pt may have been hyponatremic in the setting of poor PO intake in
   addition to her HCTZ; however pts Na was not responsive to fluids and
   Urine Na high; making concern for SIADH. CT head without evidence of
   tumor.  Pt not on any psych meds/SSRIs. Sodium is now stabilized.
   - Hold HCTZ
   - Renal signed off
   - Fena 1%
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need additional imaging to look for other possible tumor or cause
   of SIADH in future
 Metabolic Acidosis-Pt initially presented with metabolic acidosis &
   AG of 18 on admission and post-code her lactate 11.4. Improved, now no
   gap.
   -If fluids needed, avoid more Cl so use LR or blood or NaBicarb

","The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and gastroparesis. She initially presented with nausea, vomiting, chest discomfort, and hyponatremia. The patient subsequently became acutely tachypneic and experienced a cardiac arrest in the setting of a seizure and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 

The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure, which initially had an unclear etiology but is now thought to be aspiration pneumonia with pulmonary edema. The plan is to give her a few more days to heal and then attempt extubation on Monday with the use of a Cook catheter valve. 

The patient also has leukocytosis, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, benign hypertension, anemia with a low hemoglobin level, elevated PTT, seizure with status epilepticus, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, and hypothyroidism. 

The patient's chest pain is a new left-sided chest pain experienced during rounds today. An EKG was performed this morning, prior to a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Cardiac enzymes will be checked this evening. 

The patient's pneumonia shows mild rising leukocytosis but she is afebrile and clinically stable. A chest X-ray (CXR) was done and shows little overall change, with some enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and gastroparesis. She presented with nausea, vomiting, and chest discomfort and was found to be hyponatremic. She subsequently became acutely tachypneic and experienced a seizure and myocardial infarction (AMI). She is now in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially had unclear etiology but later developed marked respiratory alkalosis. She was intubated due to failed extubation caused by upper airway inflammation from ET tube trauma. She may have aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has mild rising leukocytosis and is febrile. Her chest X-ray is consistent with aspiration pneumonia, especially considering her history of seizure and code.
3. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute, Hypertension, Benign: The patient initially presented with chest discomfort, and a stat echo showed large anterior wall hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic event. Troponin peaked at 0.71. Cardiology is following, but deferred on catheterization due to concerns of infection. The patient also refused catheterization in the past, so discussing it once extubated will be necessary. An echo also showed mitral regurgitation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, tracheobronchial disease, delirium, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, heart failure, hypertension, and other conditions. The patient has been receiving various treatments and medications in the ICU. The patient's vital signs and laboratory results are within normal limits. The patient's progress notes indicate ongoing management of their conditions and monitoring of their health status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and tracheobronchial disease put them at risk for further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), aspiration pneumonia, or worsening hypoxemia.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of myocardial infarction and heart failure may predispose them to cardiac complications like arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or recurrent myocardial infarction.
3. Infection: The patient's presence of pneumonia increases the risk of developing other infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium may persist or worsen, leading to increased cognitive dysfunction and potential complications such as falls or pressure ulcers.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's use of stress ulcer prophylaxis and the presence of delirium may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or stress ulcers.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (D"

   CXR:
   In comparison with study of [**8-5**], there is little overall change.
   The various tubes remain in place. There is still though some
   enlargement of
   the cardiac silhouette with opacification at the left base consistent
   with
   some combination of atelectasis, effusion, or even consolidation. The
   right
   lung remains essentially clear.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 73yo Russian speaking woman with h/o DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   hypothyroidism and gastroparesis who initially presented with  N/V,
   chest discomfort, and hyponatremia who subsequently became acutely
   tachypneic and coded in the setting of a seizure and AMI.  Per
   patient's friend, had lost weight and having trouble for 6 months
   before with decreased appetite.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])- Initially unclear
   etiology; may be related to an ischemic event vs PE vs salicylate
   toxicity. Now seems to be an aspiration pna type picture with pulm
   edema.
   - still intubated bc failed extubation  for upper airway inflammation
   from ET tube trauma-will give her few days to heal and try extubation
   on Monday. Hopefully son will be able to be here for that. Will try
   extubation that day with Cook Cath valve.
   - SBT today for 30-60 min on PS 8, PEEP 0. Evaluate clinically during
   trial.
   - Check I/Os this PM and decide on whether to give lasix with the goal
   of keeping her even.
   - Increase lisinopril to 7.5 this PM if BP can tolerate, in order to
   minimize pulmonary edema for extubation tomorrow.
   - IP consult prior to extubation
   - follow CXR
   - for agitation, start on regular dose of haldol 2.5mg q6h and
   supplement benzos or haldol for prn agitation-follow EKG for prolonged
   QTc
   - Monitor serial ABGs with ventilation settings changes.
 Chest pain: Pt complains of new, L-sided chest pain during rounds
   today.
   -          EKG this AM, prior to SBT.
   -          Cardiac enzymes this PM.
   -          Continue all current cardiac meds.
Pneumonia: Pt has mild rising leukocytosis (to 12.0 from 9.5).
   Afebrile and clinical respiratory status is stable. CXR relatively
   unchanged.
   - Levaquin/Vanc 10 day courses were finished yesterday.
   - Follow CXR
 Leukocytosis: Mild and rising only gradually. Pt is afebrile and
   clinically stable.
   - Follow WBC.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE, HYPERTENSION, BENIGN Pt had
   initial presentation of chest discomfort.  STE in I, AVL and STD in II,
   III and AVF.  Stat echo shows large anterior wall hypokinesis c/w
   ischemic event.  Troponin peaked at 0.71 on [**7-26**]
   - cardiology following, deferred on cath [**1-28**] concerns of infection, pt
   has also refused cath in past so will need to discuss with her once
   extubated
   - ECHO as above-showed MR, may be more significant than originally
   thought, contributing to her CHF
   - Lipid panel resulted (HDL 64, LDL 64, Total cholesterol 143)
   - continue plavix, Atorvastatin 80 and asa 325mg daily
   - continue metoprolol 50mg QID, monitor for hypotension
   - Continue Lisinopril at 5 mg as Cr is normali, monitor BP
Hypotension:  BP low but fairly stable (SBP maintained above 88).
   Etiology likely cardiogenic shock and decreased EF.
   - transfuse as needed; no indication now
   - continue to monitor BP
Anemia-  Hct has been hovering between 26 and 30 for duration of stay.
   29.4 yesterday and 27.8 today.  No source of bleed identified.  Groin
   site shows no evidence of hematoma but etiologies could be GI vs
   retroperitoneal bleed considering she got femoral line during code.
   Stool was guiac positive then negative on [**7-30**].
   - Repeat Hct this PM.
   - If hct continues to drop, guiac and get hemolysis labs (haptoglobin
   and LDH).
   - Transfuse as needed.
   - consider EGD or colonscopy considering hx of diverticulosis and FamHx
   GI malignancy, will consult if Hct continues to drop.
 Elevated PTT: 63.6 today.
   -          Holding SC heparin.
   -          Monitor.
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS - Most likely pt seized in the
   setting of marked hyponatremia in addition to her profound alkalosis.
   An ABG was done when markedly tachypneic and pH was 7.7.  CT head was
   unremarkable.
   -no repeat seizure activity with corrected Na
   -Neuro following
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)Resolved. Unclear etiology;
   pt may have been hyponatremic in the setting of poor PO intake in
   addition to her HCTZ; however pts Na was not responsive to fluids and
   Urine Na high; making concern for SIADH. CT head without evidence of
   tumor.  Pt not on any psych meds/SSRIs. Sodium is now stabilized.
   - Hold HCTZ
   - Renal signed off
   - Fena 1%
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need additional imaging to look for other possible tumor or cause
   of SIADH in future
 Metabolic Acidosis-Pt initially presented with metabolic acidosis &
   AG of 18 on admission and post-code her lactate 11.4. Improved, now no
   gap.
   -If fluids needed, avoid more Cl so use LR or blood or NaBicarb

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old Russian-speaking woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and gastroparesis. She initially presented with nausea, vomiting, chest discomfort, and hyponatremia, followed by acute tachypnea and cardiac arrest. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), initially unclear etiology, now seems to be an aspiration pneumonia type picture with pulmonary edema. She is still intubated due to failed extubation for upper airway inflammation from ET tube trauma, with plans for extubation on Monday.

   73 yo female wtih DM and admit with respiratory failure attributable to
   both hydrostatic edema and subsequent pneumonia with failed extubation
   initially due to acute onset of pulmonary edema and on second failure
   due to upper airway obstruction.  She now has reasonable tolerance of
   decrease in PSV support and has suggestion on cuff leak examination of
   upper airway patency.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
Patient with good tolerance
   of PSV at this time and does have come component of increased
   resistance with ETT-6.[**Street Address(2) 4110**].  With adequate support hemodynamics
   and oxygenation appear well stabilized.   Will perform today
   SBT x 60 minutes with PSV=8 and no PEEP today
   -Monitor for Chest Pain, Tachycardia and Hypertension and ischemia as
   these variables will be the ones that are most likely to contribute to
   recurrent failure.
   -If hemodynamic instability is seen will have to consider advancement
   of cardiac regimen and/or use of IV agents around the time of
   extubation to allow successful extubation.
 TRACHEOBRONCHIAL DISEASE, OTHER (TRACHEA / BRONCHUS, INCLUDING

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) admitted with respiratory failure due to hydrostatic edema and subsequent pneumonia. The patient initially failed extubation due to acute pulmonary edema and later due to upper airway obstruction. However, there is a suggestion of upper airway patency based on cuff leak examination.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent respiratory failure: The patient's tolerance of pressure support ventilation (PSV) is good at the moment, but monitoring for chest pain, tachycardia, and hypertension will be important to prevent recurrent failure.

2. Tracheobronchial disease: The patient has improved upper airway obstruction, but caution will be needed during extubation to prevent further complications.

3. Delirium/confusion: The patient may be at risk for delirium or confusion due to the critical illness and sedation from medications.

4. Bacterial pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and appropriate antibiotics (Vanco/Levo) have been initiated.

5. Myocardial infarction: The patient's cardiac status should be closely monitored for signs of myocardial infarction (AMI), considering the risk factors such as age, DM, and current medications.

6. Acute heart failure: The patient is at risk for acute heart failure (CHF), especially considering the presence"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 73yo Russian speaking woman with h/o DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   hypothyroidism and gastroparesis who initially presented with  N/V,
   chest discomfort, and hyponatremia who subsequently became acutely
   tachypneic and coded in the setting of a seizure and AMI.  Per
   patient's friend, had lost weight and having trouble for 6 months
   before with decreased appetite.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])- Initially unclear
   etiology; but likely related to an ischemic event with pulm edema.
   - still intubated bc failed extubation  for upper airway inflammation
   from ET tube trauma-will give her few days to heal and try extubation
   today. Son here and will be in room for extubation. Will try extubation
   that day with Cook Cath valve.
   - SBT today for 30-60 min on PS 8, PEEP 0. Evaluate clinically during
   trial.
   - I/Os even without extra lasix.
   - IP consult prior to extubation. Anesthesia should be informed prior
   as well. Will have airway cart by bedside.
   - follow CXRs for ET tube placement.
   - for agitation, start on regular dose of haldol 2.5mg q6h and
   supplement benzos or haldol for prn agitation-follow EKG for prolonged
   QTc
 Chest pain: Pt having CP sounding like angina with trops flat and no
   EKG changes with pain yesterday.
   -                Continue all current cardiac meds.
   -                When extubated will again assess whether patient would
   want a cath.
Pneumonia: Pt has mild rising leukocytosis (to 13.5 from 9.5). Running
   low-grade fevers. Clinical respiratory status is stable. CXR relatively
   unchanged.
   - Levaquin/Vanc 10 day courses were finished [**2130-8-5**].
   - Follow CXR
 Leukocytosis: Mild and rising only gradually.
   -                Follow WBC.
   -                Will pan-culture to find source
   -                Will d/c central line if spikes fever or WBCs continue
   to go up if patient tolerates extubation and no longer needs propofol.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE, HYPERTENSION, BENIGN Pt had
   initial presentation of chest discomfort.  STE in I, AVL and STD in II,
   III and AVF.  Stat echo shows large anterior wall hypokinesis c/w
   ischemic event.  Troponin peaked at 0.71 on [**7-26**]
   - cardiology following, deferred on cath [**1-28**] concerns of infection, pt
   has also refused cath in past so will need to discuss with her once
   extubated
   - ECHO as above-showed MR, may be more significant than originally
   thought, contributing to her CHF
   - Lipid panel resulted (HDL 64, LDL 64, Total cholesterol 143)
   - continue plavix, Atorvastatin 80 and asa 325mg daily
   - continue metoprolol 50mg QID, monitor for hypotension
   - Continue Lisinopril at 5 mg as Cr is normal, monitor BP
Hypotension:  BP low but fairly stable (SBP maintained above 88).
   Etiology likely cardiogenic shock and decreased EF.
   - transfuse as needed; no indication now
   - continue to monitor BP
Anemia-  Hct has been hovering between 26 and 30 for duration of stay.
   29.4 -> 27.8->26.9 today.  No source of bleed identified.  Groin site
   shows no evidence of hematoma but etiologies could be GI vs
   retroperitoneal bleed considering she got femoral line during code.
   Stool was guiac positive then negative on [**7-30**].
   -. Repeat Hct this PM.
   - If hct continues to drop, guaiac stools and get hemolysis labs
   (haptoglobin and LDH)
   - Transfuse as needed. ([**Month (only) 60**] also help with cardiac status).
   - consider EGD or colonscopy considering hx of diverticulosis and FamHx
   GI malignancy, will consult if Hct continues to drop.
 PTT normal today.
   -          Re-start SC heparin.
   -          Monitor.
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS - Most likely pt seized in the
   setting of marked hyponatremia in addition to her profound alkalosis.
   An ABG was done when markedly tachypneic and pH was 7.7.  CT head was
   unremarkable.
   -no repeat seizure activity with corrected Na
   -Neuro following
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)Resolved. Unclear etiology;
   pt may have been hyponatremic in the setting of poor PO intake in
   addition to her HCTZ; however pts Na was not responsive to fluids and
   Urine Na high; making concern for SIADH. CT head without evidence of
   tumor.  Pt not on any psych meds/SSRIs. Sodium is now stabilized.
   - Hold HCTZ
   - Renal signed off
   - Fena 1%
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need additional imaging to look for other possible tumor or cause
   of SIADH in future
 Metabolic Acidosis-Pt initially presented with metabolic acidosis &
   AG of 18 on admission and post-code her lactate 11.4. Improved, now no
   gap.
   -If fluids needed, avoid more Cl so use LR or blood or NaBicarb

","The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and gastroparesis. She presented initially with nausea, vomiting, chest discomfort, and hyponatremia, followed by acute tachypnea and a cardiac arrest in the setting of a seizure and acute myocardial infarction. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions, including respiratory failure, pneumonia, heart failure (systolic), hypertension, benign, leukocytosis, anemia, hypotension, seizure with status epilepticus, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, and hypothyroidism.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, pneumonia progression, exacerbation of heart failure, hypertension, and continued hypotension. Additionally, there is a possibility of further leukocytosis, anemia, seizure activity, electrolyte imbalances, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's overall condition should be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should be implemented to prevent or manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and gastroparesis. She initially presented with nausea, vomiting, chest discomfort, and hyponatremia. She subsequently experienced acute tachypnea and coded during a seizure and acute myocardial infarction. The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure and has shown signs of decreased laryngeal edema. She continues to have chest pain, but troponin levels are stable and no EKG changes have been observed. The patient's blood pressure is low but fairly stable, and her heart rate and respiratory rate are within normal limits. Her oxygen saturation is 97%. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated due to failed extubation attempts caused by upper airway inflammation from ET tube trauma. The plan is to give her a few more days to heal before attempting extubation again.
2. Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI): The patient had an AMI, which was confirmed by an echocardiogram showing large anterior wall hypokinesis. Troponin levels peaked at 0.71 on [7-26]. Cardiology is following up, and a cardiac catheterization has been deferred due to concerns of infection and the patient's refusal in the past.
3. Heart Failure (CHF"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 73yo Russian speaking woman with h/o DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   hypothyroidism and gastroparesis who initially presented with  N/V,
   chest discomfort, and hyponatremia who subsequently became acutely
   tachypneic and coded in the setting of a seizure and AMI.  Per
   patient's friend, had lost weight and having trouble for 6 months
   before with decreased appetite.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])- Initially unclear
   etiology; may be related to an ischemic event vs PE vs salicylate
   toxicity. Now seems to be an aspiration pna type picture with pulm
   edema.
   - still intubated bc failed extubation  for upper airway inflammation
   from ET tube trauma-will give her few days to heal and try extubation
   on Monday. Hopefully son will be able to be here for that. Will try
   extubation that day with Cook Cath valve.
   - SBT today for 30-60 min on PS 8, PEEP 0. Evaluate clinically during
   trial.
   - Check I/Os this PM and decide on whether to give lasix with the goal
   of keeping her even.
   - Increase lisinopril to 7.5 this PM if BP can tolerate, in order to
   minimize pulmonary edema for extubation tomorrow.
   - IP consult prior to extubation
   - follow CXR
   - for agitation, start on regular dose of haldol 2.5mg q6h and
   supplement benzos or haldol for prn agitation-follow EKG for prolonged
   QTc
   - Monitor serial ABGs with ventilation settings changes.
 Chest pain: Pt complains of new, L-sided chest pain during rounds
   today.
   -          EKG this AM, prior to SBT.
   -          Cardiac enzymes this PM.
   -          Continue all current cardiac meds.
Pneumonia: Pt has mild rising leukocytosis (to 12.0 from 9.5).
   Afebrile and clinical respiratory status is stable. CXR relatively
   unchanged.
   - Levaquin/Vanc 10 day courses were finished yesterday.
   - Follow CXR
 Leukocytosis: Mild and rising only gradually. Pt is afebrile and
   clinically stable.
   - Follow WBC.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE, HYPERTENSION, BENIGN Pt had
   initial presentation of chest discomfort.  STE in I, AVL and STD in II,
   III and AVF.  Stat echo shows large anterior wall hypokinesis c/w
   ischemic event.  Troponin peaked at 0.71 on [**7-26**]
   - cardiology following, deferred on cath [**1-28**] concerns of infection, pt
   has also refused cath in past so will need to discuss with her once
   extubated
   - ECHO as above-showed MR, may be more significant than originally
   thought, contributing to her CHF
   - Lipid panel resulted (HDL 64, LDL 64, Total cholesterol 143)
   - continue plavix, Atorvastatin 80 and asa 325mg daily
   - continue metoprolol 50mg QID, monitor for hypotension
   - Continue Lisinopril at 5 mg as Cr is normali, monitor BP
Hypotension:  BP low but fairly stable (SBP maintained above 88).
   Etiology likely cardiogenic shock and decreased EF.
   - transfuse as needed; no indication now
   - continue to monitor BP
Anemia-  Hct has been hovering between 26 and 30 for duration of stay.
   29.4 yesterday and 27.8 today.  No source of bleed identified.  Groin
   site shows no evidence of hematoma but etiologies could be GI vs
   retroperitoneal bleed considering she got femoral line during code.
   Stool was guiac positive then negative on [**7-30**].
   - Repeat Hct this PM.
   - If hct continues to drop, guiac and get hemolysis labs (haptoglobin
   and LDH).
   - Transfuse as needed.
   - consider EGD or colonscopy considering hx of diverticulosis and FamHx
   GI malignancy, will consult if Hct continues to drop.
 Elevated PTT: 63.6 today.
   -          Holding SC heparin.
   -          Monitor.
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS - Most likely pt seized in the
   setting of marked hyponatremia in addition to her profound alkalosis.
   An ABG was done when markedly tachypneic and pH was 7.7.  CT head was
   unremarkable.
   -no repeat seizure activity with corrected Na

   - Hold HCTZ
   - Renal signed off
   - Fena 1%
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need additional imaging to look for other possible tumor or cause
   of SIADH in future
 Metabolic Acidosis-Pt initially presented with metabolic acidosis &

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 73yo Russian speaking woman with h/o DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   hypothyroidism and gastroparesis who initially presented with  N/V,
   chest discomfort, and hyponatremia who subsequently became acutely
   tachypneic and coded in the setting of a seizure and AMI.  Per
   patient's friend, had lost weight and having trouble for 6 months
   before with decreased appetite.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])- Initially unclear
   etiology; may be related to an ischemic event vs PE vs salicylate
   toxicity. Now seems to be an aspiration pna type picture with pulm
   edema.
   - still intubated bc failed extubation  for upper airway inflammation
   from ET tube trauma-will give her few days to heal and try extubation
   today. Hopefully son will be able to be here for that. Will try
   extubation that day with Cook Cath valve.
   - SBT today for 30-60 min on PS 8, PEEP 0. Evaluate clinically during
   trial.
   - I/Os even without extra lasix.
   - Increase lisinopril to 7.5 this PM if BP can tolerate, in order to
   minimize pulmonary edema for extubation tomorrow.
   - IP consult prior to extubation
   - follow CXR
   - for agitation, start on regular dose of haldol 2.5mg q6h and
   supplement benzos or haldol for prn agitation-follow EKG for prolonged
   QTc
   - Monitor serial ABGs with ventilation settings changes.
 Chest pain: Pt CP free this am with trops flat and no EKG changes
   with pain yesterday.
   -          Continue all current cardiac meds.
Pneumonia: Pt has mild rising leukocytosis (to 13.5 from 9.5). Running
   low-grade fevers. Clinical respiratory status is stable. CXR relatively
   unchanged.
   - Levaquin/Vanc 10 day courses were finished [**2130-8-5**].
   - Follow CXR
 Leukocytosis: Mild and rising only gradually.
   - Follow WBC.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE, HYPERTENSION, BENIGN Pt had
   initial presentation of chest discomfort.  STE in I, AVL and STD in II,
   III and AVF.  Stat echo shows large anterior wall hypokinesis c/w
   ischemic event.  Troponin peaked at 0.71 on [**7-26**]
   - cardiology following, deferred on cath [**1-28**] concerns of infection, pt
   has also refused cath in past so will need to discuss with her once
   extubated
   - ECHO as above-showed MR, may be more significant than originally
   thought, contributing to her CHF
   - Lipid panel resulted (HDL 64, LDL 64, Total cholesterol 143)
   - continue plavix, Atorvastatin 80 and asa 325mg daily
   - continue metoprolol 50mg QID, monitor for hypotension
   - Continue Lisinopril at 5 mg as Cr is normal, monitor BP
Hypotension:  BP low but fairly stable (SBP maintained above 88).
   Etiology likely cardiogenic shock and decreased EF.
   - transfuse as needed; no indication now
   - continue to monitor BP
Anemia-  Hct has been hovering between 26 and 30 for duration of stay.
   29.4 -> 27.8->26.9 today.  No source of bleed identified.  Groin site
   shows no evidence of hematoma but etiologies could be GI vs
   retroperitoneal bleed considering she got femoral line during code.
   Stool was guiac positive then negative on [**7-30**].
   - Guaiac stools and get hemolysis labs (haptoglobin and LDH). Repeat
   Hct this PM.
   - If hct continues to drop,
   - Transfuse as needed. ([**Month (only) 60**] also help with cardiac status).
   - consider EGD or colonscopy considering hx of diverticulosis and FamHx
   GI malignancy, will consult if Hct continues to drop.
 PTT normal today.
   -          Re-start SC heparin.
   -          Monitor.
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS - Most likely pt seized in the
   setting of marked hyponatremia in addition to her profound alkalosis.
   An ABG was done when markedly tachypneic and pH was 7.7.  CT head was
   unremarkable.
   -no repeat seizure activity with corrected Na
   -Neuro following
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)Resolved. Unclear etiology;
   pt may have been hyponatremic in the setting of poor PO intake in
   addition to her HCTZ; however pts Na was not responsive to fluids and
   Urine Na high; making concern for SIADH. CT head without evidence of
   tumor.  Pt not on any psych meds/SSRIs. Sodium is now stabilized.
   - Hold HCTZ
   - Renal signed off
   - Fena 1%
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need additional imaging to look for other possible tumor or cause
   of SIADH in future
 Metabolic Acidosis-Pt initially presented with metabolic acidosis &
   AG of 18 on admission and post-code her lactate 11.4. Improved, now no
   gap.
   -If fluids needed, avoid more Cl so use LR or blood or NaBicarb

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and gastroparesis. She presented with nausea, vomiting, chest discomfort, and hyponatremia. She subsequently became tachypneic and experienced a seizure and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure, initially unclear etiology, now appears to be aspiration pneumonia type picture with pulmonary edema. She has been given several medications, including propofol, midazolam, fentanyl, morphine sulfate, famotidine, and haloperidol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to an aspiration pneumonia type picture with pulmonary edema. She is still intubated and attempts will be made for extubation today.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has mild rising leukocytosis and low-grade fevers, indicating a possible infection. Her chest X-ray is relatively unchanged.
3. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute, Hypertension, Benign: The patient initially presented with chest discomfort and stat echo showed large anterior wall hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic event. Troponin peaked at 0.71 on [**7-26**]. She also has mitral regurgitation, which may be more significant"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and gastroparesis. She initially presented with nausea, vomiting, chest discomfort, and hyponatremia, and subsequently became acutely tachypneic and experienced a cardiac arrest in the setting of a seizure and acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS) - Initially unclear etiology, but likely related to an ischemic event with pulmonary edema. She remains intubated due to failed extubation for upper airway inflammation from ET tube trauma. SBT today for 30-60 minutes on PS 8, PEEP 0 to evaluate clinically during the trial.
2. Chest pain - Pt CP free this am with troponin flat and no EKG changes with pain yesterday. Continue all current cardiac medications.
3. Pneumonia - Pt has mild rising leukocytosis (to 13.5 from 9.5). Running low-grade fevers. Clinical respiratory status is stable. CXR relatively unchanged. Levaquin/Vanc 10-day courses were finished on [**2130-8-5**]. Follow CXR.
4. Leukocytosis - Mild and rising only gradually. Follow WBC.
5. Heart failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with tracheobronchial disease, delirium/confusion, acute myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, hypertension, and other conditions. The patient underwent invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated after showing signs of distress. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 164/74 mmHg to 95/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm. The patient is receiving various medications and infusions, including nitroglycerin, heparin sodium, famotidine, and morphine sulfate. Fluid balance and respiratory support data are also provided. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count and troponin T levels. The patient's condition remains under observation, with ongoing assessment and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Tracheobronchial disease: The patient may be at risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia, tracheal stenosis, or bronchial strictures due to the initial injury and mechanical ventilation.
2. Delirium/confusion: The patient may experience continued cognitive impairment, disorientation, or agitation, which can increase the risk of falls, self-removal of lines or tubes, and poor adherence to medical interventions.
3. Acute myocardial infarction: The patient may"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 73yo Russian speaking woman with h/o DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   hypothyroidism and gastroparesis who initially presented with  N/V,
   chest discomfort, and hyponatremia who subsequently became acutely
   tachypneic and coded in the setting of a seizure and AMI.  Per
   patient's friend, had lost weight and having trouble for 6 months
   before with decreased appetite.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])- Initially unclear
   etiology; but likely related to an ischemic event with pulm edema.
   -Extubated yesterday and doing well on O2 by NC now.
   - I/Os even without extra lasix.
 Leukocytosis: Rose from 9 to 20 in last 3 days.
   -                Follow WBC.
   -                Pan-cultured.
   -                Will d/c central line today and culture tip.
 Chest pain: Pt having recurrent episodes of CP sounding like angina
   although could be feeling her SVT and PVCs. Trops flat and no EKG
   changes with pain yesterday.
   -                Continue all current cardiac meds.
   -                When extubated will again assess whether patient would
   want a cath.
   -                On metoprolol 50 QID. [**Month (only) 60**] increase dose to better
   control SVT esp since resting HR in high-70s (goal beta blockade is HR
   60) and as BP running high (150s systolic).
Pneumonia: Clinical respiratory status is stable. CXR slightly more
   opacification in LLL.
   -                Levaquin/Vanc 10 day courses were finished [**2130-8-5**]
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE, HYPERTENSION, BENIGN Pt had
   initial presentation of chest discomfort.  STE in I, AVL and STD in II,
   III and AVF.  Stat echo shows large anterior wall hypokinesis c/w
   ischemic event.  Troponin peaked at 0.71 on [**7-26**]
   - cardiology following, deferred on cath [**1-28**] concerns of infection, pt
   has also refused cath in past so will need to discuss with her once
   extubated
   - ECHO as above-showed MR, may be more significant than originally
   thought, contributing to her CHF
   - Lipid panel resulted (HDL 64, LDL 64, Total cholesterol 143)
   - continue plavix, Atorvastatin 80 and asa 325mg daily
   - Now on Metoprolol 50 QID. [**Month (only) 60**] need more with high BP and HR 70s with
   SVT.
   - Continue Lisinopril at 5 mg as Cr is normal, monitor BP
Hypotension:  Now resolved and actually hypertensive.
Anemia-  Hct has been hovering between 26 and 30 for duration of
   stay.  No source of bleed identified.  Stool was guiac positive then
   negative on [**7-30**]. Was concern for retroperitoneal hematoma as got fem
   line in code but now hct stable for several days so this is less
   likely.
 PTT normal today. Restarted SC heparin yesterday.
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS - Most likely pt seized in the
   setting of marked hyponatremia in addition to her profound alkalosis.
   An ABG was done when markedly tachypneic and pH was 7.7.  CT head was
   unremarkable and no repeat seizure activity with corrected Na
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)Resolved. Unclear etiology;
   pt may have been hyponatremic in the setting of poor PO intake in
   addition to her HCTZ; however pts Na was not responsive to fluids and
   Urine Na high; making concern for SIADH. CT head without evidence of
   tumor.  Pt not on any psych meds/SSRIs. Sodium is now stabilized.
   - Hold HCTZ
   - Renal signed off
   - Fena 1%
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need additional imaging to look for other possible tumor or cause
   of SIADH in future
 Metabolic Acidosis-Pt initially presented with metabolic acidosis &
   AG of 18 on admission and post-code her lactate 11.4. Improved, now no
   gap.

","The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and gastroparesis. She presented initially with nausea, vomiting, chest discomfort, and hyponatremia. She subsequently experienced acute tachypnea and coded during a seizure and acute myocardial infarction. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), leukocytosis, chest pain, pneumonia, heart failure (CHF), systolic, acute, hypertension, benign, anemia, hypotension, seizure with status epilepticus, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, and hypothyroidism. 

The patient has been extubated and is doing well on oxygen by nasal cannula. Her input/output balance is even without extra lasix. She has recurrent episodes of chest pain, which may be angina or feeling her supraventricular tachycardia and premature ventricular contractions. Troponin levels are flat, and there are no EKG changes with pain yesterday. 

The patient's cardiac medications should continue, and she will be assessed again regarding whether she wants a cardiac catheterization. Her metoprolol dose should be increased to better control her SVT, especially since her resting heart rate is in the high 70s (goal beta blockade is HR 60), and her blood pressure is running high (150"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 73yo Russian speaking woman with h/o DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   hypothyroidism and gastroparesis who initially presented with  N/V,
   chest discomfort, and hyponatremia who subsequently became acutely
   tachypneic and coded in the setting of a seizure and AMI.  Per
   patient's friend, had lost weight and having trouble for 6 months
   before with decreased appetite.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])- Initially unclear
   etiology; but likely related to an ischemic event with pulm edema.
   - still intubated bc failed extubation  for upper airway inflammation
   from ET tube trauma-will give her few days to heal and try extubation
   today. Son here and will be in room for extubation. Will try extubation
   that day with Cook Cath valve.
   - SBT today for 30-60 min on PS 8, PEEP 0. Evaluate clinically during
   trial.
   - I/Os even without extra lasix.
   - IP consult prior to extubation. Anesthesia should be informed prior
   as well. Will have airway cart by bedside.
   - follow CXRs for ET tube placement.
   - for agitation, start on regular dose of haldol 2.5mg q6h and
   supplement benzos or haldol for prn agitation-follow EKG for prolonged
   QTc
 Chest pain: Pt having CP sounding like angina with trops flat and no
   EKG changes with pain yesterday.
   -                Continue all current cardiac meds.
   -                When extubated will again assess whether patient would
   want a cath.
Pneumonia: Pt has mild rising leukocytosis (to 13.5 from 9.5). Running
   low-grade fevers. Clinical respiratory status is stable. CXR relatively
   unchanged.
   - Levaquin/Vanc 10 day courses were finished [**2130-8-5**].
   - Follow CXR
 Leukocytosis: Mild and rising only gradually.
   -                Follow WBC.
   -                Will pan-culture to find source
   -                Will d/c central line if spikes fever or WBCs continue
   to go up if patient tolerates extubation and no longer needs propofol.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE, HYPERTENSION, BENIGN Pt had
   initial presentation of chest discomfort.  STE in I, AVL and STD in II,
   III and AVF.  Stat echo shows large anterior wall hypokinesis c/w
   ischemic event.  Troponin peaked at 0.71 on [**7-26**]
   - cardiology following, deferred on cath [**1-28**] concerns of infection, pt
   has also refused cath in past so will need to discuss with her once
   extubated
   - ECHO as above-showed MR, may be more significant than originally
   thought, contributing to her CHF
   - Lipid panel resulted (HDL 64, LDL 64, Total cholesterol 143)
   - continue plavix, Atorvastatin 80 and asa 325mg daily
   - continue metoprolol 50mg QID, monitor for hypotension
   - Continue Lisinopril at 5 mg as Cr is normal, monitor BP
Hypotension:  BP low but fairly stable (SBP maintained above 88).
   Etiology likely cardiogenic shock and decreased EF.
   - transfuse as needed; no indication now
   - continue to monitor BP
Anemia-  Hct has been hovering between 26 and 30 for duration of stay.
   29.4 -> 27.8->26.9 today.  No source of bleed identified.  Groin site
   shows no evidence of hematoma but etiologies could be GI vs
   retroperitoneal bleed considering she got femoral line during code.
   Stool was guiac positive then negative on [**7-30**].
   -. Repeat Hct this PM.
   - If hct continues to drop, guaiac stools and get hemolysis labs
   (haptoglobin and LDH)
   - Transfuse as needed. ([**Month (only) 60**] also help with cardiac status).
   - consider EGD or colonscopy considering hx of diverticulosis and FamHx
   GI malignancy, will consult if Hct continues to drop.
 PTT normal today.
   -          Re-start SC heparin.
   -          Monitor.
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS - Most likely pt seized in the
   setting of marked hyponatremia in addition to her profound alkalosis.
   An ABG was done when markedly tachypneic and pH was 7.7.  CT head was
   unremarkable.
   -no repeat seizure activity with corrected Na
   -Neuro following
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)Resolved. Unclear etiology;
   pt may have been hyponatremic in the setting of poor PO intake in
   addition to her HCTZ; however pts Na was not responsive to fluids and
   Urine Na high; making concern for SIADH. CT head without evidence of
   tumor.  Pt not on any psych meds/SSRIs. Sodium is now stabilized.
   - Hold HCTZ
   - Renal signed off
   - Fena 1%
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need additional imaging to look for other possible tumor or cause
   of SIADH in future
 Metabolic Acidosis-Pt initially presented with metabolic acidosis &
   AG of 18 on admission and post-code her lactate 11.4. Improved, now no
   gap.
   -If fluids needed, avoid more Cl so use LR or blood or NaBicarb

","The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and gastroparesis. She initially presented with nausea, vomiting, chest discomfort, and hyponatremia. She then became acutely tachypneic and experienced a seizure, resulting in cardiac arrest. 

The patient was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure, which is likely related to an ischemic event with pulmonary edema. The patient's upper airway inflammation from ET tube trauma precluded extubation initially. 

She has been receiving various medications including nitroglycerin, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), famotidine (Pepcid), and morphine sulfate. 

Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 164/74 mmHg to 196/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and sinus rhythm. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated troponin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still intubated due to failed extubation attempts. She will be given a few more days to heal before attempting extubation again with a Cook"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 73yo Russian speaking woman with h/o DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
   hypothyroidism and gastroparesis who initially presented with  N/V,
   chest discomfort, and hyponatremia who subsequently became acutely
   tachypneic and coded in the setting of a seizure and AMI.  Per
   patient's friend, had lost weight and having trouble for 6 months
   before with decreased appetite.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])- Initially unclear
   etiology; but likely related to an ischemic event with pulm edema.
   -Extubated yesterday and doing well on O2 by NC now.
   -          I/Os even without extra lasix.
   -          Was difficult intubation and extubation [**1-28**] laryngeal edema.
   Upon extubation required heliox, racemic epi, and morphine 1mg IV.
 Leukocytosis: Rose from 9 to 20 in last 3 days.
   -                Follow WBC.
   -                Pan-cultured.
   -                Will d/c central line today and culture tip.
   -                Will hold antibiotics unless hemodynamically unstable
   or febrile.
 Chest pain: Pt having recurrent episodes of CP sounding like angina
   although could be feeling her SVT and PVCs. Trops flat and no EKG
   changes with pain yesterday.
   -                Continue all current cardiac meds.
   -                When extubated will again assess whether patient would
   want a cath.
   -                On metoprolol 50 QID. [**Month (only) 60**] increase dose to better
   control SVT esp since resting HR in high-70s (goal beta blockade is HR
   60) and as BP running high (150s systolic).
   #.SVT: Likely secondary to scar as electrolytes WNL. Will inc
   metoprolol to 75 QID. Continue on tele.
Pneumonia: Clinical respiratory status is stable. CXR slightly more
   opacification in LLL. Sputum Culture pending.
   -                Levaquin/Vanc 10 day courses were finished [**2130-8-5**]
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE, HYPERTENSION, BENIGN Pt had
   initial presentation of chest discomfort.  STE in I, AVL and STD in II,
   III and AVF.  Stat echo shows large anterior wall hypokinesis c/w
   ischemic event.  Troponin peaked at 0.71 on [**7-26**]
   - cardiology following, deferred on cath [**1-28**] concerns of infection, pt
   has also refused cath in past so will need to discuss with her once
   extubated
   - ECHO as above-showed MR, may be more significant than originally
   thought, contributing to her CHF
   - Lipid panel resulted (HDL 64, LDL 64, Total cholesterol 143)
   - continue plavix, Atorvastatin 80 and asa 325mg daily
   - Now on Metoprolol 50 QID. [**Month (only) 60**] need more with high BP and HR 70s with
   SVT.
   -                Continue Lisinopril at 5 mg as Cr is normal, monitor
   BP
   -                Held HCTZ [**1-28**] hyponatremia but may need diuretic in
   the future but currently not wet on exam.
Hypotension:  Now resolved and actually hypertensive.
Anemia-  Hct has been hovering between 26 and 30 for duration of
   stay.  No source of bleed identified.  Stool was guiac positive then
   negative on [**7-30**]. Was concern for retroperitoneal hematoma as got fem
   line in code but now hct stable for several days so this is less
   likely.
 PTT normal today. Restarted SC heparin yesterday.
 SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS - Most likely pt seized in the
   setting of marked hyponatremia in addition to her profound alkalosis.
   An ABG was done when markedly tachypneic and pH was 7.7.  CT head was
   unremarkable and no repeat seizure activity with corrected Na
 HYPONATREMIA (LOW SODIUM, HYPOSMOLALITY)Resolved. Unclear etiology;
   pt may have been hyponatremic in the setting of poor PO intake in
   addition to her HCTZ; however pts Na was not responsive to fluids and
   Urine Na high; making concern for SIADH. CT head without evidence of
   tumor.  Pt not on any psych meds/SSRIs. Sodium is now stabilized.
   - Hold HCTZ
   - Renal signed off
   - Fena 1%
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need additional imaging to look for other possible tumor or cause
   of SIADH in future
 Metabolic Acidosis-Pt initially presented with metabolic acidosis &
   AG of 18 on admission and post-code her lactate 11.4. Improved, now no
   gap.

","The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and gastroparesis. She presented with nausea, vomiting, chest discomfort, and hyponatremia. She subsequently experienced acute tachypnea and coded in the setting of a seizure and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 

The patient had respiratory failure, which was initially unclear etiology but likely related to an ischemic event with pulmonary edema. She was intubated and extubated successfully without any complications. 

The patient also had leukocytosis, chest pain, pneumonia, acute systolic heart failure, hypertension, anemia, seizure with status epilepticus, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, and hypothyroidism. 

She is currently stable on oxygen via nasal cannula, with a SpO2 of 99%. Her vital signs are stable, and she is on various medications including antihypertensives, antiplatelets, statins, and others. 

The patient's recent lab results show normal electrolytes, elevated white blood cell count, and slightly elevated troponin levels. 

The patient's current plan includes continuing cardiac medications, discussing the need for a cardiac catheterization, monitoring and managing her blood pressure and heart rate, assessing for potential complications such as pneumonia or deep vein thrombosis, and ensuring proper glycemic control. 

She will be transitioned to the floor when stable and has peripheral access."
