","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) who presented with pulmonary embolism (PE) and subsequent acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient is currently receiving invasive ventilation with a ventilator set at a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%. The patient is also receiving continuous infusions of heparin and fentanyl. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Prolonged need for mechanical ventilation: The patient's respiratory failure may require prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving heparin, an anticoagulant, which increases the risk of bleeding. Given the patient's recent gastrointestinal bleeding and need for anticoagulation, there is a potential for further bleeding complications.
3. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcoholism, and the use of sedatives may lead to withdrawal symptoms. Close monitoring and appropriate management with benzodiazepines may be necessary.
4. Thromboembolic events: Despite anticoagulation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and previous multifocal pulmonary embolisms (PE). He presented with symptoms of PE and subsequent hypoxia, leading to invasive ventilation. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring close monitoring and multiple interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's presentation suggests acute PE, which can lead to further respiratory distress, hypoxia, and potentially fatal outcomes if not managed appropriately.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's recent GIB indicates a potential risk for rebleeding, especially with the need for anticoagulation therapy due to the PE. This could result in significant blood loss and require urgent endoscopy or surgical intervention.

3. Alcohol Withdrawal: Given the patient's alcohol abuse history, there is a risk of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can present with symptoms such as agitation, tremors, seizures, and delirium tremens. Proper management with benzodiazepines and other supportive measures is necessary to prevent complications.

4. Venous Thromboembolism: As the patient has a history of DVT and now presents with PE, there is an increased risk of further thromboembolic events. Anticoagulation therapy will be required to prevent new DVT formation and potential embolization.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and previous pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient presented with symptoms of PE and subsequent hypoxia, leading to intubation. An IVC filter was placed, and the patient is currently receiving heparin infusions. The patient also has a history of alcohol withdrawal and requires ongoing sedation and prophylaxis for withdrawal symptoms upon extubation.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count, along with slightly elevated blood glucose levels. The troponin-T level is within normal range. Other lab values including electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, and cardiac markers are within normal limits.

The ultrasound revealed acute occlusive thrombus in the right popliteal vein and nonocclusive thrombus in the left popliteal vein. The echocardiogram showed moderate dilation of the right ventricular cavity with moderate global free wall hypokinesis but no pericardial effusion. Left ventricular systolic function appears normal.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 74-129 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. Fluid balance shows an input of 4,116 mL and output of 285 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,831 mL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient already has a history of PE and currently presents with symptoms of PE. The presence of an acute occlusive thrombus in the right popliteal vein further increases the risk of developing additional pulmonary emboli.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of GIB, which may require endoscopy at some point to assess the risk for rebleeding while on anticoagulation therapy.

3. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient is at risk for alcohol withdrawal due to his history of alcoholism. Sedation and monitoring for withdrawal symptoms will be necessary upon extubation.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis: The patient has evidence of acute and chronic DVT. Anticoagulation therapy will be required to prevent further clot formation.

5. Right Ventricular Dysfunction: The echocardiogram reveals moderate dilation of the right ventricular cavity with moderate global free wall hypokinesis, indicating potential right ventricular dysfunction. Close monitoring of preload and afterload is necessary.

6. Infection: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation."

   Attending Note:
   I was physically present with the resident team and independently
   examined the patient on this date.  I agree with the findings as
   described above including history, exam, ROS, Fam Hx and assessment and
   plan.  I would add/emphasize the following:
   67 year old alcoholic with stage 1 NSCLC, question of Hct drip with
   GIB, hx DVTs, presents with multifocal pulmonary emboli. Unstable at [**Hospital1 **]
   [**Location (un) 250**].  Heparin IV started, BP in ED 118/80, 7.56/28/56. Was
   intubated in ED, sedated with versed. TTE showed RV dilatation but poor
   windows. CT angiogram was reviewed personally and with housestaff.
   Multifocal proximal bilateral pulmonary emboli are evident, though not
   involving main PA. Decision was made not to thrombolyse. Echo this AM
   showed RA clot, therefore PE in transit. Hemodynamics were significant
   for tachycardia. The patient remained intubated with hypoxic
   respiratory failure
 pO2 57 on 70% O2 and peep 8cm. Cardiology consult
   was much appreciated
 they discussed the echo and CT findings with the
   patient
s family and therapeutic options. It was decided with the
   family
s agreement that pt should be thrombolysed. tPA given at
   approximately 3pm. Currently less tachycardic, though BP slightly lower
   also. Fibrinogen decreased from 433 to 81. Heparin will be restarted
   depending on PTT and fibrinogen. Repeat TTE in AM.  Watch for alcohol
   withdrawal, IV folate/thiamine/MVI. Family is updated. Patient is full
   code.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time 40 minutes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), history of deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), and presents with multifocal pulmonary emboli (PEs). The patient was unstable at [**Hospital1 **] and required heparin and intubation in the emergency department. The patient's blood pressure is unstable, requiring fluid resuscitation. The patient has been sedated with versed due to alcohol abuse and intubation.

The patient's condition has been monitored closely, with frequent vital signs assessments and laboratory tests. The patient's white blood cell count has increased from 4.4 to 8.2 thousand/mm3, hematocrit (Hct) has decreased from 32.2% to 31.2%, platelet count has increased from 147 thousand/mm3 to 171 thousand/mm3, and troponin-T levels have remained within normal range at 0.05 ng/mL.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a slightly low pH of 7.32, with respiratory compensation indicated by elevated PaCO2 levels of 57 mmHg. Oxygenation is maintained with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 70%, resulting in a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 81.

The patient's physical examination reveals pinpoint pupils, no jugular venous distention (JVD), chest tube"

The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and multifocal pulmonary embolisms (PE). The patient presented with bilateral PE and was admitted to the ICU for stabilization. They were intubated due to respiratory distress and required sedation with Versed. The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, requiring fluid resuscitation and consideration of vasopressor support with Levophed.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 121 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/77 mmHg to 80/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be intubated and sedated, with no jugular venous distention (JVD), plethora, or facial swelling. The patient's abdomen is soft, with normal bowel sounds, no ascites, or organomegaly. There is no calf edema or swelling, palmar erythema, or evidence of chronic liver disease. Laboratory"

 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   67 year old alcoholic with recent GIB, hx DVT's with multifocal PE's.
   .
   # PE's:  BP 116/80. BP slightly lower in ED - possible [**Month (only) **] in BP after
   sedation- but not unstable. RV strain on echo but no collapse or HD
   compromise. Sinsus tachy on EKG w/o RV strain. Will need to keep
   pre-load up. Patient was intubated for hypoxia. Seen by cardiothoracic
   surgery in the ED who noted that pt
s emboli were mostly distal and
   that the patient was HD stable; the advised against embolectomy.  Given
   patient
s hemodynamic stability, there is no indication for TPA at this
   time. In addition, as the patient has had recent GIB, TPA would be
   contraindicated. Retrievable IVC filter placed overnight.
   - heparin gtt, start Coumadin tonight
   - check CXR now, repeat ECG now
   - official TTE today to eval for RV strain
   - interventional cardiology consult for local tPA given considerable
   size of clot on CTA
   - monitor BP closely, if HoTN would use Levophed or Dopamine
   - needs intubation, needs NGT

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic male with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and multifocal pulmonary embolism (PE). He presented with hypoxia and was intubated. The patient underwent an ultrasound that showed a right popliteal DVT. An IVC filter was placed overnight. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate in the 110s, blood pressure ranging from 114/77 to 129/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%. His physical examination reveals no jugular venous distention, no edema, and normal heart sounds. The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 8.2 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, normal platelet count of 171 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 25 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), presenting with multifocal pulmonary embolisms (PEs). The patient was unstable at another hospital and required heparin and intubation in the emergency department. They were sedated with versed for sedation. The patient has been on invasive ventilation since May 16th, 04:25 PM. An ultrasound was performed on May 16th, 05:21 PM. The patient has multiple medical conditions including hypotension, alcohol withdrawal, recent GIB, renal insufficiency, and potential complications such as DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, elevated heart rate, and low blood pressure. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates significant fluid intake and output imbalances. The patient's blood work reveals elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient has been prescribed various medications including heparin, fentanyl, midazolam (versed), pantoprazole (Protonix), thiamine, and multivitamins. The patient requires further evaluation and treatment for PE, alcohol withdrawal, recent GIB, and renal insufficiency. The patient's disposition is currently in"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of EtOH abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He was admitted to the ICU with multifocal pulmonary embolisms (PEs). The patient developed worsening tachycardia and hypoxia, leading to the initiation of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for lysis, which improved his heart rate and oxygen saturation.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypotension, acute pulmonary embolism, anemia, alcohol withdrawal, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal insufficiency. The hypotension occurred post-lysis with TPA but responded to intravenous fluids (IVF). Cardiology suggests that it may be due to micro-emboli, which should improve within 24 hours.

The anemia is likely dilutional due to the administration of 4 liters of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), but acute bleeding cannot be ruled out completely. Alcohol withdrawal is a concern given the patient's significant EtOH history. The recent GIB is unclear in history, and further evaluation may be required. Renal insufficiency has improved.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. His blood pressure (BP) is being closely monitored, and intravenous fluids are being administered to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. Heparin is being continued, and warfarin (Coumadin) has been started. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has also been placed.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), slightly elevated platelet count (Plt), and normal creatinine (Cr). Troponin-T levels are within normal range, as well as liver enzymes and electrolytes.

Overall, the patient is receiving appropriate care for his conditions, including prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The plan is to continue monitoring his vital signs, repeating a transthoracic echo (TTE), and weaning off the ventilator while maintaining sedation."

   RADIOLOGY:
   TTE - The left atrium is normal in size. No definite mass or thrombus
   is seen in the right atrium (this cannot be fully excluded on the basis
   of this study). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
   Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
   cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
   normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
   (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with
   severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal
   motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.
   The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
   no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion.
   There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  IMPRESSION:
   Dilated, hypokinetic RV c/w RV strain. No change from prior study dated
   [**2162-5-16**].

","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presents with multifocal pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently in the ICU. The patient has undergone thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for the treatment of PE, which resulted in improvement of heart rate and oxygen saturation but led to transient hypotension. He has also received 4 liters of normal saline intravenous fluid boluses to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.

The patient is intubated and sedated, with ongoing mechanical ventilation. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 87/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's echocardiogram shows a markedly dilated right ventricle with severe global free wall hypokinesis, consistent with right ventricular strain. There are no signs of tamponade.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of EtOH abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). He presents with multifocal pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and is currently admitted to the ICU.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has had multiple PEs, which are serious and potentially life-threatening conditions caused by blood clots that travel to the lungs. He received tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for lysis, which improved his heart rate and oxygen saturation.

2. Hypotension: The patient developed hypotension post-lysis with TPA. This may be due to micro-emboli, which are small blood clots that can cause low blood pressure. His blood pressure responded to intravenous fluid administration, and he is being closely monitored.

3. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia, possibly due to dilutional effects from receiving 4 liters of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). However, there is also a possibility of acute bleeding, especially considering his history of GIB. Further investigations are needed to determine the exact cause of anemia.

4. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has a significant history of EtOH abuse and is at risk for alcohol withdrawal. He is currently sedated with midazolam (Versed) and receiving"

   Attending Note:
   I was physically present with the resident team and independently
   examined the patient on this date.  I agree with the findings as
   described above including history, exam, ROS, Fam Hx and assessment and
   plan.  I would add/emphasize the following:
   67 year old alcoholic with stage 1 NSCLC, question of Hct drip with
   GIB, hx DVTs, presents with multifocal pulmonary emboli. Unstable at [**Hospital1 **]
   [**Location (un) 250**].  Heparin IV started, BP in ED 118/80, 7.56/28/56. Was
   intubated in ED, sedated with versed. TTE showed RV dilatation but poor
   windows. CT angiogram was reviewed personally and with housestaff.
   Multifocal proximal bilateral pulmonary emboli are evident, though not
   involving main PA. Decision was made not to thrombolyse. Echo this AM
   showed RA clot, therefore PE in transit. Hemodynamics were significant
   for tachycardia. The patient remained intubated with hypoxic
   respiratory failure
 pO2 57 on 70% O2 and peep 8cm. Cardiology consult
   was much appreciated
 they discussed the echo and CT findings with the
   patient
s family and therapeutic options. It was decided with the
   family
s agreement that pt should be thrombolysed.
   Overnight, spiked to 101.6, cultured. GPC in clusters from
 bottles
   unclear from where this was drawn, started on IV Vancomycin. Also now
   positive for c diff. Started on Flagyl PO.  6 L positive. Oxygenation
   improved, now PSV 10/5, 40%, sats 95%. Echo today
 report states
   right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
   contractility. The interatrial septum is markedly thickened around the
   fossa ovale secondary to lipomatous hypertrophy.
   No active bleeding except for some oral blood from suctioning. MAP 66,
   HR 106. Only signs of possible alcohol withdrawal is shaking when being
   turned. Sedation being weaned. Fibrinogen decreased from 433 to 75.
   Heparin will be restarted depending on PTT and fibrinogen. Watch for
   alcohol withdrawal, IV folate/thiamine/MVI. F/u on blood cultures.
   Patient is full code.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time 36 minutes.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), and multifocal pulmonary emboli (PEs). The patient presented with symptoms of hypoxic respiratory failure and was intubated in the emergency department. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) showed right ventricular (RV) dilatation, and a CT angiogram confirmed the presence of multifocal proximal bilateral PEs. The decision was made not to thrombolyse the patient.

During the overnight period, the patient developed a fever and tested positive for C. difficile. The patient was started on intravenous vancomycin and oral Flagyl. Oxygenation improved, and the patient's sedation was weaned. An echo today reported RV cavity dilatation with depressed free wall contractility and marked thickening of the interatrial septum secondary to lipomatous hypertrophy.

The patient's vital signs included a temperature of 101.6°F, blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg, heart rate of 120 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's blood cultures were obtained, and they were started on IV folate/thiamine/MVI. The patient's code status remains as full"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and multifocal pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient was admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, alcohol withdrawal, recent GIB, renal insufficiency, and potential medical complications such as DVT, stress ulcer prophylaxis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the need for an endoscopy to assess the risk of rebleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and consideration of vasopressor therapy, such as levophed, may be necessary.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is at risk for alcohol withdrawal due to their history of alcoholism. Sedation with midazolam (versed) is currently being provided, and the need for CIWA assessment and benzodiazepine treatment upon extubation should be considered.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function is impaired, which can affect fluid and electrolyte balance, acid-base status, and drug clearance. Regular monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly are important.
4. Recent GIB: The patient has a recent history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which increases the risk of rebleeding. An"

","The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and now presents with multifocal pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient recently stopped taking Coumadin due to a significant drop in hematocrit (Hct), which could be related to the GIB. The patient underwent thrombolysis for a thrombus in transit in the right atrium (RA) and showed improvement in oxygenation and tachycardia. The patient's Hct remains stable, and they received 4 liters of normal saline (NS). The patient also had a spike in temperature to 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

The patient has allergies to no known medications. The last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient is currently receiving infusions of heparin sodium, midazolam (Versed), and fentanyl. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), chlorhexidine, colace, thiamine 100mg IV for three days, fludrocortisone once daily, folic acid, MVI (Multivitamins), and protonix every twelve hours.

The patient's medical and family history remain unchanged from admission except as noted below. Review of systems is also unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.7 degrees Celsius (101.6 degrees Fahrenheit), current temperature of 37.5"

   Imaging: CXR [**5-18**]: In comparison with the study of [**5-17**], there is some
   increasing opacification at the right base suggesting atelectasis and
   possible pleural fluid. The right lung and upper half of the left lung
   remain clear.  Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube remain in
   position.
   CXR [**5-19**]:  Progressive left lower lobe consolidation is probably
   atelectasis, accompanied by small left pleural effusion. ET tube is in
   standard position.
   Echo [**5-18**]: The left ventricular cavity is small. Left ventricular
   systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular
   cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
   interatrial septum is markedly thickened around the fossa ovale
   secondary to lipomatous hypertrophy.Compared with the findings of the
   prior study (images reviewed) of [**2162-5-17**], the interatrial septum and
   right atrium are better visualized, and the mass in the right atrium is
   now seen clearly to be secondary to lipomatous hypertrophy of the
   interatrial septum.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of ethanol abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and tachycardia, which were initially thought to be due to septic shock. However, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a large right atrial mass, identified as lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum. The patient also had elevated troponin levels and evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE), for which he received tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) lysis.

The patient developed hypotension post-lysis, which responded to intravenous fluids. He continues to be on heparin for anticoagulation and has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place. His right ventricular function remains depressed, but there is no evidence of bleeding. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and his ventilator settings are being weaned as tolerated.

The patient has a fever and a concerning infiltrate on chest X-ray, raising concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is being treated for Clostridium difficile infection and is also receiving prophylaxis for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis. His renal function has improved, and he is expected to be extubated soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. C. difficile infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis. This infection may lead to complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and sepsis.

2. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly. It is important to monitor for signs of ongoing bleeding, such as hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia.

3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk for developing pulmonary embolism, especially if they have been immobile for an extended period. Symptoms may include sudden onset of shortness of breath, chest pain, and hypoxia.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension. This can compromise organ perfusion and increase the risk of organ damage or failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient presented with multifocal pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and was initially considered not a surgical candidate. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) and cardiology consult were performed, leading to the administration of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for lysis on 5/17. The patient's heart rate and oxygen saturation improved with lysis, but repeat TTE showed continued depressed right ventricular function. The right ventricular abnormality was recharacterized as lipoma rather than clot, with no evidence of bleeding. The patient continues to receive heparin gtt, currently therapeutic, and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed. The patient is also being weaned off the ventilator, with a trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) today.

Other medical conditions and concerns include:
- Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which was confirmed by stool culture and started on oral Flagyl.
- Hypotension, which developed post-lysis with TPA but responded to intravenous fluids (IVF).
- Anemia, likely dilutional due to receiving 4 liters of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), but in the setting of lysis and vague"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (metronidazole and vancomycin), pain management with fentanyl, sedation with midazolam, and heparin sodium for anticoagulation. The patient is also receiving pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

The patient's vital signs show an elevated heart rate (116 bpm) and slightly elevated body temperature (37.9°C). His blood pressure is within normal limits (108/61 mmHg), but his respiratory rate is on the higher end of the normal range (26 breaths per minute). Oxygen saturation is at 94%, indicating some level of respiratory compromise. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted gastrointestinal bleeding. 

Flow sheet data indicates that the patient has received a significant amount of fluid intake, with a total input of 3,087 mL over the past 24 hours. However, there is a notable output of 975 mL in terms of blood products and 975 mL of urine output. The patient's NG and stool outputs are not recorded. 

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and recent pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's chief complaint is bilateral PE. The patient recently stopped taking Coumadin for GIB due to a significant drop in hematocrit (Hct). The patient underwent lysis on 05-17.

The patient has been experiencing moderate tan secretions, C. diff positive, and gram-positive cocci in the blood culture, although it is unclear if this was drawn from the peripheral IV. The patient's fibrinogen levels have improved.

The patient is intubated and sedated, with mild tremor during sedation hold. The patient has pinpoint pupils, no jugular venous distention (JVD), clear right lung, bronchial breath sounds at the left base, tachycardia, no murmurs, soft abdomen with normal NT/ND, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurological examination reveals that the patient is sedated and has equal pupils with regular eye movements.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL, leukocyte count of 172 K/uL, platelet count of 124 mg/dL, sodium level of 22 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L, chloride level of 8 mg/dL, bicarbonate level of 32.3%, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 8 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, glucose level of 127 mg/dL, and liver enzymes within normal range.

Microbiological tests reveal 2+ sparse oral flora in the sputum, gram-positive cocci in the blood culture, and negative urine culture. The patient has been positive for C. diff since 05-17.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with recent GIB, history of DVT, and multifocal PE. The patient received tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) yesterday. Repeat trans-thoracic echo (TTE) is planned to evaluate for resolution of clot. The patient will continue heparin infusion with a goal PTT of 80-100, closely monitor blood pressure, and consider using levophed if hypotensive. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bloodstream infection: The patient has gram-positive cocci in the blood culture, which could indicate a potential bloodstream infection. Further evaluation is needed, including repeating blood cultures and sputum analysis.
2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has been positive for C. diff since 05-17. It is important to continue appropriate treatment for C. diff for at least two weeks or three if there is concurrent staph bacteremia.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of multifocal PE and received TPA yesterday. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygen saturation is necessary.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a recent history of GIB. The patient may require endoscopy to better elucidate the risk for rebleeding, especially considering the need for anticoagulation.
5. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is at risk for alcohol withdrawal due to chronic alcohol use. Sedation will be held and restarted at 20% when the patient starts to wake up or in response to vital sign changes. The patient will need CIWA and SW on extubation.
6. Hypotension: The patient is at risk for hypotension, and close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary. The patient will continue florinef for now.
7. Renal insufficiency: The patient has shown improvement in renal function. Continued monitoring is needed.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Appropriate antibiotic coverage will be added if there is evidence of VAP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and multifocal pulmonary embolisms (PE). They were admitted to the ICU for treatment of PE and have been on heparin therapy. The patient has shown improvement in fibrinogen levels and resolution of RV dysfunction on trans-thoracic echo. However, they continue to have borderline blood pressure, fever, and positive C. diff. The patient is intubated and sedated, with pinpoint pupils and no jugular venous distention. They have bilateral pleural effusions and evidence of bilateral PE on imaging. The patient's white blood cell count has fluctuated, with recent readings ranging from 8.2 to 8.4 K/uL. Other lab results show elevated creatinine, troponin T, and lactic acid levels, along with low albumin and potassium. The patient's medical history includes alcoholism, recent GIB, and multiple DVTs. The patient is currently receiving TPA for PE, heparin gtt, and an IVC filter. They are also being treated for fever, C. diff infection, respiratory support, hypotension, alcohol withdrawal, and renal insufficiency. The patient requires endoscopy for recent GIB, weaning of sedation, and close monitoring of blood pressure. The patient's nutritional support includes Fibersource HN at 50 mL/hour. Prophylaxis measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer protection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and their current disposition is the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Rebleeding: The patient has a history of recent GIB, and they will need anticoagulation in the future. This increases the risk of rebleeding.
2. Infection: The patient has an ongoing C. diff infection and is at risk for developing other infections due to their ICU stay and immunocompromised state.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is borderline, and there is a concern for hypotension. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain stable blood pressure.
4. Respiratory issues: The patient is intubated and receiving respiratory support. Weaning off sedation and ensuring proper ventilation will be crucial for their recovery.
5. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is at risk for alcohol withdrawal due to their history of alcoholism. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent complications such as seizures or delirium tremens.
6. Renal insufficiency: The patient has evidence"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of EtOH abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). He presented with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pulmonary embolism (PE), and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. He has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, multiple GNRs in sputum cultures, and CoNS in blood cultures. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole. The patient also has a history of alcohol withdrawal and anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially progress to septic shock if not managed appropriately.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of DVTs and now presents with multiple PEs. This indicates a high risk for further thromboembolic events, which could lead to respiratory distress or even death.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or other underlying causes. It is important to monitor and manage blood pressure closely to prevent further complications.
4. C. difficile infection: The presence of C. difficile infection increases the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea or col"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and multifocal pulmonary embolisms (PE). The patient has been treated with thrombolysis and is currently on heparin therapy to maintain a goal PTT of 80-100 seconds. The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored, and consideration may be given to using levophed if hypotension persists.

The patient has developed fevers, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) has been identified in their stool culture. Treatment for C. diff will consist of a two-week course of oral vancomycin. The patient is also being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). A planned extubation will involve CIWA and SW protocols to manage alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

The patient's acute respiratory failure requires daily sedation weaning and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), with FiO2 titration based on oxygen saturation levels. When able, the patient will be transitioned to pressure support ventilation (PSV). Hypotension management includes continuing fludrocortisone and considering transient pressors if necessary.

The patient's recent GIB necessitates an endoscopic evaluation to assess the risk for rebleeding, especially considering the need for anticoagulation. Proton pump"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and recent pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient underwent thrombolysis on 5/17. 

The patient is currently experiencing fevers and has positive blood cultures for gram-positive cocci, indicating a potential bloodstream infection. The patient also has Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which has been present since 5/18. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal range, but there are signs of leukocytosis with an increase in neutrophils.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system inquiry (RSBI) is 28, indicating a moderate risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's cardiovascular status shows tachycardia with a heart rate between 103-129 beats per minute (bpm) and blood pressure ranging from 119/64 to 154/82 mmHg. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 27 mmHg, indicating high CVP. The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema.

   Formal TTE and Cardiology consult --> TPA for lysis on [**5-17**] with
   improvement of HR and SaO2. Repeat TTE yesterday shows continued
   depressed RV function; however, right ventricular abnl is now better
   characterized as limpoma rather than clot. No evidence of bleeding.
   Also s/p IVC filter placement.
   - appreciate cardiology involvement, s/p lysis by TPA
   - continue heparin gtt, currently therapeutic, goal 80-100
   - cont to wean vent depending on sedation and secretions
   # Edema - Pt w/ increased edema as he has gotten several IVF boluses
   for his Hypotension. Lasix gtt w/ good effect on UOP, although pt still
   getting quite a bit of fluid in.
   - check for obligate Ins, consider changing some meds to PO rather than
   IV
   - cont Lasix gtt at current rate, increasing may be limited by
   hypotension
   # Hypotension - Developed post-lysis w/ TPA. Responsive to IVF.
   Initially thought to be [**2-15**] micro-emboli and expected to improve, but

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He was admitted to the ICU for suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) and sepsis. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole, due to positive cultures for Gram-negative rods (GNRs) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). He also received tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for lysis of a PE and had an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placed. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, respiratory failure, altered mental status, electrolyte and fluid disorders, and other medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an imbalance in electrolytes, including low potassium and magnesium levels. Close monitoring and appropriate replacement are necessary to avoid cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The need to wean off the ventilator should be carefully evaluated, considering the patient's underlying infection and the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to sepsis, medication effects, or alcohol withdrawal"

   - f/u all culture data
   - IVF boluses PRN hypotension, consider Levophed for pressor support
   # PEs - On admission pt w/ borderline BPs and considered not a surgical
   candidate. Progressively developed worsening tachycardia and hypoxia.
   Formal TTE and Cardiology consult --> TPA for lysis on [**5-17**] with
   improvement of HR and SaO2. Repeat TTE yesterday shows continued
   depressed RV function; however, right ventricular abnl is now better
   characterized as limpoma rather than clot. No evidence of bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). He presented with respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiple pulmonary embolisms (PEs). The patient is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation, receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for various infections including Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an electrolyte imbalance with low sodium levels and fluid overload as indicated by the positive fluid balance.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure, and there is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, likely due to a combination of factors such as sedation, alcohol withdrawal, and sepsis.
4. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, evidenced by fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and positive blood cultures growing CoNS and multiple GNRs.
5. C. difficile Infection: The patient has a confirmed C. difficile infection, which may contribute to his gastrointestinal symptoms and overall illness severity.
6. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has had multiple PEs, one of which was treated with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) lysis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), and recent thrombolysis. The patient presents with multifocal pulmonary emboli (PEs) and has been experiencing low-grade fever, requiring sedation and ventilation support. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/51 mmHg to 147/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with pinpoint pupils and elevated jugular venous distention. The patient's chest X-ray shows right lower lobe infiltrate. Laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Blood cultures show growth of gram-negative rods, and sputum cultures reveal gram-negative rods and sparse oral flora.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Submassive Pulmonary Emboli:
- Administered tissue plasminogen activator (TPA)
- Continue heparin drip with goal PTT of 80-100 seconds
- Monitor blood pressure closely and consider using levophed if hypotensive
- Insert inferior vena cava (IVC) filter

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU on [date] for evaluation and treatment of sepsis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, deep venous thrombosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and C. difficile infection. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient was diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening infection that causes systemic inflammation. The infection may have originated from a respiratory source, as indicated by the presence of GNR bacteria in the sputum culture. It is important to continue aggressive management of the sepsis, including appropriate antibiotic therapy, fluid resuscitation, and supportive care.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The ABG results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 320, indicating significant hypoxemia. This suggests the need for further optimization of the ventilator settings to improve oxygenation and prevent further lung injury. Additionally, daily weaning trials should be considered to assess the patient's readiness to extubate.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has experienced altered mental status, which can be attributed to several factors, including sepsis, multiorgan dysfunction, and potential brain injury. Close monitoring of neurologic status and regular reassessment of cognitive function are crucial for identifying any changes or improvements. Sedation with propofol may have been used to facilitate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, and deep vein thrombosis. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to multiple medical complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, altered mental status, pulmonary embolism, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection and is also experiencing hypotension, edema, and anemia. He has a significant ethanol history and requires close monitoring and management for alcohol withdrawal. The patient's recent gastrointestinal bleeding is unclear in significance and requires further evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension indicate an ongoing infection, which needs to be aggressively treated with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and we need to closely monitor his respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings accordingly.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of multiple PEs, and anticoagulation therapy needs to be continued to prevent further clot formation.
4. Electrolyte/Fluid Disorder: The patient's fluid balance is abnormal due to IVF boluses and Lasix gtt. Close monitoring of electrolytes and fluid status is necessary to avoid complications related to fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.

   # Sepsis
 Resolving, now normotensive. Pt spiking fevers, tachycardic,
   and hypotensive several days ago but without elevation in WBC. Has
   bottles blood Cx growing CoNS, sputum growing multiple GNRs, and stool
   C.diff positive. Did have = infiltrate on CXR concerning for VAP.
   Currently on Zosyn, and Vanc PO, Flagyl. 3 sputum cx all growing GNRs.
   Still spiking fevers
   - cont Zosyn (day 4), for GNR
   - con tFlagyl (day 5), PO Vanc (day 3) for C.diff
   - f/u all culture data, obtain specation of GNR
   - draw cultures through a-line and CVL lines
   - keep even, no diuresis
   # PEs - On admission pt w/ borderline BPs and considered not a surgical
   candidate. Progressively developed worsening tachycardia and hypoxia.
   Formal TTE and Cardiology consult --> TPA for lysis on [**5-17**] with
   improvement of HR and SaO2. Repeat TTE yesterday shows continued
   depressed RV function; however, right ventricular abnl is now better
   characterized as limpoma rather than clot. No evidence of bleeding.
   Also s/p IVC filter placement.
   - appreciate cardiology involvement, s/p lysis by TPA
   - continue heparin gtt, currently therapeutic, goal 80-100
   - cont to wean vent depending on sedation and secretions
   .
   # VAP: + sputum, fevers and new infiltrate. Had been on Vanc but only
   growing GNR
s in sputum but now
   - cont Zosyn
   - obtain repeat sputum cx
   # Edema - Pt w/ increased edema as he has gotten several IVF boluses
   for his Hypotension. Lasix gtt w/ good effect on UOP, although pt still
   getting quite a bit of fluid in.
   - check for obligate Ins, consider changing some meds to PO rather than
   IV
   -  contlasix gt to keep keep even
   # Hypotension - Developed post-lysis w/ TPA. Responsive to IVF.
   Initially thought to be [**2-15**] micro-emboli and expected to improve, but
   now more likely related to underlying infection and fevers. Transiently
   required pressors, but now off.
   - cont to monitor BP closely
   - keep I/O even
   - continue home Florinef
   - keep I/O even today
   # Anemia - Likely dilutional considering pt received 4L PRBCs, but in
   setting of lysis and vague h/o GIB. HCT down 32->29. No melena.
   - Guaiac stools
   - recheck HCt
   # Alcohol withdrawal - Significant EtOH history.
   - cont propofol for sedation
   - daily thiamine / MVI / folate
   - will need CIWA and SW on extubation
   # Unresponive: likely related to Versed in the setting of EtOh abuse;
   however did get lyisi is at risk for intracranial hemorrhage
   - f/u head CT
   # Recent GIB - Unclear history, ? significant.
   - PPI IV BID
   -  GI consulted, no endoscopy now,but will scope prior to discharge

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of EtOH abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple deep vein thrombosis (DVT) episodes. He presents with multifocal pulmonary embolisms (PEs), sepsis, C. difficile infection, and hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for lysis of a massive PE using tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). He continues to experience fever spikes, tachycardia, hypoxia, and hypotension. His blood cultures are growing coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS), sputum cultures are growing multiple Gram-negative rods (GNRs), and stool culture is positive for C. difficile. The patient has been placed on Zosyn, vancomycin (Vanc) orally, and Flagyl for his infections. A sputum culture is pending speciation of the GNRs. The patient's right ventricular function remains depressed, but there is no evidence of bleeding. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed. The patient's edema has increased due to IV fluid boluses for hypotension, and he is receiving Lasix gtt to manage his fluid balance. He also has anemia, likely dilutional from receiving 4 liters of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's alcohol withdrawal symptoms are being managed with"

   # Sepsis
 Pt spiking fevers, tachycardic, and hypotensive yesterday
   but without elevation in WBC. Has
 bottles blood Cx growing CoNS,
   sputum growing multiple GNRs, and stool C.diff positive. Did have
   concerning infiltrate on CXR concerning for VAP. Currently on Zosyn,
   and Vanc PO, Flagyl. Diff today with 81% PMNs. Now w/ 3 sputum cx all
   growing GNRs. Still spiking fevers
   - cont Zosyn (day 4), for GNR
   - con tFlagyl (day 5), PO Vanc (day 3) for C.diff
   - f/u all culture data, obtain specation of GNR
   - draw cultures through lines
   - IVF boluses PRN hypotension, consider Levophed for pressor support
   - keep even, no diuresis
   # PEs - On admission pt w/ borderline BPs and considered not a surgical
   candidate. Progressively developed worsening tachycardia and hypoxia.
   Formal TTE and Cardiology consult --> TPA for lysis on [**5-17**] with
   improvement of HR and SaO2. Repeat TTE yesterday shows continued
   depressed RV function; however, right ventricular abnl is now better
   characterized as limpoma rather than clot. No evidence of bleeding.
   Also s/p IVC filter placement.
   - appreciate cardiology involvement, s/p lysis by TPA
   - continue heparin gtt, currently therapeutic, goal 80-100
   - cont to wean vent depending on sedation and secretions
   # Edema - Pt w/ increased edema as he has gotten several IVF boluses
   for his Hypotension. Lasix gtt w/ good effect on UOP, although pt still
   getting quite a bit of fluid in.
   - check for obligate Ins, consider changing some meds to PO rather than
   IV
   - dc lasix gtt, keep even
   # Hypotension - Developed post-lysis w/ TPA. Responsive to IVF.
   Initially thought to be [**2-15**] micro-emboli and expected to improve, but
   now more likely related to underlying infection and fevers. Transiently
   required pressors, but now off.
   - cont to monitor BP closely
   - IVF boluses to keep MAP >60
   - continue home Florinef
   - keep I/O even today
   # Anemia - Likely dilutional considering pt received 4L PRBCs, but in
   setting of lysis and vague h/o GIB. HCT down 32->29. No melena.
   - Guaiac stools
   - recheck HCt
   # Alcohol withdrawal - Significant EtOH history.
   - cont propofol for sedation
   - daily thiamine / MVI / folate
   - will need CIWA and SW on extubation
   # Unresponive: likely related to Versed in the setting of EtOh abuse;
   however did get lyisi is at risk for intracranial hemorrhage
   - f/u head CT
   # Recent GIB - Unclear history, ? significant.
   - PPI IV BID
   -  GI consulted, no endoscopy now,but will scope prior to discharge

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of EtOH abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple previous deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). He is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pulmonary embolism (PE), and C. difficile infection. The patient has been experiencing fevers, tachycardia, and hypotension, with blood cultures growing CoNS, sputum cultures growing multiple GNRs, and stool culture positive for C. diff. He has also had a recent PE treated with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVTs and is currently in the ICU with a PE. There is a risk of developing new DVTs due to immobility and central venous catheters.
2. Electrolyte & fluid disorder: The patient has received multiple IV fluid boluses, which may lead to fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration in lung function.
4. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing fevers and positive cultures for multiple organisms, indicating an ongoing infection and risk of sepsis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to multiple complications.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Bilateral PE: The patient presents with multifocal pulmonary embolisms.
2. GIB: The patient has a recent history of gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. DVT: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis.
4. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient shows signs of infection.
5. C. difficile infection (C. diff colitis): The patient has an infection caused by Clostridium difficile.
6. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient exhibits changes in mental function.
7. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient has respiratory failure.
8. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has imbalances in electrolytes and fluids.
9. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient displays low blood pressure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Prolonged or recurrent DVT/PE: The patient's history of DVT and PE increases the risk of future clot formation.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's recent GIB may lead to further bleeding episodes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. They were admitted to the ICU after experiencing a massive pulmonary embolism and received thrombolytic therapy. The patient has multiple medical complications including ventilator dependence, central venous thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, confusion, alcohol withdrawal, Clostridium difficile infection, and renal insufficiency. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, sedation, and receiving treatment for various infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Line-related infection - The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line and central venous lines, which can potentially lead to line-related infections.
3. Bleeding - Due to the patient's recent gastrointestinal bleeding and anticoagulation therapy, there is a risk of bleeding complications.
4. Alcohol withdrawal - The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently sedated, which may lead to alcohol withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation of sedatives.
5. Clostridium difficile infection - The patient has a current infection with C. difficile, which can worsen if not properly managed.
6. Renal insufficiency - The patient has a history of renal insufficiency, which may be exacerbated by fluid overload or medications.

The patient has been treated with thrombolytic therapy (TPA) and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are as follows:
1. Submassive Pulmonary Emboli - The patient has multifocal PEs and was given TPA. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's blood pressure and consider using levophed if hypotensive.
2. Altered Mental Status - The patient is suspected to have secondary to high dose benzodiazepine use. If there is no improvement, a CT brain should be checked for the possibility of cerebral bleed.
3. Fevers/VAP/C. Diff - The patient has an active infection of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and will require a 2-week treatment. PO vancomycin will be added given the patient's clinical status, and the current treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with Vanc/Zosyn will continue.

   # AMS
   Complicated by sedation, underlying EtOH, possibility of ICH given
   thrombolysis.
   Hold all sedatives.
   # Vent. Dependence- obstacle to extubation is MS at this point.
   # Submassive Pulmonary Emboli
   - TPA given
   - Continue heparin gtt goal 80-100 PTT
   - monitor BP closely will consider levophed if hypotensive
   - s/p  IVC filter
   # MS-Not waking up off sedation suspect secondary to high dose Benzo
   #CV
   Hemodynamically stable and u/o 50-100cc/hr so effective circulation.
   TBB goal even.
   #Fevers/VAP/C.Diff
   -+C.Diff  2 week treatment will add PO vanc given his clinical status
   - Will continue tx for VAP with Vanc/Zosyn

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), presenting with multifocal pulmonary embolism (PE).
- The patient underwent thrombolysis on [**5-17**] and had an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement.
- The patient is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications, including ventilator dependence, acute respiratory failure, alcohol withdrawal, recent GIB, renal insufficiency, and fever with possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.
- The patient's mental status remains poor, and there is concern for possible intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) given the recent thrombolysis.
- The patient is receiving various treatments and medications, including sedatives, antibiotics, anticoagulants, and diuretics.
- The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver enzymes, and cardiac markers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH): Given the patient's recent thrombolysis, there is a concern for possible ICH, which can be a serious complication.
2. Ventilator dependence: The patient is currently dependent on the ventilator, which may pose obstacles to extubation.

 Resolving, now normotensive. Pt spiking fevers, tachycardic,
   and hypotensive several days ago but without elevation in WBC. Has
   bottles blood Cx growing CoNS, sputum growing multiple GNRs, and stool
   C.diff positive. Did have = infiltrate on CXR concerning for VAP.
   Currently on Zosyn, and Vanc PO, Flagyl. 3 sputum cx all growing GNRs.
   Still spiking fevers
   - cont Zosyn (day 5), for GNR
   - cont Vanc IV (d2) for GPCs
   - cont Flagyl (day 6), PO Vanc (day 4) for C.diff
   - f/u all culture data, obtain specation of GNR/GPCs
   - draw cultures through a-line and CVL lines
   - gentle diuresis to keep even
   # Unresponsive: likely related to Versed in the setting of EtOh abuse;
   however did get lyisi is at risk for intracranial hemorrhage. Head CT
   neg for bleed and he is moving all 4 extremities, so suspect this is
   sedation related. This morning, he is more responsive, following
   commands, but still not opening eyes
   - continue to hold sedation as possible, try PRN fent boluses when
   agitated to see if there is a pain component
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure: Currently unable to extubate due to mental

   - trial extubation this morning as he is following commands, has a good
   cough and pros outweight the cons of extubation
   # VAP: + sputum, fevers and new infiltrate. Sputum growing GNR/GPCs
   - cont Zosyn/Vanc for 8 day course unless grows pseudomonas
   - obtain repeat sputum cx
   # PEs - On admission pt w/ borderline BPs and considered not a surgical
   candidate. Progressively developed worsening tachycardia and hypoxia.
   Formal TTE and Cardiology consult --> TPA for lysis on [**5-17**] with
   improvement of HR and SaO2. Repeat TTE yesterday shows continued
   depressed RV function; however, right ventricular abnl is now better
   characterized as limpoma rather than clot. No evidence of bleeding.
   Also s/p IVC filter placement.
   - appreciate cardiology involvement, s/p lysis by TPA
   - has been on heparin gtt, now will switch lovenox to help minimize
   fluid intake
   - cont to wean vent depending on sedation and secretions
   .
   # Edema - Pt w/ increased edema as he has gotten several IVF boluses
   for his Hypotension. Lasix gtt w/ good effect on UOP, although pt still
   getting quite a bit of fluid in.
   - check for obligate Ins, consider changing some meds to PO rather than
   IV
   - cont lasix gtt to keep keep even
   # Hypotension - Developed post-lysis w/ TPA. Responsive to IVF.
   Initially thought to be [**2-15**] micro-emboli and expected to improve, but
   now more likely related to underlying infection and fevers. Transiently

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and previous deep venous thrombosis (DVT). He was admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications, including fever of unknown origin (FUO), respiratory failure, altered mental status, Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), and pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's condition has been complex and dynamic, with various interventions and changes in treatment. Some key points include:

1. Fever: The patient has had persistent fevers, which have not been explained by a specific infection. Cultures have grown CoNS, multiple GNRs, and C. diff. He continues to spike fevers despite antibiotic therapy.

2. Sepsis: The patient was initially septic but is now resolving. He is normotensive but still tachycardic.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently unable to be extubated due to mental status changes and the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has a good cough and follows commands, suggesting the possibility of extubation.

4. VAP: The patient has a new infiltrate on chest X-ray and is producing purulent sputum. He is being treated with Zosyn and Vanc for an 8-day course unless the organism is identified as pseudomonas.

5. PEs: The patient has had"

   67-year-old man w/ EtOH abuse, recent GIB, h/o DVTs, p/w multifocal
   PEs, now septic.
   # Sepsis
 Resolving, now normotensive. Pt spiking fevers, tachycardic,
   and hypotensive several days ago but without elevation in WBC. Has
   bottles blood Cx growing CoNS, sputum growing multiple GNRs, and stool
   C.diff positive. Did have = infiltrate on CXR concerning for VAP.
   Currently on Zosyn, and Vanc PO, Flagyl. 3 sputum cx all growing GNRs.
   Still spiking fevers
   - cont Zosyn (day 5), for GNR
   - cont Vanc IV (d2) for GPCs
   - cont Flagyl (day 6), PO Vanc (day 4) for C.diff
   - f/u all culture data, obtain specation of GNR/GPCs
   - draw cultures through a-line and CVL lines
   - gentle diuresis to keep even
   # Unresponive: likely related to Versed in the setting of EtOh abuse;
   however did get lyisi is at risk for intracranial hemorrhage. Head CT
   neg for bleed and he is moving all 4 extremities, so suspect this is
   sedation related
   - continue to hold sedation as possible, try PRN fent boluses when
   agitated to see if there is a pain component
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure: Currently unable to extubate due to mental
   status and also has VAP
   - monitor secretions
   - continue PS
   # VAP: + sputum, fevers and new infiltrate. Sputum growing GNR/GPCs
   - cont Zosyn/Vanc
   - obtain repeat sputum cx
   # PEs - On admission pt w/ borderline BPs and considered not a surgical
   candidate. Progressively developed worsening tachycardia and hypoxia.
   Formal TTE and Cardiology consult --> TPA for lysis on [**5-17**] with
   improvement of HR and SaO2. Repeat TTE yesterday shows continued
   depressed RV function; however, right ventricular abnl is now better
   characterized as limpoma rather than clot. No evidence of bleeding.
   Also s/p IVC filter placement.
   - appreciate cardiology involvement, s/p lysis by TPA
   - continue heparin gtt, currently therapeutic, goal 80-100
   - cont to wean vent depending on sedation and secretions
   .
   # Edema - Pt w/ increased edema as he has gotten several IVF boluses
   for his Hypotension. Lasix gtt w/ good effect on UOP, although pt still
   getting quite a bit of fluid in.
   - check for obligate Ins, consider changing some meds to PO rather than
   IV
   -  cont lasix gt to keep keep even
   # Hypotension - Developed post-lysis w/ TPA. Responsive to IVF.
   Initially thought to be [**2-15**] micro-emboli and expected to improve, but
   now more likely related to underlying infection and fevers. Transiently
   required pressors, but now off.
   - cont to monitor BP closely
   - keep I/O even
   - continue home Florinef
   - keep I/O even today
   # Anemia - Likely dilutional considering pt received 4L PRBCs, but in
   setting of lysis and vague h/o GIB. HCT down 32->29. No melena.
   - Guaiac stools
   - recheck HCt
   # Alcohol withdrawal - Significant EtOH history.
   - cont propofol for sedation
   - daily thiamine / MVI / folate
   - will need CIWA and SW on extubation
   # Recent GIB - Unclear history, ? significant.
   - PPI IV BID
   -  GI consulted, no endoscopy now,but will scope prior to discharge
   .
   # Low phos: resolved
   - replete
   - recheck in pm
   - nutrition consult
   # Renal insufficieny - Improved.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of EtOH abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), hypotension, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). He was admitted to the ICU due to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) including respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute kidney injury (AKI).

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. Blood cultures are positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), and sputum cultures are growing multiple Gram-negative rods (GNRs). Stool culture is positive for Clostridium difficile (C. difficile).
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed a new infiltrate on chest X-ray, which is concerning for VAP. He is currently receiving appropriate antibiotics for GNR and Gram-positive cocci (GPC).
3. DVT and PE: The patient has a history of DVT and PE. He underwent lytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for PE and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement.
4. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with signs of sepsis but is now resolving.
5. C. difficile infection: The patient's stool culture is positive for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of altered mental status, respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, electrolyte and fluid disorder, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and sedatives. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are ongoing concerns about potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated bloodstream infection, and further deterioration in mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms, such as increased fever, worsening oxygenation, and changes in sputum color or quantity, should be done. Regular cultures and chest X-rays may be necessary to identify any signs of infection.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place, increasing the risk of bloodstream infection. Signs of infection may include fever, chills, hypotension, and positive blood cultures. Regular assessment of the insertion sites for signs of infection or leakage is crucial.
3. Further deterioration in mental status: The patient's mental status remains altered, and there is a risk of further decline. Close monitoring of neurological symptoms, such as"

 Resolving, now normotensive. Pt spiking fevers, tachycardic,
   and hypotensive several days ago but without elevation in WBC. Has
   bottles blood Cx growing CoNS, sputum growing multiple GNRs, and stool
   C.diff positive. Did have = infiltrate on CXR concerning for VAP.
   Currently on Zosyn, and Vanc PO, Flagyl. 3 sputum cx all growing GNRs.
   Still spiking fevers
   - cont Zosyn (day 5), for GNR
   - cont Vanc IV (d2) for GPCs
   - cont Flagyl (day 6), PO Vanc (day 4) for C.diff
   - f/u all culture data, obtain specation of GNR/GPCs
   - draw cultures through a-line and CVL lines
   - gentle diuresis to keep even
   # Unresponive: likely related to Versed in the setting of EtOh abuse;
   however did get lyisi is at risk for intracranial hemorrhage. Head CT
   neg for bleed and he is moving all 4 extremities, so suspect this is
   sedation related
   - continue to hold sedation as possible, try PRN fent boluses when
   agitated to see if there is a pain component
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure: Currently unable to extubate due to mental
   status and also has VAP
   - monitor secretions
   - continue PS
   # VAP: + sputum, fevers and new infiltrate. Sputum growing GNR/GPCs
   - cont Zosyn/Vanc
   - obtain repeat sputum cx
   # PEs - On admission pt w/ borderline BPs and considered not a surgical
   candidate. Progressively developed worsening tachycardia and hypoxia.
   Formal TTE and Cardiology consult --> TPA for lysis on [**5-17**] with
   improvement of HR and SaO2. Repeat TTE yesterday shows continued
   depressed RV function; however, right ventricular abnl is now better
   characterized as limpoma rather than clot. No evidence of bleeding.
   Also s/p IVC filter placement.
   - appreciate cardiology involvement, s/p lysis by TPA
   - continue heparin gtt, currently therapeutic, goal 80-100
   - cont to wean vent depending on sedation and secretions
   .
   # Edema - Pt w/ increased edema as he has gotten several IVF boluses
   for his Hypotension. Lasix gtt w/ good effect on UOP, although pt still
   getting quite a bit of fluid in.
   - check for obligate Ins, consider changing some meds to PO rather than
   IV
   -  cont lasix gt to keep keep even
   # Hypotension - Developed post-lysis w/ TPA. Responsive to IVF.
   Initially thought to be [**2-15**] micro-emboli and expected to improve, but
   now more likely related to underlying infection and fevers. Transiently
   required pressors, but now off.
   - cont to monitor BP closely
   - keep I/O even
   - continue home Florinef
   - keep I/O even today
   # Anemia - Likely dilutional considering pt received 4L PRBCs, but in
   setting of lysis and vague h/o GIB. HCT down 32->29. No melena.
   - Guaiac stools
   - recheck HCt
   # Alcohol withdrawal - Significant EtOH history.
   - cont propofol for sedation
   - daily thiamine / MVI / folate
   - will need CIWA and SW on extubation
   # Recent GIB - Unclear history, ? significant.
   - PPI IV BID
   -  GI consulted, no endoscopy now,but will scope prior to discharge

   Patient is critically ill.
   Total time spent: 40 minutes
","The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and multiple pulmonary embolisms (PE). The patient presented with multifocal PE's and underwent thrombolysis on [**5-17**]. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed. The patient also has concerns about a right atrial clot, which was found to be lipomatous hypertrophy. The patient is currently in the ICU and is experiencing various complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory failure. Weaning sedation and daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) should be considered to assess readiness for extubation. FiO2 should be titrated based on oxygen saturation levels.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period and is at risk for developing VAP. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and the plan is to continue treatment with vancomycin and Zosyn.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has tested positive for C. diff and is being treated with oral vancomycin. Flagyl has also been administered.

4. Submassive Pulmonary Embolism: The patient received tissue plasminogen activator (TPA"

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. AMS (acute mental status change): The patient is sedated, and there is a possibility of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) given the thrombolysis.

2. Vent. Dependence: The patient is dependent on the ventilator due to myocardial stunning (MS). 

3. Submassive Pulmonary Emboli: The patient received tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for treatment, and continues on heparin drip with a goal PTT of 80-100 seconds. Blood pressure should be closely monitored, and consideration will be given to using levophed if hypotensive. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed.

4. MS (myocardial stunning): The patient is not waking up from sedation, suspecting secondary to high-dose benzodiazepines.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and recent pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing multiple medical complications.

1. Bilateral PE: The patient presents with multifocal PEs, which were treated with thrombolytic therapy (TPA) and placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient is on heparin drip to maintain a PTT of 80-100 seconds and is being monitored closely for hypotension, with consideration for using levophed if necessary.

2. Mental Status (MS): The patient's mental status remains poor, with a Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) score of -4. The patient is heavily sedated and not following commands. Propofol has been used to increase arousal.

3. Ventilator Dependence: The patient is dependent on the ventilator due to severe mental status impairment. The goal is to wean sedation and perform daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBT).

4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has developed VAP, and treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) has been initiated. Once the patient's clinical status allows, vancomycin will be discontinued, and an 8"

   Currently on Zosyn, and Vanc PO, Flagyl. 3 sputum cx all growing GNRs.
   Still spiking fevers, new cultures growing Coag (+) Staph.
   - cont Zosyn (Day 6), for GNR
   - cont Vanc IV (Day 3) for GPCs
   - cont Flagyl (Day 7), PO Vanc (Day 5) for C.diff
   - f/u all culture data, obtain specation of GNR/GPCs
   - draw cultures through a-line and CVL lines
   - gentle diuresis to keep even
   # Unresponsive: likely related to Versed in the setting of EtOh abuse;
   however did get lyisi is at risk for intracranial hemorrhage. Head CT
   neg for bleed and he is moving all 4 extremities, so suspect this is
   sedation related. This morning, he is more responsive, following
   commands, but still not opening eyes. Now extubated with significantly
   improving mental status.
   - hold any mind-altering medications
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure: Extubated with improving hypoxia.
   - monitor secretions
   # VAP: + sputum, fevers and new infiltrate. Sputum growing GNR/GPCs
   - cont Zosyn/Vanc for 8 day course unless grows pseudomonas
   # PEs - On admission pt w/ borderline BPs and considered not a surgical
   candidate. Progressively developed worsening tachycardia and hypoxia.
   Formal TTE and Cardiology consult --> TPA for lysis on [**5-17**] with
   improvement of HR and SaO2. Repeat TTE yesterday shows continued
   depressed RV function; however, right ventricular abnl is now better
   characterized as limpoma rather than clot. No evidence of bleeding.
   Also s/p IVC filter placement.

   - cont lovenox to help minimize fluid intake, holding off on coumadin
   pending GI evaluation
   # Edema - Pt w/ increased edema as he has gotten several IVF boluses
   for his Hypotension. Lasix gtt w/ good effect on UOP, although pt still
   getting quite a bit of fluid in.
   - check for obligate Ins, consider changing some meds to PO rather than
   IV
   - cont lasix gtt to keep negative
   # Hypotension - Developed post-lysis w/ TPA. Responsive to IVF.
   Initially thought to be [**2-15**] micro-emboli and expected to improve, but
   now more likely related to underlying infection and fevers. Transiently

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleed (GIB), and hypotension. He was admitted to the ICU for sepsis and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple complications including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), fever of unknown origin (FUO), electrolyte and fluid disorder, pulmonary embolism (PE), altered mental status, Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, diuretics, and anticoagulants. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), blood pressure of 122/68 mmHg, heart rate of 119 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals signs of edema and positive fluid balance. Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine level, and positive cultures for Gram-negative rods and Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's mental status has improved since extubation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin. It is important to monitor for signs of clot progression or new clot formation.

   Still spiking fevers, new cultures growing Coag (+) Staph.
   - cont Zosyn (Day 6), for GNR
   - cont Vanc IV (Day 3) for GPCs
   - cont Flagyl (Day 7), PO Vanc (Day 5) for C.diff
   - f/u all culture data, obtain specation of GNR/GPCs
   - draw cultures through a-line and CVL lines
   - gentle diuresis to keep even
   # Unresponsive: likely related to Versed in the setting of EtOh abuse;
   however did get lyisi is at risk for intracranial hemorrhage. Head CT
   neg for bleed and he is moving all 4 extremities, so suspect this is
   sedation related. This morning, he is more responsive, following
   commands, but still not opening eyes. Now extubated with significantly
   improving mental status.
   - hold any mind-altering medications
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure: Extubated with improving hypoxia.
   - monitor secretions
   # VAP: + sputum, fevers and new infiltrate. Sputum growing GNR/GPCs
   - cont Zosyn/Vanc for 8 day course unless grows pseudomonas
   # PEs - On admission pt w/ borderline BPs and considered not a surgical
   candidate. Progressively developed worsening tachycardia and hypoxia.
   Formal TTE and Cardiology consult --> TPA for lysis on [**5-17**] with
   improvement of HR and SaO2. Repeat TTE yesterday shows continued
   depressed RV function; however, right ventricular abnl is now better
   characterized as limpoma rather than clot. No evidence of bleeding.
   Also s/p IVC filter placement.
   - appreciate cardiology involvement, s/p lysis by TPA
   - cont lovenox to help minimize fluid intake, holding off on coumadin
   pending GI evaluation
   # Edema - Pt w/ increased edema as he has gotten several IVF boluses
   for his Hypotension. Lasix gtt w/ good effect on UOP, although pt still
   getting quite a bit of fluid in.
   - check for obligate Ins, consider changing some meds to PO rather than
   IV
   - cont lasix gtt to keep negative
   # Hypotension - Developed post-lysis w/ TPA. Responsive to IVF.
   Initially thought to be [**2-15**] micro-emboli and expected to improve, but
   now more likely related to underlying infection and fevers. Transiently
   required pressors, but now off.
   - cont to monitor BP closely
   - continue home Florinef
   # Anemia - Likely dilutional considering pt received 4L PRBCs, but in
   setting of lysis and vague h/o GIB. HCT down 32->29. No melena.
   - Guaiac stools
   - recheck HCt
   # Alcohol withdrawal - Significant EtOH history. Should now be out of
   window for withdrawal.
   - daily thiamine / MVI / folate
   - SW consult
   # Recent GIB - Unclear history, ? significant.
   - PPI IV BID
   - GI consulted, no endoscopy now, but will scope prior to discharge
   # Low phos: resolved
   - replete

","The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. He was admitted to the ICU due to severe sepsis and respiratory failure. He had been intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs have been unstable, with episodes of fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. His mental status has fluctuated, and he has been unresponsive at times.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), electrolyte and fluid disorders, respiratory failure, altered mental status, Clostridium difficile infection, and suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Vancomycin, and Metronidazole.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and leukocytosis with a left shift. His blood cultures have grown Citrobacter freundii complex and multiple gram-negative rods, which are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. His sputum cultures have also grown gram-negative rods, and he has tested positive for Clostridium difficile.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing Zosyn and Vancomycin for 8 days, holding off on Coumadin pending GI evaluation, and continuing Lovenox to minimize fluid intake. He is also on las"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and recent pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient was admitted to the ICU for submassive pulmonary emboli and underwent thrombolysis on [**5-17**]. The patient's current condition includes multifocal PE's, recent GIB, and potential volume overload. The patient has been extubated and is receiving tube feeds. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 119/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated and intubated, but opens eyes to stimulation. Neurological examination is nonfocal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Submassive Pulmonary Emboli: The patient has a history of PE and received thrombolysis. The patient is currently on lovenox and being monitored closely for any signs of hypotension. Levophed may be considered if hypotension occurs. An IVC filter has been placed to prevent further emboli.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP and is being treated with Zosyn until final culture results return. Vanc and Flagyl will continue for 2 weeks and 1 week post-antibiotics"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), fever of unknown origin, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), altered mental status, Clostridium difficile infection, and acute pulmonary embolism.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been receiving various antibiotics including piperacillin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin. The patient also receives infusions of furosemide for diuresis and enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis. Additionally, the patient is on pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure within normal limits, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 37.8 degrees Celsius.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,050 mL with outputs totaling 4,300 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,250 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure (CVP) of 4 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.6 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels of 1"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and recent pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient underwent thrombolysis and placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient has several medical complications, including submassive pulmonary embolism, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), hypotension, alcohol withdrawal, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, renal insufficiency, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrent PE or further deterioration of lung function.
2. Infection due to prolonged use of mechanical ventilation and indwelling lines.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding recurrence.
4. Worsening of renal function.
5. Electrolyte imbalances.
6. Development of new infections, such as hospital-acquired pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection.
7. Possible need for reintubation if there are issues with weaning off mechanical ventilation.
8. Complications related to alcohol withdrawal if not properly managed.

These are some potential complications that may arise based on the information provided in the progress note. However, it is important to note that individual cases can vary, and other complications may also be present."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). He presented with hypoxia and was found to have multiple pulmonary embolisms (PEs). The patient underwent thrombolysis and placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. He also developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and was treated with antibiotics. The patient has been weaned off mechanical ventilation and his condition has improved. However, he continues to have some complications, including anemia, Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and renal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of DVTs and was found to have multiple PEs. This is a serious complication that can lead to further clotting events, including new or recurrent DVTs and PEs. The patient has already undergone thrombolysis and placement of an IVC filter to prevent further embolic events.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient developed VAP, which is a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are receiving mechanical ventilation. VAP can be caused by various bacteria and can lead to worsening respiratory function. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, but there is still a risk of ongoing"

   depressed RV function; however, right ventricular abnl is now better
   characterized as limpoma rather than clot. No evidence of bleeding.
   Also s/p IVC filter placement. Blood pressure recently stable.
   - Appreciate cardiology involvement, s/p lysis by TPA
   - Continue lovenox to help minimize fluid intake, holding off on
   coumadin pending GI evaluation

   consider also b12 deficiency.
   - Follow Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]; change to oral
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse hct>25
   - Place two PIV; once in, can d/c CVL once PIV in
   - GI to perform EGD and colonoscopy on floor
   - Check iron panel, folate, b12
   # C. diff colitis:  Clinically improved, has been treated with both PO
   vancomycin and metronidazole.
   - Complete 10d course of PO vancomycin following completion of Zosyn
   for HAP
   - Discontinue PO metronidazole
   # Alcohol withdrawal: Significant EtOH history. Should now be out of
   window for withdrawal and was loaded up front.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). He presented with multifocal pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and is now septic.
- On admission, the patient had borderline blood pressures and was considered not a surgical candidate. He developed worsening tachycardia and hypoxia, leading to the administration of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for lysis on [**5-17**]. This resulted in improvement of heart rate and oxygen saturation. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) on [**5-18**] showed continued depressed right ventricular function, but with no evidence of bleeding. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was also placed.
- The patient's blood pressure has recently stabilized, and he is continuing to receive low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to minimize fluid intake. Coumadin is being held pending gastrointestinal evaluation.
- The patient was diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is clinically improved without significant fever or sputum production in the last day. Sputum cultures are growing Citrobacter, Aeromonas, and Staphylococcus aureus. He is being treated with Zosyn"

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has had multiple PEs and was initially considered not a surgical candidate due to borderline blood pressures. However, he received tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for lysis, which improved his heart rate and oxygen saturation. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed continued depressed right ventricular function, but no evidence of bleeding. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was also placed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, and multiple deep vein thromboses (DVTs). He presented with hypoxia and was found to have multiple pulmonary embolisms (PEs). He underwent thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. The patient's right ventricular function is compromised, but there is no evidence of bleeding.

The patient developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and was treated with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin. He also had Clostridium difficile infection, which has improved after treatment with metronidazole and vancomycin.

The patient has edema due to fluid overload during IVF resuscitation. Anemia is trending down, possibly secondary to chronic gastrointestinal bleeding and macrocytosis. The patient's electrolytes and fluid disorder need to be managed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged immobilization and bed rest may lead to pressure ulcers or deep vein thrombosis.
2. The patient's compromised right ventricular function increases the risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism and heart failure.
3. The patient has a history of chronic alcohol abuse, which increases the risk of liver disease and related complications.
4. The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may recur, leading to further"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, and multiple previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) episodes. He presented with hypoxia and was found to have multiple comorbidities, including sepsis, acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, Clostridium difficile infection, pulmonary embolism, and unresponsive behavior. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications. His current condition is improving, with resolving sepsis and hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by an overwhelming immune response to infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced acute respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. This condition can be fatal if not managed properly.
3. Clostridium difficile Infection: The patient has a positive stool culture for Clostridium difficile, indicating an infection caused by this bacterium. It can cause severe diarrhea and colitis, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient had multiple pulmonary embolisms, which are blood clots that have traveled to the lungs. This can result in decreased oxygenation and respiratory distress.
5. Unresponsive Behavior: The patient was unresponsive at"

","The patient's chief complaint is hypoxia. Based on the 24-hour events, the arterial line was stopped and the patient was given Lasix boluses for diuresis. The patient's mental status has been improving, and they have developed a central line-associated bloodstream infection with Citrobacter freundii complex, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Staphylococcus aureus coag positive. The patient's allergies are unknown.

The last doses of antibiotics administered were metronidazole, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is receiving various ICU medications including pantoprazole (Protonix), enoxaparin (Lovenox), furosemide (Lasix), and others. There are no changes to the patient's medical or family history.

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient has no cardiovascular or respiratory symptoms, pain, or fever. The flowsheet data shows that the patient's temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate are within normal ranges. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals sclera that is anicteric, a regular S1 and S2 heart sound without murmurs or gallops, clear lungs bilaterally, soft abdomen with bowel sounds, and warm extremities with 1+ pitting edema bilaterally. The patient is alert"

 Resolving, now normotensive. Pt spiking fevers, tachycardic,
   and hypotensive several days ago but without elevation in WBC. Has
   bottles blood Cx growing CoNS, sputum growing multiple GNRs, and stool
   C.diff positive. Did have infiltrate on CXR concerning for VAP.
   Currently on Zosyn, and Vanc PO, Flagyl. 3 sputum cx all growing GNRs.
   Still spiking fevers, new cultures growing Coag (+) Staph.
   - cont Zosyn (Day 6), for GNR
   - cont Vanc IV (Day 3) for GPCs
   - cont Flagyl (Day 7), PO Vanc (Day 5) for C.diff
   - f/u all culture data, obtain specation of GNR/GPCs
   - draw cultures through a-line and CVL lines
   - gentle diuresis to keep even
   # Unresponsive: likely related to Versed in the setting of EtOh abuse;
   however did get lyisi is at risk for intracranial hemorrhage. Head CT
   neg for bleed and he is moving all 4 extremities, so suspect this is
   sedation related. This morning, he is more responsive, following
   commands, but still not opening eyes. Now extubated with significantly
   improving mental status.
   - hold any mind-altering medications
   # Hypoxic Resp Failure: Extubated with improving hypoxia.
   - monitor secretions
   # VAP: + sputum, fevers and new infiltrate. Sputum growing GNR/GPCs
   - cont Zosyn/Vanc for 8 day course unless grows pseudomonas
   # PEs - On admission pt w/ borderline BPs and considered not a surgical
   candidate. Progressively developed worsening tachycardia and hypoxia.
   Formal TTE and Cardiology consult --> TPA for lysis on [**5-17**] with
   improvement of HR and SaO2. Repeat TTE yesterday shows continued
   depressed RV function; however, right ventricular abnl is now better
   characterized as limpoma rather than clot. No evidence of bleeding.
   Also s/p IVC filter placement.
   - appreciate cardiology involvement, s/p lysis by TPA
   - cont lovenox to help minimize fluid intake, holding off on coumadin
   pending GI evaluation
   # Edema - Pt w/ increased edema as he has gotten several IVF boluses
   for his Hypotension. Lasix gtt w/ good effect on UOP, although pt still
   getting quite a bit of fluid in.
   - check for obligate Ins, consider changing some meds to PO rather than
   IV
   - cont lasix gtt to keep negative
   # Hypotension - Developed post-lysis w/ TPA. Responsive to IVF.
   Initially thought to be [**2-15**] micro-emboli and expected to improve, but
   now more likely related to underlying infection and fevers. Transiently
   required pressors, but now off.
   - cont to monitor BP closely
   - continue home Florinef
   # Anemia - Likely dilutional considering pt received 4L PRBCs, but in
   setting of lysis and vague h/o GIB. HCT down 32->29. No melena.
   - Guaiac stools
   - recheck HCt
   # Alcohol withdrawal - Significant EtOH history. Should now be out of
   window for withdrawal.
   - daily thiamine / MVI / folate
   - SW consult
   # Recent GIB - Unclear history, ? significant.
   - PPI IV BID
   - GI consulted, no endoscopy now, but will scope prior to discharge
   # Low phos: resolved

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He presented with hypoxia and was found to have multiple pulmonary embolisms (PEs). He is septic with bottles of blood cultures growing CoNS (Coagulase-negative Staphylococci) and GNRs (Gram-negative rods). His sputum culture also grew multiple GNRs, and he tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C.diff) in his stool. He had an infiltrate on chest X-ray, which was concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently on piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin (Vanc) PO, and metronidazole (Flagyl).

The patient has shown improvement in his mental status, respiratory failure, and hypotension. He was unresponsive initially but is now more responsive and extubated. His hypoxia has improved, and he is off the ventilator. He continues to have fevers and new infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting ongoing infection. His blood cultures continue to grow GNR/GPCs (Gram-positive cocci), and he remains on Zosyn/Vanc for an 8-day course unless pseudomonas is identified. He had a previous episode of acute respiratory distress syndrome"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVTs), and recent thrombolysis for submassive pulmonary emboli (PEs). The patient has multifocal PEs and was not on anticoagulation due to a recent GIB. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed, and there is a concern for right atrial clot that was actually lipomatous hypertrophy. The patient has developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with sputum positive for Citrobacter and Staph, volume overload requiring lasix bolus, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/74 to 97/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 4 liters of supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and sedated, but opens eyes to stimulation, with decreased tremor. Physical examination findings include elevated jugular venous pressure (JVD) and clear lung fields anteriorly but not able to auscultate posteriorly.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.6 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count"

The patient underwent thrombolysis on [**5-17**] and has an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place. The patient presents with submassive pulmonary embolism, for which TPA was given, and is currently on enoxaparin (lovenox). The patient also has malnutrition and will need to focus on nutritional intake and improving cough/secretion clearance.

The patient has been experiencing fevers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Antibiotics will continue until final culture results return, totaling an 8-day gram-negative coverage. Vancomycin will be continued for a total of 8 days and for an additional 2 weeks post-antibiotics.

The patient's hypotension has resolved, and fluoroctisone will be continued for now. There were signs of alcohol withdrawal, but these have improved, and no benzodiazepine requirement exists. Daily thiamine and multivitamins will be administered.

The patient recently experienced gastrointestinal bleeding and will need to undergo a scope at some point to evaluate the risk for rebleeding, as anticoagulation will be necessary once acute issues are resolved. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was changed"

   not a surgical candidate. Progressively developed worsening tachycardia
   and hypoxia. Formal TTE and Cardiology consult --> TPA for lysis on [**5-17**]
   with improvement of HR and SaO2. Repeat TTE [**5-18**]  shows continued
   depressed RV function; however, right ventricular abnl is now better
   characterized as limpoma rather than clot. No evidence of bleeding.
   Also s/p IVC filter placement. Blood pressure recently stable.
   - Appreciate cardiology involvement, s/p lysis by TPA
   - Continue lovenox to help minimize fluid intake, holding off on
   coumadin pending GI evaluation
   # Ventilator associated pneumonia:  Clinically improved without
   significant fever or sputum in the last day. Sputum growing
   Citrobacter, Aeromonas, and vancomycin
   - Continue Zosyn (D1: [**5-19**])
   - Continue vancomycin (D1: [**5-21**])
   - Plan for 8 days of antibiotics; awaiting final sensitivities before
   pealing off meds
   # Edema: Total body overloaded in the setting of IVF resuscitation for
   his hypotension.
   - Continue IV lasix boluses goal -1 to 2L negative
   # Anemia:  Hct trending down, without any evidence of gross bleeding
   here. Of note, he does have a history of GIB and is s/p thrombolysis
   and on LMWH. Macrocytosis likely secondary to liver disease, but
   consider also b12 deficiency.
   - Follow Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]; change to oral
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse hct>25
   - Place two PIV; once in, can d/c CVL once PIV in
   - GI to perform EGD and colonoscopy on floor
   - Check iron panel, folate, b12
   # C. diff colitis:  Clinically improved, has been treated with both PO
   vancomycin and metronidazole.
   - Complete 10d course of PO vancomycin following completion of Zosyn
   for HAP
   - Discontinue PO metronidazole
   # Alcohol withdrawal: Significant EtOH history. Should now be out of
   window for withdrawal and was loaded up front.
   - Daily thiamine / MVI / folate
   - SW consult

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, and multiple previous deep vein thrombosis episodes. He presented with multifocal pulmonary embolisms and was initially considered not a surgical candidate. The patient developed worsening tachycardia and hypoxia, leading to the administration of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for lysis. He showed improvement in heart rate and oxygen saturation. A repeat echocardiogram revealed continued depressed right ventricular function, but no evidence of bleeding. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was also placed. The patient's blood pressure has recently stabilized.

The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia and has shown clinical improvement without significant fever or sputum production. His sputum culture grew Citrobacter, Aeromonas, and vancomycin-sensitive organisms. Antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin has been continued for 8 days, awaiting final sensitivities before peeling off medications.

The patient has edema, likely secondary to total body overload in the setting of intravenous fluid resuscitation for hypotension. Lasix boluses are being continued to achieve a goal of negative fluid balance.

The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is trending down, without any evidence of gross bleeding. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and has undergone thrombolysis"

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male admitted to the ICU with a history of altered mental status, respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, DVT, electrolyte and fluid disorder, pain control, and possible C. difficile infection. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate between 110-126 bpm, low blood pressure ranging from 99/64-133/85 mmHg, normal respiratory rate between 18-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's blood culture results are pending. The patient has received various medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole, vancomycin, pantoprazole, furosemide, enoxaparin, and Percocet for pain management. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's fluid balance is negative by 965 mL, indicating fluid loss. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and his skin and neurologic examination findings are also not documented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's history of DVT increases the risk of PE, which can cause respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: The patient's fever of unknown origin, elevated white blood cell count, and positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of an"

   Assessment and Plan:  67-year-old man w/ EtOH abuse, recent GIB, h/o
   DVTs, p/w multifocal PEs, now septic.
   # Pulmonary embolism:  On admission pt w/ borderline BPs and considered
   not a surgical candidate. Progressively developed worsening tachycardia
   and hypoxia. Formal TTE and Cardiology consult --> TPA for lysis on [**5-17**]
   with improvement of HR and SaO2. Repeat TTE [**5-18**]  shows continued
   depressed RV function; however, right ventricular abnl is now better
   characterized as limpoma rather than clot. No evidence of bleeding.
   Also s/p IVC filter placement. Blood pressure recently stable.
   - Appreciate cardiology involvement, s/p lysis by TPA
   - Continue lovenox to help minimize fluid intake, holding off on
   coumadin pending GI evaluation
   # Ventilator associated pneumonia:  Clinically improved without
   significant fever or sputum in the last day. Sputum growing
   Citrobacter, Aeromonas, and vancomycin
   - Continue Zosyn (D1: [**5-19**])
   - Continue vancomycin (D1: [**5-21**])
   - Plan for 8 days of antibiotics; awaiting final sensitivities before
   pealing off meds
   # Edema: Total body overloaded in the setting of IVF resuscitation for
   his hypotension.
   - Continue IV lasix boluses goal -1 to 2L negative
   # Anemia:  Hct trending down, without any evidence of gross bleeding
   here. Of note, he does have a history of GIB and is s/p thrombolysis
   and on LMWH. Macrocytosis likely secondary to liver disease, but
   consider also b12 deficiency.
   - Follow Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]; change to oral
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse hct>25
   - Place two PIV; once in, can d/c CVL once PIV in
   - GI to perform EGD and colonoscopy on floor
   - Check iron panel, folate, b12
   # C. diff colitis:  Clinically improved, has been treated with both PO
   vancomycin and metronidazole.
   - Complete 10d course of PO vancomycin following completion of Zosyn
   for HAP
   - Discontinue PO metronidazole
   # Alcohol withdrawal: Significant EtOH history. Should now be out of
   window for withdrawal and was loaded up front.
   - Daily thiamine / MVI / folate
   - SW consult

","The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of EtOH abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). He presents with multifocal pulmonary embolism (PEs), sepsis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), edema, anemia, and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis.

Assessment and plan:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient was initially considered not a surgical candidate due to borderline blood pressures. He developed worsening tachycardia and hypoxia, and a formal transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and cardiology consult led to the administration of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for lysis on [5-17]. This resulted in improvement of heart rate and oxygen saturation. Repeat TEE on [5-18] showed continued depressed right ventricular (RV) function, but the right ventricular abnormality was better characterized as a thrombus rather than a clot. No evidence of bleeding was observed. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was also placed. The patient's blood pressure is now stable.
- Continue Lovenox to minimize fluid intake.
- Hold off on Coumadin pending gastrointestinal evaluation.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient has shown clinical improvement without significant fever or sputum in the last day. Sputum cultures have grown Cit"

   Assessment and Plan:  67-year-old man w/ EtOH abuse, recent GIB, h/o
   DVTs, p/w multifocal PEs, now septic.
   # Fevers
   Pt currently being treated for VAP, with sputum cultures growing
   Citrobacter, aeromonas, and S. aureus (sensitivites on the latter two
   organisms are pending). CXR not worsening and O2 requirement stable
   arguing against progression of pna. Consider also line infection, UTI,
   drug fever, clot/PE. Of note, PO vancomycin discontinued yesterday for
   C diff though he continues on PO flagyl. Back pain c/w prior at home
   but also consider possibility of spinal osteo.
   - Follow up pending urine and blood cultures, repeat cultures if
   febrile
   - DC foley and central line
   - Call lab for sensitivities on aeromonas and staph
   - Consider L spine MRI though back pain is chronic
   # Tachycardia
   Likely multifactorial, pt with recent large PE and infection
   - Follow on telemetry, treating infection and PE
   # Pulmonary embolism:  On admission pt w/ borderline BPs and considered
   not a surgical candidate. Progressively developed worsening tachycardia
   and hypoxia. Formal TTE and Cardiology consult --> TPA for lysis on [**5-17**]
   with improvement of HR and SaO2. Repeat TTE [**5-18**]  shows continued
   depressed RV function; however, right ventricular abnl is now better
   characterized as limpoma rather than clot. No evidence of bleeding.
   Also s/p IVC filter placement. Blood pressure recently stable.
   - Appreciate cardiology involvement, s/p lysis by TPA
   - Continue lovenox to help minimize fluid intake, holding off on
   coumadin pending GI evaluation
   # Ventilator associated pneumonia:  Clinically improved. Sputum growing
   Citrobacter, Aeromonas, staph aureus.
   - Continue Zosyn (D1: [**5-19**])
   - Continue vancomycin (D1: [**5-21**])
   - Plan for 8 days of antibiotics; awaiting final sensitivities before
   pealing off meds
   # Edema: Total body overloaded in the setting of IVF resuscitation for
   his hypotension.
   - Will hold off on further diuresis today
   # Anemia:  Hct trending down, without any evidence of gross bleeding
   here. Of note, he does have a history of GIB and is s/p thrombolysis
   and on LMWH. Macrocytosis likely secondary to liver disease, but
   consider also b12 deficiency.
   - Follow daily hct
   - Continue PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse hct>25
   - Place two PIV; once in, can d/c CVL
   - GI to perform EGD and colonoscopy on floor
   - Repeat iron studies as outpatient
   # C. diff colitis:  Clinically improved, has been treated with both PO
   vancomycin.
   - Complete 14d course of PO flagyl  following completion of VAP
   antibiotics
   # Alcohol withdrawal: Significant EtOH history. Should now be out of
   window for withdrawal and was loaded up front.
   - Daily thiamine / MVI / folate
   - SW consult ([**5-26**])

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and multiple pulmonary embolisms (PE).
- He presented with hypoxia and was found to have sepsis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and a positive stool test for Clostridium difficile (C. diff).
- The patient's condition has improved clinically, but he continues to have fevers and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for the VAP.
- Other issues include tachycardia, anemia, edema, and potential alcohol withdrawal.
- The patient underwent thrombolysis for one of the PE episodes and had an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placed.
- His blood cultures grew coag-negative Staphylococcus, but subsequent tests were negative for MRSA and other organisms.
- The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, which is a common complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. It is important to continue appropriate antibiotic therapy based on culture sensitivities to prevent further progression of the infection.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and recent PE, indicating a hypercoag"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and multiple deep vein thrombosis (DVTs). He presents with hypoxia and has been diagnosed with sepsis. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), with sputum cultures growing Citrobacter, Aeromonas, and Staphylococcus aureus. The CXR does not show worsening, suggesting that there may not be progression of pneumonia. However, the patient is still febrile, which could indicate a line infection, urinary tract infection (UTI), drug fever, or clot/pulmonary embolism (PE).

2. Tachycardia: The patient has been experiencing worsening tachycardia, likely due to a combination of factors including recent large PE and infection. The patient is being monitored on telemetry, and the infection and PE are being treated.

3. Pulmonary embolism: On admission, the patient had borderline blood pressures and was considered not a surgical candidate. He developed worsening tachycardia and hypoxia, leading to the administration of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) for lysis on [5-17]. The patient showed improvement in heart rate and oxygen saturation. Repeat transthoracic echoc"

1. Line infection: The patient has multiple lines, including a central line, which increases the risk of infection.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Foley catheterization can lead to UTI, especially in hospitalized patients.
3. Drug fever: The patient is receiving several medications, including antibiotics, which can cause fever as a side effect.
4. Clot/PE: Given the patient's history of DVTs and current PEs, there is a risk of further clot formation and potential embolization.
5. Spinal osteomyelitis: The patient's back pain could be related to spinal osteomyelitis, especially considering his history of EtOH abuse and recent hospitalization.
6. Liver disease: The patient's macrocytosis may be secondary to liver disease, which can cause anemia.
7. Vitamin B12 deficiency: This is another possible cause of the patient"

   Assessment and Plan:  67-year-old man w/ EtOH abuse, recent GIB, h/o
   DVTs, p/w multifocal PEs, now septic.
   # Fevers
   Pt currently being treated for VAP, with sputum cultures growing
   Citrobacter, aeromonas, and S. aureus (sensitivites on the latter two
   organisms are pending). CXR not worsening and O2 requirement stable
   arguing against progression of pna. Consider also line infection, UTI,
   drug fever, clot/PE. Of note, PO vancomycin discontinued yesterday for
   C diff though he continues on PO flagyl.
   - Follow up pending urine and blood cultures, repeat cultures if
   febrile
   - DC foley and central line
   - Call lab for sensitivities on aeromonas and staph.
   # Tachycardia
   Likely multifactorial, pt with recent large PE and infection
   - Follow on telemetry, treating infection and PE
   # Pulmonary embolism:  On admission pt w/ borderline BPs and considered
   not a surgical candidate. Progressively developed worsening tachycardia
   and hypoxia. Formal TTE and Cardiology consult --> TPA for lysis on [**5-17**]
   with improvement of HR and SaO2. Repeat TTE [**5-18**]  shows continued
   depressed RV function; however, right ventricular abnl is now better
   characterized as limpoma rather than clot. No evidence of bleeding.
   Also s/p IVC filter placement. Blood pressure recently stable.
   - Appreciate cardiology involvement, s/p lysis by TPA
   - Continue lovenox to help minimize fluid intake, holding off on
   coumadin pending GI evaluation
   # Ventilator associated pneumonia:  Clinically improved without
   significant fever or sputum in the last day. Sputum growing
   Citrobacter, Aeromonas, and vancomycin
   - Continue Zosyn (D1: [**5-19**])
   - Continue vancomycin (D1: [**5-21**])
   - Plan for 8 days of antibiotics; awaiting final sensitivities before
   pealing off meds
   # Edema: Total body overloaded in the setting of IVF resuscitation for
   his hypotension.
   - Will hold off on further diuresis today
   # Anemia:  Hct trending down, without any evidence of gross bleeding
   here. Of note, he does have a history of GIB and is s/p thrombolysis
   and on LMWH. Macrocytosis likely secondary to liver disease, but
   consider also b12 deficiency.
   - Follow Hct [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue PPI [**Hospital1 **]; change to oral
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse hct>25
   - Place two PIV; once in, can d/c CVL once PIV in
   - GI to perform EGD and colonoscopy on floor
   - Repeat iron studies as outpatient
   # C. diff colitis:  Clinically improved, has been treated with both PO
   vancomycin and metronidazole.
   - Complete 14d course of PO flagyl  following completion of VAP
   antibiotics
   # Alcohol withdrawal: Significant EtOH history. Should now be out of
   window for withdrawal and was loaded up front.
   - Daily thiamine / MVI / folate
   - SW consult

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, recent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and multiple pulmonary embolisms (PEs). He is currently in the ICU for sepsis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and treatment for C. difficile colitis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: Spiked to 101.3°F, currently 99.4°F
- Heart rate: 108-126 bpm
- Blood pressure: 105/58 mmHg (with fluctuations)
- Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on nasal cannula

The patient has been treated for VAP with piperacillin/tazobactam and vancomycin, which grew Citrobacter, aeromonas, and Staphylococcus aureus. His central line, Foley catheter, and IVC filter have been placed. He has received TPA for lysis of a PE and has had an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placed.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, anemia, elevated lactic acid levels, and renal dysfunction. His coagulation profile is abnormal, with prolonged PT and PTT. The patient's electrolytes and liver function tests are also abnormal.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions. He has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, pain control issues, deep vein thrombosis, electrolyte and fluid disorder, respiratory failure, altered mental status, C. difficile infection, and pulmonary embolism. The patient is on various medications and IV infusions, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's persistent fever and elevated white blood cell count indicate a potential ongoing infection. Close monitoring for signs of worsening infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy is essential.

2. Thromboembolic Events: The presence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism suggests an increased risk of further thromboembolic events. Prophylactic measures such as early mobilization and anticoagulant therapy should be continued to prevent new occurrences.

3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory failure indicates impaired gas exchange. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary. Supportive measures like supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation may be required.

4. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels are deranged. Close monitoring of intake and output, along with regular electrolyte measurements, is crucial. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management is necessary to maintain hemodynamic stability.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old alcoholic with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and recent thrombolysis for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has been diagnosed with submassive PEs, which were treated with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), low molecular weight heparin (lovenox), and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient also has multiple medical complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile infection, volume overload, and renal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrence of PE: Given the patient's history of DVT and recent PE, there is a risk of recurrence, especially while on anticoagulation therapy.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's recent GIB may recur if not properly managed, especially considering the need for anticoagulation once acute issues are resolved.
3. VAP: The patient has been diagnosed with VAP, which requires prompt treatment to prevent further complications.
4. C. difficile infection: The patient has an active C. difficile infection, which should be monitored and treated appropriately to prevent complications such as severe colitis.
5. Volume overload: The patient is experiencing volume overload, which needs to be managed carefully to avoid cardiac issues or worsening renal function.
6. Renal insufficiency: The patient has renal insufficiency,"
