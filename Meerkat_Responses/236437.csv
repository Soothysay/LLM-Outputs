   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of severe pulmonary hypertension and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 136/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 93%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.6 degrees Celsius.

The patient has been receiving various medications including furosemide (Lasix), famotidine (Pepcid), and antibiotics such as vancomycin and ceftriaxone. 

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the episode of desaturation to 88% while on a shovel mask, which did not appear to be related to respiratory distress. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH level of 7.42, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, and PaO2 of 63 mmHg. 

Physical examination reveals an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), occasional rales over the right posterior lung field, decreased breath sounds at the bases (right greater than left), and no lower airway disease. The cardiovascular examination shows an irregular heart rate with a normal rhythm, normal S2, and no murmurs or gallops. The abdomen is soft with no tenderness or guarding, and there are no peripheral edema or clubbing. Neurological"

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with
   altered mental status.
   .
   #  Altered Mental Status: The patient has a postive U/A and urine
   culture growing GNR. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS
   change. Sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her past history.
   Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The patient has no
   seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE. Hypercarbia also
   possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on chronic respiratory
   failure.  Etiology unclear but history of hyperacute change in mental
   status concerning for seizure or acute stroke. Initially, the patient
   had pinpoint pupils, however, narcane for possible opiod toxicity had
   no effect. TSH, RPR, Vit B12, Folate WNL.
   - f/u Neuro consult
   - continue Ceftriaxone for UTI
   - f/u urine & blood cx
   - avoid any sedating meds
   .
   # UTI: Pt with grossly positive UA and mental status changes.  No prior
   culture data, will continue empiric Abx until Cx data available
   - continue Ceftriaxone 1gram IV
   - follow up blood & urine cultures
   .
   #Hypoxia: The patient is likely hyoxemic with an acute on chronic resp.
   acidosis due to her pleural effusion. The desaturations seems
   positional, so likely due to the pleural effusions. The patient might
   also have underlying COPD, but not sure about PMH or smoking history.
   WBC WNL and afebrile, so infection with a parapneumonic effusion less
   likely. Also possibly a PE, but CTA with contrast r/o any PE.
   - consider thoracentesis for therapy and diagnostic purposes. Since INR
   elevated, will give FFP before procedure.
   - culture if spikes and broaden to cover HAP
   - obtain addl records about pleural effusion
   - strict aspiration precautions
   .
   # Diastolic HF: As per [**Hospital1 1031**] records, has diastolic HF. Might be related
   to R>L effusion.
   - Will f/u on old Echo. If cannot obtain, consider Echo.
   - Patient is on home lasix, so will give dose of Lasix to see if
   respiratory status changes.
   - Will check BNP.
   # AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.  Difficult to
   interpret EKG changes given V-paced rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes negative
   so far.
   - will admin Metoprolol prn RVR
   - plan to restart po meds when alert enough to swallow
   - holding on anticoagulation for now given her elevated INR
   # Increased INR: Likely on Coumadin for A.fib
   - Would like to get up to date med list
   - Follow INR. Still elevated. If decide to do thoracentesis, will give
   FFP before.
   # ARF (unsure if acute on chronic): Cr: 1.5
1.3. Likely pre-renal given

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The key findings include:

1. Episode of desaturation to 88% while on a shovel mask, without apparent respiratory distress. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 66, suggesting hypoxemia and potential pulmonary hypertension.

2. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reveals severe pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, dilated and hypocontractile right ventricle, and mildly thickened mitral and tricuspid valve leaflets.

3. The patient has altered mental status, likely due to hypoxemia and possible sepsis or other underlying conditions. 

4. The patient has undergone several interventions, including administration of furosemide (Lasix) and famotidine (Pepcid), as well as placement of an 18-gauge line. 

5. The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure and heart rate but decreased oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 93%. 

6. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Renal function appears to be mildly impaired, with an elevated creatinine level. Electrolyte levels are within normal ranges."

 HYPOXEMIA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with
   altered mental status.
   .
   #Hypoxia: The patient is likely hyoxemic with an acute on chronic resp.
   acidosis due to her pleural effusion. The desaturations seems
   positional, so likely due to the pleural effusions. The patient also
   has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused by the pleural
   effusion. WBC WNL and afebrile, so infection with a parapneumonic
   effusion less likely. Also possibly a PE, but CTA with contrast r/o any
   PE.
   - consider thoracentesis for therapy and diagnostic purposes. Since INR
   elevated, will give FFP before procedure.
   - Obtain Echo records from [**Hospital1 1031**] to determine the chronicity of pulmonary
   hypertension.
   - culture if spikes and broaden to cover HAP
   - strict aspiration precautions
   - Will try CPAP tonight to see if it helps with night hypoxia
   #  Altered Mental Status: The patient has a postive U/A and urine
   culture growing Klebsiella. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS
   change. The patient has waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status changes, likely due
   to UTI. Initially, sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her past
   history. Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The
   patient has no seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE.
   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of
   hyperacute change in mental status was initially concerning for seizure
   or acute stroke. Initially, the patient had pinpoint pupils, however,
   narcane for possible opiod toxicity had no effect. TSH, RPR, Vit B12,
   Folate WNL.
   - f/u Neuro consult
   - continue to treat UTI
   - f/u blood cx
   - avoid any sedating meds
   .
   # UTI: Pt. grew Klebsiella in urine. Has sensitivities
   - Change ceftriaxone to cipro
   - Cipro (started [**2102-6-15**]) Day 3 of 10
   .
   # AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.  Difficult to
   interpret EKG changes given V-paced rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes negative
   so far.
   - Continue PO metoprolol
   - holding on anticoagulation for now given her elevated INR
   # Increased INR: Likely on Coumadin for A.fib
   - Would like to get up to date med list
   - Follow INR. Still elevated. If decide to do thoracentesis, will give
   FFP before.
   # Chronic renal failure: Cr: 1.4. Low UOP.
   -- Continue to trend creatinine

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. She presents with altered mental status and is likely hypoxemic with acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis due to pleural effusion. The patient also has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused by the pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a risk of inadequate oxygen supply to the body tissues. This can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction if not promptly addressed.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis suggests a failure in oxygenation or ventilation. If left untreated, it can progress to severe respiratory failure, leading to decreased oxygenation and carbon dioxide retention.

3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's underlying pulmonary hypertension increases the risk of right ventricular strain and failure. It can lead to inadequate blood flow to the lungs and decreased oxygenation.

4. Tricuspid regurgitation: The patient has moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, which may worsen due to increased right ventricular pressure and volume overload caused by pulmonary hypertension.

5. Right ventricular failure: The patient's dilated and hypocontractile right ventricle suggests a risk of right ventricular failure. This can occur due to the increased workload on the right ventricle caused by pulmonary hypertension and tricus"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOXEMIA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with
   altered mental status, now with hypoxia.
   .
   Acute respiratory distress: Patient had an episode of acute respiratory
   distress. With some support on BiPap, patient breathing more
   comfortably. ABG while in distress showed no increase in pCO2, just her
   baseline chronic respiratory acidosis. CXR showed increased pulmonary
   edema. EKG showed increase in rate of atrial fibrillation. Lactate
   increasing. Acute distress likely due to pulmonary edema secondary to
   diastolic dysfunction. Other possibe etiologies include TRALI (too late
   of onset), pneumothroax (r/o on CXR), aspiration PNA or pneumonitis, or
   mucus plugging.
   --Will give a dose of Lasix IV.
   --Monitor respiratory status and give patient Bipap
   --continue aspiration precautions
   --Will check ABG.
   #Hypoxia: The patient is likely hyoxemic with an acute on chronic resp.
   acidosis due to her pleural effusion. The desaturations seems
   positional, so likely due to the pleural effusions. The patient also
   has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused by chronic
   hypoxia due to pleural effusion. WBC WNL and afebrile, so infection
   with a parapneumonic effusion less likely. Also possibly a PE, but CTA
   with contrast r/o any PE.
   - consider thoracentesis for therapy and diagnostic purposes. Since INR
   elevated, will give FFP and vitamin K before procedure.
   - Obtain Echo records from [**Hospital1 1031**] to determine the chronicity of pulmonary
   hypertension.
   - culture if spikes and broaden to cover HAP
   - strict aspiration precautions
   #  Altered Mental Status: The patient has a postive U/A and urine
   culture growing Klebsiella. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS
   change. The patient has waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status changes, likely due
   to UTI. Initially, sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her past
   history. Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The
   patient has no seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE.
   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of
   hyperacute change in mental status was initially concerning for seizure
   or acute stroke. Initially, the patient had pinpoint pupils, however,
   narcane for possible opiod toxicity had no effect. TSH, RPR, Vit B12,
   Folate WNL.
   - f/u Neuro consult
   - continue to treat UTI
   - f/u blood cx
   - avoid any sedating meds
   - Will start zosyn (start [**2102-6-16**]) and Vanco ([**2102-6-16**])
   .
   # UTI: Pt. grew Klebsiella in urine. Has sensitivities
   - Change ceftriaxone to cipro
   - Cipro (started [**2102-6-15**]) for a 10 day course.
   .
   Diastolic HF: EF 65-70% with no LVH. Has had episodes of flash
   pulmonary edema.
   - Manage HTN
   - Lasix PRN
   - Obtain old echo records
   # AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.  Difficult to
   interpret EKG changes given V-paced rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes negative
   so far.
   - Continue IV metoprolol
   - holding on anticoagulation for now given her elevated INR
   # Increased INR: Likely on Coumadin for A.fib
   - Would like to get up to date med list
   - Follow INR. Still elevated. If decide to do thoracentesis, will give
   FFP before.
   Pulm HTN: New onset pulm HTN since [**Month (only) **]? In [**Hospital1 1031**] D/C summary, there
   was no mention of Pulm HTN. It
s possibly due to chronic hypoxia [**12-19**]
   large pleural effusion on right. Other etiologies like idiopathic (too
   old for onset), PE (ruled out with CTA), and HIV unlikely.
   - Continue O2 requirement
   - Will not pursue medical therapy at this time.
   # Chronic renal failure: Cr: 1.4. Low UOP.
   -- Continue to trend creatinine
   -- start home furosemide. Encourage PO intake

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease post-myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular disease. She presents with altered mental status, now with hypoxia. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient is likely hypoxemic with acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis due to her pleural effusion. Desaturations seem positional, possibly due to the effusions. The patient also has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused by chronic hypoxia from the effusion. White blood cell count is normal, and the patient is afebrile, making infection with a parapneumonic effusion less likely. Also, possibly a pulmonary embolism, but computed tomography angiography (CTA) with contrast ruled out any PE. Consider thoracentesis for therapy and diagnostic purposes. Since the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated, will give fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K before the procedure. Obtain echocardiogram records from [Hospital1 1031] to determine the chronicity of pulmonary hypertension. Culture if spikes and broaden to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Strict aspiration precautions.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. She was admitted with altered mental status and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 161/75 to 192/137 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. She is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery and has been given 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to an elevated INR. The patient's physical examination reveals supple neck, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), labored breathing with wheezing, irregular heart rate, and no murmurs or gallops. Neurological examination shows weakness and withdrawal to sternal rub. The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose, and troponin T levels, while other values are within normal range. The chest X-ray shows increased pleural effusion, perihilar edema, and congestion. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory acidosis, pulmonary hypertension, and possible acute respiratory distress due to pleural effusions. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Klebsiella species identified in the urine culture. The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to the UTI or possibly a"

 HYPOXEMIA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with
   altered mental status.
   .
   Acute respiratory distress: Patient had an episode of acute respiratory
   distress. With some support on BiPap, patient breathing more
   comfortably. ABG while in distress showed no increase in pCO2, just her
   baseline chronic respiratory acidosis. CXR showed increased pulmonary
   edema. EKG showed increase in rate of atrial fibrillation. Lactate
   increasing. Acute distress likely due to pulmonary edema secondary to
   diastolic dysfunction.
   --Will give a dose of Lasix IV.
   --Monitor respiratory status and give patient Bipap
   --Will check ABG.
   #Hypoxia: The patient is likely hyoxemic with an acute on chronic resp.
   acidosis due to her pleural effusion. The desaturations seems
   positional, so likely due to the pleural effusions. The patient also
   has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused by chronic
   hypoxia due to pleural effusion. WBC WNL and afebrile, so infection
   with a parapneumonic effusion less likely. Also possibly a PE, but CTA
   with contrast r/o any PE.
   - consider thoracentesis for therapy and diagnostic purposes. Since INR
   elevated, will give FFP and vitamin K before procedure.
   - Obtain Echo records from [**Hospital1 1031**] to determine the chronicity of pulmonary
   hypertension.
   - culture if spikes and broaden to cover HAP
   - strict aspiration precautions
   - Will try CPAP tonight to see if it helps with night hypoxia
   #  Altered Mental Status: The patient has a postive U/A and urine
   culture growing Klebsiella. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS
   change. The patient has waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status changes, likely due
   to UTI. Initially, sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her past
   history. Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The
   patient has no seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE.
   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of
   hyperacute change in mental status was initially concerning for seizure
   or acute stroke. Initially, the patient had pinpoint pupils, however,
   narcane for possible opiod toxicity had no effect. TSH, RPR, Vit B12,
   Folate WNL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and hypoxemia. The patient received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to an elevated INR of 2.6, which improved to 1.8. The patient also required high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at night to maintain oxygen saturation levels in the high 80s. Restraints were used to manage delirium. The patient has been on CPAP, but it failed, leading to desaturation to the 70s. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 161/75 to 192/137 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius. The patient has been receiving various medications, including famotidine and antibiotics. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and troponin T levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 91 and 156 mg/dL. The patient's potassium, sodium, chloride, and magnesium levels are within normal range. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.27. The patient's physical examination findings are not available. The patient's disposition is as an inpatient in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and elevated troponin T level suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxemia and the need for HFNC indicate a compromised respiratory function, which could progress to ARDS.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and use of restraints suggest delirium, which can be associated with ICU stay and may increase the risk of complications.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of DVT.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient's use of famotidine suggests a concern for stress ulcer development.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged need for respiratory support increases the risk of VAP."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and altered mental status. The patient has been receiving various treatments including non-invasive ventilation, arterial line insertion, and administration of antibiotics and other medications.

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range but there is a slight variation in blood pressure readings. The heart rate and respiratory rate are stable. The patient's oxygen saturation is consistently above 99%.

The patient has received a total of 1,665 mL of blood products and 807 mL of fluids since midnight. The fluid balance shows a negative balance of 858 mL.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a bipap mask, set at CPAP/PSV mode. The tidal volume is 411 mL, peak inspiratory pressure is 18 cmH2O, and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 60%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 49 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 167 mmHg.

The physical examination notes are incomplete, with assessments not performed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and other systems.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, the blood glucose level is elevated at 126 mg/dL."

 HYPOXEMIA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with
   altered mental status, now with hypoxia.
   .
   Hypoxia: Patient not in respiratory distress while on BiPap. Patient
   had an episode of acute respiratory distress on [**6-16**]. With some support
   on BiPap, patient breathing more comfortably. ABG while in distress
   showed no increase in pCO2, just her baseline chronic respiratory
   acidosis. CXR showed increased pulmonary edema. EKG showed increase in
   rate of atrial fibrillation. BNP increased.  Lactate increased during
   acute episode. Acute distress likely due to pulmonary edema secondary
   to diastolic dysfunction. Other possibe etiologies include TRALI (too
   late of onset), pneumothroax (r/o on CXR), aspiration PNA or
   pneumonitis, or mucus plugging. After the acute event, started to cover
   for HAP as well as aspiration PNA. Increased lactate correlated to
   increased respiratory distress and respiratory muscle fatigue. The
   patient
s baseline hypoxia which is not entirely responsive to oxygen
   might be due to cardiac (R
L) shunting, atelectasis of right lobe due
   to pleural effusion, or intrapulmonary shunting.
   --continue lasix gtt with goal of -1L per day.
   --Continue Vanco and Zosyn (both started [**6-16**])
   --continue aspiration precautions
   --Will check ABG and see if patient can wean from BiPap
   --Continue Metoprolol 15 mg q4hr. Manage HTN to decrease any diastolic
   failure. Will give Hydralazine x 1. On nitrates, metoprolol and CCB at
   home. Hesitant to give nitrate because patient is preload dependent.
   #Right pleural effusion: The patient is likely hyoxemic with an acute
   on chronic resp. acidosis due to her pleural effusion. The
   desaturations seems positional, so likely due to the pleural effusions.
   The patient also has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused
   by chronic hypoxia due to pleural effusion. WBC WNL and afebrile, so
   infection with a parapneumonic effusion less likely. Also possibly a
   PE, but CTA with contrast r/o any PE.
   - consider thoracentesis for therapy and diagnostic purposes.
   - Obtain Echo records from [**Hospital1 1031**] to determine the chronicity of pulmonary
   hypertension.
   - strict aspiration precautions
   #  Altered Mental Status: Patient seems to be at her baseline, as per
   HCP. The patient has a postive U/A and urine culture growing
   Klebsiella. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS change. The
   patient has waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status changes, likely due to UTI.
   Initially, sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her past
   history. Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The
   patient has no seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE.
   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of
   hyperacute change in mental status was initially concerning for seizure
   or acute stroke. Initially, the patient had pinpoint pupils, however,
   narcane for possible opiod toxicity had no effect. TSH, RPR, Vit B12,
   Folate WNL.
   - continue to treat UTI
   - f/u blood cx
   - avoid any sedating meds
   - Continue  zosyn (start [**2102-6-16**]) and Vanco ([**2102-6-16**])
   .
   # UTI: Pt. grew Klebsiella in urine. Has sensitivities
   - Will D/C cipro since zosyn covers. Abx course started on [**6-14**] for a
   total of 10 days.
   - f/u repeat urine culture.
   .
   Diastolic HF: EF 65-70% with no LVH. Has had episodes of flash
   pulmonary edema.
   - Manage HTN.
   - Lasix PRN
   - Obtain old echo records
   # AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.  Difficult to
   interpret EKG changes given V-paced rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes negative
   so far.
   - Continue IV metoprolol
   - holding on anticoagulation for now given her elevated INR.
   Pulm HTN: New onset pulm HTN since [**Month (only) **]? In [**Hospital1 1031**] D/C summary, there
   was no mention of Pulm HTN. It
s possibly due to chronic hypoxia [**12-19**]
   large pleural effusion on right. Other etiologies like idiopathic (too
   old for onset), PE (ruled out with CTA), and HIV unlikely.
   - Continue O2 requirement
   - Will not pursue medical therapy at this time.
   # Increased INR: Likely on Coumadin for A.fib
   - Would like to get up to date med list
   # Chronic renal failure: Cr: 1.4. Low UOP.
   -- Continue to trend creatinine
   -- Lasix gtt

 HYPOXEMIA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with
   altered mental status, now with hypoxia.
   .
   HTN: Metoprolol 15 mg IV q 4hr
   Acute respiratory distress: Patient had an episode of acute respiratory
   distress. With some support on BiPap, patient breathing more
   comfortably. ABG while in distress showed no increase in pCO2, just her
   baseline chronic respiratory acidosis. CXR showed increased pulmonary
   edema. EKG showed increase in rate of atrial fibrillation. Lactate
   increasing. Acute distress likely due to pulmonary edema secondary to
   diastolic dysfunction. Other possibe etiologies include TRALI (too late
   of onset), pneumothroax (r/o on CXR), aspiration PNA or pneumonitis, or
   mucus plugging.
   --Will give a dose of Lasix IV.
   --Monitor respiratory status and give patient Bipap
   --continue aspiration precautions
   --Will check ABG.
   #Hypoxia: The patient is likely hyoxemic with an acute on chronic resp.
   acidosis due to her pleural effusion. The desaturations seems
   positional, so likely due to the pleural effusions. The patient also
   has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused by chronic
   hypoxia due to pleural effusion. WBC WNL and afebrile, so infection
   with a parapneumonic effusion less likely. Also possibly a PE, but CTA
   with contrast r/o any PE.
   - consider thoracentesis for therapy and diagnostic purposes. Since INR
   elevated, will give FFP and vitamin K before procedure.
   - Obtain Echo records from [**Hospital1 1031**] to determine the chronicity of pulmonary
   hypertension.
   - culture if spikes and broaden to cover HAP
   - strict aspiration precautions
   #  Altered Mental Status: The patient has a postive U/A and urine
   culture growing Klebsiella. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS
   change. The patient has waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status changes, likely due
   to UTI. Initially, sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her past
   history. Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The
   patient has no seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE.
   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of
   hyperacute change in mental status was initially concerning for seizure
   or acute stroke. Initially, the patient had pinpoint pupils, however,
   narcane for possible opiod toxicity had no effect. TSH, RPR, Vit B12,
   Folate WNL.
   - f/u Neuro consult
   - continue to treat UTI
   - f/u blood cx
   - avoid any sedating meds
   - Will start zosyn (start [**2102-6-16**]) and Vanco ([**2102-6-16**])
   .
   # UTI: Pt. grew Klebsiella in urine. Has sensitivities
   - Change ceftriaxone to cipro
   - Cipro (started [**2102-6-15**]) for a 10 day course.
   .
   Diastolic HF: EF 65-70% with no LVH. Has had episodes of flash
   pulmonary edema.
   - Manage HTN
   - Lasix PRN
   - Obtain old echo records
   # AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.  Difficult to
   interpret EKG changes given V-paced rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes negative
   so far.
   - Continue IV metoprolol
   - holding on anticoagulation for now given her elevated INR
   # Increased INR: Likely on Coumadin for A.fib
   - Would like to get up to date med list
   - Follow INR. Still elevated. If decide to do thoracentesis, will give
   FFP before.
   Pulm HTN: New onset pulm HTN since [**Month (only) **]? In [**Hospital1 1031**] D/C summary, there
   was no mention of Pulm HTN. It
s possibly due to chronic hypoxia [**12-19**]
   large pleural effusion on right. Other etiologies like idiopathic (too
   old for onset), PE (ruled out with CTA), and HIV unlikely.
   - Continue O2 requirement
   - Will not pursue medical therapy at this time.
   # Chronic renal failure: Cr: 1.4. Low UOP.
   -- Continue to trend creatinine
   -- start home furosemide. Encourage PO intake

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. She presents with altered mental status, acute respiratory failure, and hypoxia. The patient has an increased pulmonary edema on chest X-ray and a positive urine culture for Klebsiella. 

The assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to acute distress likely secondary to pulmonary edema caused by diastolic dysfunction. The patient is also diagnosed with hypoxemia, altered mental status, and a urinary tract infection. 

The patient's current medications include metoprolol, furosemide, famotidine, and heparin sodium. She has been started on Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and Vancomycin for her infections. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine and BUN, with a decreased hemoglobin level. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate chronic respiratory acidosis with a slightly elevated pCO2. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 71 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 108/54 mmHg to 189/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 807 mL and output of 1655 mL"

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with
   altered mental status, now with hypoxia.
   .
   Hypoxia: Patient not in respiratory distress while on BiPap. Patient
   had an episode of acute respiratory distress on [**6-16**]. With some support
   on BiPap, patient breathing more comfortably. ABG while in distress
   showed no increase in pCO2, just her baseline chronic respiratory
   acidosis. CXR showed increased pulmonary edema. EKG showed increase in
   rate of atrial fibrillation. BNP increased.  Lactate increased during
   acute episode. Acute distress likely due to pulmonary edema secondary
   to diastolic dysfunction. Other possibe etiologies include TRALI (too
   late of onset), pneumothroax (r/o on CXR), aspiration PNA or
   pneumonitis, or mucus plugging. After the acute event, started to cover
   for HAP as well as aspiration PNA. Increased lactate correlated to
   increased respiratory distress and respiratory muscle fatigue. The
   patient
s baseline hypoxia which is not entirely responsive to oxygen
   might be due to cardiac (R
L) shunting, atelectasis of right lobe due
   to pleural effusion, or intrapulmonary shunting.
   --continue lasix gtt with goal of -1L per day.
   --Continue Vanco and Zosyn (both started [**6-16**])
   --continue aspiration precautions
   --Will check ABG and see if patient can wean from BiPap
   --Continue Metoprolol 15 mg q4hr. Manage HTN to decrease any diastolic
   failure. Will give Hydralazine x 1. On nitrates, metoprolol and CCB at
   home. Hesitant to give nitrate because patient is preload dependent.
   #Right pleural effusion: The patient is likely hyoxemic with an acute
   on chronic resp. acidosis due to her pleural effusion. The
   desaturations seems positional, so likely due to the pleural effusions.
   The patient also has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portion
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8880**]
s note above and
   I agree with his findings and plan of care.  The patient is in the MICU
   primarily for hypoxemia in the setting of changes in mentation likely
   due to Klebsiella UTI.  The hypoxemia is likely due to biventricular
   CHF with R>L pleural effusions and RLL atelectasis, and also due to
   hypercarbia.  An additional shunt through a PFO can
t be excluded,
   given her pulm htn, which is in part from left sided diastolic
   dysfunction.  She has improved with lasix drip with improved
   oxygenation and less effusions on CXR and lower 02 requirement.
   The plan today will be to continue diuresis aiming for 1L negative, and
   to add hydralazine IV for better systemic BP control.  I personally
   [**Male First Name (un) **]
t think a thoracentesis is necessary given that CHF is so likely
   the cause. If she doesn
t continue to improve I would consider low dose
   sildenafil for Rx of pulm htn and afterload reduction on RV.  Despite
   her age and infirmity, she wishes to be full code.

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. She presents with altered mental status and hypoxia. The patient had an episode of acute respiratory distress, which was supported by BiPap and ABG improved. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has a central venous line, arterial line, and urinary catheter in place.

The patient's past medical history includes a myocardial infarction and post-stroke. She has chronic respiratory acidosis due to pleural effusion. The patient has a positive urine culture for Klebsiella, indicating a urinary tract infection. There is also evidence of increased INR, possibly due to Coumadin for atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current medications include lasix, metoprolol, heparin sodium, and famotidine. She has received antibiotics such as ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/54 mmHg to 120/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals poor air entry and bronchial breath sounds over the right posterior field. The abdomen is soft"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 HYPOXEMIA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with
   altered mental status, now with hypoxia.
   .
   Acute respiratory distress: Patient had an episode of acute respiratory
   distress. With some support on BiPap, patient breathing more
   comfortably. ABG while in distress showed no increase in pCO2, just her
   baseline chronic respiratory acidosis. CXR showed increased pulmonary
   edema. EKG showed increase in rate of atrial fibrillation. Lactate
   increasing. Acute distress likely due to pulmonary edema secondary to
   diastolic dysfunction. Other possibe etiologies include TRALI (too late
   of onset), pneumothroax (r/o on CXR), aspiration PNA or pneumonitis, or
   mucus plugging.
   --Will give a dose of Lasix IV.
   --Monitor respiratory status and give patient Bipap
   --continue aspiration precautions
   --Will check ABG.
   #Hypoxia: The patient is likely hyoxemic with an acute on chronic resp.
   acidosis due to her pleural effusion. The desaturations seems
   positional, so likely due to the pleural effusions. The patient also
   has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused by chronic
   hypoxia due to pleural effusion. WBC WNL and afebrile, so infection
   with a parapneumonic effusion less likely. Also possibly a PE, but CTA
   with contrast r/o any PE.
   - consider thoracentesis for therapy and diagnostic purposes. Since INR
   elevated, will give FFP and vitamin K before procedure.
   - Obtain Echo records from [**Hospital1 1031**] to determine the chronicity of pulmonary
   hypertension.
   - culture if spikes and broaden to cover HAP
   - strict aspiration precautions
   #  Altered Mental Status: The patient has a postive U/A and urine
   culture growing Klebsiella. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS
   change. The patient has waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status changes, likely due
   to UTI. Initially, sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her past
   history. Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The
   patient has no seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE.
   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of
   hyperacute change in mental status was initially concerning for seizure
   or acute stroke. Initially, the patient had pinpoint pupils, however,
   narcane for possible opiod toxicity had no effect. TSH, RPR, Vit B12,
   Folate WNL.
   - f/u Neuro consult
   - continue to treat UTI
   - f/u blood cx
   - avoid any sedating meds
   - Will start zosyn (start [**2102-6-16**]) and Vanco ([**2102-6-16**])
   .
   # UTI: Pt. grew Klebsiella in urine. Has sensitivities
   - Change ceftriaxone to cipro
   - Cipro (started [**2102-6-15**]) for a 10 day course.
   .
   Diastolic HF: EF 65-70% with no LVH. Has had episodes of flash
   pulmonary edema.
   - Manage HTN
   - Lasix PRN
   - Obtain old echo records
   # AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.  Difficult to
   interpret EKG changes given V-paced rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes negative
   so far.
   - Continue IV metoprolol
   - holding on anticoagulation for now given her elevated INR
   # Increased INR: Likely on Coumadin for A.fib
   - Would like to get up to date med list
   - Follow INR. Still elevated. If decide to do thoracentesis, will give
   FFP before.
   Pulm HTN: New onset pulm HTN since [**Month (only) **]? In [**Hospital1 1031**] D/C summary, there
   was no mention of Pulm HTN. It
s possibly due to chronic hypoxia [**12-19**]
   large pleural effusion on right. Other etiologies like idiopathic (too
   old for onset), PE (ruled out with CTA), and HIV unlikely.
   - Continue O2 requirement
   - Will not pursue medical therapy at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. She presents with altered mental status and hypoxia. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation support multiple times due to acute respiratory distress, which is likely secondary to pulmonary edema caused by diastolic dysfunction. Other possible etiologies include TRALI, pneumothorax, aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, and mucus plugging. The patient also has a positive urine analysis and culture growing Klebsiella, indicating a urinary tract infection. There are concerns about the possibility of sepsis, acute stroke, or seizures. The patient's altered mental status is also attributed to the UTI. The patient has chronic renal failure and pulmonary hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress and pulmonary edema.
2. Sepsis secondary to Klebsiella urinary tract infection.
3. Stroke or seizures causing altered mental status.
4. Diastolic heart failure leading to flash pulmonary edema.
5. Chronic renal failure with low urine output.
6. Pulmonary hypertension potentially due to chronic hypoxia from pleural effusion."

   .
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with

   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient not in respiratory distress while on BiPap. Patient
   had an episode of acute respiratory distress on [**6-16**]. With some support
   on BiPap, patient breathing more comfortably. ABG while in distress
   showed no increase in pCO2, just her baseline chronic respiratory
   acidosis. CXR showed increased pulmonary edema. EKG showed increase in
   rate of atrial fibrillation. BNP increased.  Lactate increased during
   acute episode. Acute distress likely due to pulmonary edema secondary
   to diastolic dysfunction. Other possibe etiologies include TRALI (too
   late of onset), pneumothroax (r/o on CXR), aspiration PNA or
   pneumonitis, or mucus plugging. After the acute event, started to cover
   for HAP as well as aspiration PNA. Increased lactate correlated to
   increased respiratory distress and respiratory muscle fatigue. The
   patient
s baseline hypoxia which is not entirely responsive to oxygen
   might be due to cardiac (R
L) shunting, atelectasis of right lobe due
   to pleural effusion, or intrapulmonary shunting.
   --continue lasix gtt with goal of -500cc per day.
   --Will d/c vanc/zosyn today since no e/o PNA
   --continue aspiration precautions
   --Will check ABG and see if patient can withstand facemask during day

   --Continue IV Metoprolol 15 mg q4hr. On nitrates, metoprolol and CCB at
   home.
   --[**Month (only) **] IV hydral 10q6 to 5q6
   .
   #Right pleural effusion: The patient is likely hyoxemic with an acute
   on chronic resp. acidosis due to her pleural effusion. The
   desaturations seems positional, so likely due to the pleural effusions.
   The patient also has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused
   by chronic hypoxia due to pleural effusion. WBC WNL and afebrile, so
   infection with a parapneumonic effusion less likely. PE r/o with CTA.
   Also pt
s INR has recently been >1.5 so no [**Female First Name (un) 217**] due to risk for
   hemothorax.
   - consider thoracentesis for therapy and diagnostic purposes.
   - Obtain Echo records from [**Hospital1 1031**] to determine the chronicity of pulmonary
   hypertension.
   - strict aspiration precautions
   .
   #  Altered Mental Status: Patient seems to be at her baseline (AOx2),
   as per HCP. The patient has a postive U/A and urine culture growing
   Klebsiella. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS change. The
   patient has waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status changes, likely due to UTI.
   Initially, sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her past
   history. Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The
   patient has no seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE.
   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of
   hyperacute change in mental status was initially concerning for seizure
   or acute stroke. Initially, the patient had pinpoint pupils, however,
   narcane for possible opiod toxicity had no effect. TSH, RPR, Vit B12,
   Folate WNL.
   - continue to treat UTI
   - f/u blood cx
   - avoid any sedating meds
   - D/C vanc/zosyn today since no e/o PNA, will resume cipro for UTI
   .
   # UTI: Pt. grew Klebsiella in urine. Has sensitivities. Repeat UCx neg.
   - D/C vanc/zosyn today since no e/o PNA, will resume cipro. Abx course
   started on [**6-14**] for a total of 10 days.
   .
   #Diastolic HF: EF 65-70% with no LVH. Has had episodes of flash
   pulmonary edema. On nitrates, metoprolol and CCB at home.
   - Manage HTN.
   - Lasix gtt
   - Obtain old echo records
   .
   # AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.  Difficult to
   interpret EKG changes given V-paced rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes negative
   so far.
   - Continue IV metoprolol
   - holding on anticoagulation for now given her recently elevated INR
   and poss need for [**Female First Name (un) 217**].
   .
   #Pulm HTN: New onset pulm HTN since [**Month (only) **]? In [**Hospital1 1031**] D/C summary, there
   was no mention of Pulm HTN. It
s possibly due to chronic hypoxia [**12-19**]

   - Continue O2 requirement
   - Will not pursue medical therapy at this time.
   # Increased INR: Likely on Coumadin for A.fib
   - Would like to get up to date med list
   # Chronic renal failure: Cr: 1.4. Low UOP.

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided. I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 347**]
s note and agree
   with his findings and plan of care.
   The patient continues to diurese on lasix drip and while she is holding
   her own froma resp status (7.47/44/60 on 60% mask) there is no
   appreciable change in her large right pleural effusion on CXR or exam.
   While I still believe her effusion to be due to biventricular CHF, it
   seems increasingly reasonable to do thoracentesis to improve work of
   breathing and RLL atelectasis, while also ruling out alternative
   diagnoses.  We
ll aim to do this tomorrow, and meanwhile continue lasix
   to achieve I/O neg 500cc today.
   Without evidence of pneumonia (though one can
t see RLL) I concur with
   d/c of vanco and zosyn and continuing cipro.
   HTN is under better control today with continued diuresis and so we
   decrease Hydralazine dose.
   Her ultimate success and survival will depend in part on her strength
   and nutrition.  We
ll advance diet to full liquids during the day, with
   the expectation that she
ll use BIPAP at night during sleep.
   We hope to have family mtg today. It seems to me that DNR status is
   reasonable in the event of CPA. This would still allow for intubation
   should the patient really desire this.   However right now the pt is a
   full code.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. She presented with altered mental status and hypoxia. The patient experienced an acute episode of respiratory distress on 06/16, which was likely due to pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction. Other possible etiologies include TRALI, pneumothorax, aspiration pneumonia, or mucus plugging. She was started on antibiotics to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia. The patient's baseline hypoxia, not entirely responsive to oxygen, might be due to cardiac right-to-left shunting, atelectasis of the right lobe due to pleural effusion, or intrapulmonary shunting.

The patient also has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypoxemia, and altered mental status (not delirium). She has a positive urine culture growing Klebsiella, indicating a urinary tract infection. The patient's altered mental status might be due to the UTI, and she is being treated for it.

Other findings include a right pleural effusion, which is likely hypoxemic with an acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis due to the pleural effusion. The desaturations seem positional, suggesting that the pleural effusion is causing the hypoxemia. The patient has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused by chronic hypoxia due to the ple"

   # Hypoxia: Patient not in respiratory distress while on BiPap. Patient
   had an episode of acute respiratory distress on [**6-16**]. With some support
   on BiPap, patient breathing more comfortably. ABG while in distress
   showed no increase in pCO2, just her baseline chronic respiratory
   acidosis. CXR showed increased pulmonary edema. EKG showed increase in
   rate of atrial fibrillation. BNP increased.  Lactate increased during
   acute episode. Acute distress likely due to pulmonary edema secondary
   to diastolic dysfunction. Other possibe etiologies include TRALI (too
   late of onset), pneumothroax (r/o on CXR), aspiration PNA or
   pneumonitis, or mucus plugging. After the acute event, started to cover
   for HAP as well as aspiration PNA. Increased lactate correlated to
   increased respiratory distress and respiratory muscle fatigue. The
   patient
s baseline hypoxia which is not entirely responsive to oxygen
   might be due to cardiac (R
L) shunting, atelectasis of right lobe due
   to pleural effusion, or intrapulmonary shunting.
   --continue lasix gtt with goal of -1L per day.
   --Continue Vanco and Zosyn (both started [**6-16**])
   --continue aspiration precautions
   --Will check ABG and see if patient can wean from BiPap
   --Continue IV Metoprolol 15 mg q4hr. On nitrates, metoprolol and CCB at
   home.
   --cont IV hydral 10q6
   .
   #Right pleural effusion: The patient is likely hyoxemic with an acute
   on chronic resp. acidosis due to her pleural effusion. The
   desaturations seems positional, so likely due to the pleural effusions.
   The patient also has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused
   by chronic hypoxia due to pleural effusion. WBC WNL and afebrile, so
   infection with a parapneumonic effusion less likely. PE r/o with CTA.
   Also pt
s INR has recently been >1.5 so no [**Female First Name (un) 217**] due to risk for
   hemothorax.
   - consider thoracentesis for therapy and diagnostic purposes.
   - Obtain Echo records from [**Hospital1 1031**] to determine the chronicity of pulmonary
   hypertension.
   - strict aspiration precautions
   .
   #  Altered Mental Status: Patient seems to be at her baseline, as per
   HCP. The patient has a postive U/A and urine culture growing
   Klebsiella. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS change. The
   patient has waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status changes, likely due to UTI.
   Initially, sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her past
   history. Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The
   patient has no seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE.
   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of
   hyperacute change in mental status was initially concerning for seizure
   or acute stroke. Initially, the patient had pinpoint pupils, however,
   narcane for possible opiod toxicity had no effect. TSH, RPR, Vit B12,
   Folate WNL.
   - continue to treat UTI
   - f/u blood cx
   - avoid any sedating meds
   - Continue  zosyn (start [**2102-6-16**]) and Vanco ([**2102-6-16**])

   # UTI: Pt. grew Klebsiella in urine. Has sensitivities. Repeat UCx neg.
   - Will D/C cipro since zosyn covers. Abx course started on [**6-14**] for a
   total of 10 days.
   - Continue  zosyn (start [**2102-6-16**]) and Vanco ([**2102-6-16**])
   .
   #Diastolic HF: EF 65-70% with no LVH. Has had episodes of flash
   pulmonary edema. On nitrates, metoprolol and CCB at home.
   - Manage HTN.
   - Lasix gtt
   - Obtain old echo records
   # AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.  Difficult to
   interpret EKG changes given V-paced rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes negative
   so far.
   - Continue IV metoprolol
   - holding on anticoagulation for now given her recently elevated INR
   and poss need for [**Female First Name (un) 217**].

 HYPOXEMIA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with
   altered mental status, now with hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient not in respiratory distress while on BiPap. Patient
   had an episode of acute respiratory distress on [**6-16**]. With some support
   on BiPap, patient breathing more comfortably. ABG while in distress
   showed no increase in pCO2, just her baseline chronic respiratory
   acidosis. CXR showed increased pulmonary edema. EKG showed increase in
   rate of atrial fibrillation. BNP increased.  Lactate increased during
   acute episode. Acute distress likely due to pulmonary edema secondary
   to diastolic dysfunction. Other possibe etiologies include TRALI (too
   late of onset), pneumothroax (r/o on CXR), aspiration PNA or
   pneumonitis, or mucus plugging. After the acute event, started to cover
   for HAP as well as aspiration PNA. Increased lactate correlated to
   increased respiratory distress and respiratory muscle fatigue. The
   patient
s baseline hypoxia which is not entirely responsive to oxygen
   might be due to cardiac (R
L) shunting, atelectasis of right lobe due
   to pleural effusion, or intrapulmonary shunting.
   --discontinue lasix in light of elevated creatinine, keep at even fluid
   balance today
   -- vanc/zosyn discontinued because no evidence of PNA
   --continue aspiration precautions
   --check ABG  to assess oxygenation
 facemask during day, BIPAP at
   night
   --continue IV Metoprolol 15 mg q4hr
   .
   #Right pleural effusion: The patient is likely hyoxemic with an acute
   on chronic resp acidosis due to her pleural effusion. The desaturations
   seems positional, so likely due to the pleural effusions. The patient
   also has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused by chronic
   hypoxia due to pleural effusion. WBC WNL and afebrile, so infection
   with a parapneumonic effusion less likely. PE r/o with CTA. INR 1.2,
   can be considered for thoracentesis
   - therapeutic and diagnostic thoracentesis today
   - Obtain Echo records from [**Hospital1 1031**] to determine the chronicity of pulmonary
   hypertension.
   - strict aspiration precautions
   .
   #  Altered Mental Status: Patient seems to be at her baseline (AOx2),
   as per HCP. The patient has a postive U/A and urine culture growing
   Klebsiella. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS change. The
   patient has waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status changes, likely due to UTI.
   Initially, sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her past
   history. Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The
   patient has no seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE.
   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of
   hyperacute change in mental status was initially concerning for seizure
   or acute stroke. Initially, the patient had pinpoint pupils, however,
   narcane for possible opiod toxicity had no effect. TSH, RPR, Vit B12,
   Folate WNL.
   - continue cipro, started [**6-14**] (day 6 of 10 day treatment)
   - f/u blood cx
   - avoid any sedating meds
   .
   # UTI: Pt. grew Klebsiella in urine. Has sensitivities. Repeat UCx neg.
   -  continue cipro. Abx course started on [**6-14**] for a total of 10 days.
   .
   #Diastolic HF: EF 65-70% with no LVH. Has had episodes of flash
   pulmonary edema. On nitrates, metoprolol and CCB at home.
   - Manage HTN.
   - Obtain old echo records
   .
   # AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.  Difficult to
   interpret EKG changes given V-paced rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes negative
   so far.
   - Continue IV metoprolol
   - can restart anticoagulation after thoracentesis
   .
   # Pulm HTN: New onset pulm HTN since [**Month (only) **]? In [**Hospital1 1031**] D/C summary,
   there was no mention of Pulm HTN. It
s possibly due to chronic hypoxia
   [**12-19**] large pleural effusion on right. Other etiologies like idiopathic
   (too old for onset), PE (ruled out with CTA), and HIV unlikely.
   - Continue O2 requirement
   - Will not pursue medical therapy at this time.
   # Increased INR: INR down to 1.2 today
   - will restart anticoagulation after thoracentesis
   # Chronic renal failure: Cr: 1.8. Low UOP.
   -- Continue to trend creatinine
   -- renally dose medications.
   # Hypokalemia
   - replete potassium, 60 mEq
   # Nutrition
   - nutrition consult
   - give 1 L D5W today, aim to keep fluid balance even
   - recheck electrolytes

   Ms. [**Known lastname 9191**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo deaf, Russian speaking female with a history
   of A. fib (on coumadin), multiple CVAs, diastolic heart failure, and
   pulmonary HTN presenting with AMS. She was found to have a Klebsiella
   UTI and her mental status improved with treatment. While in the ICU,
   she has had frequent desats, likely due to her right sided pleural
   effusion. She had an episode of respiratory distress on [**6-16**], most
   likely due to flash pulmonary edema [**12-19**] her diastolic heart failure.
   After that episode, a Lasix gtt was initiated to diurese her. Poor
   oxygenation continues to be a problem and currently unsure if her
   right>left sided pleural effusion will be tapped for
   diagnostic/therapeutic purposes.

   showed no increase in pCO2, just her baseline chronic respiratory
   acidosis. CXR showed increased pulmonary edema. EKG showed increase in
   rate of atrial fibrillation. BNP increased.  Lactate increased during
   acute episode. Acute distress likely due to pulmonary edema secondary
   to diastolic dysfunction. Other possibe etiologies include TRALI (too
   late of onset), pneumothroax (r/o on CXR), aspiration PNA or
   pneumonitis, or mucus plugging. After the acute event, started to cover
   for HAP as well as aspiration PNA. Increased lactate correlated to
   increased respiratory distress and respiratory muscle fatigue. The
   patient
s baseline hypoxia which is not entirely responsive to oxygen
   might be due to cardiac (R
L) shunting, atelectasis of right lobe due
   to pleural effusion, or intrapulmonary shunting.
   --continue lasix gtt with goal of -500cc per day.
   --Will d/c vanc/zosyn today since no e/o PNA
   --continue aspiration precautions
   --Will check ABG and see if patient can withstand facemask during day

 HYPOXEMIA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Ms. [**Known lastname 9191**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo deaf, Russian speaking female with a history
   of A. fib (on coumadin), multiple CVAs, diastolic heart failure, and
   pulmonary HTN presenting with AMS. She was found to have a Klebsiella
   UTI and her mental status improved with treatment. While in the ICU,
   she has had frequent desats, likely due to her right sided pleural
   effusion. She had an episode of respiratory distress on [**6-16**], most
   likely due to flash pulmonary edema [**12-19**] her diastolic heart failure.
   After that episode, a Lasix gtt was initiated to diurese her. Poor
   oxygenation continues to be a problem and currently unsure if her
   right>left sided pleural effusion will be tapped for
   diagnostic/therapeutic purposes.
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with
   altered mental status, now with hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient not in respiratory distress while on BiPap. Patient
   had an episode of acute respiratory distress on [**6-16**]. With some support
   on BiPap, patient breathing more comfortably. ABG while in distress
   showed no increase in pCO2, just her baseline chronic respiratory
   acidosis. CXR showed increased pulmonary edema. EKG showed increase in
   rate of atrial fibrillation. BNP increased.  Lactate increased during
   acute episode. Acute distress likely due to pulmonary edema secondary
   to diastolic dysfunction. Other possibe etiologies include TRALI (too
   late of onset), pneumothroax (r/o on CXR), aspiration PNA or
   pneumonitis, or mucus plugging. After the acute event, started to cover
   for HAP as well as aspiration PNA. Increased lactate correlated to
   increased respiratory distress and respiratory muscle fatigue. The
   patient
s baseline hypoxia which is not entirely responsive to oxygen
   might be due to cardiac (R
L) shunting, atelectasis of right lobe due
   to pleural effusion, or intrapulmonary shunting.
   --continue lasix gtt with goal of -500cc per day.
   --Will d/c vanc/zosyn today since no e/o PNA
   --continue aspiration precautions
   --Will check ABG and see if patient can withstand facemask during day
   and BIPAP overnight
   --Continue IV Metoprolol 15 mg q4hr. On nitrates, metoprolol and CCB at
   home.
   --[**Month (only) **] IV hydral 10q6 to 5q6
   .
   #Right pleural effusion: The patient is likely hyoxemic with an acute
   on chronic resp. acidosis due to her pleural effusion. The
   desaturations seems positional, so likely due to the pleural effusions.
   The patient also has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused
   by chronic hypoxia due to pleural effusion. WBC WNL and afebrile, so
   infection with a parapneumonic effusion less likely. PE r/o with CTA.
   Also pt
s INR has recently been >1.5 so no [**Female First Name (un) 217**] due to risk for
   hemothorax.
   - consider thoracentesis for therapy and diagnostic purposes.
   - Obtain Echo records from [**Hospital1 1031**] to determine the chronicity of pulmonary
   hypertension.
   - strict aspiration precautions
   .
   #  Altered Mental Status: Patient seems to be at her baseline (AOx2),
   as per HCP. The patient has a postive U/A and urine culture growing
   Klebsiella. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS change. The
   patient has waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status changes, likely due to UTI.
   Initially, sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her past
   history. Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The
   patient has no seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE.
   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of
   hyperacute change in mental status was initially concerning for seizure
   or acute stroke. Initially, the patient had pinpoint pupils, however,
   narcane for possible opiod toxicity had no effect. TSH, RPR, Vit B12,
   Folate WNL.
   - continue to treat UTI
   - f/u blood cx
   - avoid any sedating meds
   - D/C vanc/zosyn today since no e/o PNA, will resume cipro for UTI
   .
   # UTI: Pt. grew Klebsiella in urine. Has sensitivities. Repeat UCx neg.
   - D/C vanc/zosyn today since no e/o PNA, will resume cipro. Abx course
   started on [**6-14**] for a total of 10 days.
   .
   #Diastolic HF: EF 65-70% with no LVH. Has had episodes of flash
   pulmonary edema. On nitrates, metoprolol and CCB at home.
   - Manage HTN.
   - Lasix gtt
   - Obtain old echo records
   .
   # AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.  Difficult to
   interpret EKG changes given V-paced rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes negative
   so far.
   - Continue IV metoprolol
   - holding on anticoagulation for now given her recently elevated INR
   and poss need for [**Female First Name (un) 217**].
   .
   #Pulm HTN: New onset pulm HTN since [**Month (only) **]? In [**Hospital1 1031**] D/C summary, there
   was no mention of Pulm HTN. It
s possibly due to chronic hypoxia [**12-19**]
   large pleural effusion on right. Other etiologies like idiopathic (too
   old for onset), PE (ruled out with CTA), and HIV unlikely.
   - Continue O2 requirement
   - Will not pursue medical therapy at this time.
   # Increased INR: Likely on Coumadin for A.fib
   - Would like to get up to date med list
   # Chronic renal failure: Cr: 1.4. Low UOP.
   -- Continue to trend creatinine
   -- Lasix gtt

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, multiple cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), diastolic heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. She presented with altered mental status (AMS) and was found to have a Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI), which improved with treatment. The patient experienced an episode of acute respiratory distress on 06/16, likely due to flash pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction. She continues to have hypoxemia, which is not entirely responsive to oxygen therapy and may be due to cardiac shunting, atelectasis of the right lobe caused by a pleural effusion, or intrapulmonary shunting.

The patient also has impaired skin integrity and altered mental status, which was initially concerning for a seizure or acute stroke but is now believed to be due to the UTI. Other potential etiologies include TRALI (too late of onset), pneumothorax (ruled out on chest X-ray), aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, or mucus plugging.

The patient has a large right pleural effusion, which is likely contributing to her hypoxemia. The etiology of the effusion is unclear, but infection is less likely given normal white blood cell count and absence of fever. The patient's INR has been elevated, which has delayed the decision for thoracentesis due to the risk of hemothorax"

   acidosis. CXR showed increased pulmonary edema. EKG showed increase in
   rate of atrial fibrillation. BNP increased.  Lactate increased during
   acute episode. Acute distress likely due to pulmonary edema secondary
   to diastolic dysfunction. Other possibe etiologies include TRALI (too
   late of onset), pneumothroax (r/o on CXR), aspiration PNA or
   pneumonitis, or mucus plugging. After the acute event, started to cover
   for HAP as well as aspiration PNA. Increased lactate correlated to
   increased respiratory distress and respiratory muscle fatigue. The

   to pleural effusion, or intrapulmonary shunting.

   The patient also has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused
   by chronic hypoxia due to pleural effusion. WBC WNL and afebrile, so
   infection with a parapneumonic effusion less likely. PE r/o with CTA.

   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, multiple cardiovascular accidents (CVAs), diastolic heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted with altered mental status, which improved with treatment of a Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI). She continues to experience frequent desaturations due to a right-sided pleural effusion. The patient had an episode of acute respiratory distress on [6-16], likely due to flash pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction. Other possible etiologies include TRALI, pneumothorax, aspiration pneumonia, or mucus plugging. She has been receiving Lasix gtt to diurese and cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and aspiration pneumonia. Her baseline hypoxia may be due to cardiac shunting, atelectasis of the right lobe due to pleural effusion, or intrapulmonary shunting.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Impaired skin integrity
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
3. Hypoxemia
4. Altered mental status (not delirium)

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's frequent desaturations and baseline hypoxia may lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as hypoxic brain injury or cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Pleural effusion: The large right-sided pleural effusion could worsen the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient presents with altered mental status, now with hypoxia. The patient has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, acute hypoxemia, and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition includes right pleural effusion, chronic respiratory acidosis, pulmonary hypertension, and a positive urine analysis with Klebsiella infection. The patient's mental status changes are likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) and not related to seizures or acute stroke. The patient's diastolic heart failure is managed with nitrates, metoprolol, and calcium channel blockers at home.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently paced, and cardiac enzymes are negative. There is a possibility of pulmonary hypertension due to chronic hypoxia from the large pleural effusion on the right side. The patient's increased INR is likely due to Coumadin use for atrial fibrillation.

The patient also has chronic renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.4 and low urine output per day. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical conditions and potential complications are as follows:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is not able to provide a history and shows signs of encephalopathy.

2. Pleural effusion: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions with a right-sided predominance. This may be related to fluid overload and could potentially lead to complications such as infection or respiratory distress if not managed appropriately.

3. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is not consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The respiratory status and oxygenation are improving with diuresis, indicating that fluid overload may be contributing to the respiratory distress.

4. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which could be secondary to the pleural effusions or underlying chronic lung disease.

5. Impaired skin integrity: There is no mention of any specific skin issues in the provided information.

6. Hypernatremia: The patient has elevated serum sodium levels, likely due to diuresis. This needs to be managed with free water repletion to prevent dehydration.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with
   altered mental status thought to be due to UTI, admitted for hypoxia
   with finding of right pleural effusion
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient had episode of respiratory distress, wheezing, and
   tachycardia overnight which responded to nebs, nitropaste, and lasix.
   Peripheral O2 sat was 99, but add on blood gas saturation returned at
   84.   Patient also had an episode of acute respiratory distress on [**6-16**]
   for which BiPap was started.  With support on BiPap, patient breathing
   more comfortably. ABG while in distress showed no increase in pCO2,
   just her baseline chronic respiratory acidosis. CXR showed increased
   pulmonary edema. EKG showed increase in rate of atrial fibrillation.
   BNP increased.  Lactate increased during acute episode. Acute distress
   likely due to pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction. Other
   possibe etiologies include TRALI (too late of onset), pneumothroax (r/o
   on CXR), aspiration PNA or pneumonitis, or mucus plugging. After the
   acute event, started to cover for HAP as well as aspiration PNA.
   Increased lactate correlated to increased respiratory distress and
   respiratory muscle fatigue. The patient
s baseline hypoxia which is not
   entirely responsive to oxygen might be due to cardiac (R
L) shunting,
   atelectasis of right lobe due to pleural effusion, or intrapulmonary
   shunting.
   --restart lasix, keep at one liter negative today
   --continue aspiration precautions
   --check ABG  to assess oxygenation
 facemask during day, BIPAP at
   night
   --continue IV Metoprolol 15 mg q4hr
   --restart home Imdur
   --nebs PRN
   --pulmonary toilet
   .
   #Right pleural effusion: The patient is likely hypoxemic with an acute
   on chronic resp acidosis due to her pleural effusion. The desaturations
   seems positional, so likely due to the pleural effusions. The patient
   also has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused by chronic
   hypoxia due to pleural effusion. WBC WNL and afebrile, so infection
   with a parapneumonic effusion less likely. PE r/o with CTA.  Ultrasound
   performed yesterday showed not enough fluid to tap.
   - Obtain Echo records from [**Hospital1 1031**] to determine the chronicity of pulmonary
   hypertension.
   .
   #  Altered Mental Status: Patient seems to be at her baseline (AOx2),
   as per HCP. The patient had a postive U/A and urine culture growing
   Klebsiella. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS change. The
   patient has waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status changes, likely due to UTI.
   Initially, sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her past
   history. Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The
   patient has no seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE.
   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of
   hyperacute change in mental status was initially concerning for seizure
   or acute stroke. Initially, the patient had pinpoint pupils, however,
   narcane for possible opiod toxicity had no effect. TSH, RPR, Vit B12,
   Folate WNL.
   - continue cipro, started [**6-14**] (day 7 of 10 day treatment)
   - f/u blood cx
   - avoid sedating meds
   .
   # UTI: Pt. grew Klebsiella in urine. Has sensitivities. Repeat UCx neg.
   -  continue cipro. Abx course started on [**6-14**] for a total of 10 days.
   .
   #Diastolic HF: EF 65-70% with no LVH. Has had episodes of flash
   pulmonary edema. On nitrates, metoprolol and CCB at home.
   - Manage HTN
   - check cardiac markers given episode of respiratory distress last
   night
   .
   # AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.  Difficult to
   interpret EKG changes given V-paced rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes negative
   so far.
   - Continue IV metoprolol
   - restart anticoagulation today if no procedures planned
   .
   # Pulm HTN: New onset pulm HTN since [**Month (only) **]? In [**Hospital1 1031**] D/C summary,
   there was no mention of Pulm HTN. It
s possibly due to chronic hypoxia
   [**12-19**] large pleural effusion on right. Other etiologies like idiopathic
   (too old for onset), PE (ruled out with CTA), and HIV unlikely.  Will
   not pursue medical therapy at this time other than BP control.
   - Continue O2 requirement
   # Increased INR: INR down to 1.2 today
   - restart anticoagluation if no other procedures planned
   # Chronic renal failure: Cr: 1.6 today, improved from 1.8 yesterday
   -- Continue to trend creatinine
   -- monitor ins and outs
   -- renally dose medications
   # Hypokalemia
 repleted yesterday, 3.6 today
   - replete K today since will be restarting lasix
   - monitor electrolytes
   # Nutrition
   - diet advanced to pureed diet with soft dysphagia as per nutrition

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with
   altered mental status thought to be due to UTI, admitted for hypoxia
   with finding of right pleural effusion
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient had episode of respiratory distress, wheezing, and
   tachycardia overnight which responded to nebs, nitropaste, and lasix.
   Peripheral O2 sat was 99, but add on blood gas saturation returned at
   84.   Patient also had an episode of acute respiratory distress on [**6-16**]
   for which BiPap was started.  With support on BiPap, patient breathing
   more comfortably. ABG while in distress showed no increase in pCO2,
   just her baseline chronic respiratory acidosis. CXR showed increased
   pulmonary edema. EKG showed increase in rate of atrial fibrillation.
   BNP increased.  Lactate increased during acute episode. Acute distress
   likely due to pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction. Other
   possibe etiologies include TRALI (too late of onset), pneumothroax (r/o
   on CXR), aspiration PNA or pneumonitis, or mucus plugging. After the
   acute event, started to cover for HAP as well as aspiration PNA.
   Increased lactate correlated to increased respiratory distress and
   respiratory muscle fatigue. The patient
s baseline hypoxia which is not
   entirely responsive to oxygen might be due to cardiac (R
L) shunting,
   atelectasis of right lobe due to pleural effusion, or intrapulmonary
   shunting.
   --discontinue lasix in light of elevated creatinine, keep at even fluid
   balance today
   --continue aspiration precautions
   --check ABG  to assess oxygenation
 facemask during day, BIPAP at
   night
   --continue IV Metoprolol 15 mg q4hr
   .
   #Right pleural effusion: The patient is likely hypoxemic with an acute
   on chronic resp acidosis due to her pleural effusion. The desaturations
   seems positional, so likely due to the pleural effusions. The patient
   also has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused by chronic
   hypoxia due to pleural effusion. WBC WNL and afebrile, so infection
   with a parapneumonic effusion less likely. PE r/o with CTA.  Ultrasound
   performed yesterday showed not enough fluid to tap.
   - Obtain Echo records from [**Hospital1 1031**] to determine the chronicity of pulmonary
   hypertension.
   .
   #  Altered Mental Status: Patient seems to be at her baseline (AOx2),
   as per HCP. The patient had a postive U/A and urine culture growing
   Klebsiella. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS change. The
   patient has waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status changes, likely due to UTI.
   Initially, sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her past
   history. Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The
   patient has no seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE.
   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of
   hyperacute change in mental status was initially concerning for seizure
   or acute stroke. Initially, the patient had pinpoint pupils, however,
   narcane for possible opiod toxicity had no effect. TSH, RPR, Vit B12,
   Folate WNL.
   - continue cipro, started [**6-14**] (day 7 of 10 day treatment)
   - f/u blood cx
   - avoid any sedating meds
   .
   # UTI: Pt. grew Klebsiella in urine. Has sensitivities. Repeat UCx neg.
   -  continue cipro. Abx course started on [**6-14**] for a total of 10 days.
   .
   #Diastolic HF: EF 65-70% with no LVH. Has had episodes of flash
   pulmonary edema. On nitrates, metoprolol and CCB at home.
   - Manage HTN
   - Obtain old echo records
   .
   # AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.  Difficult to
   interpret EKG changes given V-paced rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes negative
   so far.
   - Continue IV metoprolol
   - restart anticoagulation today
   .
   # Pulm HTN: New onset pulm HTN since [**Month (only) **]? In [**Hospital1 1031**] D/C summary,
   there was no mention of Pulm HTN. It
s possibly due to chronic hypoxia
   [**12-19**] large pleural effusion on right. Other etiologies like idiopathic
   (too old for onset), PE (ruled out with CTA), and HIV unlikely.
   - Continue O2 requirement
   - Will not pursue medical therapy at this time.
   # Increased INR: INR down to 1.2 today
   - restart anticoagluation
   # Chronic renal failure: Cr: 1.6 today, improved from 1.8 yesterday
   -- Continue to trend creatinine

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient had an episode of respiratory distress, wheezing, and tachycardia overnight, which improved with nebs (nebulized treatments), nitropaste, and Lasix 40 IV. SBP 169/134, UOP 365cc since Lasix given.

2. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 C (97.5%), heart rate of 85 bpm (71-88), blood pressure of 159/71 mmHg (106/45-169/75), respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (19-28), and oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow nebulization.

3. The patient's lungs showed poor air entry and bronchial breath sounds over the right posterior field. The cardiovascular examination revealed an irregular rate with a normal rhythm, normal S2, no murmurs, regurgitation, or gallop.

4. The abdomen was soft with normal tendon and bowel sounds present, no rebound or guarding. There were no extremity edemas or clubbing noted. Neurological examination showed weak gag reflex and withdrawal to sternal rub.

5. Laboratory results indicated elevated white blood cell count (K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (g/dL), increased potassium (mg/dL), decreased bicarbonate (mEq/L), elevated blood urea nitrogen"

   #  Altered Mental Status: Patient seems to be at her baseline (AOx2),
   as per HCP. The patient had a postive U/A and urine culture growing
   Klebsiella. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS change. The
   patient has waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status changes, likely due to UTI.
   Initially, sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her past
   history. Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The
   patient has no seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE.
   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of
   hyperacute change in mental status was initially concerning for seizure
   or acute stroke. Initially, the patient had pinpoint pupils, however,
   narcane for possible opiod toxicity had no effect. TSH, RPR, Vit B12,
   Folate WNL.

   # UTI: Pt. grew Klebsiella in urine. Has sensitivities. Repeat UCx neg.
   -  continue cipro. Abx course started on [**6-14**] for a total of 10 days.

   #Diastolic HF: EF 65-70% with no LVH. Has had episodes of flash
   pulmonary edema. On nitrates, metoprolol and CCB at home.
   - Manage HTN
   - Obtain old echo records
   .
   # AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.  Difficult to
   interpret EKG changes given V-paced rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes negative
   so far.
   - Continue IV metoprolol
   - restart anticoagulation today
   .
   # Pulm HTN: New onset pulm HTN since [**Month (only) **]? In [**Hospital1 1031**] D/C summary,
   there was no mention of Pulm HTN. It
s possibly due to chronic hypoxia
   [**12-19**] large pleural effusion on right. Other etiologies like idiopathic
   (too old for onset), PE (ruled out with CTA), and HIV unlikely.
   - Continue O2 requirement

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease post-myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient presented with altered mental status thought to be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI), admitted for hypoxia with findings of right pleural effusion. 

The patient experienced an episode of respiratory distress overnight, characterized by wheezing, tachycardia, and hypertension, which improved with nebulizers (nebs), nitropaste, and Lasix. The peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 99%, but the arterial blood gas (ABG) saturation was 84%. The patient also had an episode of acute respiratory distress on [6-16] for which BiPap was initiated, and the patient's breathing improved. The ABG during the distress showed no increase in pCO2, just her baseline chronic respiratory acidosis. The chest X-ray (CXR) revealed increased pulmonary edema. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed an increase in the rate of atrial fibrillation. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) increased, and lactate increased during the acute episode. 

Possible etiologies for the acute distress include pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction, TRALI (too late of onset), pneumothorax (ruled out on CXR), aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, or mucus"

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with
   altered mental status thought to be due to UTI, admitted for hypoxia
   with finding of right pleural effusion
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient had another episode of respiratory distress,
   wheezing, and tachycardia overnight which responded to nebs,
   nitropaste, and lasix.  Latest PaO2 61.  Acute distress likely due to
   pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction as well as right
   pleural effusion  The patient
s baseline hypoxia which is not entirely
   responsive to oxygen might be due to cardiac (R
L) shunting,
   atelectasis of right lobe due to pleural effusion, or intrapulmonary
   shunting.
   --hold lasix for today since IR guided thoracentesis is planned.
   --continue aspiration precautions
   --continue to check ABG to assess oxygenation
   --continue IV Metoprolol 15 mg q4hr
   --continue Imdur
   --nebs PRN
   --pulmonary toilet
   --bubble echo study today to assess possible R->L shunt.  Cardiology is
   concerned for possible air embolus in patient already in respiratory
   distress
   --review CTA with radiology looking for AV shunts
   .
   #Right pleural effusion: The patient is likely hypoxemic with an acute
   on chronic resp acidosis due to her pleural effusion. The desaturations
   seems positional, so likely due to the pleural effusions. The patient
   also has underlying pulmonary hypertension, possibly caused by chronic
   hypoxia due to pleural effusion. WBC WNL and afebrile, so infection
   with a parapneumonic effusion less likely. PE r/o with CTA.  Ultrasound
   performed bedside two days ago showed not enough fluid to tap.  However
   on physical exam this morning, pleural effusion seems to have enlarged
   - consider IR guided thoracentesis today
   - Obtain Echo records from [**Hospital1 1031**] to determine the chronicity of pulmonary
   hypertension.
   .
   #  Altered Mental Status: Patient seems to be at her baseline (AOx2),
   as per HCP. The patient had a postive U/A and urine culture growing
   Klebsiella. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS change. The
   patient has waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status changes, likely due to UTI.
   Initially, sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her past
   history. Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The
   patient has no seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE.
   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of
   hyperacute change in mental status was initially concerning for seizure
   or acute stroke.
   - change PO Cipro to IV cipro, started [**6-14**] (day 8 of 10 day treatment)
   - f/u blood cx
   - avoid sedating meds
   .
   # UTI: Pt. grew Klebsiella in urine. Has sensitivities. Repeat UCx neg.
   -  continue cipro. Abx course started on [**6-14**] for a total of 10 days.
   .
   #Diastolic HF: EF 65-70% with no LVH. Has had episodes of flash
   pulmonary edema. On nitrates, metoprolol and CCB at home.
   - continue to manage HTN with metoprolol, change from PO to IV
   - start hydralazine 10 mg
   - continue imdur
   .
   # AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.  Difficult to
   interpret EKG changes given V-paced rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes negative
   so far.
   - continue IV metoprolol
   - hold coumadine for today for possible IR guided thoracentesis
   .
   # Pulm HTN: New onset pulm HTN since [**Month (only) **]? In [**Hospital1 1031**] D/C summary,
   there was no mention of Pulm HTN. It
s possibly due to chronic hypoxia
   [**12-19**] large pleural effusion on right. Other etiologies like idiopathic
   (too old for onset), PE (ruled out with CTA), and HIV unlikely.  Will
   not pursue medical therapy at this time other than BP control.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. She presents with altered mental status, thought to be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI), and is admitted for hypoxia with findings of right pleural effusion. The patient experienced another episode of respiratory distress, wheezing, and tachycardia overnight, which responded to nebulizers, nitropaste, and Lasix. Her baseline hypoxia, not entirely responsive to oxygen, might be due to cardiac (right-to-left) shunting, atelectasis of the right lobe due to pleural effusion, or intrapulmonary shunting. Lasix administration is held for today since an interventional radiology (IR) guided thoracentesis is planned. The patient also has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (not acute respiratory distress syndrome), hypoxemia, and altered mental status (not delirium).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's acute distress is likely due to pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction as well as right pleural effusion. This can lead to worsening hypoxemia and respiratory failure.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has an enlarging right pleural effusion, which may contribute to her baseline hypoxia and can potentially lead to respiratory compromise if not managed appropriately.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. She was admitted for hypoxia and found to have a right pleural effusion. The patient experienced another episode of respiratory distress overnight, which responded to nebulizers, nitropaste, and lasix. Her baseline hypoxia is not entirely responsive to oxygen and might be due to cardiac shunting, atelectasis of the right lobe due to pleural effusion, or intrapulmonary shunting.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and is experiencing repeated episodes of wheezing, desaturation, and tachycardia. She also has a right pleural effusion, which could be contributing to her respiratory distress.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's baseline hypoxia is not entirely responsive to oxygen, indicating potential underlying issues such as cardiac shunting, atelectasis, or intrapulmonary shunting.
3. Diastolic heart failure: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 65-70% and no left ventricular hypertrophy. She has had episodes of flash pulmonary edema and is currently being managed with nitrates, metoprolol, and calcium channel blockers.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple health issues, including respiratory failure, hypoxemia, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), altered mental status, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's condition is complicated by malnutrition, impaired skin integrity, worsening pleural effusions, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and altered mental status. The patient requires close monitoring and treatment for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is severely compromised, leading to hypoxemia. This can result in further deterioration of oxygenation and ventilation, potentially leading to respiratory arrest.
2. Pleural Effusions: The worsening bilateral pleural effusions can cause compression of the lungs, impairing their ability to expand and exchange gases effectively. This may lead to increased respiratory distress and potential complications such as infection or tension pneumothorax.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, indicated by rising creatinine levels. If left untreated, acute renal failure can progress to end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation.
4. Hypernatremia: The elevated serum sodium level indicates a risk of dehydration and potential neurological complications. Without appropriate management, hypernatremia can lead to seizures, cerebral edema, or other serious neurological issues.
5. Diastolic CHF: The patient's diastolic heart failure can result in fluid accumulation in the lungs and"

   [**Age over 90 **] y/o F with PMHx of Afib, CAD s/p MI and PVD who presents with
   altered mental status thought to be due to UTI now subjectively
   resolved, admitted for hypoxia with finding of right pleural effusion

   # Hypoxia: Patient received thoracentesis yesterday with 1.2 L of
   serosanguinous fluid removed.  Pt
s PaO2 improved to 196.  Currently
   saturating well on nasal canula 7L.  Acute respiratory distress could
   have been due to the pleural effusion.  Pt saturating well but still
   requiring a lot of O2.  The patient
s baseline hypoxia might be due to
   cardiac (R
L) shunting or intrapulmonary shunting.   Prior CTA
   discussed with radiology: pt has little lung parenchyma to evaluate,
   but no large AVMs seen on [**6-13**] CTA

   #Right pleural effusion: 1.2 L of transudative fluid removed yesterday
   with improvement of patient
s oxygenation.  WBC WNL and afebrile, so
   infection with a parapneumonic effusion less likely. PE r/o with CTA.
   - Obtain Echo records from [**Hospital1 1031**] to determine the chronicity of pulmonary
   hypertension.
   .
   #  Altered Mental Status: Patient seems to be consistently at her
   baseline (AOx2), as per HCP. The patient had a postive U/A and urine
   culture growing Klebsiella. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS
   change. The patient has waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status changes, likely due
   to UTI.  Initially, sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her
   past history. Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The
   patient has no seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE.
   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of
   hyperacute change in mental status was initially concerning for seizure
   or acute stroke.
   - continue cipro, started [**6-14**] (day 9 of 10 day treatment)
   - f/u blood cx
   - avoid sedating meds

   # UTI: Pt. grew Klebsiella in urine. Has sensitivities. Repeat UCx neg.
   -  continue cipro

   #Diastolic HF: EF 65-70% with no LVH. Has had episodes of flash
   pulmonary edema. On nitrates, metoprolol and CCB at home.
   - continue metoprolol
   - continue hydralazine
   - continue imdur
   .
   # AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.  Difficult to
   interpret EKG changes given V-paced rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes negative
   so far.
   - continue metoprolol
   - restart coumadin
   .
   # Pulm HTN: New onset pulm HTN since [**Month (only) **]? In [**Hospital1 1031**] D/C summary,
   there was no mention of Pulm HTN. It
s possibly due to chronic hypoxia
   [**12-19**] large pleural effusion on right. Other etiologies like idiopathic
   (too old for onset), PE (ruled out with CTA), and HIV unlikely.  Will
   not pursue medical therapy at this time other than BP control.
   - obtain [**Hospital1 1031**] records
   - continue O2 requirement
   - manage HTN

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. She was admitted for hypoxia and a right pleural effusion.

The patient underwent thoracentesis, which involved removing 1.2 liters of serosanguinous fluid. The removed fluid was determined to be a transudate based on Light's criteria. The patient's oxygenation improved after the procedure.

The patient's current medical conditions include ineffective coping, malnutrition, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypoxemia, and altered mental status (not delirium). 

The patient's baseline hypoxia may be due to cardiac (right to left) shunting or intrapulmonary shunting. A CT angiography (CTA) was discussed with radiology, revealing no large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) seen on the previous CTA.

The patient's altered mental status is thought to be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI), which has resolved subjectively. The UTI was caused by Klebsiella, and the patient is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin.

The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 65-70% and no left ventricular hypertrophy. She has experienced episodes of flash pulmonary edema and is on nitrates, metoprol"

s PaO2 improved to 196.  Currently
   saturating well on nasal canula 6L.  Acute respiratory distress likely
   due to the pleural effusion.  Pt saturating well but still requiring

   #  Altered Mental Status: Patient seems to be consistently at her

   culture growing Klebsiella. Infection is the likely etiology of her AMS
   change. The patient has waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**] mental status changes, likely due
   to UTI.  Initially, sudden onset also concerning for CVA, given her
   past history. Her CT of the head could not r/o any acute infarcts. The
   patient has no seizure history, so unlikely a seizure. A CTA r/o PE.
   Hypercarbia also possible given desats, but ABG has stable acute on
   chronic respiratory failure.  Etiology unclear but history of
   hyperacute change in mental status was initially concerning for seizure
   or acute stroke.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress due to a pleural effusion. They require supplemental oxygen and continuous monitoring of their oxygenation status.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient's baseline hypoxia might be due to cardiac (right-to-left) shunting or intrapulmonary shunting. This could potentially worsen if the patient's pulmonary function deteriorates further.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has had mental status changes likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI). It is important to continue treatment for the UTI and avoid sedating medications.

4. Right Pleural Effusion: The patient had a right pleural effusion that was drained, resulting in improvement of their oxygenation. Further evaluation is needed to determine the chronicity of pulmonary hypertension.

5. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 65-70%. They are currently on nitrates, metoprolol, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) at home. It is important to continue these medications.

6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, although currently they are paced. It is difficult to interpret EKG changes due to the paced rhythm. Cardiac enzymes are negative so far."

She is currently on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and is expected to recover from acute respiratory distress caused by the pleural effusion.

   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Patient had 1.5 liters of pleural fluid removed yesterday. ABG improved
   through the night with greatly improved oxygenation (now only 6L nasal
   cannula supplementation). Pleural fluid transudative (protein 2.7, LDH
   85).
   Remains afebrile.
   Blood pressure under better control with hydralazine.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease post myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular disease. The patient presented with altered mental status thought to be due to a urinary tract infection, which is now subjectively resolved. The patient was admitted for hypoxia with findings of right pleural effusion. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is improving, most likely due to the right pleural effusion. The patient is currently saturating well on 4L nasal cannula oxygen, although with desaturations in the low 80s when sleeping or sedated. Continuous oxygen monitoring has revealed this baseline. Aspiration precautions should continue, and the oxygen can be weaned down as tolerated. ABG checks should be continued to assess oxygenation. Nebulizers can be used as needed for pulmonary toilet.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient seems to be at her baseline, as per healthcare providers. She is now able to sit in a chair and attempt communication. Ciprofloxacin should be continued, and sedating medications should be avoided.

   resolved, admitted for hypoxia with finding of right pleural effusion
   .
   # Hypoxia: Improving. Most likely due to R pleural effusion as pt
   improved s/p R thoracentesis. Currently saturating well on 4L NC.
   -- Possible left thoracentesis as pt did so well after R thoracentesis.
   --continue aspiration precautions
   --wean down O2 as tolerated
   --continue to check ABG to assess oxygenation, if saturating well under
   3L O2, consider calling out
   --continue IV Metoprolol 15 mg q4hr
   --continue Imdur
   --nebs PRN
   --pulmonary toilet
   .
   #  Altered Mental Status: Patient seems to be consistently at her
   baseline (AOx2), as per HCP. Now able to sit in chair and is attempting
   to communicate with team and nursing.
   - continue cipro, started [**6-14**] (day 10 of 10 day treatment)
   - avoid sedating meds
   #Diastolic HF: EF 65-70% with no LVH. Has had episodes of flash
   pulmonary edema. On nitrates, metoprolol and CCB at home.
   - ECHO not sent from [**Hospital1 1031**] so no comparison
   - continue metoprolol
   - continue hydralazine
   - continue imdur

   # AFib: Pt with history of afib though currently paced.  Difficult to
   interpret EKG changes given V-paced rhythm.  Cardiac enzymes negative
   so far.
   - continue metoprolol
   - restart coumadin if no L thoracentesis will be done
   -monitor INR
   .
   # Pulm HTN: New onset pulm HTN since [**Month (only) **]? In [**Hospital1 1031**] D/C summary,
   there was no mention of Pulm HTN. It
s possibly due to chronic hypoxia
   [**12-19**] large pleural effusion on right or enlarged pulmonary artery trunk.
   Other etiologies like idiopathic (too old for onset), PE (ruled out
   with CTA), and HIV unlikely.  Will not pursue medical therapy at this
   time other than BP control.
   - continue O2 requirement
   - manage HTN

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease post-myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular disease. She presents with altered mental status, thought to be due to a urinary tract infection, which is now resolved. She was admitted for hypoxia and the finding of right pleural effusion. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypoxia: Improving. Most likely due to right pleural effusion, as the patient improved after right thoracentesis. Possible left thoracentesis as the patient did well after right thoracentesis. Continue aspiration precautions, wean down O2 as tolerated, and continue to check ABG to assess oxygenation.
2. Altered Mental Status: Patient seems to be consistently at her baseline. Continue cipro, started on day 10 of 10-day treatment, and avoid sedating medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a frail individual experiencing respiratory distress, altered mental status, hypoxemia, pleural effusions, and hypernatremia. They are currently on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and have shown improvement in eating without apparent aspiration. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (96.9°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/52 to 141/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 91%. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the right lung when lying in the right decubitus position, but overall their general appearance is intact. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented (though language assessment is challenging). Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels (high sodium, low potassium, and magnesium). Imaging studies are pending. The patient's assessment includes impaired mobility, ventilation, aerobic capacity/endurance, respiration/gas exchange, ineffective coping, malnutrition, impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypoxemia, and altered mental status (not delirium).

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia indicate"
