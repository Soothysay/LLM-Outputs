   Assessment and Plan
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
 SUICIDALITY / SUICIDE ATTEMPT
   48 yoM w/ a h/o ETOH abuse and depression / anxiety presents with ETOH
   intoxication and suicidal ideation.
   # Suicidal Ideation: The patient has a longstanding history of
   depression, no attempts but thoughts of suicidal ideation.
   -1:1 sitter
   -psychiatry has been consulted
   -continue home celexa, f/u psych recs.
   # ETOH withdrawal: currently showing signs of ETOH withdrawal,
   currently with tremor and tachycardia, no evidence of DTs.
   -treat with IV valium until withdrawal improves then using standing
   valium 10mg PO q4hours and 5-10mg valium Q2 hours prn CIWA > 10
   # AG acidosis:
   -send lactate and obtain ABG, gap has improved from 32 to 21
   -send u/a to evaluate for ketones
   -appears dehydrated on exam and by history, give 1 additional liter of
   NS bolus then maintenance fluids NS at 100cc/hr and bolus prn
   -place foley, patient not voiding currently but refusing foley, will
   wait 1 hour and re-discuss
   # Abdominal Pain: given history of ETOH use, could be ETOH hepatitis
   (especially given liver tenderness), no jaundice on exam.  In addition
   could be pancreatitis.  Also, given a history of hematemesis, melena,
   and BRPRB could be gastric malignancy, vs. ulcer, vs.
   gastritis/duodenitis
   -send LFTs and lipase
   -management of GI bleed as below
   # GI Bleed: subjective complaints of GI bleed.  The patient has been
   adverse to EGD in the past.  Possibilities include ulcer, malignancy,
   etc as above.
   -hct seems hemoconcentrated, IVF and repeat hct stat and then 7 p.m.
   -maintain 2 PIV (currently w/ 18g and 20g)
   -type and screen
   -GI consult after withdrawal issues are settled unless GI bleed recurs
   -[**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -guaiac stools
   -NPO
   # Thrombocytopenia: normal WBC and HCT.  Baseline plts relatively
   normal. Could be from liver disease but no history of this.  Has had an
   elevated bili of 1.6 in the past but has never had coags sent.  Albumin
   4.5 in [**Month (only) **].  Other possiblities are ITP, myelosuppresion from
   ETOH (less likely given no anemia or leukopenia), DIC.
   -obtain smear
   -repeat CBC stat
   -transfuse for plts < 50 given bleeding
   -send coags
   -obtain ultrasound of liver given ascites on exam and thrombocytopenia
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / NPO
   # PPX: PPI, pneumoboots given GI bleed will hold off on sc heparin,
   bowel regimen

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and depression/anxiety who presented with alcohol intoxication and suicidal ideation. The patient is currently showing signs of alcohol withdrawal, including tremor and tachycardia, but no evidence of delirium tremens (DTs). 

The patient also has an altered mental status (MM dry) and a resting tremor. Physical examination reveals tenderness to the right upper quadrant (RUQ) and epigastrium, along with shifting dullness and fluid wave suggestive of ascites. There is also mild abdominal distension, and the liver edge is tender and palpable below the right costal margin. No splenomegaly is noted. Extremities show warm peripheral pulses (WP), dry skin (DS), and diminished pulses (DP) bilaterally. Neurological examination reveals a resting tremor but no nystagmus.

Laboratory results show leukopenia with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 5.0, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 12.2 g/dL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 133/240), hypokalemia with a potassium (K+) level of 3.1 mEq/L, hyponatremia with a sodium (Na+) level of 95 mEq/L, and thrombocytopenia with a plate"

   48 yoM w/ a h/o ETOH abuse and depression / anxiety presents with ETOH
   intoxication and suicidal ideation.
   # Suicidal Ideation: The patient has a longstanding history of
   depression, no attempts but thoughts of suicidal ideation.
   -1:1 sitter
   -psychiatry has been consulted
   -continue home celexa, f/u psych recs.
   # ETOH withdrawal: currently showing signs of ETOH withdrawal,
   currently with tremor and tachycardia, no evidence of DTs.
   -treat with IV valium until withdrawal improves then using standing
   valium 10mg PO q4hours and 5-10mg valium Q2 hours prn CIWA > 10
   # AG acidosis:
   -send lactate and obtain ABG, gap has improved from 32 to 21
   -send u/a to evaluate for ketones
   -appears dehydrated on exam and by history, give 1 additional liter of
   NS bolus then maintenance fluids NS at 100cc/hr and bolus prn
   -place foley, patient not voiding currently but refusing foley, will
   wait 1 hour and re-discuss
   # Abdominal Pain: given history of ETOH use, could be ETOH hepatitis
   (especially given liver tenderness), no jaundice on exam.  In addition
   could be pancreatitis.  Also, given a history of hematemesis, melena,
   and BRPRB could be gastric malignancy, vs. ulcer, vs.
   gastritis/duodenitis
   -send LFTs and lipase
   -management of GI bleed as below
   # GI Bleed: subjective complaints of GI bleed.  The patient has been
   adverse to EGD in the past.  Possibilities include ulcer, malignancy,
   etc as above.

   # Thrombocytopenia: normal WBC and HCT.  Baseline plts relatively
   normal. Could be from liver disease but no history of this.  Has had an
   elevated bili of 1.6 in the past but has never had coags sent.  Albumin
   4.5 in [**Month (only) **].  Other possiblities are ITP, myelosuppresion from
   ETOH (less likely given no anemia or leukopenia), DIC.
   -obtain smear
   -repeat CBC stat
   -transfuse for plts < 50 given bleeding
   -send coags
   -obtain ultrasound of liver given ascites on exam and thrombocytopenia

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and depression presenting with ethanol intoxication and suicidal ideation. The patient has been showing signs of alcohol withdrawal, including tremor and tachycardia. He has a longstanding history of depression but no previous suicide attempts.

The patient also exhibits signs of dehydration and may have acidosis, as indicated by an elevated lactate level. An additional liter of normal saline bolus has been given, and maintenance fluids are being administered at 100cc/hr with additional boluses as needed.

There are concerns regarding the patient's abdominal pain, which could be due to alcohol hepatitis or pancreatitis. Given the patient's history of hematemesis, melena, and black, tarry stools (BRPRB), there is a possibility of gastric malignancy, ulcer, or gastritis/duodenitis. Liver function tests (LFTs) and lipase have been ordered to further evaluate these conditions.

The patient has subjective complaints of gastrointestinal bleeding, and possibilities include ulcer, malignancy, etc. Type and screen have been performed, and the patient is currently on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Guaiac stools are being checked, and the patient is on NPO (nothing by mouth).

The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 59 K/uL. Normal white"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old man with a chief complaint of ETOH withdrawal and ETOH ketoacidosis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving treatment for alcohol withdrawal, including diazepam infusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), blood pressure ranging from 136/94 to 170/145 mmHg, heart rate between 100 and 105 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on a nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. His cardiovascular examination shows normal heart sounds, and his peripheral pulses are present bilaterally. Crackles are heard in the bibasilar regions of his lungs, indicating possible fluid accumulation. His abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. There is no evidence of lower extremity edema. The patient's neurologic examination reveals that he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, but has not been assessed for movement, tone, or reflexes.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 12.2 g/dL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, and a platelet count of 59 K/uL. Other lab values include a blood glucose level of 133 mg/d"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is being treated for alcohol withdrawal, with symptoms including tremor and tachycardia. The physician is considering the possibility of discharging the patient from the dual diagnosis inpatient program once they are fully treated for withdrawal, as they may no longer meet the criteria for admission. However, no inpatient programs are currently available.

Vital signs include a current temperature of 35.6°C (96.1°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/69 mmHg to 125/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has received a total of 3,190 mL of IV fluids since 7:00 AM, with an intake of 1,090 mL by mouth and 2,100 mL through the IV. Their urine output has been 2,645 mL, with blood product transfusion of 1,370 mL.

The patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation are within normal limits. However, their temperature is below the normal range. The patient's respiratory support shows an oxygen saturation of 93%.

Physical examination findings include a pulse assessment for the right and left radial pulses and digital pulses, but no abnormalities were noted. The skin, neurologic status, and peripheral vascular examination were not assessed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of ETOH abuse and depression/anxiety presenting with ETOH intoxication and suicidal ideation. The patient is currently being treated for alcohol withdrawal, which includes the use of IV Valium until withdrawal improves. The patient also has symptoms of AG acidosis, abdominal pain, GI bleed, thrombocytopenia, and FEN.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Delirium tremens (DTs): This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can occur 48-96 hours after the last drink. It is characterized by tremors, agitation, confusion, hallucinations, and fever.

2. Seizures: Alcohol withdrawal can also cause seizures, which can be life-threatening if not properly managed.

3. Suicidal behavior: The patient's history of depression and suicidal ideation increases the risk of self-harm or suicide attempts.

4. Metabolic acidosis: AG acidosis indicates a metabolic acidosis, which can be caused by several factors including lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, or renal failure. This condition needs to be closely monitored and treated accordingly.

5. Pancreatitis: The patient's abdominal pain could be due to pancreatitis, which is an inflammation of the pancreas. It can cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and elevated levels of amylase and lipase.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES)
 SUICIDALITY / SUICIDE ATTEMPT
   48 yoM w/ a h/o ETOH abuse and depression / anxiety presents with ETOH
   intoxication and suicidal ideation.
   # Suicidal Ideation: The patient has a longstanding history of
   depression, no attempts but thoughts of suicidal ideation.
   -1:1 sitter
   -psychiatry awaiting dual diagnosis program, at this point given inpt
   detox here he may not qualify
   -f/u psych recs
   # ETOH withdrawal: continues to have tremor and mild tachycardia, but
   sleeping comfortably and seems relaxed.  At this point the patient has
   rec
d around 200mg of valium.  Will decrease valium to q4hrs prn CIWA >
   10 and callout to floor, will allow it to self taper.  The patient was
   admitted [**3-31**] and therefore is > 48 hours out from his last drink and
   his only objective sign of ETOH w/d is tremor which he states he has at
   baseline as well.
   # Abdominal Pain: ETOH hepatitis, improving pain.
   -will repeat  LFTs, mainly bili and INR to evaluate synthetic function
   in a.m.
   # GI Bleed: subjective complaints of GI bleed.  HCT very stable.
   -maintain 2 PIV (currently w/ 18g and 20g)
   -type and screen
   -[**Hospital1 **] PPI
   -guaiac stools
   -outpatient GI f/u w/ EGD/Colonoscopy
   # Thrombocytopenia: normal WBC and HCT.  Baseline plts relatively
   normal. ? myelosuppression from ETOH use.  Continue to trend.  If does
   not improve with ETOH cessation then ITP could be a diagnosis of
   exclusion but less likely.
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / regular diet
   # PPX: PPI, pneumoboots, start sc heparin as GI bleed does not seem
   like an active issue currently and the patient is very immobile

Physical examination reveals that the patient is alert and oriented, with dry mucous membranes, jugular venous distention of 8 cm, equal and reactive pupils, sclera anicteric, conjunctiva pink, and no edema. The cardiac examination shows tachycardia but regular heart rhythm with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Lung examination is clear to auscultation bilaterally. The abdomen is soft and mildly distended, tender to the right upper quadrant and epigastrium, with no rebound tenderness or guarding. The patient has shifting dullness and fluid wave, indicating ascites. The liver edge is palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin and is tender. No splenomegaly is present. Minimal yellow stool is noted in the rectal vault, but guaiac test is negative, and no rectal masses are found. The"
