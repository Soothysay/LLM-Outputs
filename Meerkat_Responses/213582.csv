   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yoM w/ a h/o DM and ETOH abuse presenting from an outside
   hospital with biliary sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Pancreatitis and Biliary Sepsis - patient likely has biliary sepsis
   given history as well as enterobacter in blood as well as in biliary
   specimen from initial presentation.  Also has pancreatitis related to
   gallstones.  He also has a large amount of ascites that is infected,
   possibily primarily versus secondary bacterial peritonitis.  In this
   setting it is more likely secondary.  The patient is hypotensive
   requring pressors.
   -surveillance cultures, will need to obtain OSH records of bacterial
   sensitivities
   -continue zosyn flagyl for likely biliary sepsis
   -f/u sensitivities on enterobacter
   -continue fluid resuscitation, goal CVP 8-12 and goal UOP > 30cc/hr
   -monitor SVO2 from central venous catheter and goal of 70
   -contact ERCP fellow regarding further management given worsening
   sepsis and 3 episodes of gallstone pancreatitis
   -send sputum cultures and obtain CXR, add vancomycin if spikes
   empirically
   -send C diff if diarrhea and send a u/a and urine culture
   -given the increase in intraabdominal ascites possibilities are of a
   bile leak, a aberrant duct or a pancreatic duct disruption due to
   apparently 3 episodes of gallstone pancreatitis.  He had a negative
   HIDA scan but it is possible he had a pancreatic duct disruption that
   was not seen or that his bile leak stopped by the time he had his scan,
   less likely this was a false negative HIDA scan. Per ERCP fellow this
   is unlikely given the negative HIDA scan and more likely he has
   pancreatitis with massive third spacing given the background of ETOH
   cirrhosis.
   -call surgery consult in a.m. (Dr.[**Name (NI) 2100**] service)
   -obtain an abdominal ultrasound to evaluate liver, CBD, hepatic and
   portal flow
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely due to fluid overload and pleural
   effusions tracking up from ascites.  Patient is intubated.  At this
   current juncture he will need fluid repletion for the above and will
   diurese after he begins to improve.
   -continue to monitor volume status and diurese eventually but for now
   will give volume for pancreatitis / biliary sepsis
   -in addition possible that patient had aspiration pneumonitis versus
   pneumonia given his altered mental status when his sepsis was
   worsening, would continue to follow fever curve and secretions and send
   a sputum culture if increase in secretions.
   .
   # DM: on oral hypoglycemics at home.
   -RISS
   .
   # ETOH abuse: Admitted to OSH on [**2120-11-2**], no withdrawal noted at OSH
   and he is nearing the end of the window for ETOH withdrawal but also he
   has been not drinking for several weeks per his family.
   -thiamine, folate
   .
   # Renal Failure: Cr on [**11-5**] was 1.1, increasing on [**11-6**] to 1.7 and to
   2.2 on [**11-7**] at OSH.  Very likely secondary to sepsis as well as large
   amount of ascites and hepatorenal syndrome physiology.
   -send urine lytes
   -obtain abdominal ultrasound to evaluate kidneys
   -foley in place
   -maintain hydration as above using CVP and UOP as parameters

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and ethanol (ETOH) abuse. He was admitted to the outside hospital with biliary sepsis and pancreatitis. The patient has been transferred to the ICU for further management. His current condition includes sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and possible secondary bacterial peritonitis due to infected ascites. He is hypotensive and requires pressors. The patient is also diagnosed with DM and ETOH abuse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Biliary Sepsis: The patient has a history of biliary sepsis, which can lead to systemic infection and septic shock.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to fluid overload and pleural effusions tracking up from ascites. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have progressively increased, indicating renal failure, which may be secondary to sepsis, large amount of ascites, and hepatorenal syndrome physiology.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis related to gallstones, which can lead to complications such as necrotizing pancreatitis or pancreatic pseudocyst formation.
5. Secondary Bacterial Peritonitis: The presence of infected ascites raises the possibility of secondary bacterial peritonitis, which can lead to further infection and complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yoM w/ a h/o DM and ETOH abuse presenting from an outside
   hospital with biliary sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Septic shock/pancreatitis: Patient with colecystecomy now with septic
   shock thought to be due to enterobacter from the biliary tract. Patient
   also with gallstone pancreatitis, which may be contributing to the
   shock physiology. He has cirrhosis with ascities, which clouds the
   picture of the septic shock. Right now he is off pressors and doing
   better.  SVO2 above goal.
   - Continue Zosyn for enterobacter and biliary source flora
   - Stop flagyl since it adds no coverage over zosyn (except C diff)
   - Continue fluid boluses for MAP >60 and SBP >100
   - Re-start pressor if unable to keep goals
   - Change central line
   - Add vancomycin for gram positive coverage while cultures come back;
   concern for cellulites vs. inflammatory response
   - CT scan for eval for abcess/hemorrhage, cysts associated with
   pancreatitis
   - Surgery consult
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Likely due to fluid overload and pleural
   effusions tracking up from ascites.  Patient is intubated.  At this
   current juncture he will need fluid repletion for the above and will
   diurese after he begins to improve.
   -continue to monitor volume status and diurese eventually but for now
   will give volume for pancreatitis / biliary sepsis
   -in addition possible that patient had aspiration pneumonitis versus
   pneumonia given his altered mental status when his sepsis was
   worsening, would continue to follow fever curve and secretions and send
   a sputum culture if increase in secretions.
   .
   # DM: on oral hypoglycemics at home.
   -Insulin drip, since patient in anasarca here and hold home medicines
   .
   # ETOH abuse: Admitted to OSH on [**2120-11-2**], no withdrawal noted at OSH
   and he is nearing the end of the window for ETOH withdrawal but also he
   has been not drinking for several weeks per his family.
   -thiamine, folate
   .
   # Renal Failure: Cr on [**11-5**] was 1.1, increasing on [**11-6**] to 1.7 and to
   2.2 on [**11-7**] at OSH.  Very likely secondary to sepsis as well as large
   amount of ascites and hepatorenal syndrome physiology. However, sepsis
   physiology needs to be ruled out.
   -follow urine lytes
   -obtain abdominal ultrasound to evaluate kidneys
   -foley in place
   -maintain hydration as above using CVP and UOP as parameters

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and ethanol abuse. He was admitted to the hospital with biliary sepsis and gallstone pancreatitis. The patient has cirrhosis with ascites, which complicates the assessment of septic shock. He is currently off pressors and showing improvement. The plan includes continuing Zosyn for enterobacter and biliary source flora, stopping Flagyl, fluid boluses for MAP >60 and SBP >100, restarting pressor if necessary, changing central line, adding vancomycin for gram-positive coverage, and consulting surgery. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock/Pancreatitis: The patient has septic shock due to enterobacter from the biliary tract and gallstone pancreatitis. Close monitoring of vital signs and organ function is essential to prevent further complications.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to fluid overload and pleural effusions tracking up from ascites. Intubation and careful monitoring of volume status are crucial to prevent further respiratory compromise.

3. Diabetic Complications: The patient has DM, and insulin management is important to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

4. Ethanol Withdrawal: Although the patient is nearing the end of the window for ETOH withdrawal, thiamine and folate supplementation should be considered to prevent complications associated with chronic"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with history of EtOH abuse now transferred from [**Hospital 2125**] Center with sepsis.  Patient had initial presentation with
   biliary obstruction (Cystic duct stone) and with mild trans-aminitis he
   had cholecystostomy followed by lap CCY.  He was then discharged to
   home and found upon repeat admission to have acute pancreatitis and
   Enterobacter bacteremia leading to sepsis.  He did have modest initial
   improvement but the, in the setting of fluid resuscitation, was found
   to have worsening ascites with concern for bile leak evaluated with
   HIDA scan which was negative.  He, however, had progressive hypoxemia
   requiring intubation and is now transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further care.
   The source of the respiratory failure may well be a combination of the
   ascites and likely SBP compromising ventilatory mechanics but also with
   significant concern for evolution of non-cardiogenic edma/[**Doctor Last Name 11**].  For
   management will-->
   1)Sepsis-Multiple possible sources with concern for peritonitis,
   pancreatitis and possible persistent insult from GNR's of biliary
   source.  In addition, he has evidence of cellulitis in abdominal wall
   as well as lower extermities raising concern for possible metastatic
   source of infection.
   -Zosyn/Flagyl and will expand to Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl
   -ERCP team in to evaluate and follow patient for possible ERCP with
   cholangiogram to evaluate for source of leak in the setting of ascitic
   fluid findings
initial conclusion is to continue with current plan of
   care and defer ERCP at this time given minimal evidece of leak
   -Pancreatitis will be treated as below
   -SBP in the setting of cirrhosis is of concern as well in contributing
   to sepsis
   -Cellulitis suggestion will be followed closely and treated with
   coverage extended to gram positive organisms with Vancomycin
   -Repeat CT scan for follow up evaluation for evolution of pancreatitis
   or to evaluate for flluid collections within abdomen
   -Surgery evaluation for support with the pacreatitis
   -IVF as needed to maintain CVP and the urine flow minimum of 30cc/hr
   for now.
   2)Respiratory Failure-Minimal evidence of airflow obstruction or
   increased resistance suggesting is loss of pulmonary compliance
   contributing.  Oxygenation able to be supported with 0.5 FIO2 and Pplat
   at 22 suggesting resonable levels of support.
   -Continue with A/C support
   -Titrate PEEP up for any decrease in oxygenation
   3)Pancreatitis--Patient with diffuse abdominal tenderness noted, Lipase
   has improved upon comparison with OSH lab studies.
   -Favor post pyloric feeding if tube able to be placed and for support
   -CT scan to evaluate for any evidence of necrosis or alternative
   intra-abdominal collection
   -Pain control with Fentanyl for now
   -npo until post pyloric feeds in place
   -F/U Lipase
   4)Cholelithiasis
ERCP team to follow
   5)EtOH Abuse--Hospitalized for 5 days and no symptoms seen at this

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse, who was initially admitted to the hospital with biliary obstruction and mild trans-aminitis. He underwent cholecystostomy followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CCY) and was discharged home. Upon readmission, he was found to have acute pancreatitis and Enterobacter bacteremia leading to sepsis. The patient experienced initial improvement but developed worsening ascites with concern for a bile leak, evaluated with a HIDA scan which was negative. He then developed progressive hypoxemia requiring intubation and was transferred to another hospital for further care.

The patient's current condition includes sepsis with multiple possible sources, respiratory failure due to ascites and likely spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), pancreatitis, cholelithiasis, and EtOH abuse. The patient is critically ill.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multiple possible sources of infection, including peritonitis, pancreatitis, and a potential persistent insult from Gram-negative rods (GNRs) of biliary origin. There is also concern for possible metastatic sources of infection indicated by evidence of cellulitis in the abdominal wall and lower extremities.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to a combination of factors such as ascites and SBP compromising ventilatory mechanics, as well as the possibility"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yoM w/ a h/o DM and ETOH abuse presenting from an outside
   hospital with biliary sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Septic shock/pancreatitis: Patient with colecystecomy now with septic
   shock thought to be due to enterobacter from the biliary tract. Patient
   also with gallstone pancreatitis, which may be contributing to the
   shock physiology. He has cirrhosis with ascities, which clouds the
   picture of the septic shock. Right now he is off pressors and doing
   better.  SVO2 above goal.
   - Continue Zosyn for enterobacter and biliary source flora
   - Stop flagyl since it adds no coverage over zosyn (except C diff)
   - Continue fluid boluses for MAP >60 and SBP >100
   - Change central line changed yesterday
   - Add vancomycin for gram positive coverage until cultures grow out;
   concern for cellulites vs. inflammatory response
   - CT scan - IMPRESSION: 1. Ascites. 2. Nodular appearance of the liver
   surface, suggestive of cirrhosis. 3. Foley catheter balloon inflated at
   the base of the bladder, near the
   junction with the prostatic urethra, clinical correlation is
   recommended to exclude incorrect placement. 4. Small bilateral pleural
   effusions, right greater than left, with partially
   visualized consolidative right basilar airspace disease, atelectasis
   versus pneumonia. No non-contrast CT evidence of pancreatitis, as
   questioned.
   - abdominal echo - IMPRESSION: 1. Patent hepatic vasculature. 2.
   Diffusely echogenic liver parenchyma without evidence for focal liver
   lesions. 3. Marked amount of ascites. 4. Normal appearing kidneys
   without evidence for hydronephrosis. 5. No gallstones.
   - no new micro data
   - Surgery was consulted and said that not currently surgical issue
   - seen by liver - said to check hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth
   muscle antibody which are pending, plan for diagnostic and therapeutic
   paracentesis sunday (tomorrow)
   - patient got IV albumin yesterday in hopes to keep some intravascular
   fluid
   - cont albumin, today is day [**3-17**], need to re-order
   - start on Ppi [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated likely in the setting of sepsis.
   Likely due to fluid overload and pleural effusions tracking up from
   ascites.  Patient is intubated.  As off pressors and not requiring too
   much in the way of pressure support currently.
   -continue to monitor volume status and diurese eventually but for now
   will give volume for pancreatitis / biliary sepsis
   -in addition possible that patient had aspiration pneumonitis versus
   pneumonia given his altered mental status when his sepsis was
   worsening, would continue to follow fever curve and secretions and send
   a sputum culture if increase in secretions.
   - for now will try to wean sedation and consider spontaneously
   breathing trial
   .
   # Crit drop
   - HCt this morning significantly decreased
   - no bowel movements yet, will guiac if has some, no obvious source of
   bleeding
   - will re-check PM cbc
   - INR this morning 1.6, consider vit K as needed if bleeding becomes a
   problem
   - would consult with liveer
   # DM: on oral hypoglycemics at home.
   -Insulin drip, since patient in anasarca here and hold home medicines
   especially in the setting of continued D5W administration
   .
   # ETOH abuse: Admitted to OSH on [**2120-11-2**], no withdrawal noted at OSH
   and he is nearing the end of the window for ETOH withdrawal but also he
   has been not drinking for several weeks per his family.
   -thiamine, folate
   .
   # Renal Failure: Cr on [**11-5**] was 1.1, increasing on [**11-6**] to 1.7 and to
   2.2 on [**11-7**] at OSH, currently 1.9.  Very likely secondary to sepsis as
   well as large amount of ascites and hepatorenal syndrome physiology.
   However, sepsis physiology needs to be ruled out.
   -follow urine lytes
 FeNa 0.1% consistent mostly with prerenal
   physiology, low urine sodium
   - will check in touch with liver regarding treatment
   -abdominal ultrasound without evidence of hydronephrosis bilaterally
   -foley in place making good urine
   -continue hydration
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now, ordered nutrition consult, will likely require
   post-pyloric feeding, so will plan to try to get IR to place this
   morning and then begin feeding
   .
   # Access: LIJ
   .
   # PPx:  sc heparin tid, pneumoboots, not written for Ppi will start
   .
   # Code:  FULL
   .
   # Dispo:  ICU until extubated

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and ethanol abuse (ETOH), presenting from an outside hospital with biliary sepsis and pancreatitis. He underwent colecystectomy and is now experiencing septic shock, which is believed to be due to an infection caused by Enterobacter from the biliary tract. The patient also has gallstone pancreatitis, which may be contributing to the shock physiology. He has cirrhosis with ascites, making the clinical picture of septic shock more complicated. 

The patient is currently off pressors and doing better, with SVO2 above goal. His current plan includes continuing Zosyn for Enterobacter and biliary flora, stopping Metronidazole since it does not provide additional coverage over Zosyn, continuing fluid boluses for mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 and systemic blood pressure (SBP) >100, changing the central line that was changed yesterday, adding vancomycin for gram-positive coverage until cultures grow out, and concern for cellulitis versus inflammatory response. 

A CT scan revealed ascites, a nodular appearance of the liver suggestive of cirrhosis, a Foley catheter balloon inflated at the base of the bladder near the junction with the prostatic urethra (incorrect placement), and small bilateral pleural effusions with partially visualized consolidative right basilar airspace disease, which could be atelectasis or pneumonia.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yoM w/ a h/o DM and ETOH abuse presenting from an outside
   hospital with biliary sepsis.

   # Septic shock/pancreatitis: Patient with colecystecomy now with septic
   shock thought to be due to enterobacter from the biliary tract. Patient
   also with gallstone pancreatitis, which may be contributing to the
   shock physiology. He has cirrhosis with ascities, which clouds the
   picture of the septic shock. Right now he is off pressors and doing
   better.  SVO2 above goal.
   - Continue Zosyn for enterobacter and biliary source flora
   - Stop flagyl since it adds no coverage over zosyn (except C diff)
   - Continue fluid boluses for MAP >60 and SBP >100
   - Change central line changed yesterday
   - Add vancomycin for gram positive coverage until cultures grow out;
   concern for cellulites vs. inflammatory response
   - CT scan - IMPRESSION: 1. Ascites. 2. Nodular appearance of the liver
   surface, suggestive of cirrhosis. 3. Foley catheter balloon inflated at
   the base of the bladder, near the
   junction with the prostatic urethra, clinical correlation is
   recommended to exclude incorrect placement. 4. Small bilateral pleural
   effusions, right greater than left, with partially
   visualized consolidative right basilar airspace disease, atelectasis
   versus pneumonia. No non-contrast CT evidence of pancreatitis, as
   questioned.
   - abdominal echo - IMPRESSION: 1. Patent hepatic vasculature. 2.
   Diffusely echogenic liver parenchyma without evidence for focal liver
   lesions. 3. Marked amount of ascites. 4. Normal appearing kidneys
   without evidence for hydronephrosis. 5. No gallstones.

   # Respiratory Failure: Likely due to fluid overload and pleural
   effusions tracking up from ascites.  Patient is intubated.  At this
   current juncture he will need fluid repletion for the above and will
   diurese after he begins to improve.
   -continue to monitor volume status and diurese eventually but for now
   will give volume for pancreatitis / biliary sepsis
   -in addition possible that patient had aspiration pneumonitis versus
   pneumonia given his altered mental status when his sepsis was
   worsening, would continue to follow fever curve and secretions and send
   a sputum culture if increase in secretions.
   .
   # Crit drop
   - HCt this morning significantly decreased
   - no bowel movements yet, will guiac if has some, no obvious source of
   bleeding
   - will re-check PM cbc
   - draw coags this morning
   # DM: on oral hypoglycemics at home.
   -Insulin drip, since patient in anasarca here and hold home medicines
   - would consider transitioning back to regular meds
   .
   # ETOH abuse: Admitted to OSH on [**2120-11-2**], no withdrawal noted at OSH
   and he is nearing the end of the window for ETOH withdrawal but also he
   has been not drinking for several weeks per his family.
   -thiamine, folate
   .
   # Renal Failure: Cr on [**11-5**] was 1.1, increasing on [**11-6**] to 1.7 and to
   2.2 on [**11-7**] at OSH, currently 1.9.  Very likely secondary to sepsis as
   well as large amount of ascites and hepatorenal syndrome physiology.
   However, sepsis physiology needs to be ruled out.
   -follow urine lytes
   -obtain abdominal ultrasound to evaluate kidneys
   -foley in place
   -maintain hydration as above using CVP and UOP as parameters
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now, ordered nutrition consult, will likely require

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes and ethanol abuse presenting from an outside hospital with biliary sepsis and gallstone pancreatitis. The patient also has cirrhosis with ascites. The patient's current condition includes septic shock, respiratory failure, renal failure, and possible alcohol withdrawal.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when an infection spreads throughout the body, leading to low blood pressure, organ failure, and difficulty in maintaining vital functions.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure due to fluid overload and pleural effusions tracking up from ascites. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is showing signs of renal failure, as indicated by the increasing creatinine levels. This could be secondary to sepsis, large amounts of ascites, and hepatorenal syndrome physiology. Monitoring urine electrolytes and obtaining an abdominal ultrasound to evaluate the kidneys would be necessary.

4. Cirrhosis with Ascites: The patient has cirrhosis with ascites, which increases the risk of complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatic encephalopathy, and portal hypertension.

5. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis, which is inflammation of the pancreas"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yoM w/ a h/o DM and ETOH abuse presenting from an outside
   hospital with biliary sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Septic shock/pancreatitis: Patient with colecystecomy now with septic
   shock thought to be due to enterobacter from the biliary tract. Patient
   also with gallstone pancreatitis, which may be contributing to the
   shock physiology. He has cirrhosis with ascities, which clouds the
   picture of the septic shock. Right now he is off pressors and doing
   better.  SVO2 above goal.
   - Continue Zosyn for enterobacter and biliary source flora
   - Stop flagyl since it adds no coverage over zosyn (except C diff)
   - Continue fluid boluses for MAP >60 and SBP >100
   - Change central line changed yesterday
   - Add vancomycin for gram positive coverage until cultures grow out;
   concern for cellulites vs. inflammatory response
   - CT scan - IMPRESSION: 1. Ascites. 2. Nodular appearance of the liver
   surface, suggestive of cirrhosis. 3. Foley catheter balloon inflated at
   the base of the bladder, near the
   junction with the prostatic urethra, clinical correlation is
   recommended to exclude incorrect placement. 4. Small bilateral pleural
   effusions, right greater than left, with partially
   visualized consolidative right basilar airspace disease, atelectasis
   versus pneumonia. No non-contrast CT evidence of pancreatitis, as
   questioned.
   - abdominal echo - IMPRESSION: 1. Patent hepatic vasculature. 2.
   Diffusely echogenic liver parenchyma without evidence for focal liver
   lesions. 3. Marked amount of ascites. 4. Normal appearing kidneys
   without evidence for hydronephrosis. 5. No gallstones.
   - no new micro data
   - Surgery was consulted and said that not currently surgical issue
   - seen by liver - said to check hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth
   muscle antibody which are pending, plan for diagnostic and therapeutic
   paracentesis sunday (tomorrow)
   - patient got IV albumin yesterday in hopes to keep some intravascular
   fluid
   - cont albumin, today is day [**3-17**], need to re-order
   - start on Ppi [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated likely in the setting of sepsis.
   Likely due to fluid overload and pleural effusions tracking up from
   ascites.  Patient is intubated.  As off pressors likely consider
   -continue to monitor volume status and diurese eventually but for now
   will give volume for pancreatitis / biliary sepsis
   -in addition possible that patient had aspiration pneumonitis versus
   pneumonia given his altered mental status when his sepsis was
   worsening, would continue to follow fever curve and secretions and send
   a sputum culture if increase in secretions.
   .
   # Crit drop
   - HCt this morning significantly decreased
   - no bowel movements yet, will guiac if has some, no obvious source of
   bleeding
   - will re-check PM cbc
   - draw coags this morning
   # DM: on oral hypoglycemics at home.
   -Insulin drip, since patient in anasarca here and hold home medicines
   - would consider transitioning back to regular meds
   .
   # ETOH abuse: Admitted to OSH on [**2120-11-2**], no withdrawal noted at OSH
   and he is nearing the end of the window for ETOH withdrawal but also he
   has been not drinking for several weeks per his family.
   -thiamine, folate
   .
   # Renal Failure: Cr on [**11-5**] was 1.1, increasing on [**11-6**] to 1.7 and to
   2.2 on [**11-7**] at OSH, currently 1.9.  Very likely secondary to sepsis as
   well as large amount of ascites and hepatorenal syndrome physiology.
   However, sepsis physiology needs to be ruled out.
   -follow urine lytes

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and ethanol abuse (ETOH) presenting from an outside hospital with biliary sepsis. The patient underwent colectomy and is now experiencing septic shock, which is thought to be due to an infection from the biliary tract. The patient also has gallstone pancreatitis, cirrhosis with ascites, and is currently intubated for respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.2 C (99%)
- Heart rate: 77 bpm (70-95)
- Blood pressure: 95/51 mmHg (61)
- Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute (12-27)

- Central venous pressure (CVP): 10 mmHg (5-18)
- Bladder pressure: 20 mmHg (20)
- Mean arterial pressure (MAP): 61 mmHg
- Systemic vascular oxygenation (SVO2): above goal

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:
1. Septic shock/pancreatitis: The patient has septic shock due to an infection from the biliary tract and gallstone pancreatitis. He is off pressors and doing better. The plan includes continuing Zosyn for enterobacter and biliary flora, stopping flagyl,"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse, diabetes mellitus, and cirrhosis. He was admitted from the operating room with biliary sepsis post cholecystectomy (CCY) and returned to the hospital in shock five days later with Enterobacter sepsis. Despite receiving antibiotics and fluids, the patient's condition worsened, and he required intubation during the hospital course.

Since admission to the ICU, the patient has been on minimal ventilatory requirements and is following commands. He is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and has undergone therapeutic paracentesis for suspected cirrhosis. The patient also has evidence of pancreatitis, but his lipase levels are decreasing.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he is being evaluated for extubation. However, he still has anemia with a decreased hematocrit, and the cause is unclear as there is no obvious bleeding. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been added to address this issue.

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) attributed to sepsis or acute tubular necrosis (ATN), although urine electrolyte results are pending. Insulin gtt is being administered for diabetes management.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition support, glycemic control with insulin, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yoM w/ a h/o DM and ETOH abuse presenting from an outside
   hospital with biliary sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Septic shock/pancreatitis: Patient with colecystecomy s/p ERCP at
   OSH, now growing enterobacter from biliary tract fluid and blood. Liver
   enzymes stable, but lipase trending up today. Low likelihood of bile
   duct leak with a negative HIDA scan. Patient has been off pressors for
   48 hours and ventilatory stand point is improving.
   -          Contnue Zosyn for enterobacter and Vancomycin for possible
   cellulites (day 3)
   -          Continue fluid bolus for MAP >60 or SBP >100 or UOP <30cc/hr
   -          .
   # Respiratory Failure: Now on [**6-17**] with RSBI of 35. Patient awake and
   with minimal secretions and good gag reflex. Good candidate for
   extuabtion today.
   - Extubate later today
   .
   # DM: on oral hypoglycemics at home.
   -Insulin drip, since patient in anasarca here and hold home medicines
   especially in the setting of continued D5W administration
   .
   # ETOH abuse: Admitted to OSH on [**2120-11-2**], no withdrawal noted at OSH
   and he is nearing the end of the window for ETOH withdrawal but also he
   has been not drinking for several weeks per his family.
   -thiamine, folate
   .
   # Renal Failure: Creatinine improving; today 1.7. Most likely pre-renal
   in the setting of sepsis since it is slowly improving with fluids and
   FeNa yesterday was 0.1%. However, there may be low oncotic pressure
   affecting the kidney function as well. Will keep a CVP target of [**5-19**]
   and follow urine output today. USG without evidence of hydronephrosis.
   -CVP goal [**5-19**]
   -UOP goal 30cc/hr
   -Continue hydration PRN
   -Trend creatinine; if not going down may try albumin
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now., may feed tomorrow depending of how extubation
   goes.
   .
   # Access: LIJ
   .
   # PPx:  sc heparin tid, pneumoboots, not written for Ppi will start
   .
   # Code:  FULL

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and ethanol abuse, presenting from an outside hospital with biliary sepsis. The patient has undergone cholecystectomy and ERCP. The patient is growing enterobacter from biliary tract fluid and blood, but liver enzymes are stable. Lipase levels are trending up today. There is a low likelihood of a bile duct leak with a negative HIDA scan. The patient has been off pressors for 48 hours and ventilatory status is improving. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has biliary sepsis, which is a serious infection that can lead to septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's lipase levels are trending up, indicating the possibility of pancreatitis, which can be a complication of biliary sepsis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a concern for extubation later today. Respiratory failure can occur if the patient does not wean off the ventilator successfully.
4. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes should be managed carefully in the ICU setting, especially since the patient is receiving insulin drips and has been NPO (nothing by mouth).
5. Ethanol Withdrawal: Although the patient has not shown signs of withdrawal at OSH and has not been drinking for several weeks"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yoM w/ a h/o DM and ETOH abuse presenting from an outside
   hospital with biliary sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Septic shock/pancreatitis: Patient with colecystecomy s/p ERCP at
   OSH, now growing enterobacter from biliary tract fluid and blood. Liver
   enzymes stable, but lipase trending up today. Low likelihood of bile
   duct leak with a negative HIDA scan. Patient has been off pressors for
   48 hours and ventilatory stand point is improving.
   -          Contnue Zosyn for enterobacter and Vancomycin for possible
   cellulites (day 3)
   -          Continue fluid bolus for MAP >60 or SBP >100 or UOP <30cc/hr
   -          .
   # Respiratory Failure: Now on [**6-17**] with RSBI of 35. Patient awake and
   with minimal secretions and good gag reflex. Good candidate for
   extuabtion today.
   - Extubate later today
   .
   # DM: on oral hypoglycemics at home.
   -Insulin drip, since patient in anasarca here and hold home medicines
   especially in the setting of continued D5W administration
   .
   # ETOH abuse: Admitted to OSH on [**2120-11-2**], no withdrawal noted at OSH
   and he is nearing the end of the window for ETOH withdrawal but also he
   has been not drinking for several weeks per his family.
   -thiamine, folate
   .
   # Renal Failure: Cr on [**11-5**] was 1.1, increasing on [**11-6**] to 1.7 and to
   2.2 on [**11-7**] at OSH, currently 1.9.  Very likely secondary to sepsis as
   well as large amount of ascites and hepatorenal syndrome physiology.
   However, sepsis physiology needs to be ruled out.
   -follow urine lytes
 FeNa 0.1% consistent mostly with prerenal
   physiology, low urine sodium
   - will check in touch with liver regarding treatment
   -abdominal ultrasound without evidence of hydronephrosis bilaterally
   -foley in place making good urine
   -continue hydration
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now, ordered nutrition consult, will likely require
   post-pyloric feeding, so will plan to try to get IR to place this
   morning and then begin feeding
   .
   # Access: LIJ
   .
   # PPx:  sc heparin tid, pneumoboots, not written for Ppi will start
   .
   # Code:  FULL
   .
   # Dispo:  ICU until extubated
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and ethanol abuse. He was admitted to the outside hospital with biliary sepsis and underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. His condition has improved, and he is now awake with minimal secretions and a good gag reflex. The plan is to extubate him later today.

The patient also has septic shock and pancreatitis, with enterobacter growing from biliary tract fluid and blood. His liver enzymes are stable, but lipase levels are trending up. There is a low likelihood of a bile duct leak based on a negative HIDA scan. The patient has been off pressors for 48 hours and shows signs of improvement.

Other medical issues include poorly controlled diabetes, ethanol abuse, and renal failure. The renal failure is likely secondary to sepsis, ascites, and hepatorenal syndrome physiology. The patient's creatinine levels have been increasing from 1.1 on [11-5] to 1.7 on [11-6], and 2.2 on [11-7] at the outside hospital, currently at 1.9.

The patient requires nutritional support and has been placed on NPO status. A nutrition consult has been ordered, and post-pyloric feeding will likely be required. The patient's blood glucose levels will be monitored closely for glycemic control"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yoM w/ a h/o DM and ETOH abuse presenting from an outside
   hospital with biliary sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Septic shock/pancreatitis: Patient with colecystecomy now with septic
   shock thought to be due to enterobacter from the biliary tract. Patient
   also with gallstone pancreatitis, which may be contributing to the
   shock physiology. He has cirrhosis with ascities, which clouds the
   picture of the septic shock. Right now he is off pressors and doing
   better.  SVO2 above goal.
   - Continue Zosyn for enterobacter and biliary source flora
   - Stop flagyl since it adds no coverage over zosyn (except C diff)
   - Continue fluid boluses for MAP >60 and SBP >100
   - Change central line changed yesterday
   - Add vancomycin for gram positive coverage until cultures grow out;
   concern for cellulites vs. inflammatory response
   - CT scan - IMPRESSION: 1. Ascites. 2. Nodular appearance of the liver
   surface, suggestive of cirrhosis. 3. Foley catheter balloon inflated at
   the base of the bladder, near the
   junction with the prostatic urethra, clinical correlation is
   recommended to exclude incorrect placement. 4. Small bilateral pleural
   effusions, right greater than left, with partially
   visualized consolidative right basilar airspace disease, atelectasis
   versus pneumonia. No non-contrast CT evidence of pancreatitis, as
   questioned.
   - abdominal echo - IMPRESSION: 1. Patent hepatic vasculature. 2.
   Diffusely echogenic liver parenchyma without evidence for focal liver
   lesions. 3. Marked amount of ascites. 4. Normal appearing kidneys
   without evidence for hydronephrosis. 5. No gallstones.
   - no new micro data
   - Surgery was consulted and said that not currently surgical issue
   - seen by liver - said to check hepatitis serologies, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-smooth
   muscle antibody which are pending, plan for diagnostic and therapeutic
   paracentesis sunday (tomorrow)
   - patient got IV albumin yesterday in hopes to keep some intravascular
   fluid
   - cont albumin, today is day [**3-17**], need to re-order
   - start on Ppi [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Intubated likely in the setting of sepsis.
   Likely due to fluid overload and pleural effusions tracking up from
   ascites.  Patient is intubated.  As off pressors and not requiring too
   much in the way of pressure support currently.
   -continue to monitor volume status and diurese eventually but for now
   will give volume for pancreatitis / biliary sepsis
   -in addition possible that patient had aspiration pneumonitis versus
   pneumonia given his altered mental status when his sepsis was
   worsening, would continue to follow fever curve and secretions and send
   a sputum culture if increase in secretions.
   - for now will try to wean sedation and consider spontaneously
   breathing trial
   .
   # Crit drop
   - HCt this morning significantly decreased
   - no bowel movements yet, will guiac if has some, no obvious source of
   bleeding
   - will re-check PM cbc
   - INR this morning 1.6, consider vit K as needed if bleeding becomes a
   problem
   - would consult with liveer
   # DM: on oral hypoglycemics at home.
   -Insulin drip, since patient in anasarca here and hold home medicines
   especially in the setting of continued D5W administration
   .
   # ETOH abuse: Admitted to OSH on [**2120-11-2**], no withdrawal noted at OSH
   and he is nearing the end of the window for ETOH withdrawal but also he
   has been not drinking for several weeks per his family.
   -thiamine, folate
   .
   # Renal Failure: Cr on [**11-5**] was 1.1, increasing on [**11-6**] to 1.7 and to
   2.2 on [**11-7**] at OSH, currently 1.9.  Very likely secondary to sepsis as
   well as large amount of ascites and hepatorenal syndrome physiology.
   However, sepsis physiology needs to be ruled out.
   -follow urine lytes
 FeNa 0.1% consistent mostly with prerenal
   physiology, low urine sodium
   - will check in touch with liver regarding treatment
   -abdominal ultrasound without evidence of hydronephrosis bilaterally
   -foley in place making good urine
   -continue hydration
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now, ordered nutrition consult, will likely require
   post-pyloric feeding, so will plan to try to get IR to place this
   morning and then begin feeding
   .
   # Access: LIJ
   .
   # PPx:  sc heparin tid, pneumoboots, not written for Ppi will start
   .
   # Code:  FULL
   .
   # Dispo:  ICU until extubated

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of EtOH abuse and diabetes who underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Post-operation, he developed biliary Enterobacter sepsis, pancreatitis, and ascites in the context of cirrhotic liver. He also experienced acute decompensation of cirrhosis after surgery. Currently, he is critically ill and intubated. His vital signs are within normal limits, but he has scattered coarse breath sounds, CV RRR (crackles), and edema in his calves. The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, Enterobacter biliary sepsis, cellulitis, acute renal failure, and pancreatitis. He is receiving appropriate medications for each condition. There are no new laboratory results or imaging available at the moment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently tolerating CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) without problems, and the plan is to extubate today. However, due to his history of volume overload and sepsis, there is a potential risk of respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Enterobacter biliary sepsis: The patient is already on Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) for this condition, and a paracentesis performed yesterday showed improvement in the nature of fluid.
3. Cellulitis: The patient is being treated with vancomycin"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) and ethanol (ETOH) abuse. He presented from an outside hospital with biliary sepsis. The patient underwent cholecystectomy and ERCP at OSH but is now growing enterobacter from biliary tract fluid and blood. His liver enzymes are stable, and lipase is still trending up today. There is a low likelihood of bile duct leak with a negative HIDA scan. The patient has been off pressors for 48 hours, and his ventilatory status is improving.

The potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Sepsis/Infection: The patient has biliary sepsis and is growing enterobacter from biliary tract fluid and blood. There is a risk of ongoing infection and sepsis.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient's lipase levels are still trending up, indicating ongoing pancreatitis.

3. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient has been extubated and tolerating it, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to his underlying condition.

4. Diabetic Complications: The patient has a history of DM, which puts him at risk for diabetic complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

5. Ethanol Withdrawal: Although the patient has not shown any signs of ethanol withdrawal, there is still a risk due to his history"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes and alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU from an outside hospital with biliary sepsis. The patient underwent colecystectomy and ERCP at OSH, but now has a growing infection of enterobacter in the biliary tract fluid and blood. The patient's liver enzymes are stable, but lipase levels are trending up today. A negative HIDA scan indicates a low likelihood of a bile duct leak. The patient has been off pressors for 48 hours and is showing improvement in ventilatory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with biliary sepsis, which can lead to septic shock. Although the patient has been improving, there is still a risk of sepsis-related complications.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's lipase levels are trending up, indicating possible worsening pancreatitis. This can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level, suggesting renal impairment. It is important to monitor kidney function closely and adjust fluid management accordingly.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and extubation failure if the patient's respiratory status does not improve.
5. Diabetes Management: The patient has a history of diabetes and is"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yoM w/ a h/o DM and ETOH abuse presenting from an outside
   hospital with biliary sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Septic shock/pancreatitis: Patient with colecystecomy s/p ERCP at
   OSH, now growing enterobacter from biliary tract fluid and blood. Liver
   enzymes stable, lipase still trending up today. Low likelihood of bile
   duct leak with a negative HIDA scan. Patient has been off pressors for
   48 hours and ventilatory stand point is improving.
   -          Contnue Zosyn for enterobacter
   -         d/c Vancomycin for possible cellulites (day 3)
   -          Continue fluid bolus for MAP >60 or SBP >100 or UOP <30cc/hr
   -          cont to trend LFTs and labs
   -          f/u ERCP recs
   -          advance diet as tolerated
   # Respiratory Failure: Now on [**6-17**] with RSBI of 35. Patient awake and
   with minimal secretions and good gag reflex. Good candidate for
   extuabtion today.
   - Extubate later today
   .
   # DM: on oral hypoglycemics at home.
   -Insulin drip, since patient in anasarca here and hold home medicines
   especially in the setting of continued D5W administration
   .
   # ETOH abuse: Admitted to OSH on [**2120-11-2**], no withdrawal noted at OSH
   and he is nearing the end of the window for ETOH withdrawal but also he
   has been not drinking for several weeks per his family.
   -thiamine, folate
   .
   # Renal Failure: Creatinine improving; today 1.7. Most likely pre-renal
   in the setting of sepsis since it is slowly improving with fluids and
   FeNa yesterday was 0.1%. However, there may be low oncotic pressure
   affecting the kidney function as well. Will keep a CVP target of [**5-19**]
   and follow urine output today. USG without evidence of hydronephrosis.
   -CVP goal [**5-19**]
   -UOP goal 30cc/hr
   -Continue hydration PRN
   -Trend creatinine; if not going down may try albumin
   .
   # FEN:  NPO for now., may feed tomorrow depending of how extubation
   goes.
   .
   # Access: LIJ
   .
   # PPx:  sc heparin tid, pneumoboots, not written for Ppi will start
   .
   # Code:  FULL
   .
   # Dispo:  ICU until extubated

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and ethanol abuse. He was admitted to the outside hospital with biliary sepsis and underwent cholecystectomy followed by ERCP. The patient has been growing enterobacter from biliary tract fluid and blood. His liver enzymes are stable, lipase is still trending up today, and there is a low likelihood of bile duct leak with a negative HIDA scan. The patient has been off pressors for 48 hours and his ventilatory status is improving.

Plan:
- Continue Zosyn for enterobacter
- Discontinue Vancomycin for possible cellulitis (day 3)
- Continue fluid bolus for MAP >60 or SBP >100 or UOP <30cc/hr
- Continue to trend LFTs and labs
- Follow up on ERCP recommendations
- Advance diet as tolerated

Assessment and Plan:
1. Sepsis/pancreatitis: The patient has biliary sepsis with enterobacter growth in biliary tract fluid and blood. His liver enzymes are stable, lipase is still trending up today, and there is a low likelihood of bile duct leak with a negative HIDA scan. The patient has been off pressors for 48 hours and his ventilatory status is improving.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on [6-17] with an RSBI of 35. He is awake with minimal secretions"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and alcohol abuse presenting from an outside hospital with biliary sepsis. The patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis, removing 4 liters of fluid and receiving 50 grams of albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis showed a polymorphonuclear leukocyte count of 863, indicating spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) on Zosyn. The patient's insulin and GGT levels are being discontinued, and he is starting on intravenous insulin sliding scale (ISS).

The patient is tolerating clear liquids and may advance as tolerated. The respiratory failure is being managed by extubation and nasal cannula oxygen delivery. The patient's diabetes mellitus is currently being managed with holding home medications and starting on RISS. Ethanol abuse is not currently causing withdrawal symptoms. Renal failure is being treated with hydration and close monitoring of creatinine levels.

The patient's medical complications include sepsis, pancreatitis, cholangitis, respiratory failure, alcohol abuse, anemia, and renal failure. The plan includes continuing Zosyn for enterobacter and SBP, starting total parenteral nutrition (TPN), continuing fluid bolus for mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60, systolic blood pressure (SBP) >100, or urine output (UOP) <30 cc/hr, and advancing diet as tolerated.

Overall, the patient is stable and tolerating clear liquids. Close monitoring of vital"

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and alcohol abuse. He presented from an outside hospital with biliary sepsis. The patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis, removing 4L of fluids and receiving 50gm albumin. His ascitic fluid analysis showed poly: 863, indicating spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) on Zosyn. The patient is now tolerating clear liquids and may advance as tolerated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 147/69mmHg to 162/130mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient is alert, oriented, and following commands.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. Liver function tests are within normal limits, but pancreatic enzymes have stabilized and are trending down. The patient's electrolytes and albumin levels are also within normal ranges.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Biliary sepsis: The patient has a history of biliary sepsis, which is a serious infection in the biliary system. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs and laboratory values to ensure that the infection has resolved completely.

2. Diabetes mellitus (DM), type II: The patient has been diagnosed with type II DM, likely as a result of their alcohol abuse and pancreatitis. It is crucial to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy accordingly to maintain glycemic control.

3. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient initially experienced respiratory failure but has since improved and been extubated. However, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation levels to ensure continued improvement.

4. Alcohol abuse: Although the patient is currently receiving treatment for alcohol withdrawal and on folic acid and thiamine, there is still a risk for further complications related to chronic alcohol abuse, such as liver disease or malnutrition.

5. Pancreatitis, acute: The patient had an episode of acute pancreatitis, which seems to be improving symptomatically. However, it is important to continue monitoring the patient's abdominal pain and laboratory values to ensure that the pancreatitis has fully resolved.

6. Anemia, other: The patient has stable hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, obese male in the ICU with a chief complaint of biliary sepsis, which is resolving. The patient underwent paracentesis yesterday and received albumin. The patient's PMNs are still consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Insulin gtt was discontinued and changed to RSSI. The patient was started on a clear liquid diet without abdominal pain or distension. The patient has no known drug allergies and has been receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is on prophylactic heparin sodium and other ICU medications including Atrovent/Albuterol nebs, folic acid, and thiamine.

24-hour events include a paracentesis performed at 07:05 PM on [**2120-11-11**]. The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature (Tmax and Tcurrent): 36.8°C (98.2°F)
- Heart rate (HR): 87 bpm (81-100)
- Blood pressure (BP): 142/68 mmHg (118/44-162/83)
- Respiratory rate (RR): 23 breaths per minute (11-30 inspiratory)
- Oxygen saturation (SpO2): 99% on nasal cannula

The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm (SR). Fluid balance shows an intake of 1"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-inch tall male with a weight of unknown value, presenting with biliary sepsis that is now resolving. The patient underwent paracentesis yesterday, removing approximately 4 liters of fluid and receiving 50 grams of albumin. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is still consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Insulin gtt was discontinued and replaced with RSSI. The patient started on a clear liquid diet without experiencing any abdominal pain or distension.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature (Tmax) of 36.8°C (98.2°F), current temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate (HR) of 87 bpm with a range of 81-100 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 118/44 mmHg to 162/83 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 23 breaths per minute with a range of 11-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm (SR). 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,741 mL since 12 AM, with outputs including 7,000 mL of total out, 3,000 mL of urine output, 4,000 mL of drain output, and a negative balance of 5,259 mL. The patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
 CHOLANGITIS: Improved from admission, plan to continue Vanc / Zosyn
   for a total of 14 days. No plans for any intervention by Surgery or
   ERCP.
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II: Changed insulin gtt to RSSI
   yesterday; sugars remain moderately elevated (in the 200s), so will
   increase RSSI for better control.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): Improved, now extubated x
   3 days. Will titrate oxygen down as tolerate.
 ALCOHOL ABUSE: On folic acid and thiamine, no evidence of withdrawal.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE: Symptomatically much improved, tolerating clears
   yesterday. Continue symptomatic treatment, will further advance diet.
 ANEMIA, OTHER: Stable H/H, no indication for transfusion at this
   time. Follow daily.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Creatinine stable
   for yesterday with treatement of his underlying pancreatitis and
   biliary infection. Monitor UOP and creatinine on a daily basis. Can
   likely d/c foley today.
   Will request PT consult today; stable for floor, will call out.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of biliary sepsis, diabetes mellitus type II, respiratory failure, alcohol abuse, acute pancreatitis, anemia, and acute renal failure. The patient underwent paracentesis yesterday and received albumin. Insulin was started and then changed to RSSI to control blood sugar levels. The patient is tolerating clear liquids well without abdominal pain or distension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 81-100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/68-162/83 mmHg, respiratory rate between 11-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is currently extubated for 3 days. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, scleral edema, and no murmurs or rub. The patient has a history of right pleural effusion, which is still present on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholangitis: The patient has shown improvement from admission, but there is a risk of persistent infection or recurrence of cholangitis if the biliary tree is not adequately drained or if there are resistant bacteria causing the infection.
2. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient's blood sugar levels are still moderately elevated, and there is a risk of further complications if the diabetes is not well-controlled.
3. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient has improved and is now extubated, there"
